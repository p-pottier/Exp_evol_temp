AB  - Although studies quantifying evolutionary change in response to the selective pressures that organisms face in the wild have demonstrated that organisms can evolve rapidly, we lack a systematic assessment of the frequency, magnitude and direction of rapid evolutionary change across taxa. To address this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 58 studies that document the effects of warming, predation or competition on the evolution of body size, development rate or fecundity in natural or experimental animal populations. We tested whether there was a consistent effect of any selective agent on any trait, whether the direction of these effects align with theoretical predictions, and whether the three agents select in opposing directions on any trait. Overall, we found weak effects of all three selective agents on trait evolution: none of our nine traits by selective agent combinations had an overall effect that differed from zero, only 31% of studies had a significant within-study effect, and attributes of the included studies generally did not account for between-study variation in results. One notable exception was that predation targeting adults consistently resulted in the evolution of smaller prey body size. We discuss potential causes of these generally weak responses and consider how our results inform the ongoing development of eco-evolutionary research.

AB  - Metabolism constitutes a fundamental property of all organisms. Metabolic rate is commonly described to scale as a power function of body size and exponentially with temperature, thereby treating the effects of body size and temperature independently. Mounting evidence shows that the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass itself depends on temperature. Across-species analyses in fishes suggest that the mass-scaling exponent decreases with increasing temperature. However, whether this relationship holds at the within-species level has rarely been tested. Here, we re-analyse data on the metabolic rates of four freshwater fish species, two coregonids and two cyprinids, that cover wide ranges of body masses and their naturally experienced temperatures. We show that the standard metabolic rate of the coregonids is best fit when accounting for a linear temperature dependence of the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass, whereas a constant mass-scaling exponent is supported in case of the cyprinids. Our study shows that phenotypic responses to temperature can result in temperature-dependent scaling relationships at the species level and that these responses differ between taxa. Together with previous findings, these results indicate that evolutionarily adaptive and phenotypically plastic responses to temperature affect the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass in fishes.

AB  - Drosophila subobscura is a European (EU) species that was introduced into South America (SA) approximately 25 years ago. Previous studies have found rapid clinal evolution in wing size and in chromosome inversion frequency in the SA colonists, and these clines parallel those found among the ancestral EU populations. Here we examine thermoplastic changes in wing length in flies reared at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C from 10 populations on each continent. Wings are plastically largest in flies reared at 15 degrees C (the coldest temperature) and genetically largest from populations that experience cooler temperatures on both continents. We hypothesize that flies living in cold temperatures benefit from reduced wing loading: ectotherms with cold muscles generate less power per wing beat, and hence larger wings and/or a smaller mass would facilitate fight. We develop a simple null model, based on isometric growth, to test our hypothesis. We find that both EU and SA flies exhibit adaptive plasticity in wing loading: flies reared at 15 degrees C generally have lower wing loadings than do flies reared at 20 degrees C or 25 degrees C. Clinal patterns, however, are strikingly different. The ancestral EU populations show adaptive clinal variation at rearing a temperature of 15 degrees C: flies from cool climates have lower wing loadings. In the colonizing populations from SA, however, we cannot reject the null model: wing loading increases with decreasing clinal temperatures. Our data suggest that selective factors other than flight have favored the rapid evolution of large overall size at low environmental temperatures. However, selection for increased flight ability in such environments may secondarily favor reduced body mass.

TI  - Body size, sexual dimorphism, and seasonal mass fluctuations in a larger sika deer subspecies, the Hokkaido sika deer (Cervus nippon yesoensis Heude, 1884)
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Measurements of shoulder height, body length, hind-foot length, and total body mass were collected from 309 Hokkaido sika deer (Cervus nippon? yesoensis Heude, 1884) (115 males and 194 females) and analyzed statistically for sexual dimorphism and seasonal body mass fluctuations. The von Bertalanffy equation was fitted to the growth curves that resulted. Asymptotic shoulder height, body length, and hind-foot length were 106.2, 112.6, and 57.9 cm in males and 94.8, 103.9, and 49.4 cm in females, respectively. Total body mass showed distinct seasonal fluctuations, ranging between 102.8 and 151.0 kg in adult males and 68.0 and 99.8 kg in adult females. Male/female ratios in shoulder height, body length, hind-foot length, and total mass were 1.12, 1.08, 1.07, and 1.51, respectively. These results indicate that the Hokkaido sika deer is one of the largest subspecies, at least in skeleton size. A larger body and longer hind foot would seem to be evolutionary adaptations to Hokkaido's cold, snowy environment.

AB  - The response of quantitative traits in translocated populations has not been well explored. Evolutionary shifts in quantitative traits, such as life history characteristics, are of particular interest because of their obvious association with fitness. In a recent survey, Stockwell (1995) examined life history variation of four populations of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) that were derived from a common ancestral population 55-58 years earlier. Three life history traits differed considerably among the four sites and appeared to be correlated with local environmental conditions. To test whether these differences were due to plasticity or rapid evolution, fish from the four sites were maintained under common-garden conditions for two generations. After two generations a genetic basis was inferred for two of the three traits (size at maturity and fat content), but not for the third trait (offspring size). Thus, rapid evolution had occurred for two life history traits in these recently established populations. This case of rapid life history evolution may be due to genetic drift and/or natural selection. These data suggest that translocations may lead to rapid evolutionary responses of targeted taxa. Rapid evolutionary responses are of special concern for 'refuge' populations that are maintained as a hedge against extinction.

AB  - The relationships of generation time to both adult body mass and temperature are critical to our understanding of numerous aspects of zooplankton behavior, ecology and evolution, yet these relationships remain poorly understood. Here, I use a meta-analysis to define the relationship of generation time to body mass and temperature for both marine and freshwater zooplankton species (rotifers, copepods and cladocera), for temperatures from 5-20 degrees C. I also define a relationship for the constituent parts of generation time (embryonic and postembryonic development time) as a function of egg and body mass for zooplankton across this temperature range. These relationships provide powerful tools for evaluating differences in generation time between individual zooplankton species.

AB  - The rapid evolution of venom toxin genes is often explained as the result of a biochemical arms race between venomous animals and their prey. However, it is not clear that an arms race analogy is appropriate in this context because there is no published evidence for rapid evolution in genes that might confer toxin resistance among routinely envenomed species. Here we report such evidence from an unusual predator-prey relationship between opossums (Marsupialia: Didelphidae) and pitvipers (Serpentes: Crotalinae). In particular, we found high ratios of replacement to silent substitutions in the gene encoding von Willebrand Factor (vWF), a venom-targeted hemostatic blood protein, in a clade of opossums known to eat pitvipers and to be resistant to their hemorrhagic venom. Observed amino-acid substitutions in venom-resistant opossums include changes in net charge and hydrophobicity that are hypothesized to weaken the bond between vWF and one of its toxic snake-venom ligands, the C-type lectin-like protein botrocetin. Our results provide the first example of rapid adaptive evolution in any venom-targeted molecule, and they support the notion that an evolutionary arms race might be driving the rapid evolution of snake venoms. However, in the arms race implied by our results, venomous snakes are prey, and their venom has a correspondingly defensive function in addition to its usual trophic role.

AB  - Food supplementation usually advances the timing of laying. Here, we report a meta-analysis of 35 food supplementation studies demonstrating that species at high latitudes are less responsive to food supplementation than those at lower latitudes. Because the length of the breeding season varies with latitude, species at high latitudes may rely mostly upon photic cues and be less responsive to other environmental information. Lower latitude species, where times suitable for breeding vary from year-to-year, are predicted to be more responsive to "supplementary'' information to adjust reproduction to coincide with conditions that favor the successful rearing of young. Studies by Wingfield et al. (Gen Comp Endocrinol 101: 242-255, 1996; Gen Comp Endocrinol 107: 44 62, 1997; Gen Comp Endocrinol 131: 143-158, 2003) suggest a physiological underpinning to this reduced responsiveness to supplementary information in high-latitude species. Given that temperature increases resulting from global climate change are most pronounced at high latitude, reduced plasticity to respond to these changes in individuals of high-latitude species could cause high-latitude breeders to be poorly synchronized with a resource base that emerges earlier than usual. If high-latitude breeders indeed lack sufficient individual-level plasticity to cope effectively with climate fluctuations, effective optimization of reproductive timing in a rapidly changing environment would require similarly rapid evolutionary change. It remains to be seen whether this will be possible.

AB  - P>1. As organisms expand their range towards northern latitudes they will encounter selective factors like harsh winter conditions. The ability to cope with and adapt to harsh winters may depend on the variability and evolutionary potential of relevant traits.
   2. One adaptation in insects is winter diapause. It is characterized by changes in physiology, behaviour or in both. Physiological changes include lowered metabolic rate that enhances survival by saving limited energy reserves during overwintering. Active behavioural changes like burrowing into the soil allow individuals to escape harsh conditions.
   3. We examined variation in overwintering body mass, resting metabolic rate (CO(2) production) and diapause behaviour (burrowing into the soil), and their effects on overwintering success in the adult Colorado potato beetles (Leptinotarsa decemlineata). We conducted a full-sib/half-sib rearing experiment to estimate the evolutionary potential (heritability) of these traits.
   4. High overwintering body mass and low metabolic rate were phenotypically associated with high diapause propensity (i.e. burrowing), which was linked to high overwintering survival. We found that once beetles had entered the soil, only large body mass of males was associated with high overwintering survival. However, the heritability estimates in all traits examined were low.
   5. Our results show that winter conditions impose selection on diapause behaviour, which was linked to lower metabolic rate and larger body mass. If range expansion to higher latitudes requires adaptive genetic changes in diapause behaviour, metabolism, or body mass, the insufficient genetic variation in these traits suggest that the Colorado potato beetle's future potential to respond to selection due to harsher winters could be limited and thus, its range expansion could be hindered. Both physiological and behavioural adaptations are important to consider when assessing range expansion potential.

AB  - One century after their introduction to Europe, eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) represent a natural experiment to determine the relative contributions of adaptive plasticity and rapid evolutionary change in creating large-scale geographic variation in phenotypes. We evaluated the population-genetic structure and invasion history based on allele length polymorphisms of 15 nuclear microsatellites, which we quantified for N=660 individuals from 23 populations sampled in 2013 across the invasive range of G. holbrooki in Europe. We analysed body-shape and life-history variation in N = 1331 individuals from 36 populations, sampled in 2013 and 2017, and tested heritability of phenotypic differences in a subset of four populations using a common-garden experiment. The genetic structure of wild-caught individuals suggested a single introduction for all European mosquitofish, which were genetically impoverished compared to their native counterparts. We found some convergent patterns of phenotypic divergence across native and invasive climatic gradients (e.g., increased body size in colder/more northern populations); however, several phenotypic responses were not consistent between sampling years, pointing towards plastic phenotypes. Our analysis of common-garden reared individuals uncovered moderate heritability estimates only for two measures of male body size (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC=0.628 and 0.556) and offspring fat content (ICC=0.734), while suggesting high levels of plasticity inmost other phenotypic traits (ICC=0.407). Our results highlight the importance of phenotypic plasticity in invasive species during range expansions and demonstrate that strong selective pressures-in this case towards increased body size in colder environments-simultaneously promote rapid evolutionary divergence.

AB  - Brain size varies dramatically, both within and across species, and this variation is often believed to be the result of trade-offs between the cognitive benefits of having a large brain for a given body size and the energetic cost of sustaining neural tissue. One potential consequence of having a large brain is that organisms must also meet the associated high energetic demands. Thus, a key question is whether metabolic rate correlates with brain size. However, using metabolic rate to measure energetic demand yields a relatively instantaneous and dynamic measure of energy turnover, which is incompatible with the longer evolutionary timescale of changes in brain size within and across species. Morphological traits associated with oxygen consumption, specifically gill surface area, have been shown to be correlates of oxygen demand and energy use, and thus may serve as integrated correlates of these processes, allowing us to assess whether evolutionary changes in brain size correlate with changes in longer-term oxygen demand and energy use. We tested how brain size relates to gill surface area in the blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus. First, we examined whether the allometric slope of brain mass (i.e., the rate that brain mass changes with body mass) is lower than the allometric slope of gill surface area across ontogeny. Second, we tested whether gill surface area explains variation in brain mass, after accounting for the effects of body mass on brain mass. We found that brain mass and gill surface area both had positive allometric slopes, with larger individuals having both larger brains and larger gill surface areas compared to smaller individuals. However, the allometric slope of brain mass was lower than the allometric slope of gill surface area, consistent with our prediction that the allometric slope of gill surface area could pose an upper limit to the allometric slope of brain mass. Finally, after accounting for body mass, individuals with larger brains tended to have larger gill surface areas. Together, our results provide clues as to how fishes may evolve and maintain large brains despite their high energetic cost, suggesting that C. limbatus individuals with a large gill surface area for their body mass may be able to support a higher energetic turnover, and, in turn, a larger brain for their body mass.

AB  - The distributional limits of many ectothermic species are set by thermal tolerances of early-developmental stages in the life history; embryos and larvae often are less able to buffer environmental variation than are conspecific adults. In pond-breeding amphibians, for example, cold water may constrain viability of eggs and larvae, even if adults can find suitable thermal conditions in terrestrial niches. Invasive species provide robust model systems for exploring these questions, because we can quantify thermal challenges at the expanding range edge (from field surveys) and larval responses to thermal conditions (in the laboratory). Our studies on invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) at the southern (cool-climate) edge of their expanding range in Australia show that available ponds often average around 20 degrees C during the breeding period, 10 degrees C lower than in many areas of the toads' native range, or in the Australian tropics. Our laboratory experiments showed that cane toad eggs and larvae cannot develop successfully at 16 degrees C, but hatching success and larval survival rates were higher at 20 degrees C than in warmer conditions. Lower temperatures slowed growth rates, increasing the duration of tadpole life, but also increased metamorph body mass. Water temperature also influenced metamorph body shape (high temperatures reduced relative limb length, head width, and body mass) and locomotor performance (increased speed from intermediate temperatures, longer hops from high temperatures). In combination with previous studies, our data suggest that lower water temperatures may enhance rather than reduce recruitment of cane toads, at least in areas where pond temperatures reach or exceed 20 degrees C. That condition is fulfilled over a wide area of southern Australia, suggesting that the continuing expansion of this invasive species is unlikely to be curtailed by the impacts of relatively low water temperatures on the viability of early life-history stages.

AB  - We report life history characteristics for 4 recently established populations of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). Mosquitofish from thermally stable habitats, Bonham and Garrett, were characterized by maturity at large sizes, high fat reserves, and large embryos. In contrast, females from a thermally unstable habitat, Wabuska, matured at small sizes and had low fat reserves and small embryos. Females from Parker, a site with no appreciable thermal input, matured at intermediate sizes and had low fat reserves as well as large embryos. These populations shared a common ancestor in 1937: therefore, these results suggest either phenotypic plasticity or rapid evolution.

AB  - According to the metabolic theory of ecology, metabolic rate, an important indicator of the pace of life, varies with body mass and temperature as a result of internal physical constrains. However, various ecological factors may also affect metabolic rate and its scaling with body mass. Although reports of such effects on metabolic scaling usually focus on single factors, the possiblity of significant interactive effects between multiple factors requries further study. In this study, we show that the effect of temperature on the ontogenetic scaling of resting metabolic rate of the freshwater amphipod Gammams minus depends critically on habitat differences in predation regime. Increasing temperature tends to cause decreases in the metabolic scaling exponent (slope) in population samples from springs with fish predators, but increases in population samples from springs without fish. Accordingly, the temperature sensitivity of metabolic rate is not only size-specific, but also its relationship to body size shifts dramatically in response to fish predators. We hypothesize that the dampened effect of temperature on the metabolic rate of large adults in springs with fish, and of small juveniles in springs without fish are adaptive evolutionary responses to differences in the relative mortality risk of adults and juveniles in springs with versus without fish predators. Our results demonstrate a complex interaction among metabolic rate, body mass, temperature and predation regime. The intraspecific scaling of metabolic rate with body mass and temperature is not merely the result of physical constraints related to internal body design and biochemical kinetics, but rather is ecologically sensitive and evolutionarily malleable.

AB  - How exposure to contaminants may interfere with the widespread poleward range expansions under global warming is largely unknown. Pesticide exposure may negatively affect traits shaping the speed of range expansion, including traits related to population growth rate and dispersal-related traits. Moreover, rapid evolution of growth rates during poleward range expansions may come at a cost of a reduced investment in detoxification and repair thereby increasing the vulnerability to contaminants at expanding range fronts. We tested effects of a sublethal concentration of the widespread pesticide chlorpyrifos on traits related to range expansion in replicated edge and core populations of the poleward moving damselfly Coenagrion scitulum reared at low and high food levels in a common garden experiment. Food limitation in the larval stage had strong negative effects both in the larval stage and across metamorphosis in the adult stage. Exposure to chlorpyrifos during the larval stage did not affect larval traits but caused delayed effects across metamorphosis by increasing the incidence of wing malformations during metamorphosis and by reducing a key component of the adult immune response. There was some support for an evolutionary trade-off scenario as the faster growing edge larvae suffered a higher mortality during metamorphosis. Instead, there was no clear support for the faster growing edge larvae being more vulnerable to chlorpyrifos. Our data indicate that sublethal delayed effects of pesticide exposure, partly in association with the rapid evolution of faster growth rates, may slow down range expansions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To test for an effect of isomorphy on development rate under different experimental thermal environments.
   Methods: In three different thermal environments, we studied the following characters as response variables during development: metabolic rate, body mass, and body length. We used as our study model the terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare during the first 14 weeks of development.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that although metabolic rate and body mass may depend on the internal state of individuals, body length may present an isomorphic response. This would be evidence that a non-adaptive interpretation could explain developmental patterns and thus highlight the importance of avoiding the frequent use of unsupported adaptive explanations in evolutionary ecology.

AB  - As global obesity rates continue to rise, it is important to understand the origin, role and range of human variation of body mass index (BMI) in assessing health and healthcare. A growing body of evidence suggests that BMI is a poor indicator of health across populations, and that there may be a metabolically healthy obese phenotype. Here, we review the reasons why BMI is an inadequate tool for assessing cardiometabolic health. We then suggest that cold climate adaptations may also render BMI an uninformative metric. Underlying evolutionary and environmental drivers may allow for heat conserving larger body sizes without necessarily increasing metabolic health risks. However, there may also be a potential mismatch between modern obesogenic environments and adaptations to cold climates, highlighting the need to further investigate the potential for metabolically healthy obese phenotypes among circumpolar and other populations as well as the broader meaning for metabolic health.
   Lay Summary Global obesity rates are on the rise; however, body mass index (BMI) is a poor indicator of metabolic health. Here, we propose that cold climate populations may exhibit high BMIs, but relatively healthy metabolic profiles (metabolically healthy obesity) due to environmental and evolutionary pressures associated with inhabiting a cold climate.

AB  - Populations at risk of extinction due to climate change may be rescued by adaptive evolution or plasticity. Selective agents, such as introduced predators, may enhance or constrain plastic or adaptive responses to temperature. We tested responses of Daphnia to temperature by collecting populations from lakes across an elevational gradient in the presence and absence of fish predators (long-term selection). We subsequently grew these populations at two elevations in field mesocosms over two years (short-term selection), followed by a common-garden experiment at two temperatures in the lab to measure life-history traits. Both long-term and short-term selection affected traits, suggesting that genetic variation of plasticity within populations enabled individuals to rapidly evolve plasticity in response to high temperature. We found that short-term selection by high temperature increased plasticity for growth rate in all populations. Fecundity was higher in populations from fishless lakes and body size showed greater plasticity in populations from warm lakes (long-term selection). Neither body size nor fecundity were affected by short-term thermal selection. These results demonstrate that plasticity is an important component of the life-history response of Daphnia, and that genetic variation within populations enabled rapid evolution of plasticity in response to selection by temperature.

AB  - Pseudemydura umbrina is active only during winter and spring when environmental temperatures are relatively low and the ephemeral swamps that it inhabits contain water. We used operative environmental temperature thermometers to define the microclimates available to P. umbrina in its natural habitat during late winter and early spring, and we monitored the use of these microclimates by seven adult tortoises using radio-telemetry. Although air and water temperatures may be as low as 12-14 C during the day, we found that microclimates available to the animals have operative temperatures of up to 35-44 C out of water and 27 C in water. All animals increased in body mass during this study and females increased in body mass faster than males. Tortoises that spent more time in warm water increased their body mass faster than those that spent more time in cold water. During the cool time of the year, P. umbrina enhances its physiological condition by using warmer microclimates in the range of potential available microclimates.

Here, we combined the realism and rigid, replicated experimental design of a large-scale mesocosm study where populations of the zooplankter Simocephalus vetulus were exposed for 1 year to different global warming scenarios with a life table experiment under laboratory conditions at three temperatures that eliminated confounding, nongenetic factors. Our results provide solid proof for a rapid microevolutionary response to global warming in both survival and the subcomponents of individual performance (age at reproduction and number of offspring), which may allow populations of S. vetulus to persist locally under predicted scenarios of global warming. Such microevolutionary responses may buffer changes in community structure under global warming and help explain the outcome of previous mesocosm studies finding only marginal effects of global warming at the community level.

AB  - Eco-evolutionary dynamics occur when ecological change influences evolutionary change (eco-to-evo) and when evolutionary change influences ecological change (evo-to-eco), both on contemporary time scales. Fishes, amphibians, and reptiles have played important roles as study animals in the empirical study and exploration of these dynamics. We suggest that this primacy stems in part from the sweet-spot that many species of fishes, amphibians, and reptiles occupy on the continuum from experimental convenience to ecological importance, as well as on the particular organismal properties that they share, including indeterminate growth and ectothermy. Yet our overall understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics remains very limited. In the hope of reducing this information gap, the present symposium proceedings include 12 contributions that speak directly to three critical topics in eco-evolutionary dynamics: the role of human influences, constraints and alternatives, and the context dependence of eco-evolutionary dynamics in nature.

AB  - Rising temperatures associated with global warming present a challenge to the fate of many aquatic organisms. Although rapid evolutionary response to temperature-mediated selection may allow local persistence of populations under global warming, and therefore is a key aspect of evolutionary biology, solid proof of its occurrence is rare. In this study, we tested for genetic adaptation to an increase in temperature in the water flea Daphnia magna, a keystone species in freshwater systems, by performing a thermal selection experiment under laboratory conditions followed by the quantification of microevolutionary responses to temperature for both life-history traits as well as for intraspecific competitive strength. After three months of selection, we found a microevolutionary response to temperature in performance, but only in one of two culling regimes, highlighting the importance of population dynamics in driving microevolutionary change within populations. Furthermore, there was an evolutionary increase in thermal plasticity in performance. The results of the competition experiment were in agreement with predictions based on performance as quantified in the life table experiment and illustrate that microevolution within a short time frame has the ability to influence the outcome of intraspecific competition.

AB  - Eco-evolutionary dynamics will play a critical role in determining species' fates as climatic conditions change. Unfortunately, we have little understanding of how rapid evolutionary responses to climate play out when species are embedded in the competitive communities that they inhabit in nature. We tested the effects of rapid evolution in response to interspecific competition on subsequent ecological and evolutionary trajectories in a seasonally changing climate using a field-based evolution experiment with Drosophila melanogaster. Populations of D. melanogaster were either exposed, or not exposed, to interspecific competition with an invasive competitor, Zaprionus indianus, over the summer. We then quantified these populations' ecological trajectories (abundances) and evolutionary trajectories (heritable phenotypic change) when exposed to a cooling fall climate. We found that competition with Z. indianus in the summer affected the subsequent evolutionary trajectory of D. melanogaster populations in the fall, after all interspecific competition had ceased. Specifically, flies with a history of interspecific competition evolved under fall conditions to be larger and have lower cold fecundity and faster development than flies without a history of interspecific competition. Surprisingly, this divergent fall evolutionary trajectory occurred in the absence of any detectible effect of the summer competitive environment on phenotypic evolution over the summer or population dynamics in the fall. This study demonstrates that competitive interactions can leave a legacy that shapes evolutionary responses to climate even after competition has ceased, and more broadly, that evolution in response to one selective pressure can fundamentally alter evolution in response to subsequent agents of selection.

AB  - Low developmental temperatures cause ectotherms to retard growth, postpone maturation, and emerge at either larger or smaller adult size. In this study, we explored how these thermal responses evolved, focusing on their genetic basis. We applied a full diallel breeding design on inbred lines of the flour beetle, Tribolium castatteum. To assess the proportional contributions of genetic and non-genetic effects, each genotype, a unique combination of parental haplotypes, was reared from an egg to imago at five developmental temperatures. Faster development of females vs. males was associated with comparatively larger body masses of females (pupae and imago). In contrast, the rapid development caused by warmer environments resulted in smaller beetles (pupae and imago), but there were significant differences in this trait among genotypes. Independent effects of parental haplotypes played the major role in explaining the variance of body mass, but interactive effects of parental haplotypes explained most of the variance in developmental length. Genotypes responded to the thermal environment in a markedly uniform way. Nevertheless, we found the low statistically significant variance in the slopes of thermal reaction norms for body mass and developmental, which was mainly driven by the interactive effects of parental haplotypes. Overall, the thermal plasticity of T. castaneum follows the most common pattern among ectotherms, the so-called temperature-size rule. Detection of the low genetic variance in the shape of this response supports the idea that thermal developmental plasticity remains under a strong selective pressure in ectotherms.

AB  - Standard metabolic rate (SMR) and resistance to body dehydration (BD) are important physiological traits that have an effect on water balance and the amount of energy available for activity and production, and thus could contribute to variation in life history traits expressed across a range of environments. Few studies have tested whether SMR and BD show consistent between-individual variation in molluscs. Significant repeatability of SMR and BD indicates that the traits might be heritable and therefore a possible target for natural selection, so describing the repeatability of SMR and BD is important in studies of phenotypic variability. Here, we studied energy metabolism (body mass-corrected SMR) and the change in the scaling relationship of SMR and body mass in response to time between measurements in the giant garden slug Limax maximus. Limax maximus is one of the most invasive terrestrial molluscs, with a wide geographical distribution, and is considered an important pest of horticultural and agricultural crops. Our results show that L. maximus follows the expected relationship of increasing SMR with increasing mass, but the scaling exponent varies through time and is different from that described for other gastropods. We also found significant inter-individual variation in VCO2 Mean, VCO2 Min, VCO2 Max, and BD (t=0.25, 0.29, 0.24, 0.22, p<0.05, respectively), and significant repeatability of body mass (t=0.90). To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the repeatability of body mass-corrected SMR and BD in terrestrial slugs. Our results suggest that energy metabolism and water balance could potentially respond to selection.

AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) have become a major threat to ecosystems worldwide. From an evolutionary ecological perspective, they allow teasing apart the relative contributions of plasticity and evolutionary divergence in driving rapid phenotypic diversification. When IAS spread across extensive geographic ranges, climatic variation may represent a source of strong natural selection through overwinter mortality and summer heat stress. This could favour local adaptation, i.e., evolutionary divergence of certain traits. IAS, however, are likely to show plasticity in survival-related traits, and environmental fluctuation in their new distribution range could favour the maintenance of this pre-existing phenotypic plasticity. By contrast, sexually selected traits are more likely to undergo evolutionary divergence when components of sexual selection differ geographically. Here, using data from a common-garden rearing experiment of Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis Baird and Girard, 1853) from five populations across the species' invasive range in China, we show that invasive mosquitofish have retained plasticity in key physiological (thermal tolerances), morphological and life-history traits even 100 years after their introduction to China, but exhibit heritable population differences in several sexually selected traits, including the shape of the male copulatory organ. Adaptive plasticity of traits linked to immediate survival in different thermal environments-while likely responsible for the species' extraordinary invasion success-could slow down genetic evolution. Several sexually selected traits could diverge geographically and show rapid evolutionary change, e.g., because climate alters selective landscapes arising from mate competition as an indirect consequence of variation in overwinter mortality.

AB  - Plastic responses to temperature during embryonic development are common in ectotherms, but their evolutionary relevance is poorly understood. Using a combination of field and laboratory approaches, we demonstrate altitudinal divergence in the strength of effects of maternal thermal opportunity on offspring birth date and body mass in a live-bearing lizard (Niveoscincus ocellatus). Poor thermal opportunity decreased birth weight at low altitudes where selection on body mass was negligible. In contrast, there was no effect of maternal thermal opportunity on body mass at high altitudes where natural selection favored heavy offspring. The weaker effect of poor maternal thermal opportunity on offspring development at high altitude was accompanied by a more active thermoregulation and higher body temperature in highland females. This may suggest that passive effects of temperature on embryonic development have resulted in evolution of adaptive behavioral compensation for poor thermal opportunity at high altitudes, but that direct effects of maternal thermal environment are maintained at low altitudes because they are not selected against. More generally, we suggest that phenotypic effects of maternal thermal opportunity or incubation temperature in reptiles will most commonly reflect weak selection for canalization or selection on maternal strategies rather than adaptive plasticity to match postnatal environments.

AB  - Changes in population dynamics due to interacting evolutionary and ecological processes are the direct result of responses in vital rates, that is stage-specific growth, survival and fecundity. Quantifying through which vital rates population fitness is affected, instead of focusing on population trends only, can give a more mechanistic understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics. The aim of this study was to estimate the underlying demographic rates of aphid (Myzus persicae) populations. We analysed unpublished stage-structure population dynamics data of a field experiment with caged and uncaged populations in which rapid evolutionary dynamics were observed, as well as unpublished results from an individual life table experiment performed in a glasshouse. Using data on changes in population abundance and stage distributions over time, we estimated transition matrices with inverse modelling techniques, in a Bayesian framework. The model used to fit across all experimental treatments included density as well as clone-specific caging effects. We additionally used individual life table data to inform the model on survival, growth and reproduction. Results suggest that clones varied considerably in vital rates, and imply trade-offs between reproduction and survival. Responses to densities also varied between clones. Negative density dependence was found in growth and reproduction, and the presence of predators and competitors further decreased these two vital rates, while survival estimates increased. Under uncaged conditions, population growth rates of the evolving populations were increased compared to the expectation based on the pure clones. Our inverse modelling approach revealed how much vital rates contributed to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. The decomposition analysis showed that variation in population growth rates in the evolving populations was to a large extent shaped by plant size. Yet, it also revealed an impact of evolutionary changes in clonal composition. Finally, we discuss that inverse modelling is a complex problem, as multiple combinations of individual rates can result in the same dynamics. We discuss assumptions and limitations, as well as opportunities, of this approach.

AB  - Rapid evolution has rarely been assessed in biological control systems despite the similarity with biological invasions, which are widely used as model systems. We assessed post-introduction climatic adaptation in a population of Longitarsus jacobaeae, a biological control agent of Jacobaea vulgaris, which originated from a low-elevation site in Italy and was introduced in the USA to a high-elevation site (Mt. Hood, Oregon) in the early 1980s. Life-history characteristics of beetle populations from Mt. Hood, from two low-elevation sites in Oregon (Italian origin) and from a high-elevation site from Switzerland were compared in common gardens. The performance of low- and high-elevation populations at a low- and a high-elevation site was evaluated using reciprocal transplants. The results revealed significant changes in aestival diapause and shifts in phenology in the Mt. Hood population, compared with the low-elevation populations. We found increased performance of the Mt. Hood population in its home environment compared with the low-elevation populations that it originated from. The results indicate that the beetles at Mt. Hood have adapted to the cooler conditions by life-history changes that conform to predictions based on theory and the phenology of the cold-adapted Swiss beetles.

AB  - Heritable phenotypic traits under significant and consistent directional selection often fail to show the expected evolutionary response. A potential explanation for this contradiction is that because environmental conditions change constantly, environmental change can mask an evolutionary response to selection. We combined an "animal model" analysis with 36 years of data from a long-term study of great tits (Parus major) to explore selection on and evolution of a morphological trait: body mass at fledging. We found significant heritability of this trait, but despite consistent positive directional selection on both the phenotypic and the additive genetic component of body mass, the population mean phenotypic value declined rather than increased over time. However, the mean breeding value for body mass at fledging increased over time, presumably in response to selection. We show that the divergence between the response to selection observed at the levels of genotype and phenotype can be explained by a change in environmental conditions over time, that is, related both to increased spring temperature before breeding and elevated population density. Our results support the suggestion that measuring phenotypes may not always give a reliable impression of evolutionary trajectories and that understanding patterns of phenotypic evolution in nature requires an understanding of how the environment has itself changed.

AB  - Thermoregulatory capacity varies widely among bees and wasps, but the cellular physiology required to support such thermogenic ability remains unclear. Studies conducted on ectothermic species living in varying temperature show that cellular membrane composition is adjusted to remain functional, a process named homeoviscous adaptation. We show that the fatty acid composition of flight muscle membranes varies with thermogenic capacity in species of bees and wasps. The relative abundance of palmitate (16:0) and linoleate (18:2) decreased, while oleate (18:1) increased with increasing thoracic temperature. Species selected for the study varied over ten-fold in body mass, which in turn affected species thoracic temperature and their fatty acids profile. Nevertheless, all analyses conducted show that thoracic temperature is the main driver of flight muscle membrane composition in hymenopterans with diverse thermoregulatory capacity. These findings are in line with the predictions based on the homeoviscous adaptation hypothesis and further show that thermogenic strategy used by insect species impacts cellular membrane composition.

AB  - Climate change poses a threat to species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). A recent study on green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) at the northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) showed a highly female-skewed sex ratio with almost all juvenile turtles being female. This shortage of males might eventually cause population extinction, unless rapid evolutionary rescue, migration, range shifts, or conservation efforts ensure a sufficient number of males. We built a stochastic individual-based model inspired by C. mydas but potentially transferrable to other species with TSD. Pivotal temperature, nest depth, and shading were evolvable traits. Additionally, we considered the effect of crossbreeding between northern and southern GBR, nest site philopatry, and conservation efforts. Among the evolvable traits, nest depth was the most likely to rescue the population, but even here the warmer climate change scenarios led to extinction. We expected turtles to choose colder beaches under rising temperatures, but surprisingly, nest site philopatry did not improve persistence. Conservation efforts promoted population survival and did not preclude trait evolution. Although extra information is needed to make reliable predictions for the fate of green sea turtles, our results illustrate how evolution can shape the fate of long lived, vulnerable species in the face of climate change.

AB  - The acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1) codes for a low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase that has the important action of dephosphorylating tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and peptides and a second important role in modulating flavin cofactor levels and the activity of flavo-enzymes. These functions significantly influence cell division, differentiation, and growth. Two alleles (ACP1*A and ACP1*B) reach polymorphic frequencies at the ACP1 locus in all human populations, while the ACP1*C and ACP1*R alleles reach polymorphic frequencies in restricted geographical regions. The worldwide distribution of these alleles, and data from several clinical studies, strongly suggest that the ACP1 locus functions to modulate growth and that selection at this locus is a component of the selective processes influencing body mass and human population adaptation to thermal stress. The ACP1*A allele reaches highest frequencies at extreme latitudes and appears to be associated with maximizing body mass and adaptation to cold stress, whereas the ACP1*B allele reaches highest frequencies in tropical and subtropical environments and appears to be associated with minimizing body mass and adaptation to heat stress. The high frequency of the ACP1*C allele at northern latitudes, where ACP1*A allele frequencies are elevated, may be a mechanism for limiting fetal and maternal complications associated with fetal macrosomia and adult obesity in populations where protein and calorie intake are relatively high.

AB  - Purpose: The present study was assessed to study the restoration of the vascular compartment by rehydration after heat exposure or exercise. Methods: Eight subjects completed four trials in a randomized order: 2.7% dehydration of body mass by passive controlled hyperthermia once with rehydration and once without rehydration during recovery, and 2.7% dehydration of body mass by treadmill exercise once with rehydration and once without rehydration during recovery. An isotonic glucose electrolyte beverage was provided twice during the recovery period for a total volume, which was equivalent to the target value of body mass loss during dehydration procedures. Plasma volume (PV) was measured using Evans Blue dilution technique, and PV changes (DeltaPV) were determined using hematocrit and hemoglobin measurements. Results: PV was better maintained during exercise than during heat exposure, and the difference in DeltaPV between the two patterns of dehydration was maintained during the first 3 h of recovery. Plasma protein seemed to be accountable for the difference in DeltaPV during heat exposure and exercise but not during the 270 min of recovery. Rehydration partly restored body fluid losses, but the plasma compartment was privileged, because 26-30% of the net fluid gain was found in the plasma compartment (about 300 mL). Rehydration restored plasma osmolality and diminished the drive for arginin-vasopressin response. Conclusion: The similar selective retention of water in the plasma compartment might essentially be explained by osmotic factors provided by the beverage. As PV was completely restored by rehydration after exercise and only partly restored after heat exposure, the volume of ingested beverage should be higher after heat exposure to completely restore the plasma compartment.

AB  - The temperature-size rule is a common pattern of phenotypic plasticity in which higher temperature during development results in a smaller adult body size (i.e. a thermal reaction norm with negative slope). Examples and exceptions to the rule are known in multiple groups of organisms, but rapid population differentiation in the temperature-size rule has not been explored. Here we examine the genetic and parental contributions to population differentiation in thermal reaction norms for size, development time and survival in the Cabbage White Butterfly Pieris rapae, for two geographical populations that have likely diverged within the past 150 years. We used split-sibship experiments with two temperature treatments (warm and cool) for P. rapae from Chapel Hill, NC, and from Seattle, WA. Mixed-effect model analyses demonstrate significant genetic differences between NC and WA populations for adult size and for thermal reaction norms for size. Mean adult mass was 12-24% greater in NC than in WA populations for both temperature treatments; mean size was unaffected or decreased with temperature (the temperature-size rule) for the WA population, but size increased with temperature for the NC population. Our study shows that the temperature-size rule and related thermal reaction norms can evolve rapidly within species in natural field conditions. Rapid evolutionary divergence argues against the existence of a simple, general mechanistic constraint as the underlying cause of the temperature-size rule.

AB  - Phenotypic selection is widely accepted as the primary cause of adaptive evolution in natural populations, but selection on complex functional properties linking physiology, behavior, and morphology has been rarely quantified. In ectotherms, correlational selection on thermal physiology, thermoregulatory behavior, and energy metabolism is of special interest because of their potential coadaptation. We quantified phenotypic selection on thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance (sprint speed), thermal preferences, and resting metabolic rate in captive populations of an ectothermic vertebrate, the common lizard, Zootoca vivipara. No correlational selection between thermal sensitivity of performance, thermoregulatory behavior, and energy metabolism was found. A combination of high body mass and resting metabolic rate was positively correlated with survival and negatively correlated with fecundity. Thus, different mechanisms underlie selection on metabolism in lizards with small body mass than in lizards with high body mass. In addition, lizards that selected the near average preferred body temperature grew faster that their congeners. This is one of the few studies that quantifies significant correlational selection on a proxy of energy expenditure and stabilizing selection on thermoregulatory behavior.

AB  - Global climate is changing rapidly, and the degree to which natural populations respond genetically to these changes is key to predicting ecological responses(1-3). So far, no study has documented evolutionary changes in the thermal tolerance of natural populations as a response to recent temperature increase. Here, we demonstrate genetic change in the capacity of the water flea Daphnia to tolerate higher temperatures using both a selection experiment and the reconstruction of evolution over a period of forty years derived from a layered dormant egg bank. We observed a genetic increase in thermal tolerance in response to a two-year ambient +4 degrees C selection treatment and in the genotypes of natural populations from the 1960s and 2000s hatched from lake sediments. This demonstrates that natural populations have evolved increased tolerance to higher temperatures, probably associated with the increased frequency of heat waves over the past decades, and possess the capacity to evolve increased tolerance to future warming.

AB  - ObjectivesWe explore variations in body and limb proportions of the Jomon hunter-gatherers (14,000-2500 BP), the Yayoi agriculturalists (2500-1700 BP) of Japan, and the Kumejima Islanders of the Ryukyus (1600-1800 AD) with 11 geographically diverse skeletal postcranial samples from Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America using brachial-crural indices, femur head-breadth-to-femur length ratio, femur head-breadth-to-lower-limb-length ratio, and body mass as indicators of phenotypic climatic adaptation. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that variation in limb proportions seen in Jomon, Yayoi, and Kumejima is a complex interaction of genetic adaptation; development and allometric constraints; selection, gene flow and genetic drift with changing cultural factors (i.e., nutrition) and climate.
   METHODSThe skeletal data (1127 individuals) were subjected to principle components analysis, Manly's permutation multiple regression tests, and Relethford-Blangero analysis.
   RESULTSThe results of Manly's tests indicate that body proportions and body mass are significantly correlated with latitude, and minimum and maximum temperatures while limb proportions were not significantly correlated with these climatic variables. Principal components plots separated climatic zones: tropical, temperate, and arctic populations. The indigenous Jomon showed cold-adapted body proportions and warm-adapted limb proportions. Kumejima showed cold-adapted body proportions and limbs. The Yayoi adhered to the Allen-Bergmann expectation of cold-adapted body and limb proportions. Relethford-Blangero analysis showed that Kumejima experienced gene flow indicated by high observed variances while Jomon experienced genetic drift indicated by low observed variances.
   CONCLUSIONSThe complex interaction of evolutionary forces and development/nutritional constraints are implicated in the mismatch of limb and body proportions.

AB  - Directional climate change (global warming) is causing rapid alterations in animals' environments. Because the nervous system is at the forefront of animals' interactions with the environment, the neurobiological implications of climate change are central to understanding how individuals, and ultimately populations, will respond to global warming. Evidence is accumulating for individual level, mechanistic effects of climate change on nervous system development and performance. Climate change can also alter sensory stimuli, changing the effectiveness of sensory and cognitive systems for achieving biological fitness. At the population level, natural selection forces stemming from directional climate change may drive rapid evolutionary change in nervous system structure and function.

AB  - 1. Little evolutionary change may occur at species borders since the cost of accommodating environmental streses is high. Extreme examples of such stasis include cave animals in stable stressed environments and 'living fossils' in widely fluctuating stressed environments.
   2. Variability from the molecular to the organismic level tends to be high under extreme stress. At the developmental level, the fitness of such variants may be low. This means that much developmental variability in natural populations may have little evolutionary significance.
   3. Rapid evolutionary change of morphological traits is most likely to be based upon genes acting late in a developmental pathway under conditions which are ecologically and energetically permissive.
   4. Although some increases in resistance to temperature extremes have been recorded in laboratory selection experiments, major extensions of extremes in natural populations appear difficult to achieve. The energetic costs of surviving extremes at species borders implies that the evolution of major developmental and morphological shifts is more likely to be a feature of populations of more equable habitats.

AB  - 1. We examined published studies relating resting oxygen consumption to body mass and temperature in post-larval teleost fish. The resulting database comprised 138 studies of 69 species (representing 28 families and 12 orders) living over a temperature range of c. 40 degrees C.
   2. Resting metabolic rate (R-b; mmol oxygen gas h(-1)) was related to body mass (M; wet mass, g) by R-b = aM(b), where a is a constant and b the scaling exponent. The model was fitted by least squares linear regression after logarithmic transformation of both variables. The mean value of scaling exponent, b, for the 69 individual species was 0.79 (SE 0.11). The general equation for all teleost fish was 1nR(b) = 0.80(1nM)- 5.43.
   3. The relationship between resting oxygen consumption and environmental temperature for a 50-g fish was curvilinear. A typical tropical fish at 30 degrees C requires approximately six times as much oxygen for resting metabolism as does a polar fish at 0 degrees C. This relationship could be fitted by several statistical models, of which the Arrhenius model is probably the most appropriate. The Arrhenius model for the resting metabolism of 69 species of teleost fish, corrected to a standard body mass of 50 g, was 1nR(b) = 15.7-5.02.T-1, where T is absolute temperature (10(3) x K).
   4. The Arrhenius model fitted to all 69 species exhibited a lower thermal sensitivity of resting metabolism (mean Q(10) = 1.83 over the range 0-30 degrees C) than typical within-species acclimation studies (median Q(10) = 2.40, n = 14). This suggests that evolutionary adaptation has reduced the overall thermal sensitivity of resting metabolism across species. Analysis of covariance indicated that the relationships between resting metabolic rate and temperature for various taxa (orders) showed similar slopes but significantly different mean rates.
   5. Analysis of the data for perciform fish provided no support for metabolic cold adaptation (the hypothesis that polar fish show a resting metabolic rate higher than predicted from the overall rate/temperature relationship established for temperate and tropical species).
   6. Taxonomic variation in mean resting metabolic rate showed no relationship to phylogeny, although the robustness of this conclusion is constrained by our limited knowledge of fish evolutionary history.

AB  - Food consumption rate and temperature selection of male and female Uromastyx philbyi were measured during the spring. Mass-specific food consumption rates of this herbivorous desert lizard were lower than those of other lizard species. The exponents of body mass in relation to food consumption were 0.80, 0.78 and 0.69 for male, non-gravid and gravid females, respectively. Gravid females had significantly the lowest mass-specific food consumption rates. Both sexes selected significantly higher mean body temperatures in photophase than in scotophase over the 24-h period. Gravid females chose the highest mean selected body temperatures and spent a longer time at higher temperatures. The adaptive significance of these variations in food consumption rate and temperature selection is discussed. (C) 1998 Academic Press Limited.

AB  - The potential to adapt to novel environmental conditions is a key area of interest for evolutionary biology. However, the role of multiple selection pressures on adaptive responses has rarely been investigated in natural populations. In Sweden, the natterjack toad Bufo calamita inhabits two separate distribution areas, one in southernmost Sweden and one on the west coast. We characterized the larval habitat in terms of pond size and salinity in the two areas, and found that the western populations are more affected by both desiccation risk and pond salinity than the southern populations. In a common garden experiment manipulating salinity and temperature, we found that toads from the west coast populations were locally adapted to shorter pond duration as indicated by their higher development and growth rates. However, despite being subjected to higher salinity stress in nature, west coast toads had a poorer performance in saline treatments. We found that survival in the saline treatments in the west coast populations was positively affected by larger body mass and longer larval period. Furthermore, we found negative genetic correlations between body mass and growth rate and their plastic responses to salinity. These results implicate that the occurrence of multiple environmental stressors needs to be accounted for when assessing the adaptive potential of organisms and suggest that genetic correlations may play a role in constraining adaptation of natural populations.

AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts an average global temperature increase of 1.8-4.0 A degrees C by 2100. Tropical ectotherms are expected to be particularly sensitive to this temperature increase because they live close to their thermal limits. We investigated the phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary response of sperm traits in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to increased temperatures after 6, 18, and 24 months. Guppies with evolution temperatures of 25 A degrees C (control) or 28 A degrees C were reared in either 25 or 28 A degrees C in a 2 x 2 common garden design. The plastic response to increased temperature was a decreased sperm length, velocity, and path linearity. The evolutionary response was a subsequent increase in sperm length, resulting in complete compensation after just 6 months (at most four generations) in 28 A degrees C water. Sperm velocity and linearity showed no sign of evolution even after 24 months. This study provides evidence that some reproductive traits can respond via rapid evolution to the temperature increase associated with climate change.

AB  - Novel biotic or abiotic conditions can cause invasive species to evolve rapidly in their newly invaded habitats and are important factors when predicting species invasions. Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have a relatively long invasion history in Western Europe, whereas quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) began spreading about a decade ago. In a previous invasion to North America, quagga mussels repeatedly colonized stratified lakes at greater depth than zebra mussels. It would be important to know if the same invasion pattern is expected to repeat in Western Europe, as the quagga are expected to reach deep stratified lakes in the near future. This might require quagga mussels to be more tolerant of the low oxygen conditions at depth than zebra mussels. Therefore, using a fully factorial design, we tested survival of different zebra and quagga mussel populations from Western Europe at four oxygen levels (6%, 33%, 66% and 90%) and two temperature regimes (11 degrees C and 18 degrees C). Surprisingly, survival differences among oxygen and temperature treatments depended more on population origin than on species identity. This finding suggests that populations have undergone rapid and convergent adaptation to local conditions after invasion, in particular to low oxygen. We also found that population-by-environment interactions were more variable among quagga than zebra mussel populations. Our results suggest that rapid evolutionary adaptation to low oxygen conditions needs to be considered when predicting the further spread of zebra and quagga mussels.

AB  - The role phenotypic plasticity might play in adaptation to the ongoing climate changes is unclear. Plasticity allows for the production of a diversity of intra-generational responses, whose inter-generational evolutionary consequences are difficult to predict. In this article, we review theory and empirical studies addressing this question in insects by considering three scenarios. The first scenario corresponds to adaptive plasticity that should lead to slow or no evolution. The second scenario is the case of non-adaptive phenotypic plasticity to new environmental conditions that should lead either to extinction or, on the contrary, to rapid evolutionary change. The third scenario deals with how plasticity alters the variance selection acts upon. These scenarios are then discussed by highlighting examples of empirical studies on insects. We conclude that more studies are needed to better understand the relationship between phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary processes in insects.

AB  - Using a laboratory colony we demonstrated that the body mass (BM) and reproductive organ mass (ROM) of Brandt's voles vary in response to photoperiod and temperature. Male Brandt's voles from 25 days of age were housed under long (14L) or short (10L) photoperiod, which corresponds to seasonal changes in their natural environment. Under 10L, animals housed for the first 7 weeks at 10 degrees C were significantly lighter than those housed at 20 degrees C. This effect was not observed under 14L. However, a change from an initial 10L photoperiod to the 14L photoperiod for the following 9 weeks could compensate the effects of low temperature on BM. Changes in BM in response to photoperiod and/or temperature exposure appeared to be primarily as a result of the deposition or loss of fat-free dry mass and water. For Brandt's voles, ROM was regulated significantly by photoperiod but not by temperature. Taken together, the results suggest that BM and ROM for male Brandt's voles respond selectively to photoperiodic information and temperature. We propose that a compensatory relationship between photoperiod and temperature should be considered in animal physiology research.

AB  - There are an increasing number of studies documenting effects of global warming on the distribution and ecology of a wide variety of organisms. However, much less is known about evolutionary responses in species to increasing temperature. As a result, thermal microevolution is often ignored when making predictions about the impact of global warming on the distribution of organisms and the composition of communities. We investigated the ability of 2 large-bodied Daphnia species, D. magna and D. pulex, to genetically respond to increased temperature under semi-natural conditions. Daphnia populations were exposed for 6 mo to different temperature treatments in large outdoor mesocosms that simulated small pond systems. The selection experiment was followed by a common garden experiment in which we quantified thermal microevolution in important life history traits. Intrinsic growth rate did not respond to thermal selection. Instead, we observed an effect of selection temperature on size at maturity, indicating that Daphnia may genetically adapt to increased temperature within one growing season. In a previous laboratory study on thermal microevolution using single-species cultures of D. magna, we documented the opposite pattern with thermal microevolution in intrinsic growth rate but not in size at maturity. These observations suggest that the ecological context (semi-natural conditions compared to single species cultures) is very important in determining with which traits species adapt to global warming.

AB  - In temperate climates, the recurring seasonal exigencies of winter represent a fundamental physiological challenge for a wide range of organisms. In response, many temperate insects enter diapause, an alternative developmental program, including developmental arrest, that allows organisms to synchronize their life cycle with seasonal environmental variation. Geographic variation in diapause phenology contributing to local climatic adaptation is well documented. However, few studies have examined how the rapid evolution of a suite of traits expressed across the diapause program may contribute to climatic adaptation on a contemporary timescale. Here, we investigate the evolution of the diapause program over the past 35 years by leveraging a "natural experiment" presented by the recent invasion of the Asian tiger mosquito,Aedes albopictus, across the eastern United States. We sampled populations from two distinct climatic regions separated by 6 degrees of latitude (similar to 700 km). Using common-garden experiments, we identified regional genetic divergence in diapause-associated cold tolerance, diapause duration, and postdiapause starvation tolerance. We also found regional divergence in nondiapause thermal performance. In contrast, we observed minimal regional divergence in nondiapause larval growth traits and at neutral molecular marker loci. Our results demonstrate rapid evolution of the diapause program and imply strong selection caused by differences in winter conditions.

AB  - 1. Thermoregulatory behavior of fed and fasted desert hamsters (Phodopus roborovskii) acclimated to summer- [16 light (L):8 dark (D), ambient temperature (T-a) = 26.5 degrees C] and winter-like (8L-:16D, T-a = 10 degrees C) conditions was studied. Body temperature (T-b), selected temperature and activity were measured in hamsters placed in a thermal gradient system for 48 h.
   2. Acclimation to winter-like days led to the decrease in body mass by 14% and in body temperature by 1 degrees C. On the contrary, selected T-a was higher by about 3 degrees C than in summer-like acclimated hamsters. Fasting affected only temperatures selected by night in winter-like acclimated hamsters.
   3. Winter-like acclimation led to physiological changes, which may facilitate surviving long winter season. In the face of food shortage, behavioral thermoregulation may markedly reduce the energetic cost of normothermy. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Animal body size commonly shows a relationship with latitude to the degree that this phenomenon is one of the few rules' discussed in evolutionary ecology: Bergmann's rule. Although exaggerated secondary sexual traits frequently exhibit interesting relationships with body size (allometries) and are expected to evolve rapidly in response to environmental variation, the way in which allometry might interact with latitude has not been addressed. We present data showing latitudinal variation in body size and weapon allometry for the New Zealand giraffe weevil (Lasiorhynchus barbicornis). Males display an extremely elongated rostrum used as a weapon during fights for access to females. Consistent with Bergmann's rule, mean body size increased with latitude. More interestingly, weapon allometry also varied with latitude, such that lower latitude populations exhibited steeper allometric slopes between weapon and body size. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document a latitudinal cline in weapon allometry and is therefore a novel contribution to the collective work on Bergmann's rule and secondary sexual trait variation.

AB  - Purpose - Fresh catfish (Clarias gariepinus) is highly perishable. This paper aims to investigate the drying characteristics and quality of body-mass dehydrated catfish to determine the effective dehydration parameters for preservation.
   Design/methodology/approach - Brine concentration (3-9 per cent), brining time (30-90 min) and drying temperature (90-130 degrees C) interacted using the response surface methodology. Preliminary experiments were conducted to select treatments. Moisture content and ratio and drying rate were determined and fitted into five thin-layer drying models; the goodness of fit was evaluated by average grade ranking of the regression parameters. Proximate compositions and microbial load of dehydrated catfish were determined using standard methods.
   Findings - Treatments with 110 degrees C gave initial higher drying rate (0.034-0.043 kg H2O/kg solid/h) and shorter drying time (20-21 h). Drying occurred at two falling rate periods. Midilli model ranked first in fitting the drying data. It explained up to 99.6-99.7 per cent of the total variations in the independent variables with low values of error terms; RMSE was 0.02131-0.01794 and x 2 was 0.00037-0.00043, indicating good predictive quality. Processing parameters positively and significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the proximate compositions of dehydrated catfish. Treatment: 6 per cent brine, 90 min and 110 degrees C presented the most effective dehydration parameters for quality preservation of body-mass catfish.
   Practical implications - The dehydration technique used in this study could enhance nutritive quality and storage stability of body-mass dehydrated catfish that could serve as a useful and convenient tool for commercial application.
   Social implications - Hygienically processed dehydrated catfish of good quality could be used as a source of nutrients to ameliorate malnutrition and reduce post-harvest losses of catfish.
   Originality/value - The effective processing parameters established is an important step to harness the high nutrients and economic values embedded in catfish.

AB  - Adaptation to temporal variation in environmental conditions is widespread. Whether evolution in a constant environment alters adaptation to temporal variation is relatively unexplored. We examine how constant and diurnally fluctuating temperature conditions affect life-history traits in two populations of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta: a field population that routinely experiences fluctuating temperatures; and a laboratory population (derived from this field population in the 1960s) maintained at a constant temperature for more than 250 generations. Our experiments demonstrate that diurnal fluctuations significantly alter body size and development time in both populations, and confirm that these populations differ in their responses to a mean temperature. However, we found no evidence for population divergence in responses to diurnal temperature fluctuations. We suggest that mean and extreme temperatures may act as more potent selective forces on thermal reaction norms than temperature variation per se.

AB  - Many species are too slow to track their poleward-moving climate niche under global warming. Pesticide exposure may contribute to this by reducing population growth and impairing flight ability. Moreover, edge populations at the moving range front may be more vulnerable to pesticides because of the rapid evolution of traits to enhance their rate of spread that shunt energy away from detoxification and repair. We exposed replicated edge and core populations of the poleward-moving damselfly Coenagrion scitulum to the pesticide esfenvalerate at low and high densities. Exposure to esfenvalerate had strong negative effects on survival, growth rate, and development time in the larval stage and negatively affected flight-related adult traits (mass at emergence, flight muscle mass, and fat content) across metamorphosis. Pesticide effects did not differ between edge and core populations, except that at the high concentration the pesticide-induced mortality was 17% stronger in edge populations. Pesticide exposure may therefore slow down the range expansion by lowering population growth rates, especially because edge populations suffered a higher mortality, and by negatively affecting dispersal ability by impairing flight-related traits. These results emphasize the need for direct conservation efforts toward leading-edge populations for facilitating future range shifts under global warming.

AB  - Background: Selective landscapes in rivers are made up by an array of selective forces that vary from source to downstream regions or between seasons, and local/temporal variation in fitness maxima can result in gradual spatio-temporal variation of phenotypic traits. This study aimed at establishing freshwater amphipods as future model organisms to study adaptive phenotypic diversification (evolutionary divergence and/or adaptive plasticity) along stream gradients.
   Methods: We collected Gammarus roeselii from 16 sampling sites in the Rhine catchment during two consecutive seasons (summer and winter). Altogether, we dissected n = 1648 individuals and quantified key parameters related to morphological and life-history diversification, including naturally selected (e.g., gill surface areas) as well as primarily sexually selected traits (e.g., male antennae). Acknowledging the complexity of selective regimes in streams and the interrelated nature of selection factors, we assessed several abiotic (e.g., temperature, flow velocity) and biotic ecological parameters (e.g., conspecific densities, sex ratios) and condensed them into four principal components (PCs).
   Results: Generalized least squares models revealed pronounced phenotypic differentiation in most of the traits investigated herein, and components of the stream gradient (PCs) explained parts of the observed differences. Depending on the trait under investigation, phenotypic differentiation could be ascribed to variation in abiotic conditions, anthropogenic disturbance (influx of thermally polluted water), or population parameters. For example, female fecundity showed altitudinal variation and decreased with increasing conspecific densities, while sexual dimorphism in the length of male antennae-used for mate finding and assessment-increased with increasing population densities and towards female-biased sex ratios.
   Conclusions: We provide a comprehensive protocol for comparative analyses of intraspecific variation in life history traits in amphipods. Whether the observed phenotypic differentiation over small geographical distances reflects evolutionary divergence or plasticity (or both) remains to be investigated in future studies. Independent of the mechanisms involved, variation in several traits is likely to have consequences for ecosystem functions. For example, leaf-shredding in G. roeselii strongly depends on body size, which varied in dependence of several ecological parameters.

AB  - As the planet becomes increasingly urbanized, it is imperative that we understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of urbanization on species. One common attribute of urbanization that differs from rural areas is the prevalence of artificial light at night (ALAN). For many species, light is one of the most important and reliable environmental cues, largely governing the timing of daily and seasonal activity patterns. Recently, it has been shown that ALAN can alter behavioral, phenological, and physiological traits in diverse taxa. For temperate insects, diapause is an essential trait for winter survival and commences in response to declining daylight hours in the fall. Diapause is under strong selection pressure in the mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse); local adaptation and rapid evolution has been observed along a latitudinal dine. It is unknown how ALAN affects this photosensitive trait or if local adaptation has occurred along an urbanization gradient. Using a common garden experiment, we experimentally demonstrated that simulated ALAN reduces diapause incidence in this species by as much as 40%. There was no difference, however, between urban and rural demes. We also calculated diapause incidence from wild demes in urban areas to determine whether wild populations exhibited lower than predicted incidence compared to estimates from total nocturnal darkness. In early fall, lower than predicted diapause incidence was recorded, but all demes reached nearly 100% diapause before terminating egg laying. It is possible that nocturnal resting behavior in vegetation limits the amount of ALAN exposure this species experiences potentially limiting local adaptation.

AB  - How does environmental heterogeneity affect natural selection on tree swallow nestlings? Houle et al. (2020) show that more precipitation and higher temperatures result in stronger selection on body mass and wing length and that agricultural intensity can affect the direction of selection. These findings raise the question of how genetic diversity changes under strong selection pressures, which will be especially important under ongoing agriculture intensification and climate change.

AB  - Past theories on total lifetime energy expenditures and entropy generation in biological systems (BS) dealt with whole systems, but the recent literature suggests that the total metabolic rate of a BS, (q) over dot(body) (W) is a sum of product of specific metabolic rate (q) over dot(k,m) (W/kg of organ k) of each vital life organ, k {k = brain, heart, kidney and liver, or abbreviated as BHKL, and rest of the organ mass (R)} and mass of each organ k (m(k)). Using this hypothesis, Kleiber's law on metabolic rate of BS ((q) over dot(body)) for animals of different sizes was validated. In this work, a similar procedure is adopted in estimating total entropy generation rate of whole human body ((sigma) over dot(body), W/K) as a sum of product of specific entropy generation rate for each organ, (sigma) over dot(k,m) (W/{K kg of organ k(.)}) and the organ mass at any given age (t). Further integrating over life span for each organ (t(life)), the lifetime specific entropy generated by organ k, sigma(k,m,life) (J of organ k/ {K kg organ k}) is calculated. Then lifetime entropy generation of unit body mass, sigma(body,M,life) (J/{K kg body mass(.)}) is calculated as a sum of the corresponding values contributed by all vital organs to unit body mass and verified with previously published literature. The higher the sigma(k,m,life), the higher the entropy stress level (which is a measure of energy released by unit organ mass of k as heat) and the irreversibility within the organ, resulting in faster degradation of organ and the consequent health problems for the whole BS. In order to estimate (sigma) over dot(k) (W/K of organ k), data on energy release rate ((q) over dot) is needed over lifetime for each organ. While the Adequate Macronutrients Distribution Range (AMDR)/Adequate Intake (AI) publication can be used in estimating the energy intake of whole body vs. age for the human body, the energy expenditure data is not available at organ level. Hence the sigma(k,m,life) was computed using existing allometric laws developed for the metabolism of the organs, the relation between the m(k) of organ and body mass m(B), and the body mass growth data m(B)(t) over the lifetime. Based on the values of sigma(k,m, life), the organs were ranked from highest to lowest entropy generation and the heart is found to be the most entropy-stressed organ. The entropy stress levels of the other organs are then normalized to the entropy stress level (NESH) of the heart. The NESH values for organs are as follows: Heart: 1.0, Kidney: 0.92, Brain: 0.46, Liver: 0.41, Rest of BS: 0.027. If normalized to rest of body (R), NESR, heart: 37, Kidney: 34, Brain: 17, Liver: 15, Rest of BS: 1.0; so heart will fail first followed by kidney and other organs in order. Supporting data is provided.

AB  - We investigated the effects of developmental and parental temperatures on several physiological and morphological traits of adult Drosophila melanogaster. Flies for the parental generation were raised at either low or moderate temperature (18 degrees C or 25 degrees C) and then mated in the four possible sex-by-parental temperature crosses. Their offspring were raised at either 18 degrees C or 25 degrees C and then scored as adults for morphological (dry body mass, wing size, and abdominal melanization [females only]), physiological (knock-down temperature, and thermal dependence of walking speed), and life history (egg size) traits. The experiment was replicated, and the factorial design allows us to determine whether and how paternal, maternal, and developmental temperatures (as well as offspring sex) influence the various traits. Sex and developmental temperature had major effects on all traits. Females had larger bodies and wings, higher knock-down temperatures, and slower speeds (but similar shaped performance curves) than males. Development at 25 degrees C (versus at 18 degrees C) increased knock-down temperature, increased maximal speed and thermal performance breadth, decreased the optimal temperature for walking, decreased body mass and wing size, reduced abdominal melanization, and reduced egg size. Parental temperatures influenced a few traits, but the effects were generally small relative to those of sex or developmental temperature. Flies whose mother had been raised at 25 degrees C (versus at 18 degrees C) had slightly higher knock-down temperature and smaller body mass. Flies whose father had been raised at 25 degrees C had relatively longer wings. The effects of paternal, maternal, and developmental temperatures sometimes differed in direction. The existence of significant within- and between-generation effects suggests that comparative studies need to standardize thermal environments for at least two generations, that attempts to estimate ''field'' heritabilities may be unreliable for some traits, and that predictions of short-term evolutionary responses to selection will be difficult.

AB  - Filing gaps in our understanding of species' abilities to adapt to novel climates is a key challenge for predicting future range shifts and biodiversity loss. Key knowledge gaps are related to the potential for evolutionary rescue in response to climate, especially in long-lived clonally reproducing species. We illustrate a novel approach to assess the potential for evolutionary rescue using a combination of reciprocal transplant experiment in the field to assess performance under a changing climate and independent growth chamber assays to assess growth- and physiology-related plant trait maxima and plasticities of the same clones. We use a clonal grass, Festuca rubra, as a model species. We propagated individual clones and used them in a transplant experiment across broad-scale temperature and precipitation gradients, simulating the projected direction of climate change in the region. Independent information on trait maxima and plasticities of the same clones was obtained by cultivating them in four growth chambers representing climate extremes. Plant survival was affected by interaction between plant traits and climate change, with both trait plasticities and maxima being important for adaptation to novel climates. Key traits include plasticity in extravaginal ramets, aboveground biomass, and osmotic potential. The direction of selection in response to a given climatic change detected in this study mostly contradicted the natural trait clines indicating that short-term selection pressure as identified here does not match long-term selection outcomes. Long-lived clonal species exposed to different climatic changes are subjected to consistent selection pressures on key traits, a necessary condition for adaptation to novel conditions. This points to evolutionary rescue as an important mechanism for dealing with climate change in these species. Our experimental approach may be applied also in other model systems broadening our understanding of evolutionary rescue. Such knowledge cannot be easily deduced from observing the existing field clines.

AB  - Drosophila subobscura is geographically widespread in the Old World. Around the late 1970s, it was accidentally introduced into both South and North America, where it spread rapidly over broad latitudinal ranges. This invading species offers opportunities to study the speed and predictability of trait evolution on a geographic scale. One trait of special interest is body size, which shows a strong and positive latitudinal cline in many Drosophila species, including Old World D. subobscura. Surveys made about a decade after the invasion found no evidence of a size cline in either North or South America. However, a survey made in North America about two decades after the invasion showed that a conspicuous size cline had evolved and (for females) was coincident with that for Old World flies. We have now conducted parallel studies on 10 populations (13degrees of latitude) of flies, collected in Chile in spring 1999. After rearing flies in the laboratory for several generations, we measured wing sizes and compared geographic patterns (versus latitude or temperature) for flies on all three continents. South American females have now evolved a significant latitudinal size cline that is similar in slope to that of Old World and of North American flies. Rates of evolution (haldanes) for females are among the highest ever measured for quantitative traits. In contrast, the size cline is positive but not significant for South or North American males. At any given latitude, South American flies of both sexes are relatively large; this in part reflects the relatively cool climate of coastal Chile. Interestingly, the sections of the wing that generate the size cline for females differ among all three continents. Thus, although the evolution of overall wing size is predictable on a geographic scale (at least for females), the evolution of size of particular wing components is decidedly not.

AB  - Assessing whether trait variations among individuals are consistent over time and among environmental conditions is crucial to understand evolutionary responses to new selective pressures such as climate change. According to the universal thermal dependence hypothesis, thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate should not vary strongly and consistently among organisms, implying limited evolutionary response for metabolic traits under climate change. However, this hypothesis has been rarely tested at an individual level, leaving a gap in our understanding of climate change impacts on metabolic responses and their potential evolution. Using the amphipod Gammarus fossarum, we investigated the variability and repeatability of individual metabolic thermal reaction norms over time. We found large variations in both the thermal sensitivity (i.e. slope) and expression level (i.e. intercept) of individual metabolic reaction norms. Moreover, differences among individuals were consistent over time, and therefore repeatable. Inter-individual variations in body mass resulted in a high repeatability of metabolic expression level but had no significant effect on the repeatability of thermal sensitivity. Overall, our results highlight that inter-individual variability and repeatability of thermal reaction norms can be substantial. We conclude that these consistent differences among individuals should not be overlooked when apprehending the ecological and evolutionary effects of climate change.

AB  - Anthropogenic factors, including climate warming, are increasing the incidence and prevalence of infectious diseases worldwide. Infectious diseases caused by pathogenic parasites can have severe impacts on host survival, thereby altering the selection regime and inducing evolutionary responses in their hosts. Knowledge about such evolutionary consequences in natural populations is critical to mitigate potential ecological and economic effects. However, studies on pathogen-induced trait changes are scarce and the pace of evolutionary change is largely unknown, particularly in vertebrates. Here, we use a time series from long-term monitoring of perch to estimate temporal trends in the maturation schedule before and after a severe pathogen outbreak. We show that the disease induced a phenotypic change from a previously increasing to a decreasing size at maturation, the most important life-history transition in animals. Evolutionary rates imposed by the pathogen were high and comparable to those reported for populations exposed to intense human harvesting. Pathogens thus represent highly potent drivers of adaptive phenotypic evolution in vertebrates.

AB  - Parallel latitudinal clines to the long-standing ones in the original Palearctic populations have independently evolved at different rates for chromosomal polymorphism and body size in South and North American populations of Drosophila subobscura since colonization around 25 years ago. This strongly suggests that (micro) evolutionary changes are largely predictable, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The putative role of temperature per se was investigated by using three sets of populations at each of three temperatures (13degrees, 18degrees, and 22degreesC) spanning much of the tolerable range for this species. We found a lower chromosomal diversity at the warmest temperature; a quick and consistent shift in gene arrangement frequencies in response to temperature; an evolutionary decrease in wing size, mediated by both cell area and cell number, at 18degreesC; no relationship between wing size and those inversions involved in latitudinal clines; and a shortening of the basal length of longitudinal vein IV relative to its total length with increasing standard dose. The trends for chromosomal polymorphism and body size were generally inconsistent from simple climatic-based explanations of worldwide latitudinal patterns. The findings are discussed in the light of available information on D. subobscura and results from earlier thermal selection experiments with various Drosophila species.

AB  - Greater oxygen availability has been hypothesized to be important in allowing the evolution of larger invertebrates during the Earth's history, and across aquatic environments. We tested for evolutionary and developmental responses of adult body size of Drosophila melanogaster to hypoxia and hyperoxia. Individually reared flies were smaller in hypoxia, but hyperoxia had no effect. In each of three oxygen treatments (hypoxia, normoxia or hyperoxia) we reared three replicate lines of flies for seven generations, followed by four generations in normoxia. In hypoxia, responses were due primarily to developmental plasticity, as average body size fell in one generation and returned to control values after one to two generations of normoxia. In hyperoxia, flies evolved larger body sizes. Maximal fly mass was reached during the first generation of return from hyperoxia to normoxia. Our results suggest that higher oxygen levels could cause invertebrate species to evolve larger average sizes, rather than simply permitting evolution of giant species.

AB  - 1. The effects of environmental temperature on components of insect flight determine life-history traits, fitness, adaptability and, ultimately, organism ecosystem functional roles. Despite the crucial role of flying insects across landscapes, our understanding of how temperature affects insect flight performance remains limited.
   2. Many insect pollinators are considered under threat from climatic warming. Quantifying the relationship between temperature and behavioural performance traits allows us to understand where species are operating in respect to their thermal limits, helping predict responses to projected temperature increases and/or erratic weather events.
   3. Using a tethered flight mill, we quantify how flight performance of a widespread bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, varies over a temperature range (12-30 degrees C). Given that body mass constrains insect mobility and behaviour, bumblebees represent a useful system to study temperature-mediated size dependence of flight performance owing to the large intra-colony variation in worker body size they exhibit.
   4. Workers struggled to fly over a few hundred metres at the lowest tested temperature of 12 degrees C; however, flight endurance increased as temperatures rose, peaking around 25 degrees C after which it declined. Our findings further revealed variation in flight capacity across the workforce, with larger workers flying further, longer, and faster than their smaller nestmates. Body mass was also positively related with the likelihood of flight, although importantly this relationship became stronger as temperatures cooled, such that at 12 degrees C only the largest workers were successful fliers. Our study thus highlights that colony foraging success under variable thermal environments can be dependent on the body mass distribution of constituent workers, and more broadly suggests smaller-bodied insects may benefit disproportionately more from warming than larger-bodied ones in terms of flight performance.
   5. By incorporating both flight endurance and likelihood of flight, we calculated a simple metric termed 'temperature-mediated foraging potential' to gain a clearer understanding of how temperature may constrain colony foraging. Of our tested temperatures, 27 degrees C supported the highest potential, indicating that for much of the range of this species, higher mean daily temperatures as forecasted under climate warming will push colonies closer to their thermal optimum for flight. Subsequently, warming may have positive implications for bumblebee foraging returns and pollination provision.

AB  - Metabolism shapes the ecosystem role of organisms by dictating their energy demand and nutrient recycling potential. Metabolic theory (MTE) predicts consumer metabolic and recycling rates will rise with warming, especially if body size declines, but it ignores potential for adaptation. We measured metabolic and nutrient excretion rates of individuals from populations of a globally invasive fish that colonized sites spanning a wide temperature range (19-37 degrees C) on two continents within the last 100yr. Fish body size declined across our temperature gradient and MTE predicted large rises in population energy demand and nutrient recycling. However, we found that the allometry and temperature dependency of metabolism varied in a countergradient pattern with local temperature in a way that offset predictions of MTE. Scaling of nutrient excretion was more variable and did not track temperature. Our results suggest that adaptation can reduce the metabolic cost of warming, increasing the prospects for population persistence under extreme warming scenarios.

AB  - Stress tolerance and adaptation to stress are known to facilitate species invasions. Many invasive species are also pests and insecticides are used to control them, which could shape their overall tolerance to stress. It is well-known that heavy insecticide usage leads to selection of resistant genotypes but less is known about potential effects of mild sublethal insecticide usage. We studied whether stressful, sublethal pyrethroid insecticide exposure has within-generational and/or maternal transgenerational effects on fitness-related traits in the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) and whether maternal insecticide exposure affects insecticide tolerance of offspring. Sublethal insecticide stress exposure had positive within-and transgenerational effects. Insecticide-stressed larvae had higher adult survival and higher adult body mass than those not exposed to stress. Furthermore, offspring whose mothers were exposed to insecticide stress had higher larval and pupal survival and were heavier as adults (only females) than those descending from control mothers. Maternal insecticide stress did not explain differences in lipid content of the offspring. To conclude, stressful insecticide exposure has positive transgenerational fitness effects in the offspring. Therefore, unsuccessful insecticide control of invasive pest species may lead to undesired side effects since survival and higher body mass are known to facilitate population growth and invasion success.

AB  - Early developmental stages of cold-adapted ectotherms such as brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are at higher risk of mortality with increasing water temperatures. To determine the amount of variation present in early life, which may allow for potential adaptation to increasing temperature, we examined the routine metabolic rates (RMR) of wild-origin brook trout embryos and alevins reared at normal (5 degrees C) and elevated (9 degrees C) temperatures. The experiment was structured to examine variation in RMR within and among several levels of biological organization (family, population and ancestral type (native vs. mixed ancestry)). As expected, family and temperature variables were most important for predicting RMR and body mass, although population-level differences also existed when family was excluded for more detailed analysis. Additionally, body mass strongly influenced RMR at all life stages except for eyed embryos. When family identity was removed from the analysis, population became the most significant variable. Variation in RMR and mass within and among populations may indicate existing adaptive potential within and among brook trout populations to respond to predicted warming under climate change scenarios.

AB  - Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) has often been argued to be a physiological defense against obesity, but no empirical proof of its effectiveness in limiting human body weight gain is available. We here propose an immune explanation of DIT-i.e., that it results from the coevolution of host and gut microbiota (especially Firmicutes) that ferment ingested food and proliferate, causing periodic, vagally mediated increases in thermogenesis aimed at curtailing their expansion. Because of this evolutionary adaptive significance related to the immune system, DIT is not effective as an "adaptation'' to maintain a certain body mass. Were DIT an effective adaptation to prevent obesity, the current obesity epidemic might not have occurred.

AB  - Trap-building predators remain under strong selection from thermal microenvironments. To address how soil temperature and body size affect trap building, we conducted a laboratory experiment using larvae of the antlion Myrmeleon bore at six ecologically relevant temperatures. Larger larvae built larger traps, and warmer soil led to more and larger traps. Body mass did not alter the dependence of trap building on temperature. Our results suggest that the physiological capacity of antlion larvae, which is affected by larval size and body temperature, is the major determinant of trap building. This effect should be considered when assessing interactions between antlions and prey.

AB  - Climate change can drive evolution. This connection is clear both historically and in modern times. The three-lesson curriculum described below provides opportunities for students to make connections between climate change and evolution through various modes of inquiry and self-investigation. Students examine how genetic variation may either facilitate or limit the ability for species to survive changing climates through work with the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Students are asked to layer new understanding of the mechanisms of evolution onto their observations of genetic variation in fruit fly thermotolerance, and then synthesize this information to make predictions regarding the survival of species threatened by climate change.

AB  - We measured metabolic rates of adult male Drosophila melanogaster allowed to evolve in the laboratory at 18 and 25 degrees C and compared these with measurements of metabolic rates of flies collected along a latitudinal gradient in Australia. Metabolic rates of flies that had evolved in the laboratory at low temperature were 5-7% higher than those of flies allowed to evolve at high temperature. Metabolic rates of field collected increased with latitude when measured at 18 degrees C but not at higher temperature (25 degrees C) and were about 9% greater in high latitude (similar to 41'00) flies than low latitude (16'53) flies. Metabolic rate was strongly influenced by measurement temperature; estimated Q(10)s ranged from 1.79 to 2.5 for measurements made at 18 and 25 degrees C. Metabolic rate scaled isometrically with body mass; the estimated slope of a In-in regression of metabolic rate and body mass was 1.03 +/- 0.1. We used our measures of metabolic rate and activity to estimate the minimum cost of transport (MCOT) while walking. The estimates of MCOT have high standard errors (lab, 34.30 +/- 14.2 mi O(2)/g/km; and field, 38.0 +/- 17.0 mi O(2)/g/km); however, they differ by only 3-9% from predicted values based on allometric relationships reported in the literature.

AB  - The nesting ecology of the Allen Cays rock iguana was studied on Leaf Cay and Southwest Allen's Cay (= U Cay) in the northern Exuma Islands, Bahamas, during 2001 and 2002. Mating occured in mid-May, and females migrated 30-173 m to potential nest sites in mid to late June. Females often abandoned initial attempts at digging nest burrows, and average time from initiation of the final burrow to completion of a covered nest was six days. At least some females completely buried themselves within the burrow during the final stages of burrow construction and oviposition. Females defended the burrow site during the entire time of construction, and most continued that defense for at least three to four weeks after nest completion. Nests were completed between mid-June and mid-July, but for unknown reasons timing was seven days earlier on U Cay than on Leaf Cay. Nest burrows averaged 149 cur in length and terminal nest chambers usually angled off the main burrow. Depth to the bottom of the egg chamber averaged 28 cm, and was inversely correlated with shadiness of the site, suggesting that females may select depths with preferred temperatures (mean, 31.4 C in this study). Overall, only about one in three females nested each year, although nesting frequency increased with female size such that the largest females usually nest annually. Nest fidelity was common, despite the potential for observer effects; seven of 13 two-year nesters placed nests within 0.7 m of that constructed the previous year.
   Nesting females averaged 32 cm snout-vent length (SVL) and 1.336 g body mass, and larger, older females nested earlier than smaller, younger ones. Sexual maturity is reached at 26-27 cm SVL, about 750 g body mass, and twelve years of age (nearly twice as old as any previously studied lizard). Longevity of females apparently exceeds 40 years. Clutch size ranged from 1-10 eggs (mean 4.6) and was correlated with female body size and age. Eggs averaged 66 mm in length, 35 mm in width, and 49 g in mass, Egg mass was not correlated with female body size, although egg length was negatively correlated, and egg width was positively correlated with female size. The production of elongate eggs in the smaller females allowed them to invest the same total mass in each egg as a larger female, while being constrained by the limits of the pelvic opening. No trade-off existed between standardized clutch size versus egg size. Relative clutch mass (clutch mass/gravid female body mass X 100) averaged 16.5 and did not vary with female size or age. Hatching apparently occurs in late September and early October after about 80-85 days incubation, with emergence within just a few days. Hatchlings averaged 9.5 cm SVL and 33 g body mass. Survivorship, to emergence was 78.9%, and was inversely correlated with soil moisture.
   The reproductive ecology of other iguanids (sensu strictu) is reviewed for comparison with that of the Allen Cays rock iguana. Comparisons of these data with those available for other rock iguanas of the genus Cyclura suggest that colonization of smaller islands has produced reductions in adult female body size, clutch size, clutch mass, and relative clutch mass, but no change in egg or hatchling mass. Because this pattern is also demonstrated by a population of Cuban iguanas introduced to a small island only 40 years ago, it may primarily be a proximal response to decreased resource availability and/or physiological processability on small islands rather than an evolved response to reduced predation rates or other factors affecting survivorship.

AB  - Climate change is imposing intensified and novel selection pressures on organisms by altering abiotic and biotic environmental conditions on Earth, but studies demonstrating genetic adaptation to climate change mediated selection are still scarce. Evidence is accumulating to indicate that both genetic and ecological constrains may often limit populations' abilities to adapt to large scale effects of climate warming. These constraints may predispose many organisms to respond to climate change with range shifts and phenotypic plasticity, rather than through evolutionary adaptation. In general, broad conclusions about the role of evolutionary adaptation in mitigating climate change induced fitness loss in the wild are as yet difficult to make.

AB  - Changes in global temperature and humidity as a result of climate change are producing rapid evolutionary changes in many animal species, including agricultural pests and disease vectors, leading to changes in allele frequencies of genes involved in thermotolerance and desiccation resistance. As some of these genes have pleiotropic effects on insecticide resistance, climate change is likely to affect insecticide resistance in the field. In this review, we discuss how the interactions between adaptation to climate change and resistance to insecticides can affect insecticide resistance in the field using examples in phytophagous and hematophagous pest insects, focusing on the effects of increased temperature and increased aridity. We then use detailed genetic and mechanistic studies in the model insect, Drosophila melanogaster, to explain the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. We suggest that tradeoffs or facilitation between adaptation to climate change and resistance to insecticides can alter insecticide resistance allele frequencies in the field. The dynamics of these interactions will need to be considered when managing agricultural pests and disease vectors in a changing climate. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - Both the slope and elevation of scaling relationships between log metabolic rate and log body size vary taxonomically and in relation to physiological or developmental state, ecological lifestyle and environmental conditions. Here I discuss how the recently proposed metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis (MLBH) provides a useful conceptual framework for explaining and predicting much, but not all of this variation. This hypothesis is based on three major assumptions: (1) various processes related to body volume and surface area exert state-dependent effects on the scaling slope for metabolic rate in relation to body mass; (2) the elevation and slope of metabolic scaling relationships are linked; and (3) both intrinsic (anatomical, biochemical and physiological) and extrinsic (ecological) factors can affect metabolic scaling. According to the MLBH, the diversity of metabolic scaling relationships occurs within physical boundary limits related to body volume and surface area. Within these limits, specific metabolic scaling slopes can be predicted from the metabolic level (or scaling elevation) of a species or group of species. In essence, metabolic scaling itself scales with metabolic level, which is in turn contingent on various intrinsic and extrinsic conditions operating in physiological or evolutionary time. The MLBH represents a "meta-mechanism" or collection of multiple, specific mechanisms that have contingent, state-dependent effects. As such, the MLBH is Darwinian in approach (the theory of natural selection is also meta-mechanistic), in contrast to currently influential metabolic scaling theory that is Newtonian in approach (i.e., based on unitary deterministic laws). Furthermore, the MLBH can be viewed as part of a more general theory that includes other mechanisms that may also affect metabolic scaling.

AB  - We maintained pregnant Sphenomorphus indicus under four thermal conditions for the whole gestation period to assess the effects of gestation temperature on offspring phenotypes. Parturition occurred between late June and early August, with females at high body temperatures giving birth earlier than those maintained at low body temperatures. Litter size, litter mass, and postpartum body mass did not differ among treatments, and females with relatively higher fecundity produced smaller offspring. Females gave birth to predominantly female offspring (85.7% of the 14 sexed offspring were females) at 24 degrees C and to predominantly male offspring (76.5% of the 17 sexed offspring were males) at 28 degrees C. Females with the opportunity to regulate body temperature produced a mix of sexes that did not differ from equality. Offspring produced in different treatments differed in head size, hind-limb length, and tympanum length, but not in snout-vent length, tail length, body mass, fore-limb length, and eye length. Offspring produced at 28 degrees C were not only smaller in head size, but also shorter in hind-limb length and tympanum length than those offspring produced at lower temperatures. Offspring produced at 28 degrees C performed more poorly in the racetrack and grew more slowly than offspring produced in the other three treatments. Taken together, our results show that S. indicus might be a temperature-dependent sex determination species and that offspring phenotypes are impaired at high gestation temperatures but maximized at relatively low gestation temperatures.

AB  - The sable (Martes zibellina) is widely distributed in the northern zone of Eurasia. M. zibellina survival requires a better ability to regulate its body temperature than southern-distributed marten species. The genetic basis underlying the adaptive fat mechanism in the sable is unclear. We screened candidate genes related to lipid metabolism and absorption and compared these with orthologous sequences from other carnivores. Our goal was to determine the molecular mechanism underlying the thinner fur layer and determine if the cold adaptation of sables is associated with evolutionary changes in these genes. We found that the PNLIP and ACSS2 genes have received positive selection and the GOT2 gene has undergone rapid evolution. We performed comparative transcriptome sequencing of the sable adipose tissue and found multiple genes with different expression levels. GO enrichment analysis on the differentially expressed genes showed that they were significantly enriched in GO entries, such as lipid metabolism, lipase activity, and glucose metabolism. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways and fatty acid metabolism pathways, indicating significant differences in the metabolic level of adipose tissue in winter and summer.

AB  - While geographic trait variation along environmental clines is widespread, associated patterns in sexual selection remain largely unexplored. Geographic patterns in sexual selection may be expected if 1) phenotypes vary geographically and sexual selection is dependent on the local phenotypes in the population, and if 2) sexual selection is influenced by geographically structured environmental conditions. We quantified geographic variation in flight-related traits and flight performance in mated and unmated males and tested for geographic variation in sexual selection on these traits in the poleward range-expanding damselfly Coenagrion scitulum across a set of eleven core and edge populations ordered along thermal gradients in the larval and in the adult stage. We found little support for trait differentiation between core and edge populations, instead we found considerable geographic trait variation along the larval and adult thermal gradients. As expected under time constraints, body mass decreased with shorter larval growth seasons. Lower temperatures during the adult flight period were associated with a higher body mass, a higher flight speed and a higher fat content; these traits likely evolved to buffer flight ability at suboptimal temperatures and to optimize starvation resistance. Across the large geographic scale, we found a consistent higher flight duration in mated males. Instead, sexual selection for higher fat content was stronger in populations with lower adult flight temperatures and sexual selection for lower body mass acted only in edge populations. Our results indicate sexual selection on flight performance to be consistent over a large geographic scale and this despite the clear geographic patterns in sexual selection on the underlying morphological traits. Our results highlight that to fully understand the fitness implications of geographically changing trait patterns, researchers should consider the entire phenotype-performance-fitness axis and incorporate effects of geographically structured life-stage specific environmental conditions on this axis.

AB  - Icefishes of the perciform suborder Notothenioidei dominate the Antarctic ichthyofauna. These species originated from a benthic ancestor and do not possess a swimbladder. However, some notothenioids have achieved neutral buoyancy through skeletal reductions as well as storage of lipids to reduce body mass relative to seawater. These adaptations enable them to exploit the highly productive pelagic realm. Mobilizing these lipid reserves in periods of critically low food intake may lead to buoyancy problems. Accumulating and conserving these reserves may slow down the development of somatic and reproductive tissues and hence future reproductive output. We constructed a dynamic state variable model to investigate how ingested energy is partitioned over 3 state variables: lipid reserves, structural protein body mass and egg development. Two forms of the model differed in that lipid reserves were either included in or excluded from the total metabolic energy budget of an individual. The model was parameterised for the Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum, a key species in the pelagic food web of the high Antarctic zone of the Southern Ocean. In Pleuragramma, lipids are stored in unique extracellular lipid sacs, which are thought to serve as buoyancy aids and energy reserves. The model predicts optimal habitat selection and an optimal energy allocation strategy by maximizing future reproductive output. The environment is simulated using vertical gradients in water temperature, optical properties, food availability and predation risk. The form of the model that considers lipids as metabolically inactive reserves best replicates field measurements of fat content and yields high values for fitness in Pleuragramma. Uncoupling fat reserves from metabolism, through the development of extracellular lipid sacs, probably represents a key adaptation in the evolution towards a pelagic lifestyle in a fish species with a low scope for activity.

AB  - Urbanization involves a cocktail of human-induced rapid environmental changes and is forecasted to gain further importance. Urban-heat-island effects result in increased metabolic costs expected to drive shifts towards smaller body sizes. However, urban environments are also characterized by strong habitat fragmentation, often selecting for dispersal phenotypes. Here, we investigate to what extent, and at which spatial scale(s), urbanization drives body size shifts in macro-mothsan insect group characterized by positive size-dispersal linksat both the community and intraspecific level. Using light and bait trapping as part of a replicated, spatially nested sampling design, we show that despite the observed urban warming of their woodland habitat, macro-moth communities display considerable increases in community-weighted mean body size because of stronger filtering against small species along urbanization gradients. Urbanization drives intraspecific shifts towards increased body size too, at least for a third of species analysed. These results indicate that urbanization drives shifts towards larger, and hence, more mobile species and individuals in order to mitigate low connectivity of ecological resources in urban settings. Macro-moths are a key group within terrestrial ecosystems, and since body size is central to species interactions, such urbanization-driven phenotypic change may impact urban ecosystem functioning, especially in terms of nocturnal pollination and food web dynamics. Although we show that urbanization's size-biased filtering happens simultaneously and coherently at both the inter- and intraspecific level, we demonstrate that the impact at the community level is most pronounced at the 800 m radius scale, whereas species-specific size increases happen at local and landscape scales (50-3,200m radius), depending on the species. Hence, measuressuch as creating and improving urban green infrastructureto mitigate the effects of urbanization on body size will have to be implemented at multiple spatial scales in order to be most effective.

AB  - Forecasts of species range shifts as a result of climate change are essential, because invasions by exotic species shape biodiversity and therefore ecosystem functions and services. Ecologists have focused on propagule pressure (for example, the number of individuals and invasion events), the characteristics of an invading species, and its new abiotic and biotic environment to predict the likelihood of range expansion and invasion. Here, we emphasize the role of photoperiodic response on the range expansion of species. Unlike temperature, the latitudinal gradient of seasonal changes in day length is a stable, abiotic environmental factor that does not change with local or global climate. Predicting range expansions across latitudes and the subsequent consequences for native communities requires a more comprehensive understanding of how species use day length to coordinate seasonal growth, reproduction, physiology and synchronization of life cycles with interacting individuals and species.

AB  - Salinity conditions in oyster breeding grounds in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to drastically change due to increased precipitation from climate change and anthropogenic changes to local hydrology. We determined the capacity of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, to adapt via standing genetic variation or acclimate through transgenerational plasticity (TGP). We outplanted oysters to either a low- or medium-salinity site in Louisiana for 2 years. We then crossed adult parents using a North Carolina II breeding design, and measured body size and survival of larvae 5 dpf raised under low or ambient salinity. We found that TGP is unlikely to significantly contribute to low-salinity tolerance since we did not observe increased growth or survival in offspring reared in low salinity when their parents were also acclimated at a low-salinity site. However, we detected genetic variation for body size, with an estimated heritability of 0.68 +/- 0.25 (95% CI). This suggests there is ample genetic variation for this trait to evolve, and that evolutionary adaptation is a possible mechanism through which oysters will persist with future declines in salinity. The results of this experiment provide valuable insights into successfully breeding low-salinity tolerance in this commercially important species.

AB  - As the air temperature of the Earth rises, ecological relationships within a community might shift, in part due to differences in the thermal physiology of species. Prediction of these shifts - an urgent task for ecologists - will be complicated if thermal tolerance itself can rapidly evolve. Here, we employ a mechanistic approach to predict the potential for rapid evolution of thermal tolerance in the intertidal limpet Lottia gigantea. Using biophysical principles to predict body temperature as a function of the state of the environment, and an environmental bootstrap procedure to predict how the environment fluctuates through time, we create hypothetical time-series of limpet body temperatures, which are in turn used as a test platform for a mechanistic evolutionary model of thermal tolerance. Our simulations suggest that environmentally driven stochastic variation of L.. gigantea body temperature results in rapid evolution of a substantial 'safety margin' : the average lethal limit is 5-7 degrees C above the average annual maximum temperature. This predicted safety margin approximately matches that found in nature, and once established is sufficient, in our simulations, to allow some limpet populations to survive a drastic, century-long increase in air temperature. By contrast, in the absence of environmental stochasticity, the safety margin is dramatically reduced. We suggest that the risk of exceeding the safety margin, rather than the absolute value of the safety margin, plays an underappreciated role in the evolution of thermal tolerance. Our predictions are based on a simple, hypothetical, allelic model that connects genetics to thermal physiology. To move beyond this simple model - and thereby potentially to predict differential evolution among populations and among species - will require significant advances in our ability to translate the details of thermal histories into physiological and population-genetic consequences.

AB  - Phenotypic adjustments following environmental change are ubiquitous, and trait changes arising through phenotypic plasticity often lag behind their environmental stimuli. Evolutionary biologists seeking to understand how adaptive plasticity can evolve have extensively studied this phenomenon. However, the ecological consequences of common features of plastic responses to environmental variability, including gradual phenotypic change (i.e., slower than the pace of environmental change), are underappreciated. We present a framework based on the unifying concept of phenotype x environment performance landscapes that encompasses gradual plasticity. Then, we experimentally investigate the environmental contexts where gradual plasticity is important, using freshwater phytoplankton populations exposed to thermal variation. Finally, based on our conceptual framework, we develop a mathematical model of gradual plasticity that explains population dynamics in variable environments better than common alternative models. Understanding and accounting for the ecological effects of plasticity in variable environments is critical to making vital predictions and advancing ecology.

AB  - A wide variety of animals show latitudinal cline in body size, which can be caused not only by abiotic factors such as temperature but also by biotic ones such as diet quality. In seed feeding insects, adult body size is affected by seed size. Therefore, seed size may be an important factor to explain the latitudinal cline in body size if the seed size also shows a latitudinal cline. In the present study, we detected a latitudinal cline in body size of an alien bruchid, Acanthoscelides pallidipennis, which was introduced into Japan from North America with its host plant Amorpha fruticosa. In 13 out of 24 populations that we collected in Japan, A. fruticosa seeds were infested with A. pallidipennis. Both body size of A. pallidipennis and host seed weight increased with latitude in the infested populations, but not in the non-infested populations. There was a significant positive correlation between body size and seed weight in both field observation and laboratory experiment. In a common environmental condition, there was no significant difference in body size among three latitudinally different populations. Our results show that the latitudinal cline in adult body size of A. pallidipennis across a non-native range could be explained by the latitudinal cline in seed weight of A. fruticosa, but not by genetic differentiation among populations.

AB  - Many collapsed fish populations have failed to recover after a decade or more with little fishing. This may reflect evolutionary change in response to the highly selective mortality imposed by fisheries. Recent experimental work has demonstrated a rapid genetic change in growth rate in response to size-selective harvesting of laboratory fish populations. Here, we use a 30-year time-series of back-calculated lengths-at-age to test for a genetic response to size-selective mortality in the wild in a heavily exploited population of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Controlling for the effects of density- and temperature-dependent growth, the change in mean length of 4-year-old cod between offspring and their parental cohorts was positively correlated with the estimated selection differential experienced by the parental cohorts between this age and spawning. This result supports the hypothesis that there have been genetic changes in growth in this population in response to size-selective fishing. Such changes may account for the continued small size-at-age in this population despite good conditions for growth and little fishing for over a decade. This study highlights the need for management regimes that take into account the evolutionary consequences of fishing.

AB  - Metabolic enzyme activities of muscle tissue have been useful and widely-applied indicators of whole animal metabolic capacity, particularly in inaccessible systems such as the deep sea. Previous studies have been conducted at atmospheric pressure, regardless of organism habitat depth. However, maximum reaction rates of some of these enzymes are pressure dependent, complicating the use of metabolic enzyme activities as proxies of metabolic rates. Here, we show pressure-related rate changes in lactate and malate dehydrogenase (LDH, MDH) and pyruvate kinase (PK) in six fish species (2 hadal, 2 abyssal, 2 shallow). LDH maximal reaction rates decreased with pressure for the two shallow species, but, in contrast to previous findings, it increased for the four deep species, suggesting evolutionary changes in LDH reaction volumes. MDH maximal reaction rates increased with pressure in all species (up to 51 +/- 10% at 60 MPa), including the tide pool snailfish, Liparis florae (activity increase at 60 MPa 44 +/- 9%), suggesting an inherent negative volume change of the reaction. PK was inhibited by pressure in all species tested, including the hadal liparids (up to 34 +/- 3% at 60 MPa), suggesting a positive volume change during the reaction. The addition of 400 mM TMAO counteracted this inhibition at both 0.5 and 2.0 mM ADP concentrations for the hadal liparid, Notoliparis kermadecensis. We revisit depth-related trends in metabolic enzyme activities according to these pressure-related rate changes and new data from seven abyssal and hadal species from the Kermadec and Mariana trenches. Results show that, with abyssal and hadal species, pressure-related rate changes are another variable to be considered in the use of enzyme activities as proxies for metabolic rate, in addition to factors such as temperature and body mass. Intraspecific increases in tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes with depth of capture, independent of body mass, in two hadal snailfishes suggest improved nutritional condition for individuals deeper in the hadal zone, likely related to food availability. These new data inform the discussion of factors controlling metabolism in the deep sea, including the visual interactions hypothesis and extend published trends to the planet's deepest-living fishes.

AB  - 1. Selected body temperatures of female lizards, Sceloporus jarrovi, were measured on a photothermal gradient during late pregnancy and again when postpartum, and pregnant females were subjected to one of three fluctuating temperature regimes that simulated body temperatures of (1) pregnant females, (2) postpartum females or (3) allowed normal thermoregulation.
   2. Overall, females selected lower body temperatures when pregnant (mean = 32.0 degrees C) than when postpartum (mean = 33.5 degrees C).
   3. Females regulated body temperature more precisely when pregnant than when postpartum as judged by their smaller variances in body temperature throughout the day.
   4. When pregnant, females selected a lower mean maximum body temperature (mean: pregnant = 32.8 degrees C; postpartum = 34.5 degrees C) than when postpartum, but selected mean minimum body temperatures did not differ.
   5. None of the experimental temperature treatments was detrimental to pregnant females. Female body length increased during pregnancy but the rate of increase did not differ among treatments. Moreover, length-adjusted body mass of postpartum females did not differ among treatments.
   6. Pregnant females that experienced postpartum body temperatures produced neonates that were smaller in body mass and length than pregnant females that experienced pregnant body temperatures and females that were allowed to thermoregulate.
   7. For neonates resulting from the postpartum body temperature treatment, the disparity in the body length, but not mass, was still observed at 9 days of age, although survival and growth of neonates was high and did not differ among treatments.
   8. The results demonstrate that pregnant females could maintain higher postpartum body temperatures without compromising their physical condition, but select relatively low body temperatures, presumably to avoid decrements in offspring fitness.

AB  - Dams and other anthropogenic barriers have caused global ecological and hydrological upheaval in the blink of the geological eye. In the present article, we synthesize 307 studies in a systematic review of contemporary evolution following reduced connectivity and habitat alteration on freshwater fishes. Genetic diversity loss was more commonly observed for small populations impounded in small habitat patches for many generations behind low-passability barriers. Studies show that impoundments can cause rapid adaptive evolution in migration timing, behavior, life history, temperature tolerance, and morphology, as well as reduce phenotypic variance, which can alter adaptive potential and ecological roles. Fish passage structures can restore migratory populations but also create artificial selection pressures on body size and migration. The accelerating pace of dam removals and the paucity of data for fishes other than salmonids, other vertebrates, invertebrates, and tropical and southern hemisphere organisms highlights the urgent need for more studies on the rapid evolutionary effects of dams.

AB  - Seven species in three species groups (Decim, Cassini and Decula) of periodical cicadas (Magicicada) occupy a wide latitudinal range in the eastern United States. To clarify how adult body size, a key trait affecting fitness, varies geographically with climate conditions and life cycle, we analysed the relationships of population mean head width to geographic variables (latitude, longitude, altitude), habitat annual mean temperature (AMT), life cycle and species differences. Within species, body size was larger in females than males and decreased with increasing latitude (and decreasing habitat AMT), following the converse Bergmann's rule. For the pair of recently diverged 13- and 17-year species in each group, 13-year cicadas were equal in size or slightly smaller on average than their 17-year counterparts despite their shorter developmental time. This fact suggests that, under the same climatic conditions, 17-year cicadas have lowered growth rates compared to their 13-years counterparts, allowing 13-year cicadas with faster growth rates to achieve body sizes equivalent to those of their 17-year counterparts at the same locations. However, in the Decim group, which includes two 13-year species, the more southerly, anciently diverged 13-year species (Magicicada tredecim) was characterized by a larger body size than the other, more northerly 13- and 17-year species, suggesting that local adaptation in warmer habitats may ultimately lead to evolution of larger body sizes. Our results demonstrate how geographic clines in body size may be maintained in sister species possessing different life cycles.

AB  - Body size and temperature are the two most important variables affecting nearly all biological rates and times, especially individual growth or production rates. By favoring an optimal maturation age and reproductive allocation, natural selection links individual growth to the mortality schedule. A recent model for evolution of life histories for species with indeterminate growth, which includes most fish, successfully predicts the numeric values of two key dimensionless numbers and the allometry of the average reproductive allocation versus maturation size across species. Here we use this new model to predict the relationships of age-at-maturity, adult mortality and reproductive effort to environmental temperature and maturation size across species. Age-at-maturity, adult mortality and the proportion of the body mass given to reproduction per year are predicted to show +/-0.25 power allometries with mass at maturity, and an exponential (Boltzmann) temperature dependence. Temperature is assumed to affect only body size growth, so the temperature linkages of maturation, mortality and reproductive effort are indirect via life history optimization; this is briefly contrasted with the idea that (for example) temperature directly affects mortality.

AB  - This special issue of Evolutionary Applications comprises 15 papers that illustrate how evolutionary principles can inform the conservation and management of salmonid fishes. Several papers address the past evolutionary history of salmonids to gain insights into their likely plastic and genetic responses to future environmental change. The remaining papers consider potential evolutionary responses to climate warming, biological invasions, artificial propagation, habitat alteration, and harvesting. All of these papers consider how such influences might alter selective regimes, which should then favour plastic or genetic responses. Some of the papers then go on to document such responses, at least some of which are genetically based and adaptive. Despite the different approaches and target species, all of the papers argue for the importance of evolutionary considerations in the conservation and management of salmonids.

AB  - Genetic adaptation to temperature change can impact responses of populations and communities to global warming. Here we integrate previously published results on experimental evolution trials with follow-up experiments involving the water flea Daphnia as a model system. Our research shows (1) the capacity of natural populations of this species to genetically adapt to changes in temperature in a time span of months to years, (2) the context-dependence of these genetic changes, emphasizing the role of ecology and community composition on evolutionary responses to climatic change, and (3) the impact of micro-evolutionary changes on immigration success of preadapted genotypes. Our study involves (1) experimental evolution trials in the absence and presence of the community of competitors, predators, and parasites, (2) life-table and competition experiments to assess the fitness consequences of micro-evolution, and (3) competition experiments with putative immigrant genotypes. We use these observations as building blocks of an evolving metacommunity to understand biological responses to climatic change. This approach integrates both local and regional responses at both the population and community levels. Finally, we provide an outline of current gaps in knowledge and suggest fruitful avenues for future research.

AB  - Introduced species frequently undergo rapid evolutionary change in ecologically important traits that may strongly influence their performance in their introduced range. But for many introduced species, and particularly those in marine systems, the spatial and temporal dimensions of this evolutionary change are largely unknown. In this study, I conducted a common garden transplant experiment using replicate clones of an introduced tunicate, Botrylloides sp., collected from three sites in the southern Gulf of Maine to test for differential growth and survival in response to local thermal regimes. This species has a restricted larval development period, which may permit significant population differentiation over relatively small spatial scales. I found dramatic among-site differences in survival rates: tunicates collected from both the transplant site and from a distant northern site had high survival, while those collected from a southern site experienced 100% mortality. The most likely cause of this differential mortality was an anomalous upwelling event that produced some of the coldest mid-summer temperatures in the last 10 years based on NOAA weather buoy data. I also found significant differences in growth rates among sites as well as among clones within a site in comparison with growth-rate differences within clones. An estimate of broad-sense heritability based on these data was consistent with a genetic basis for among-site differences in growth rates, which were strongly predictive of subsequent mortality. I conclude that this species has undergone significant evolutionary change that has resulted in population differentiation with respect to temperature tolerances among sites separated by < 60 km.

AB  - Although there is considerable optimism surrounding adaptive evolutionary responses to global change, relatively little attention has been paid to maladaptation in this context. In this review, we consider how global change might lead populations to become maladapted. We further consider how populations can evolve to new optima, fail to evolve and therefore remain maladapted, or become further maladapted through trait-driven or eco-evo-driven mechanisms after being displaced from their fitness optima. Our goal is to stimulate thinking about evolution as a "double-edged sword" that comprises both adaptive and maladaptive responses, rather than as a "silver bullet" or a purely adaptive mechanism to combat global change. We conclude by discussing how a better appreciation of environmentally driven maladaptation and maladaptive responses might improve our current understanding of population responses to global change and our ability to forecast future responses.

AB  - Body size is a key functional trait that is predicted to decline under warming. Warming is known to cause size declines via phenotypic plasticity, but evolutionary responses of body size to warming are poorly understood. To test for warming-induced evolutionary responses of body size and growth rates, we used populations of mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) recently established (less than 100 years) from a common source across a strong thermal gradient (19-33 degrees C) created by geothermal springs. Each spring is remarkably stable in temperature and is virtually closed to gene flow from other thermal environments. Field surveys show that with increasing site temperature, body size distributions become smaller and the reproductive advantage of larger body size decreases. After common rearing to reveal recently evolved trait differences, warmer-source populations expressed slowed juvenile growth rates and increased reproductive effort at small sizes. These results are consistent with an adaptive basis of the plastic temperature-size rule, and they suggest that temperature itself can drive the evolution of countergradient variation in growth rates. The rapid evolution of reduced juvenile growth rates and greater reproduction at a small size should contribute to substantial body downsizing in populations, with implications for population dynamics and for ecosystems in a warming world.

AB  - Predicting the potential effects of changes in climate on freshwater species requires an understanding of the relationships between physiological traits and environmental conditions among populations. While water temperature is a primary factor regulating metabolic rates in freshwater ectotherms, how metabolic rates vary across the species range is unclear. In addition, photoperiod has also been hypothesised to influence metabolic rates in freshwater taxa based on seasonal changes in activity rates. Using an experimental approach, we investigated whether variation in routine metabolic rate (RMR) and sensitivity of RMR to changes in temperature are correlated with local thermal regimes, photoperiods and body mass among ten populations across the geographic range of the Bluntnose minnow (Pimephales notatus), a North American freshwater fish species. Routine metabolic rate data were collected from populations acclimatised to three temperature treatments (9, 18 and 27 degrees C) and correlated with water temperature and photoperiod estimates at collection locations for each population. Routine metabolic rate was negatively correlated with minimum photoperiod at 9 degrees C, negatively correlated with weekly high temperature at 18 degrees C and positively correlated with weekly high temperature at 27 degrees C. Body mass was also a predictor of RMR at each temperature treatment. Thermal sensitivity of RMR was positively correlated with weekly high temperature, indicating that individuals from warmer low latitude populations experienced greater sensitivity of RMR to changes in temperature than individuals from cooler high latitude populations. These results indicate differential responses among populations to variation in temperature and suggest the importance of recognising this variation when characterising responses of freshwater taxa to increases in water temperature.

AB  - Diversified bet-hedging (DBH) by production of within-genotype phenotypic variance may evolve to maximize fitness in stochastic environments. Bet-hedging is generally associated with parental effects, but phenotypic variation may also develop throughout life via developmental instability (DI). This opens for the possibility of a within-generation mechanism creating DBH during the lifetime of individuals. If so, DI could in fact be a plastic trait itself; if a fluctuating environment indicates uncertainty about future conditions, sensing such fluctuations could trigger DI as a DBH response. However, this possibility has received little empirical attention. Here, we test whether fluctuating environments may elicit such a response in the clonally reproducing crustacean Daphnia magna. Specifically, we exposed genetically identical individuals to two environments of different thermal stability (stable vs. pronounced daily realistic temperature fluctuations) and tested for effects on DI in body mass and metabolic rate shortly before maturation. Furthermore, we also estimated the genetic variation in DI. Interestingly, fluctuating temperatures did not affect body mass, but metabolic rate decreased. We found no evidence for plasticity in DI in response to environmental fluctuations. The lack of plasticity was common to all genotypes, and for both traits studied. However, we found considerable evolvability for DI, which implies a general evolutionary potential for DBH under selection for increased phenotypic variance.

AB  - To evaluate the influence of host mass and environmental temperature on the evolution of body size in ticks, a comparative analysis was performed using data from 193 species. Using the 20 possible phylogenetically independent contrasts among tick species, no relationship was found between body size of female ticks and either host mass or temperature. The statistical power of these analyses was low. Within the two most speciose genera of soft ticks, however, separate cross-species analyses revealed a positive and highly significant relationship between female tick size and host mass. Also, within the two most speciose genera of hard ticks, cross-species analyses showed a positive and highly significant relationship between scutum size of female ticks and host mass. The latter correlation is based on measurements of tick body size that are independent of the level of blood engorgement. No effect of temperature was observed in the within-genera analyses. These within-genera trends may be artefacts of unknown phylogenetic relationships. Another explanation, however, is that host body mass may have influenced the evolution of tick body size.

AB  - Contemporary global change is altering ecosystems at an unprecedented pace and scale. This critical period is a crisis for biodiversity, but the perturbations caused by global environmental change also offer new opportunities to study the evolution of species boundaries-their persistence, formation, or collapse-over rapid evolutionary timescales. Increasing temperature means and fluctuations have the potential to alter gene flow between species through changes in species distributions, interactions, life history, and temperature-dependent behavior. This is particularly true for insects, whose geographic ranges, behaviors, and life history traits are temperature dependent. Here, we review the potential for climate change to influence gene flow and species boundaries between closely related insect species. We focus on studies that have tracked changes in climate and insect distributions and/or have evaluated temperature dependent reproductive barriers between species.

AB  - Past evolution determines the genetically determined available phenotypes in populations which affect ecological dynamics in communities, shaping in turn the selective pressures that further model phenotypes. Because an increase in temperature increases metabolic rates and encounter rates, climate change may have profound eco-evolutionary effects, possibly affecting the future persistence and functioning of food webs. We introduce a semi-spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) framework to study functional eco-evolutionary dynamics in food webs. Each species embedded in the web includes 13 genetically determined and multidimensionally variable traits (the G matrix), 4 of which are flexible physiological and behavioural (personality) traits that respond to temperature. An increase in temperature and stronger correlation among traits leads to stronger trophic cascades but higher stochasticity, with higher probability of extinction for some trophic levels. A combination of the abiotic (temperature) and biotic (predators' presence/absence) matrix of selective agents (the O matrix) generates differential selection for activation energies for metabolic rates and several instances of correlational selection (selection in one trait changes with the levels of another), suggesting how global warming might favour certain trait combinations. Our results and the future prospects of this IBM approach open new avenues for climate change research.

AB  - How will organisms deal with Climate change? Ectotherms such as reptiles and amphibians are especially at risk due to their metabolic ties to the environment and their general inability to migrate with changing climates over short time frames. We modeled the growth response of Three-toed Box Turtles (Terrapene carolina triunguis) to fluctuations in ambient temperature and precipitation. Then we extrapolated this model to climate conditions expected in 2100. We predict that there is less than 20% possibility of hatchling turtles growing during their first year. Reduced annual growth rates during later years may cause earlier termination of growth, smaller standard carapace lengths, and reduced fecundity. These responses are typical of those that stimulate an extinction vortex. These findings provide for a general understanding of how this species and other terrestrial reptiles may respond to climate change. Without reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we could face catastrophic declines in many ectotherms as temperature and rainfall patterns change.

AB  - Culturing experiments of the intermediate morphotype of the cosmopolitan coccolithophore Calcidiscus leptoporus, indicate that the size of its coccosphere and of its coccoliths are affected only in a minor way by temperature. The changes observed in clones growing under different temperature and light conditions are within the range defined for this morphotype in the plankton and Holocene sediments. This outcome suggests that the three morphotypes of living C. leptoporus may be reproductively isolated species rather than stages in a life cycle of a single species or ecophenotypic adaptations of a single species with considerable morphological plasticity. Numerous extinct morphotypes of C. leptoporus have been recorded from marine sediments deposited during the last approximately 25 Ma. In the light of our experiments, these may in fact represent genetically distinct species, which experienced rapid evolution.

AB  - 1. A key challenge for ecologists is to predict how single and joint effects of global warming and predation risk translate from the individual level up to ecosystem functions. Recently, stoichiometric theory linked these levels through changes in body stoichiometry, predicting that both higher temperatures and predation risk induce shifts in energy storage (increases in C-rich carbohydrates and reductions in N-rich proteins) and body stoichiometry (increases in C : N and C : P). This promising theory, however, is rarely tested and assumes that prey will divert energy away from reproduction under predation risk, while under size-selective predation, prey instead increase fecundity.
   2. We exposed the water flea Daphnia magna to 4 degrees C warming and fish predation risk to test whether C-rich carbohydrates increase and N-rich proteins decrease, and as a result, C : N and C : P increase under warming and predation risk.
   3. Unexpectedly, warming decreased body C : N, which was driven by reductions in C-rich fat and sugar contents while the protein content did not change. This reflected a trade-off where the accelerated intrinsic growth rate under warming occurred at the cost of a reduced energy storage. Warming reduced C : N less and only increased C : P and N : P in the fishperiod Daphnia. These evolved stoichiometric responses to warming were largely driven by stronger warming-induced reductions in P than in C and N and could be explained by the better ability to deal with warming in the fish-period Daphnia.
   4. In contrast to theory predictions, body C : N decreased under predation risk due to a strong increase in the N-rich protein content that offsets the increase in C-rich fat content. The higher investment in fecundity (more N-rich eggs) under predation risk contributed to this stronger increase in protein content. Similarly, the lower body C : N of pre-fish Daphnia also matched their higher fecundity.
   5. Warming and predation risk independently shaped body stoichiometry, largely by changing levels of energy storage molecules. Our results highlight that two widespread patterns, the trade-off between rapid development and energy storage and the increased investment in reproduction under size-selective predation, cause predictable deviations from current ecological stoichiometry theory.

AB  - In response to encountering abiotic extremes, many organisms exhibit stress responses as measured by levels of corticosterone and heat-shock protein (e.g., HSP70) in the blood. Such responses can enhance organismal viability. How quickly can those responses shift if the organisms encounter novel challenges, as occurs with climate change, or a species' invasion into a new area? We found elevated levels of corticosterone and HSP70 in the blood of cane toads (Rhinella marina) that were desiccated, especially at low temperatures, a response that might jeopardize survival by increasing rates of water loss. Importantly, toads from the climatically equable native range in Brazil showed twofold higher levels of these stress hormones than did toads from the climatically harsh invaded range in Australia. Thus, the toads' invasion of abiotically extreme habitats has been accompanied by a substantial down-regulation of the acute stress response. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Thingvallavatn, the largest and one of the oldest lakes in Iceland, contains four morphs of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus. Dwarf benthic (DB), large benthic (LB), planktivorous (PL) and piscivorous (PI) morphs can be distinguished and differ markedly in head morphology, colouration and maximum fork length (FLmax,), reflecting their different resource specialisations within the lake. The four morphs in Thingvallavatn are thought to have been isolated for approximately 10 000 years, since shortly after the end of the last Ice Age.
   We tested the null hypothesis that the pattern of muscle fibre recruitment was the same in all morphs, reflecting their recent diversification. The cross-sectional areas of fast and slow muscle fibres were measured at 0.7 FL in 46 DB morphs, 23 LB morphs, 24 PL morphs and 22 PI morphs, and the ages of the charr were estimated using sacculus otoliths. In fish larger than 10 g, the maximum fibre diameter scaled with body mass (M-b)(0.18) for both fibre types in all morphs. The number of myonuclei per cm fibre length increased with fibre diameter, but was similar between morphs. On average, at 60 pm diameter, there were 2264 nuclei cm(-1) in slow fibres and 1126 nuclei cm(-1) in fast fibres. The absence of fibres of diameter 4-10 mum was used to determine the FL at which muscle fibre recruitment stopped. Slow fibre number increased with body length in all morphs, scaling with b. In contrast, the recruitment of fast muscle fibres continued until a clearly identifiable FL, corresponding to 18-19 cm in the dwarf morph, 24-26 cm in the pelagic morph, 32-33 cm in the large benthic morph and 34-35 cm in the piscivorous morph. The maximum fast fibre number (FNmax) in the dwarf morph (6.97X 10(4)) was 56.5 % of-that found in the LB and PI morphs combined (1.23X10(5)) (P<0.001). Muscle fibre recruitment continued until a threshold body size and occurred at a range of ages, starting at 4+ years in the DB morph and 7+ years in the LB and PI morphs. Our null hypothesis was therefore rejected for fast muscle and it was concluded that the dwarf condition was associated with a reduction in fibre number.
   We then investigated whether variations in development temperature associated with different spawning sites and periods were responsible for the observed differences in muscle cellularity between morphs. Embryos from the DB. LB and PL morphs were incubated at temperature regimes simulating cold subterranean spring-fed sites (2.2-3.2degreesC) and the general lakebed (4-7degreesC). Myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs) were identified using specific antibodies to Paired box protein 7 (Pax 7), Forkhead box protein K1-alpha (FoxK1-alpha), MyoD and Myf-5. The progeny showed no evidence of developmental plasticity in the numbers of either MPCs or muscle fibres. Juveniles and adult stages of the DB and LB morphs coexist and have a similar diet. We therefore conclude that the reduction in FNmax, in the dwarf morph probably has a genetic basis and that gene networks regulating myotube production are under high selection pressure. To explain these findings we propose that there is an optimal fibre size. and hence number, which varies with maximum body size and reflects a trade-off between diffusional constraints on fibre diameter and the energy costs of maintaining ionic gradients. The predictions of the optimal fibre size hypothesis and its consequences for the adaptive evolution of muscle architecture in fishes are briefly discussed.

AB  - Hypoxic stress can alter conspecific phenotype and additionally alter phenotypes of the filial generation, for example, via maternal or epigenetic processes. Lasting effects can also be seen across development and generations even after stressors have been removed. This study utilized the model of rapidly developing, parthenogenetic Daphnia to examine the intraspecific variability of response of exposure of a parental generation to hypoxia (4 kPa) within a single clone line across development, across broods, and across generations. Body mass across development and reproductive output were monitored in the parental generation and the first three broods of the first filial generation (which were not directly exposed to hypoxia). O-2 consumption across a wide Po-2 range (normoxia to anoxia) was assessed to determine whether exposure of the parental generation to hypoxia conferred hypoxia tolerance on the offspring and whether this transgenerational, epigenetic phenomenon varied intraspecifically. Differences in mass occurred in both the parental generation (hypoxia-exposed smaller during brood 1 and brood 2 neonate production) and the filial generation (e. g., brood 1 and 2 neonates from hypoxic mothers were initially smaller than control neonates). However, differences in mass were not accompanied by changes in reproductive output (assessed by brood number and neonate size). At day 0, first filial generation brood 1 neonates from hypoxia-exposed mothers had a higher metabolic rate than control neonates. However, this effect, like that of body mass, dissipated with development within a brood but also with subsequent broods. An isometric scaling exponent for was repeatedly observed.

AB  - Changes in temperature alter the viscosity of fluids, which impacts the force needed to move and the diffusion rates of gases. This is particularly salient for organisms that operate at mid to low Reynolds numbers. In this study, we investigated the independent effects of changes in temperature and viscosity on oxygen consumption rates of two coastal copepods (Acartia tonsaandParvocalanus crassirostris) and used bioenergetic models to predict how these patterns could influence copepods in the natural environment. We found that only temperature influenced copepod oxygen consumption rates, indicating that copepods were not impacted by reduced oxygen diffusivity or increased energetics of movement resulting from higher seawater viscosity. We developed energy budgets based on novel respiration experiments in conjunction with data from the literature and found that cold temperatures do not result in higher scope for growth, because decreased metabolic costs are offset by reduced feeding capability. Our energy budgets imply that observed copepod temperature ranges in natural waters match theoretical ranges of optimal net carbon assimilation. At cold temperatures, feeding on motile prey yielded higher net carbon assimilation compared to feeding on non-motile prey, implying that motile prey are more favorable and may be actively selected for at cold temperatures. Finally, our models predicted thatA. tonsahad a higher maximum net carbon assimilation as a percentage of body mass, indicating that copepods that use a similar sink-and-wait feeding strategy may be better able to exploit ephemeral food sources compared to continuous-swimming copepods such asP. crassirostris.

AB  - Scan thermal processing, enabled by guidance of the heat source trajectory during fabrication, combines the flexibility of sequential methods to the productivity of parallel processes. For cylindrically symmetric parts, this is performed by their rapid revolution under a radially or axially translated torch. The source power is modulated to implement a specified thermal distribution as it sweeps the product surface, and thus to generate desirable material features. An analytical description of the thermal field, based on superposition of Green's fields, is developed for off-line analysis. Also, a multivariable model with least-squares parameter identification, is introduced for real-time compensation of the process efficiency. This model is embedded to a thermal distribution control scheme, driving the scanned torch motion and power by a simulated annealing optimization strategy. This uses temperature feedback from random surface locations by an infrared pyrometer. The thermal regulator is validated computationally and experimentally, and its applicability to other scanned processes is examined.

AB  - At the biogeographic scale, spatial variation in diets may reflect not only the ecological flexibility of carnivore feeding habits, but also evolutionary adaptations of different populations within a species. We described the large-scale pattern in brown bear Ursus arctos predation on ungulates, its selectivity for ungulate species, and its relative role in ungulate mortality. We collated data from 63 studies in Europe and Asia and analyzed them in relation to annual temperature. Ungulate meat makes up, on average, 8.7% of brown bear diets, with European bears feeding on ungulates more (mean 10.5%) than Asiatic bears (6.8%). In Europe (but not in Asia), the percentage share of ungulates in bear diet was negatively related to the mean annual temperature. Northern populations of Asian bears consumed less ungulate meat than the respective populations in Europe, because of the widespread occurrence of Siberian pine Pinus sibirica and dwarf Siberian pine Pinus pumila, which produce relatively large, protein-rich seeds. In both continents, ungulates peak in the diet of bears in spring. Brown bears' preference for 10 species of ungulates increased with body mass of prey. The bear significantly preferred preying upon moose Alces alces throughout its range. Bears were the most important predator of moose and caused, on average, 23% of total natural mortality in moose populations. Brown bear preference for moose and its dominant role in moose mortality suggest an evolutionary predator-prey relationship between these two species. Brown bears illustrate that even an apparently omnivorous predator can prefer one prey species.

AB  - Competing hypotheses: (1) Large body size confers more efficient energy use (relative efficiency hypothesis) (2) Large body size requires more energy to be sustained, I disadvantage when food is limited (absolute energy demand hypothesis).
   Organism: Yellow dung flies, Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera Scathophagidae), artificially selected for large and small body size in the laboratory for 24 generations to augment the available phenotypic body sizes.
   Methods: Larvae were reared under limited and unlimited food (dung) conditions, and the energy content of pupae was measured at the beginning and the end of the pupal stage in different. size-matched individuals
   Conclusions: Over the pupal period, lipids and glycogen decreased whereas sugar content increased. Net energy loss per unit body mass was higher at unlimited food contrary to expectation, males (the larger sex) lost less energy than females. Large selection line pupae showed the highest absolute and mass-specific energy loss during metamorphosis, indicating a correlated physiological response to body size selection because phenotypic body sizes do not differ between the lines at limited dung. We conclude that energetic costs due to greater absolute energy demand of larger individuals during the pupal phase outweigh the benefits due to greater metabolic efficiency.

AB  - Populations often face changes in environmental conditions in a relatively short timescale, which may lead to microevolution of traits to cope with these changing selective pressures. Here, we demonstrate microevolution of a physiological trait in a natural population of the water flea Daphnia magna. Levels of the stress protein Hsp60 showed genetic variation, indicating in situ evolutionary potential, and the levels increased through time. The observed microevolutionary increase did not fit the historically documented changes in fish predation pressure in this pond, but it paralleled an increase in the load of infective stages of epibionts through time. In line with this, the locally most abundant epibiont caused an induction of Hsp60. Because stress proteins show evolutionary potential and protect organisms against a wide array of environmental factors, microevolution of stress proteins in natural populations is likely to be common.

AB  - Functional traits can covary to form "functional syndromes." Describing and understanding functional syndromes is an important prerequisite for predicting the effects of organisms on ecosystem functioning. At the intraspecific level, functional syndromes have recently been described, but very little is known about their variability among populations and-if they vary-what the ecological and evolutionary drivers of this variation are. Here, we quantified and compared the variability in four functional traits (body mass, metabolic rate, excretion rate, and boldness), their covariations and the subsequent syndromes among thirteen populations of a common freshwater fish (the European minnow, Phoxinus phoxinus). We then tested whether functional traits and their covariations, as well as the subsequent syndromes, were underpinned by the phylogenetic relatedness among populations (historical effects) or the local environment (i.e., temperature and predation pressure), and whether adaptive (selection or plasticity) or nonadaptive (genetic drift) processes sustained among-population variability. We found substantial among-population variability in functional traits and trait covariations, and in the emerging syndromes. We further found that adaptive mechanisms (plasticity and/or selection) related to water temperature and predation pressure modulated the covariation between body mass and metabolic rate. Other trait covariations were more likely driven by genetic drift, suggesting that nonadaptive processes can also lead to substantial differences in trait covariations among populations. Overall, we concluded that functional syndromes are population-specific, and that both adaptive and nonadaptive processes are shaping functional traits. Given the pivotal role of functional traits, differences in functional syndromes within species provide interesting perspectives regarding the role of intraspecific diversity for ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Although a growing number of studies have documented the evolution of adult dispersal-related traits at the range edge of poleward-expanding species, we know little about evolutionary changes in immune function or traits expressed by nondispersing larvae. We investigated differentiation in larval (growth and development) and adult traits (immune function and flight-related traits) between replicated core and edge populations of the poleward-moving damselfly Coenagrion scitulum. These traits were measured on individuals reared in a common garden experiment at two different food levels, as allocation trade-offs may be easier to detect under energy shortage. Edge individuals had a faster larval life history (growth and development rates), a higher adult immune function and a nearly significant higher relative flight muscle mass. Most of the differentiation between core and edge populations remained and edge populations had a higher relative flight muscle mass when corrected for latitude-specific thermal regimes, and hence could likely be attributed to the range expansion process per se. We here for the first time document a higher immune function in individuals at the expansion front of a poleward-expanding species and documented the rarely investigated evolution of faster life histories during range expansion. The rapid multivariate evolution in these ecological relevant traits between edge and core populations is expected to translate into changed ecological interactions and therefore has the potential to generate novel eco-evolutionary dynamics at the expansion front.

AB  - Background: Populations of Drosophila melanogaster show differences in many morphometrical traits according to their geographic origin. Despite the widespread occurrence of these differences in more than one Drosophila species, the actual selective mechanisms controlling the genetic basis of such variation are not fully understood. Thermal selection is considered to be the most likely cause explaining these differences.
   Results: In our work, we investigated several life history traits (body size, duration of development, preadult survival, longevity and productivity) in two tropical and two temperate natural populations of D. melanogaster recently collected, and in a temperate population maintained for twelve years at the constant temperature of 18 degrees C in the laboratory. In order to characterise the plasticity of these life history traits, the populations were grown at 12, 18, 28 and 31.2 degrees C. Productivity was the fitness trait that showed clearly adaptive differences between latitudinal populations: tropical flies did better in the heat but worse in the cold environments with respect to temperate flies. Differences for the plasticity of other life history traits investigated between tropical and temperate populations were also found. The differences were particularly evident at stressful temperatures (12 and 31.2 degrees C).
   Conclusion: Our results evidence a better cold tolerance in temperate populations that seems to have been evolved during the colonisation of temperate countries by D. melanogaster Afrotropical ancestors, and support the hypothesis of an adaptive response of plasticity to the experienced environment.

AB  - Forecasts of ecological dynamics in changing environments are increasingly important, and are available for a plethora of variables, such as species abundance and distribution, community structure and ecosystem processes. There is, however, a general absence of knowledge about how far into the future, or other dimensions (space, temperature, phylogenetic distance), useful ecological forecasts can be made, and about how features of ecological systems relate to these distances. The ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which useful forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental variation, demographic stochasticity and evolution), level of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), and organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial and phylogenetic forecast horizons. Insights from these case studies demonstrate that the ecological forecast horizon is a flexible and powerful tool for researching and communicating ecological predictability. It also has potential for motivating and guiding agenda setting for ecological forecasting research and development.

AB  - Temperature provides a powerful theme for exploring environmental adaptation at all levels of biological organization, from molecular kinetics to organismal fitness to global biogeography. First, the thermodynamic properties that underlie biochemical kinetics and protein stability determine the overall thermal sensitivity of rate processes. Consequently, a single quantitative framework can assess variation in thermal sensitivity of ectotherms in terms of single amino acid substitutions, quantitative genetics, and interspecific differences. Thermodynamic considerations predict that higher optimal temperatures will result in greater maximal fitness at the optimum, a pattern seen both in interspecific comparisons and in within-population genotypic variation. Second, the temperature-size rule (increased developmental temperature causes decreased adult body size) is a common pattern of phenotypic plasticity in ectotherms. Mechanistic models can correctly predict the rule in some taxa, but lab and field studies show that rapid evolution can weaken or even break the rule. Third, phenotypic and evolutionary models for thermal sensitivity can be combined to explore potential fitness consequences of climate warming for terrestrial ectotherms. Recent analyses suggest that climate change will have greater negative fitness consequences for tropical than for temperate ectotherms, because many tropical species have relatively narrow thermal breadths and smaller thermal safety margins.

AB  - Female reproductive performance is a central component of ungulate population dynamics, and it can be influenced by individual, social, and environmental factors. Researchers have often assumed direct effects of different predictors on reproduction, yet more complex relationships should be considered when investigating temporal variations in life-history traits within a broader eco-evolutionary context. In this study, we explored direct effects of individual, social, and environmental predictors on female reproductive performance and investigated potential causal chains among variables. We analyzed the variation in fecundity, measured as the probability of being pregnant, in 215 adult female deer Cervus elaphus culled on the Italian Alps, with respect to age, body mass, kidney fat, jaw length, lactation status, population size, temperature and precipitation in spring-summer, temperature and snow depth in winter, and the delayed effect of spring-summer temperature. We used random forest and logistic regression models to select variables whose direct effects best explained variation in fecundity. Path analysis was used to test for alternative hypotheses of direct/indirect effects between pre-selected weather (spring-summer temperature) and individual (age, kidney fat index [KFI]) predictors. The most important direct predictors of fecundity were age, kidney fat, and the interaction between kidney fat and spring-summer temperature. Path analysis supported the hypothesis that higher spring-summer temperature had negative, indirect effects on the probability of being pregnant, mediated by decreasing values of KFI. Our study revealed some complex, cause-effect relationships between weather stochasticity, body condition, and reproduction, possibly suggesting a conditional trade-off between opportunity for reproduction and survival, and emphasizing how environmental variations and individual characteristics may interact to shape life-history traits in ungulate populations.

AB  - Ectothermic species are particularly sensitive to changes in temperature and may adapt to changes in thermal environments through evolutionary shifts in thermal physiology or thermoregulatory behaviour. Nevertheless, the heritability of thermal traits, which sets a limit on evolutionary potential, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we captured brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei) from two populations that occur in contrasting thermal environments. We raised offspring from these populations in a laboratory common garden and compared the shape of their thermal performance curves to test for genetic divergence in thermal physiology. Thermal performance curves differed between populations in a common garden in ways partially consistent with divergent patterns of natural selection experienced by the source populations, implying that they had evolved in response to selection. Next, we estimated the heritability of thermal performance curves and of several traits related to thermoregulatory behaviour. We did not detect significant heritability in most components of the thermal performance curve or in several aspects of thermoregulatory behaviour, suggesting that contemporary selection is unlikely to result in rapid evolution. Our results indicate that the response to selection may be slow in the brown anole and that evolutionary change is unlikely to keep pace with current rates of environmental change.

AB  - Salinity tolerance, energy metabolism, buoyancy, and passive sinking and swimming speeds have been studied for comparative assessment of the adaptive potential of two species of cyclopoid copepods in the Black Sea, the native Oithona similis and new invader Oithona davisae. Both species were considered marine euryhaline copepods, but the range of salinity tolerance of O. davisae was much broader (5-55aEuro degrees). The energy metabolism, locomotor activity, mean body mass density, and speed of passive sinking at the same temperature were significantly higher in O. davisae than in O. similis. The relationship between the physiological and behavioral parameters and ecological characteristics of the species are discussed.

AB  - Rapid evolutionary adaptation has the potential to rescue from extinction populations experiencing environmental changes. Little is known, however, about the impact of short-term environmental fluctuations during long-term environmental deterioration, an intrinsic property of realistic environmental changes. Temporary environmental amelioration arising from such fluctuations could either facilitate evolutionary rescue by allowing population recovery (a positive demographic effect) or impede it by relaxing selection for beneficial mutations required for future survival (a negative population genetic effect). We address this uncertainty in an experiment with populations of a bacteriophage virus that evolved under deteriorating conditions (gradually increasing temperature). Periodic environmental amelioration (short periods of reduced temperature) caused demographic recovery during the early phase of the experiment, but ultimately reduced the frequency of evolutionary rescue. These experimental results suggest that environmental fluctuations could reduce the potential of evolutionary rescue.

AB  - In nature, spatiotemporally dynamic coevolutionary processes play major roles in the foundation and maintenance of biodiversity. Here, we examined the arms race coevolution involving a seed-eating weevil with a long snout and its camellia plant host with a thick fruit coat (pericarp) throughout the marked climatic gradient observed across the Japanese islands. Results demonstrated that female weevils, which bored holes through camellia pericarps to lay eggs into seeds, had evolved much longer snouts than males, especially in areas in which Japanese camellia pericarps were very thick. The thickness of the plant pericarp was heritable, and the camellia plant evolved a significantly thicker pericarp on islands with the weevil than on islands without it. Across populations with weevils, resource allocation to plant defense increased with increasing annual mean temperature or annual precipitation, thereby geographically differentiating the evolutionary and ecological interactions between the two species. Given that the coevolutionary relationship exhibited appreciable variation across a relatively small range of annual mean temperatures, ongoing global climatic change can dramatically alter the coevolutionary process, thereby changing the ecological interaction between these species.

AB  - ContextIncreasing rates of habitat fragmentation globally underscore the importance of understanding the full spectrum of fragmentation's ecological consequences. Fragmentation alters the thermal environment of fragments, which may alter the body size of ectothermic organisms and in turn impact survival and reproduction.ObjectivesTo determine whether experimental habitat fragmentation alters body size in the heliothermic, ground-dwelling common garden skink (Lampropholis guichenoti).MethodsWe use body size data spanning 29years to experimentally test the prediction that lizards will experience morphological changes in forest fragments but not in non-fragmented controls.ResultsLizards were smaller in forest fragments relative to those in the non-fragmented controls after the fragmentation treatment was applied. For lizards within forest fragments, the greater the exposure to deforested areas, the greater the decline in body size. This pattern was strongest in the first 5 years following fragmentation and weakened or reversed over time as the pine plantation matrix surrounding the fragments matured. Using sampling site-scale temperature data for the most recent 5years of the experiment, we show that temperature predicts lizard body size. Our findings are consistent with predictions made under the temperature-size rule that ectotherms will be smaller in fragmented landscapes because of temperature increases at newly created edges.ConclusionsOur results raise new concerns about the effects of fragmentation on organisms in remnant patches and offer new research priorities, as more evidence is needed to determine the generality of body size declines in fragmented landscapes. Our results also highlight that body size declines, often attributed to climate change, may be amplified by habitat fragmentation, which has been global in its impact.

AB  - We integrated the evidence for evolutionary and plastic trait changes in situ in response to climate change in freshwater invertebrates (aquatic insects and zooplankton). The synthesis on the trait changes in response to the expected reductions in hydroperiod and increases in salinity indicated little evidence for adaptive, plastic, and genetic trait changes and for local adaptation. With respect to responses to temperature, there are many studies on temporal trait changes in phenology and body size in the wild that are believed to be driven by temperature increases, but there is a general lack of rigorous demonstration whether these trait changes are genetically based, adaptive, and causally driven by climate change. Current proof for genetic trait changes under climate change in freshwater invertebrates stems from a limited set of common garden experiments replicated in time. Experimental thermal evolution experiments and common garden warming experiments associated with space-for-time substitutions along latitudinal gradients indicate that besides genetic changes, also phenotypic plasticity and evolution of plasticity are likely to contribute to the observed phenotypic changes under climate change in aquatic invertebrates. Apart from plastic and genetic thermal adjustments, also genetic photoperiod adjustments are widespread and may even dominate the observed phenological shifts.

AB  - Natural populations of hosts and their enemies are often spatially structured, with patches that vary in the strength of reciprocal selection, so-called coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots with strong or weak reciprocal selection, respectively. Theory predicts that dispersal from hotspots should intensify coevolution in coldspots, whereas dispersal from coldspots should weaken coevolution in hotspots; however, there have been few empirical tests. We addressed this using paired populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and the phage SBW25 Phi 2 linked by one-way dispersal. Within each population, the strength of reciprocal selection was manipulated by altering the bacteria-phage encounter rate, which changes the rate of coevolution without affecting environmental productivity. We observed that dispersal from hotspots accelerated coevolution in coldspots, while dispersal from coldspots decelerated coevolution in hotspots. These results confirm theoretical predictions and suggest that source populations can act as coevolutionary "pacemakers" for recipient populations, overriding local conditions.

AB  - Global pest invasions have significantly increased in recent years. These invasions together with climate warming directly impact agriculture. Tropical climates feature extreme weather events, including high temperatures and seasonal droughts. Thus, successful invasive pests in tropics have to adapt to these extreme climate features. The intrinsic factors relevant to tropical invasion of insects have been explored in many studies, but the knowledge is rather dispersed in contemporary literature. Here, we reviewed the potential biophysical characters of successful invasive pests' adaption to tropical environments including [1] inherent high basal stress tolerance and advanced life-history performances [2], phenotypic plasticity [3], rapid evolution to environmental stress, polyphagy, diverse reproductive strategies and high fecundity. We summarised how these traits and their interactive effects enhance pest invasions in the tropics. Comprehensive understanding of how these characters facilitate invasion improves models for predicting ecological consequences of climate change on invasive pest species for improved pest management.

AB  - Cities can be used as in situ replicates to assess the responses of organisms to environmental changes, such as increased heat or pollution. Community-level studies and more rarely population-level studies have been conducted, but they are not often based on multiple city replicates, thus preventing generalization. Our study tested whether colonies of the antTemnothorax nylanderifrom forest and urban populations exhibit distinct responses to pollution. Because this is a social species, we could also test whether social traits (colony size and mean size of adult workers) affected the response of colonies to urbanization. We collected colonies from four pairs of forest and urban habitats and reared them in the laboratory under normal or cadmium-supplemented diets. We then measured the emergence rate and size of newly-produced workers as well as the mortality rate of adult workers. In all four forest/city replicates, urban colonies were less negatively affected by cadmium than forest colonies for emergence rate and size of newly-produced workers, but not for mortality rate of adult workers. We did not find any correlation between social traits and cadmium resistance, in contrast with what was found in other eusocial insects. We discuss the potential adaptive nature of this differential response.

AB  - Metabolic rates of ectotherms are expected to increase with global trends of climatic warming. But the potential for rapid, compensatory evolution of lower metabolic rate in response to rising temperatures is only starting to be explored. Here, we explored rapid evolution of metabolic rate and locomotor performance in acorn-dwelling ants (Temnothorax curvispinosus) in response to urban heat island effects. We reared ant colonies within a laboratory common garden (25 degrees C) to generate a laboratory-born cohort of workers and tested their acute plastic responses to temperature. Contrary to expectations, urban ants exhibited a higher metabolic rate compared with rural ants when tested at 25 degrees C, suggesting a potentially maladaptive evolutionary response to urbanization. Urban and rural ants had similar metabolic rates when tested at 38 degrees C, as a consequence of a diminished plastic response of the urban ants. Locomotor performance also evolved such that the running speed of urban ants was faster than rural ants under warmer test temperatures (32 degrees C and 42 degrees C) but slower under a cooler test temperature (22 degrees C). The resulting specialist-generalist trade-off and higher thermal optimum for locomotor performance might compensate for evolved increases in metabolic rate by allowing workers to more quickly scout and retrieve resources.

AB  - On the Indian subcontinent, geographical populations (8.0 degrees to 33.0 degrees) of Drosophila melanogaster demonstrate opposite latitudinal dines for desiccation (r = 0.83) and starvation (r = -0.88). Desiccation tolerance is significantly and positively correlated with body size and abdominal pigmentation, whereas starvation is negatively correlated with body size and life-history characteristics. Analysis of variance and analysis of covariance show a substantial direct effect of body size for both traits. For the Indian geographical populations, both latitudinal and altitudinal variations can explain the observed divergence of these two traits of ecological significance. Regression analysis of climatic variables (i.e. T-max, T-min and T-average), which are not significantly correlated with latitude, are positively and significantly associated with starvation and can explain trait variability (R-2 = 0.78-0.88). In contrast, T-CV (R-2 = 0.65), rainfall and precipitation (R-2 = 0.32) are significantly but positively associated with desiccation tolerance. The observed negative correlation between climatically selected starvation and desiccation in Indian geographical populations is not in line with the correlated selection response of these traits on the basis of laboratory selection experiments. For south Indian tropical populations, higher starvation tolerance might be selected because of temperature variables (T-max, T-min and T-average), higher metabolic stress in relation to smaller body size, greater competition and involve a trade-off for life-history traits. In contrast, significantly higher desiccation tolerance in subtropical (northern) populations might be selected because of T-CV, rainfall and precipitation, which reflect seasonal variations. Desiccation and starvation tolerance are independent traits that reveal rapid evolutionary trends in tropical and subtropical climates.

AB  - Experimental data on the relationship between mean heart rate (f(H)) and mean rate of oxygen consumption (V) over dot O-2 of captive barnacle geese during flights in a wind tunnel are assessed in terms of their capacity to predict the typical (V) over dot O-2 of wild barnacle geese, based on the recordings of their f(H), while undertaking autumn migratory flights between Spitsbergen (78degreesN) and Caerlaverock, Scotland (55degreesN). A significant linear relationship has been demonstrated between the f(H) and simultaneously recorded (V) over dot O-2 of a single barnacle goose (B-B) flying in the wind tunnel (V) over dot O-2 = 1.42 f(H) - 304, r(2)=0.82, P<0.001, N=12 flights). Data recorded from three additional geese (N=4 flights), lay within the 95% prediction intervals of the relationship for goose B-B. When these geese (mean body mass= 2.06 kg, n = 4) were flown in the wind tunnel (WT) without the mask, they had a mean f(H) of 451 +/- 23 beats min(-1), yielding an estimate for (V) over dot O-2 of 336+/-33 ml min(-1). However, f(H) has also been recorded from wild barnacle geese (mean migratory f(H) of 253 beats min(-1)), and substitution of this value into the above calibration equation results in an unrealistically low value for mean migratory (V) over dot O-2 of only 55 ml min(-1). Various factors, such as differences in heart mass, selective tissue perfusion, environmental temperature and flock formation, which might account for some of the difference in f(H) between the captive and wild geese are discussed. Comparison with other WT studies shows that inter-species minimum mass-specific (V) over dot O-2 declines with increasing body mass (M-b; range 0.035-2.8 kg) as 173 M-b(-0224), r(2) =0.848.

AB  - High variability of cells size is used selectively for reproduction of working bees and drones. A decrease in both distance between cells and cells size themselves causes similar effects to body mass and morphometric traits of developing individuals. Adaptation of honey bees to living in shelters has led to their becoming tolerant to hypoxia. Improvement of ethological and physiological mechanisms of thermal regulation is associated with limitation of ecological valence and acquiring of stenothermic features by breed. Optimal thermal conditions for breed are limited by the interval 33-34.5 degrees C. Deviations of temperature by 3-4 degrees C beyond this range have minimum lethal effect at embryonic stage of development and medium effect at the stage of pre-pupa and pupa. Developing at the low bound of the vital range leads to increasing, while developing at the upper bound to decreasing of body mass, mandibular and hypopharyngeal glands, as well as other organs, which, later, affects the variability of these traits during the adult stage of development. Eliminative and teratogenic efficiency of ecological factors that affect a breed is most often manifested in underdevelopment of wings. However, their size (in case of wing laminas formation) is characterized by relatively low variability and size-dependent asymmetry. Asymmetry variability of wings and other pair organs is expressed through realignment of size excess from right- to left-side one with respect to their increase. Selective elimination by those traits whose emerging probability increases as developmental conditions deviate from the optimal ones promotes restrictions on individual variability. Physiological mechanisms that facilitate adaptability enhancement under conditions of increasing anthropogenic contamination of environment and trophic substrates consumed by honey bees, arrear to be toxicants accumulation in rectum and crops' ability to absorb contaminants from nectar in course of its processing to honey.

AB  - Background: Following colonization of new habitats and subsequent selection, adaptation to environmental conditions might be expected to be rapid. In a mountain lake in Norway, Lesjaskogsvatnet, more than 20 distinct spawning demes of grayling have been established since the lake was colonized, some 20-25 generations ago. The demes spawn in tributaries consistently exhibiting either colder or warmer temperature conditions during spawning in spring and subsequent early development during early summer. In order to explore the degree of temperature-related divergence in early development, a multi-temperature common-garden experiment was performed on embryos from four different demes experiencing different spring temperatures.
   Results: Early developmental characters were measured to test if individuals from the four demes respond differently to the treatment temperatures. There was clear evidence of among-deme differences (genotype environment interactions) in larval growth and yolk-to-body-size conversion efficiency. Under the cold treatment regime, larval growth rates were highest for individuals belonging to cold streams. Individuals from warm streams had the highest yolk-consumption rate under cold conditions. As a consequence, yolk-to-body-mass conversion efficiency was highest for cold-deme individuals under cold conditions. As we observed response parallelism between individuals from demes belonging to similar thermal groups for these traits, some of the differentiation seems likely to result from local adaptation
   Conclusion: The observed differences in length at age during early larval development most likely have a genetic component, even though both directional and random processes are likely to have influenced evolutionary change in the demes under study.

AB  - Humans have dramatically altered the planet over the course of a century, from the acidity of our oceans to the fragmentation of our landscapes and the temperature of our climate. Species find themselves in novel environments, within communities assembled from never before encountered mixtures of invasives and natives. The speed with which the biotic and abiotic environment of species has changed has already altered the evolutionary trajectory of species, a trend that promises to escalate. In this article, I reflect upon this altered course of evolution. Human activities have reshaped selection pressures, favouring individuals that better survive in our built landscapes, that avoid our hunting and fishing, and that best tolerate the species that we have introduced. Human-altered selection pressures have also modified how organisms live and move through the landscape, and even the nature of reproduction and genome structure. Humans are also shaping selection pressures at the species level, and I discuss how species traits are affecting both extinction and speciation rates in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Evidence from the wild as to the ecological and evolutionary consequences of top predator depletions remains limited, especially in marine systems. Given the pace and extent of predator loss, an understanding of these processes is important. Two sets of adjacent coral reef systems off north-western Australia have similar biological, physical and environmental conditions, but one of the reef systems has been exposed to nearly exclusive commercial fishing of sharks. Across reefs where sharks have been depleted, prey fishes had significantly smaller caudal fins and eyes compared to the reefs with intact shark populations (up to 40 and 46% relative difference in standardized means). These patterns were consistent across 7 teleost prey species (N = 611 individuals) that vary in behavior, diet and trophic guild. We hypothesize that these morphological patterns were primarily driven by differences in shark predation. Morphological differences were not consistent with plausible alternative explanations (habitat complexity, temperature, light, current, food availability, prey targets, competition) as primary drivers. These results provide field evidence of morphological changes in prey potentially due to predator depletions consistent with ecological predictions; specifically, predator loss caused a reduction in the size of prey morphological traits associated with predator detection and evasion. While our analysis cannot differentiate between rapid evolutionary change versus morphological plasticity due to shark depletions, either possible outcome would indicate that predator removals may have profound effects on body shapes of prey communities. This is particularly significant in the case of sharks, given that the consequences of their widespread removal have been a topic of significant speculation, debate and concern.

AB  - Currently, poleward range expansions are observed in many taxa, often in response to anthropogenic climate change. At the expanding front, populations likely face cooler and more variable temperature conditions, imposing thermal selection. This may result in changes in trait means or plasticity, the relative contribution of which is not well understood. We, here, investigate evolutionary change in range-expanding populations of the butterfly Pieris mannii, by comparing populations from the core and the newly established northern range under laboratory conditions. We observed both changes in trait means and in thermal reaction norms. Range-expanding populations showed a more rapid development, potentially indicative of counter-gradient variation and an increased cold tolerance compared with core populations. Genotype-environment interactions prevailed in all associated traits, such that the above differences were restricted to cooler environmental conditions. In range-expanding populations, plasticity was decreased in developmental traits enabling relatively rapid growth even under cooler conditions but increased in cold tolerance arguably promoting higher activity under thermally challenging conditions. Notably, these changes must have occurred within a time period of ca. 10 years only. Our results suggest, in line with contemporary theory, that the evolution of plasticity may play a hitherto underestimated role for adaptation to climatic variation. However, rather than generally increased or decreased levels of plasticity, our results indicate fine-tuned, trait-specific evolutionary responses to increase fitness in novel environments.

AB  - The seasonal dominance of cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton community of lake ecosystems can have severe implications for higher trophic levels. For herbivorous zooplankton such as Daphnia, cyanobacteria have poor nutritional value and some species can produce toxins affecting zooplankton survival and reproduction. Here we present another, hitherto largely unexplored aspect of cyanobacteria, namely that they can increase Daphnia susceptibility to parasites. In a 12-yr monthly time-series analysis of the Daphnia community in Greifensee (Switzerland), we observed that cyanobacteria density correlated significantly with the epidemics of a common gut parasite of Daphnia, Caullerya mesnili, regardless of what cyanobacteria species was present or whether it was colonial or filamentous. The temperature from the previous month also affected the occurrence of Caullerya epidemics, either directly or indirectly by the promotion of cyanobacterial growth. A laboratory experiment confirmed that cyanobacteria increase the susceptibility of Daphnia to Caullerya, and suggested a possible involvement of cyanotoxins or other chemical traits of cyanobacteria in this process. These findings expand our understanding of the consequences of toxic cyanobacterial blooms for lake ecosystems and might be relevant for epidemics experienced by other aquatic species.

AB  - The present study aims to understand the influence of two thermal extremes (15 degrees C and 35 degrees C) as thermal stressors on the selected line of developmental variants (slow and fast developers) in Propylea dissecta and to compare it with the response at the optimal temperature (27 degrees C). The ratio of slow and fast developers within an egg batch differed with thermal extremes irrespective of Fl and F15 generations. Adult body mass got depressed after selection for control slow developers at 15 degrees C while it got enhanced for selected fast developers at 35 degrees C. More selected slow developers were found at low temperature and more selected fast developers at high temperature. Selection probably favours the enhancement of immature survival and emergence ratio which was found to be highest for selected fast developers at 35 degrees C and selected slow developers at 15 degrees C. Population level disparity on thermal confliction was observed in ladybird post selection over several generations. Therefore, we put forward that exposure thermal extremes over a long duration, causes an adaptive differentiation in thermal responses of slow and fast developers.

AB  - Ample variation in body size is common in vertebrates over extensive geographical distances, or in isolated populations, where effective geographical barriers may cause dwarfism or gigantism. Here we study potential causes of extreme size reduction in continental populations of amphibians within a short geographical distance and in the absence of geographical barriers. Natterjack toads Epidalea calamita in Donana National Park (Spain) experience up to 2.1-fold difference in body mass in as little as 37 km. Studying six populations divergent in body size, we tested for genetic isolation of the dwarf populations using multilocus genotypes (16 microsatellites), and explored whether populations differ in trophic status (through stable isotope analysis), standard metabolic rate and growth pattern, senescence and age structure (conducting telomere length assays and skeletochronology). We also recorded advertisement calls across populations and experimentally tested for behavioural reinforcement of the body size variation through female preferences. Local dwarfism in these populations occurs in the absence of genetic isolation while maintaining relatively high effective population sizes. Dwarf populations, however, are exposed to drier and warmer climatic conditions, have different trophic status, show lower mass-specific metabolic rate, and male advertisement calls with a higher dominant frequency. Juvenile growth differed among populations, reaching the adult stage at different body sizes. Altogether, our results suggest a significant influence of environmental conditions on the physiology and ecology of the Donana E. calamita populations, mainly affecting toads between metamorphosis and sexual maturity. Further experimental and genomic studies focusing on these early life stages are necessary to dissect the relative roles of the environment and adaptive genetic differentiation on this phenomenon.

AB  - Rapid evolutionary change in seasonal timing can facilitate ecological speciation and resilience to climate warming. However, the molecular mechanisms behind shifts in animal seasonality are still unclear. Evolved differences in seasonality occur in the European corn borer moth (Ostrinia nubilalis), in which early summer emergence in E-strain adults and later summer emergence in Z-strain adults is explained by a shift in the length of the termination phase of larval diapause. Here, we sample from the developmental time course of diapause in both strains and use transcriptome sequencing to profile regulatory and amino acid changes associated with timing divergence. Within a previously defined quantitative trait locus (QTL), we nominate 48 candidate genes, including several in the insulin signaling and circadian rhythm pathways. Genome-wide transcriptional activity is negligible during the extended Z-strain termination, whereas shorter E-strain termination is characterized by a rapid burst of regulatory changes involved in resumption of the cell cycle, hormone production and stress response. Although gene expression during diapause termination in Ostrinia is similar to that found previously in flies, nominated genes for shifts in timing are species specific. Hence, across distant relatives the evolution of insect seasonality appears to involve unique genetic switches that direct organisms into distinct phases of the diapause pathway through wholesale restructuring of conserved gene regulatory networks.

AB  - Cities are rapidly expanding, and global warming is intensified in urban environments due to the urban heat island effect. Therefore, urban animals may be particularly susceptible to warming associated with ongoing climate change. We used a comparative and manipulative approach to test three related hypotheses about the determinants of heat tolerance or critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in urban ants-specifically, that (a) body size, (b) hydration status, and (c) chosen microenvironments influence CTmax. We further tested a fourth hypothesis that native species are particularly physiologically vulnerable in urban environments. We manipulated water access and determined CTmax for 11 species common to cities in California's Central Valley that exhibit nearly 300-fold variation in body size. There was a moderate phylogenetic signal influencing CTmax, and inter (but not intra) specific variation in body size influenced CTmax where larger species had higher CTmax. The sensitivity of ants' CTmax to water availability exhibited species-specific thresholds where short-term water limitation (8 hr) reduced CTmax and body water content in some species while longer-term water limitation (32 hr) was required to reduce these traits in other species. However, CTmax was not related to the temperatures chosen by ants during activity. Further, we found support for our fourth hypothesis because CTmax and estimates of thermal safety margin in native species were more sensitive to water availability relative to non-native species. In sum, we provide evidence of links between heat tolerance and water availability, which will become critically important in an increasingly warm, dry, and urbanized world that others have shown may be selecting for smaller (not larger) body size.

AB  - Urbanization causes both changes in community composition and evolutionary responses, but most studies focus on these responses in isolation. We performed an integrated analysis assessing the relative contribution of intra-and interspecific trait turnover to the observed change in zooplankton community body size in 83 cladoceran communities along urbanization gradients quantified at seven spatial scales (50-3200 m radii). We also performed a quantitative genetic analysis on 12 Daphnia magna populations along the same urbanization gradient. Body size in zooplankton communities generally declined with increasing urbanization, but the opposite was observed for communities dominated by large species. The contribution of intraspecific trait variation to community body size turnover with urbanization strongly varied with the spatial scale considered, and was highest for communities dominated by large cladoceran species and at intermediate spatial scales. Genotypic size at maturity was smaller for urban than for rural D. magna populations and for animals cultured at 24 degrees C compared with 20 degrees C. While local genetic adaptation likely contributed to the persistence of D. magna in the urban heat islands, buffering for the phenotypic shift to larger body sizes with increasing urbanization, community body size turnover was mainly driven by non-genetic intraspecific trait change.

AB  - Tail autotomy in lizards is an adaptive strategy that has evolved to reduce the risk of predation. Since tail loss reduces body mass and moving ability-which in turn are expected to influence thermal balance-there is potential for a trade-off between tail autotomy and thermoregulation. To test this hypothesis, we studied a common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) population at high latitude, inhabiting a high-cost thermal environment. Z. vivipara is a small, non-territorial lizard known as a very accurate thermoregulator. We made two predictions: (1) the reduced body weight due to tail loss results in faster heating rate (a benefit), and (2) the reduction in locomotor ability after tail loss induces a shift to the use of thermally poorer microhabitats (a cost), thus decreasing the field body temperatures of active lizards. We did not find any effect of tail loss on heating rate in laboratory experiments conducted under different thermal conditions. Likewise, no significant relationship between tail condition and field body temperatures, or between tail condition and thermal microhabitat use, were detected. Thus, our results suggest that tail autotomy does not influence the accuracy of thermoregulation in small-bodied lizards.

AB  - Resistance to predation, herbivory, or disease often comes at a cost such that resistant genotypes are competitively inferior to their sensitive counterparts in the absence of predators, herbivores, or pathogens. The effects of this trade-off on natural populations depend on its sensitivity to environmental changes. We used Escherichia coli and bacteriophage T4 as a model predator/prey system to study the effects of temperature on the cost of resistance. An array of independent T4-resistant mutants, derived from a single ancestral strain of E. coli B, had a mean reduction in competitive fitness that depended strongly on environmental temperature; the cost of resistance generally increased with temperature. Genetic variance for fitness among phage-resistant mutants also depended on temperature; however, genetic variance increased at high and low thermal extremes. These results suggest that temperature is likely to be an important determinant of the consequences of predation in natural communities. We also discuss the underlying mechanistic basis for the cost of resistance in this system and its interaction with temperature.

AB  - Changes in the environment and fishing have been shown to affect life-history characteristics, such as size or age of maturation, in a number of finfish and invertebrates. The American lobster (Homarus americanus) supports Canada's most valuable fishery and exploitation rates are high. Female size-at-maturity (SM) is an important parameter in management of this species, as it is used in establishing minimum legal size regulations. In this study, we show with historical and recent data that SM of female American lobsters has declined across most of Canada, in some areas by as much as 30%, over the past 10-80 years. The spatial patterns of these declines are inconsistent with patterns of rising ocean temperature and lobster abundance (density). They are, however, strongly correlated to the strength of size-based fishery selection, and egg-per-recruit modeling indicates a gain in lifetime egg production associated with observed SM declines under a range of realistic harvesting scenarios. These findings suggest that the marked decrease we document in SM of female American lobsters in Canada over the past century represents an evolutionary response to intense exploitation.

AB  - Among eight populations of grayling Thymallus thymallus that shared common ancestors 8-28 generations earlier, mean egg mortality ranged between 1.2 and 59.8%; mortality during yolk sac absorption was low (0.0-8.0%) and mean survival to swim-up was high (90-97%), with two exceptions (20% and 50%). Survival probabilities differed significantly among populations, even after statistically adjusting for size at swim-up and water depth, water velocity, gravel size and temperature. Development time from fertilization to first observed swim-up was significantly different among populations, ranging between 27 to 40 days, or 264 to 280 degree-days. Mean specific growth rates during the first external feeding period varied between 1.2 and 2.0% day(-1) among populations, population-specific growth rates were independent of temperature. Rates of divergence were of the same order as in other salmonid studies showing rapid evolution. The phenotypic differences may be due partly to genetic differentiation among the populations.

AB  - Diversity of human body size and shape is often biogeographically interpreted in association with climatic conditions. According to Bergmann's and Allen's rules, populations in regions with a cold climate are expected to display an overall larger body and smaller/shorter extremities than those in warm/hot environments. In the present study, the skeletal limb size and proportions of prehistoric Jomon hunter-gatherers, who extensively inhabited subarctic to subtropical areas in the ancient Japanese archipelago, were examined to evaluate whether or not the inter-regional differences follow such ecogeographic patterns. Results showed that the Jomon intralimb proportions including relative distal limb lengths did not differ significantly among five regions from northern Hokkaido to the southern Okinawa Islands. This suggests a limited co-variability of the intralimb proportions with climate, particularly within genealogically close populations. In contrast, femoral head breadth (associated with body mass) and skeletal limb lengths were found to be significantly and positively correlated with latitude, suggesting a north-south geographical cline in the body size. This gradient therefore comprehensively conforms to Bergmann's rule, and may stem from multiple potential factors such as phylogenetic constraints, microevolutionary adaptation to climatic/geographic conditions during the Jomon period, and nutritional and physiological response during ontogeny. Specifically, the remarkably small-bodied Jomon in the Okinawa Islands can also be explained as an adjustment to subtropical and insular environments. Thus, the findings obtained in this study indicate that Jomon people, while maintaining fundamental intralimb proportions, displayed body size variation in concert with ambient surroundings.

AB  - Inbreeding is expected to increase the variability in size and shape within populations. The distinct effects of inbreeding on size and shape suggest that they are governed by different developmental pathways. One unresolved question is whether the non-allometric shape component is partially unconstrained developmentally and therefore whether shape is evolvable. In the present study, we utilized a mass outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster maintained at standard laboratory conditions. Eight lines with equivalent expected levels of inbreeding (F approximate to 0.67) were obtained by restricting the size of each population to two pairs for nine generations. Nine landmarks were measured on Drosophila wings of the inbreed lines and compared with those of the mass population. Wing landmarks comprise an excellent model system for studying evolution of size and shape. Landmark measurements were analyzed with a Procrustes generalized least squares procedure. To visualize global shape changes among samples, we reconstructed the mean shape and the shape changes related to both the allometric and non-allometric components. An increased variability in the non-allometric shape component was found with inbreeding. This indicated that shape was not entirely developmentally constrained, and therefore that shape appears to be evolvable.

AB  - The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, vectors the bacterium `Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' responsible for the huanglongbing ( HLB) disease. In Mexico, economic losses caused by HLB severely affect the citrus industry. Despite the threat that the presence of D. citri implies, due to its invasive characteristics, there are few ecological and biological studies addressing its adaptation to new and different environments in Mexico. Based on the temperature-size rule, stating smaller adult size at higher rearing temperatures, the aim of this study was to evaluate D. citri's body size variation at different temperatures related to an elevation gradient. Adults were collected at four different elevations in the states of Jalisco and Colima, Mexico. Right forewing length and width as well as prothorax width and right antenna length were measured. Statistical differences between the sexes were analyzed by a multivariate analysis using Hotelling's T 2 and Kruskal- Wallis nonparametric test to evaluate body size variation between elevations followed by a Nemenyi's pairwise comparison test. To evaluate relationships between size variation and elevation, a v2 independence test was performed. Females were shown to be statistically larger than males. All body structures except the prothorax were shown to be larger at location El Arenal ( higher elevation) and smaller at location Tecoma ' n ( lower elevation). Forewing length and width best explained the differences observed between the sexes and at the four locations, showing that the temperature- size rule applies in this case.

AB  - Invasive species cope with novel environments through both phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary change. However, the environmental factors that cause evolutionary divergence in invasive species are poorly understood. We developed predictions for how different life-history traits, and plasticity in those traits, may respond to environmental gradients in seasonal temperatures, season length and natural enemies. We then tested these predictions in four geographic populations of the invasive cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae) from North America. We examined the influence of two rearing temperatures (20 and 26.7 degrees C) on pupal mass, pupal development time, immune function and fecundity. As predicted, development time was shorter and immune function was greater in populations adapted to longer season length. Also, phenotypic plasticity in development time was greater in regions with shorter growing seasons. Populations differed significantly in mean and plasticity of body mass and fecundity, but these differences were not associated with seasonal temperatures or season length. Our study shows that some life-history traits, such as development time and immune function, can evolve rapidly in response to latitudinal variation in season length and natural enemies, whereas others traits did not. Our results also indicate that phenotypic plasticity in development time can also diverge rapidly in response to environmental conditions for some traits.

AB  - The thermal biology of obligatory aquatic salamanders (e.g., Amphiumidae) is largely unknown. We therefore investigated thermal selection and temperature preference in the fully aquatic salamander, Amphiuma tridactylum. In a laboratory thermal gradient, A. tridactylum selected a mean water temperature of 26.3 degrees C (SE = 0.29, n = 15, range = 24.3 to 27.9). We also investigated potential influences of body size on thermal selection and found no significant relationship between thermal selection and snout-vent length or body mass. The preferred selected temperature is higher than the preferred temperatures reported for other obligatory aquatic salamanders, a difference that may reflect A. tridactylum's southern distribution in the U.S. We collected water and air temperatures at a site representative of A. tridactylum habitat to estimate when preferred temperature may be seasonally available in the field. Maximum water temperatures exceeded 25 degrees C and thus would support activity of A. tridactylum near its preferred temperature during May to August.

AB  - In the last few decades, non-native freshwater fishes have been introduced all over the world for economic purposes, including aquaculture and aquarium trade, as well as improvement for wild stocks resulting in adverse environmental and socio-economic effects. The Guangdong province of China is at a high risk of fish invasions owing to its warm and humid climate, abundance of water courses, flourishing aquaculture and ornamental fish trade, and extensive sea ports. A total of 160 non-native freshwater species were introduced in the Guangdong province and 71.9% of them were imported for aquarium purposes. Fourteen species have established self-sustaining populations and 21 species were found in the main river basin of the Guangdong province. Propagule pressure, rapid evolution and abundant resources in the environment were the factors likely to contribute to successful invasion by non-native fishes. The invasion of non-native fishes in the Guangdong province has already resulted in economic losses, decline of native species, as well as negative impacts on the functional diversity of native fish assemblages. To mitigate these effects and prevent future non-native fish invasions, scientists, policy makers and stakeholders should collaborate on the management of non-native fish introductions by developing risk assessments, statutory regulations, public education and scientific research.

AB  - Temperature affects everything that an organism does. Although we have an increasingly sophisticated understanding of evolutionary adaptation to temperature at the molecular level for some cellular processes, we still know little about evolutionary temperature adaptation in gene expression, cell-cycle control or growth, all of which influence organism performance and fitness. Recent studies have shown that the physiological costs of evolutionary temperature adaptation vary with body temperature. Here, I argue that this macroecological pattern has powerful consequences for life-history theory, and probably also for food-web dynamics, biological diversity and biotic response to climate change. The relationships among evolution, temperature and ecology are multivariate, hierarchical and complex making evolutionary physiology at the macroecological scale an exciting and challenging agenda for the next decade.

AB  - Climate change profoundly impacts ecosystems and their biota, resulting in range shifts, novel interactions, food web alterations, changed intensities of hostparasite interactions, and extinctions. An increasing number of studies have documented evolutionary changes in traits such as phenology and thermal tolerance. In this opinion paper, we argue that, while evolutionary responses have the potential to provide a buffer against extinctions or range shifts, a number of constraints and complexities blur this simple prediction. First, there are limits to evolutionary potential both in terms of genetic variation and demographic effects, and these limits differ strongly among taxa and populations. Second, there can be costs associated with genetic adaptation, such as a reduced evolutionary potential towards other (human-induced) environmental stressors or direct fitness costs due to tradeoffs. Third, the differential capacity of taxa to genetically respond to climate change results in novel interactions because different organism groups respond to a different degree with local compared to regional (dispersal and range shift) responses. These complexities result in additional changes in the selection pressures on populations. We conclude that evolution can provide an initial buffer against climate change for some taxa and populations but does not guarantee their survival. It does not necessarily result in reduced extinction risks across the range of taxa in a region or continent. Yet, considering evolution is crucial, as it is likely to strongly change how biota will respond to climate change and will impact which taxa will be the winners or losers at the local, metacommunity and regional scales.

AB  - The present "obesogenic' environment has favored excessive energy intake resulting in the current obesity epidemic and its associated diseases. The epidemic has incentivized scientists to develop novel behavioral and pharmacological strategies that enhance energy expenditure to compensate for excessive energy intake. Although physical activity is effective to increase total energy expenditure, it is insufficient to induce negative energy balance and weight loss. With the discovery of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans, BAT activation soon emerged as a potential strategy for elevating energy expenditure. BAT is the only tissue that expresses uncoupling protein 1, conferring on this tissue high thermogenic capacity due to a low efficiency for mitochondrial ATP generation. Potential manipulation of BAT mass and activity has fueled the interest in altering whole-body energy balance through increased energy expenditure. Remarkable advances have been made in quantifying the amount and activity of BAT in humans. Many studies have concluded that the amount of active BAT appears insufficient to induce meaningful increases in energy expenditure. Thus, the majority of studies report that BAT activation does not influence body weight and metabolic control in humans. Strategies to increase BAT mass and/or to potentiate BAT activity seem necessary.

AB  - Evolution in nature occurs in the proverbial tangled bank. The species interactions characterizing this tangled bank can be strongly affected by global change and can also influence the fitness and selective effects of a global change on a focal population. As a result, species interactions can influence which traits will promote adaptation and the magnitude or direction of evolutionary responses to the global change. First, we provide a framework describing how species interactions may influence evolutionary responses to global change. Then, we highlight case studies that have explicitly manipulated both a global change and the presence or abundance of interacting species and used either experimental evolution or quantitative genetics approaches to test for the effects of species interactions on evolutionary responses to global change. Although still not frequently considered, we argue that species interactions commonly modulate the effects of global change on the evolution of plant and animal populations. As a result, predicting the evolutionary effects of the multitude of global changes facing natural populations requires both community ecology and evolutionary perspectives.

AB  - Metabolic rate (MR) often scales with body mass (BM) following a power function of the form MR= aBM(b), where log(a) is the allometric intercept and b is the allometric exponent (i.e. slope on a log-log scale). The variational properties of b have been debated, but very few studies have tested for genetic variance in b, and none have tested for a genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction in b. Consequently, the short-term evolutionary potentials of both b and its phenotypic plasticity remain unknown. Using 10 clones of a population of Daphnia magna, we estimated the genetic variance in b and assessed whether a GxE interaction affected b. We measured MR on juveniles of different sizes reared andmeasured at three temperatures (17, 22 and 28 degrees C). Overall, b decreased with increasing temperature. We found no evidence of genetic variance in b at any temperature, and thus no GxE interaction in b. However, we found a significant GxE interaction in size-specific MR. Using simulations, we show how this GxE interaction can generate genetic variation in the ontogenetic allometric slope of animals experiencing directional changes in temperature during growth. This suggests that b can evolve despite having limited genetic variation at constant temperatures.

AB  - Critical thermal limits (CTLs) constrain the performance of organisms, shaping their abundance, current distributions, and future distributions. Consequently, CTLs may also determine the quality of ecosystem services as well as organismal and ecosystem vulnerability to climate change. As some of the most ubiquitous animals in terrestrial ecosystems, ants are important members of ecological communities. In recent years, an increasing body of research has explored ant physiological thermal limits. However, these CTL data tend to centre on a few species and biogeographical regions. To encourage an expansion of perspectives, we herein review the factors that determine ant CTLs and examine their effects on present and future species distributions and ecosystem processes. Special emphasis is placed on the implications of CTLs for safeguarding ant diversity and ant-mediated ecosystem services in the future. First, we compile, quantify, and categorise studies on ant CTLs based on study taxon, biogeographical region, methodology, and study question. Second, we use this comprehensive database to analyse the abiotic and biotic factors shaping ant CTLs. Our results highlight how CTLs may affect future distribution patterns and ecological performance in ants. Additionally, we identify the greatest remaining gaps in knowledge and create a research roadmap to promote rapid advances in this field of study.

AB  - Little is known about the life-history trade-offs and limitations, and the physiological mechanisms that are associated with phenotypic adaptation to future ocean conditions. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the within-and trans-generation life-history responses and aerobic capacity of a marine polychaete, Ophryotrocha labronica, to elevated temperature and elevated temperature combined with elevated salinity for its entire lifespan. In addition, transplants between treatments were carried out at both the egg mass and juvenile stage to identify the potential influence of developmental effects. Within-generation, life-history trade-offs caused by the timing of transplant were only detected under elevated temperature combined with elevated salinity conditions. Polychaetes transplanted at the egg mass stage grew slower and had lower activities of energy metabolism enzymes but reached a larger maximum body size and lived longer when compared with those transplanted as juveniles. Trans-generation exposure to both elevated temperature and elevated temperature and salinity conditions restored 20 and 21% of lifespan fecundity, respectively. Trans-generation exposure to elevated temperature conditions also resulted in a trade-off between juvenile growth rates and lifespan fecundity, with slower growers showing greater fecundity. Overall, our results suggest that future ocean conditions may select for slower growers. Furthermore, our results indicate that life-history trade-offs and limitations will be more prevalent with the shift of multiple global change drivers, and thus there will be greater constraints on adaptive potential.

AB  - Understanding the processes driving formation and maintenance of latitudinal clines has become increasingly important in light of accelerating global change. Many studies have focused on the role of abiotic factors, especially temperature, in generating clines, but biotic factors, including the introduction of non-native species, may also drive clinal variation. We assessed the impact of invasion by predatory fire ants on latitudinal clines in multiple fitness-relevant traits-morphology, physiological stress responsiveness, and antipredator behavior-in a native fence lizard. In areas invaded by fire ants, a latitudinal cline in morphology is opposite both the cline found in museum specimens from historical populations across the species' full latitudinal range and that found in current populations uninvaded by fire ants. Similarly, clines in stress-relevant hormone response to a stressor and in antipredator behavior differ significantly between the portions of the fence lizard range invaded and uninvaded by fire ants. Changes in these traits within fire ant-invaded areas are adaptive and together support increased and more effective antipredator behavior that allows escape from attacks by this invasive predator. However, these changes may mismatch lizards to the environments under which they historically evolved. This research shows that novel biotic pressures can alter latitudinal clines in multiple traits within a single species on ecological timescales. As global change intensifies, a greater understanding of novel abiotic and biotic pressures and how affected organisms adapt to them across space and time will be central to predicting and managing our changing environment.

AB  - The tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta has been an important model system in insect biology for more than half a century. Here we report the evolutionary divergence in thermal sensitivity and diapause initiation between field and laboratory populations that were separated for more than 35 yr ( 1240 laboratory generations) and that are descendants from the same field populations in central North Carolina. At intermediate rearing temperatures (20 degrees-25 degrees C), mean body size was significantly larger and development time significantly faster in the laboratory than in the field populations. At higher temperatures (30 degrees-35 degrees C), these mean differences between populations were reduced or eliminated, and larval survival at 35 degrees C was significantly lower in the laboratory population than in the field population. F-1 crosses had survival and development time to wandering similar to the field population times at both 25 degrees and 35 degrees C; body mass at wandering for F-1 crosses was intermediate compared with that of the field and laboratory populations. Comparisons with earlier field and laboratory studies suggest evolutionary reductions in thermal tolerance and performance at high temperatures in the laboratory population. The critical photoperiod initiating diapause in field populations in North Carolina did not change detectably between the 1960s and 2005. In contrast, the laboratory population has evolved a reduced tendency to diapause under short- day conditions, relative to the field population.

AB  - Research to date has suggested that both individual marine species and ecological processes are expected to exhibit diverse responses to the environmental effects of climate change. Evolutionary responses can occur on rapid (ecological) timescales, and yet studies typically do not consider the role that adaptive evolution will play in modulating biological responses to climate change. Investigations into such responses have typically been focused at particular biological levels (e. g., cellular, population, community), often lacking interactions among levels. Since all levels of biological organisation are sensitive to global climate change, there is a need to elucidate how different processes and hierarchical interactions will influence species fitness. Therefore, predicting the responses of communities and populations to global change will require multidisciplinary efforts across multiple levels of hierarchy, from the genetic and cellular to communities and ecosystems. Eventually, this may allow us to establish the role that acclimatisation and adaptation will play in determining marine community structures in future scenarios.

AB  - Rapid anthropogenic alterations caused by urbanization are increasing temperatures in urban cores, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Two cicada species, Cryptotympana atrata and Hyalessa fuscata (Hemiptera: Cicadidae), are abundant in metropolitan Seoul where their population densities correlate strongly with UHI intensities. Such a positive correlation between cicada density and UHI intensity may be possible if cicada abundance is linked to a certain thermal tolerance. We tested this hypothesis by investigating variation in morphology and thermal responses of two cicada species along a thermal gradient in Seoul and surrounding areas. The morphological responses were measured by metrics such as length, thorax width and depth, and mass. The thermal responses were measured in terms of minimum flight temperature, maximum voluntary temperature and heat torpor temperature. First, we observed a species-specific variation in thermal responses, in which C. atrata displayed a higher thermal threshold for maximum voluntary and heat torpor temperatures than H. fuscata. Second, a positive association between temperature conditions and body sizes were displayed in females H. fuscata, but not in either conspecific males or C. atrata individuals. Third, C. atrata exhibited similar thermal responses regardless of habitat temperature, while H. fuscata in warmer areas showed an increase in heat tolerance. In addition, H. fuscata individuals with bigger thorax sizes were more heat-tolerant than those with smaller thoraxes. Overall, our research is the first to detect a variation in thermal responses and body size of H. fuscata individuals at a local scale. More investigations would be needed to better understand the adaptation mechanisms of insects linked to UHI effects.

AB  - The distribution of the subtropical Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea (O.F. Muller, 1774)), one of the world's most invasive freshwater molluscs, is reportedly constrained by a lower thermal tolerance limit of 2 degrees C. Although its occurrence in north temperate regions is typically restricted to artificially heated waterbodies, the species has been found to overwinter in unheated lakes and rivers. In laboratory experiments, we compared the cold tolerance of populations from several geographically distinct sites spanning 35 degrees N to 46 degrees N in eastern North America. Each population contained individuals that fully recovered from 2 months of continuous exposure to near-freezing (1 degrees C) conditions, contrary to published accounts of C. fluminea's thermal ecology. Survivorship increased with body size and was enhanced by prior acclimation to a low temperature (10 degrees C) compared with a higher one (18 degrees C). When acclimated to 10 degrees C, clams from northern populations exhibited greater survivorship (55.0% +/- 16.1%) than those from southern populations (26.7% +/- 19.2%). However, one southern population demonstrated survivorship as great as that of the most tolerant northern population, suggesting that its clams could overwinter in unheated northern waterbodies. Differences among populations indicate either that contemporary evolution has occurred or that developmental plasticity shapes future acclimation responses.

AB  - Latitudinal genetic clines in body size occur in many ectotherms including Drosophila species. In the wing of D. melanogaster, these clines are generally based on latitudinal variation in cell number. In contrast, differences in wing area that evolve by thermal selection in the laboratory are in general based on cell size. To investigate possible reasons for the different cellular bases of these two types of evolutionary response, we compared the newly established North and South American wing size clines of Drosophila subobscura. The new clines are based on latitudinal variation in cell area in North America and cell number in South America. The ancestral European cline is also based on latitudinal variation in cell number. The difference in the cellular basis of wing size variation in the American clines, which are roughly the same age, together with the similar cellular basis of the new South American cline and the ancient European one, suggest that the antiquity of a cline does not explain its cellular basis. Furthermore, the results indicate that wing size as a whole, rather than its cellular basis, is under selection. The different cellular bases of different size clines are most likely explained either entirely by chance or by different patterns of genetic variance-or its expression-in founding populations.

AB  - A changing climate is expected to have profound effects on many aspects of ectotherm biology. We report on a decade-long study of free-ranging sand lizards (Lacerta agilis), exposed to an increasing mean mating season temperature and with known operational sex ratios. We assessed year-to-year variation in sexual selection on body size and postcopulatory sperm competition and cryptic female choice. Higher temperature was not linked to strength of sexual selection on body mass, but operational sex ratio (more males) did increase the strength of sexual selection on body size. Elevated temperature increased mating rate and number of sires per clutch with positive effects on offspring fitness. In years when the "quality" of a female's partners was more variable (in standard errors of a male sexual ornament), clutches showed less multiple paternity. This agrees with prior laboratory trials in which females exercised stronger cryptic female choice when male quality varied more. An increased number of sires contributing to within-clutch paternity decreased the risk of having malformed offspring. Ultimately, such variation may contribute to highly dynamic and shifting selection mosaics in the wild, with potential implications for the evolutionary ecology of mating systems and population responses to rapidly changing environmental conditions.

AB  - The pace-of-life hypothesis predicts that among-individual differences in behaviour should integrate with a wide variety of morphological, metabolic and life-history traits along a slow to fast pace-of-life continuum. Support for the pace-of-life hypothesis has been mixed, in part because most empirical tests have been conducted strictly at the phenotypic level and have thus conflated genetic and environmental sources of covariance among traits. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that, according to the predictions of the pace-of-life hypothesis, body mass, routine metabolic rate, activity and exploratory propensity are positively integrated in the house cricket Acheta domesticus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Using modified open field behavioural tests and flow-through respirometry, we determined whether among-individual differences are correlated across morphology, behaviour and metabolism in 50 male house crickets. All traits were repeatable, but we found poor evidence for overall integration across traits. Instead we found evidence for modularity, with behavioural traits covarying independently from mass and routine metabolic rate. Modularity, like that found here between activity and exploratory propensity, has been suggested to facilitate adaptive evolutionary change by coupling functionally related traits into suites on which selection can act more rapidly.

AB  - Reports of fishing-induced evolution in the maturation schedules of commercially exploited marine fishes are numerous and are alarming. Here, we analysed the probabilistic maturation reaction norms for a freshwater fish species, the pikeperch (Sander lucioperca), to assess whether the maturation patterns of cohorts 1993-2006 responded to intensive coastal commercial and recreational fishing in the Archipelago Sea area of the Baltic Sea. Lp(50) values estimated using individual data from catch samples revealed that maturation had shifted towards an earlier age and smaller size. Lengths-at-age showed variation, but no linear trends, whereas the condition factor decreased for most of the age groups. Cross-correlation analysis of Lp(50) values with variables describing stock size (potential social effects on maturation) and water temperature revealed no obvious growth-independent effects on the maturation trends. This suggests that fishing, in line with the life-history theory, was the most important driving factor favouring early maturation. These results suggest that fishing-induced shifts in the maturation patterns of fish are nearly ubiquitous and not limited to commercially harvested marine species. This calls for increased awareness of fishing-induced life-history changes also in coastal and inland fisheries management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diapause has long been recognized as a crucial ecological adaptation to spatio-temporal environmental variation. More recently, rapid evolution of the diapause response has been implicated in response to contemporary global warming and during the range expansion of invasive species. Although the molecular regulation of diapause remains largely unresolved, rapidly emerging next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provide exciting opportunities for addressing this longstanding question. In the present study, a new assembly from life-history stages relevant to diapause in the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus (Skuse) is reported, along with unique methods for the analysis of NGS data and transcriptome assembly. A digital normalization procedure that significantly reduces the computational resources required for transcriptome assembly is evaluated. Additionally, a method for protein reference-based and genomic reference-based merged assembly of 454 and Illumina reads is described. Finally, a gene ontology analysis is presented, which creates a platform for identifying the physiological processes associated with diapause. Taken together, these methods provide valuable tools for analyzing the transcriptional underpinnings of many complex phenotypes, including diapause, and provide a basis for determining the molecular regulation of diapause in Ae. albopictus.

AB  - Background: Biologists studying adaptation under sexual selection have spent considerable effort assessing the relative importance of two groups of models, which hinge on the idea that females gain indirect benefits via mate discrimination. These are the good genes and genetic compatibility models. Quantitative genetic studies have advanced our understanding of these models by enabling assessment of whether the genetic architectures underlying focal phenotypes are congruent with either model. In this context, good genes models require underlying additive genetic variance, while compatibility models require non-additive variance. Currently, we know very little about how the expression of genotypes comprised of distinct parental haplotypes, or how levels and types of genetic variance underlying key phenotypes, change across environments. Such knowledge is important, however, because genotype-environment interactions can have major implications on the potential for evolutionary responses to selection.
   Results: We used a full diallel breeding design to screen for complex genotype-environment interactions, and genetic architectures underlying key morphological traits, across two thermal environments (the lab standard 27 degrees C, and the cooler 23 degrees C) in the Australian field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus. In males, complex three-way interactions between sire and dam parental haplotypes and the rearing environment accounted for up to 23 per cent of the scaled phenotypic variance in the traits we measured (body mass, pronotum width and testes mass), and each trait harboured significant additive genetic variance in the standard temperature (27 degrees C) only. In females, these three-way interactions were less important, with interactions between the paternal haplotype and rearing environment accounting for about ten per cent of the phenotypic variance (in body mass, pronotum width and ovary mass). Of the female traits measured, only ovary mass for crickets reared at the cooler temperature (23 degrees C), exhibited significant levels of additive genetic variance.
   Conclusions: Our results show that the genetics underlying phenotypic expression can be complex, context-dependent and different in each of the sexes. We discuss the implications of these results, particularly in terms of the evolutionary processes that hinge on good and compatible genes models.

KW  - REMOVAL
AB  - A mathematical model is developed for describing the decomposition and removal of binder from ceramic components formed by injection molding. The model takes into account heat transfer by conduction within the ceramic body, mass transfer by convective flow of gas products, and an Arrhenius dependence of the decomposition rate. The model is solved numerically to determine the spatial and temporal evolution of temperature, reaction rate, concentration, porosity, and pressure. The influences of the thermal and transport properties on the distribution of binder and on the buildup of pressure within the body are examined. When small temperature gradients exist across the body, the binder is removed homogenously, whereas when large temperature gradients are present, the binder is removed as a receding planar front.

AB  - Temperature is the most significant factor controlling developmental timing of most temperate poikilotherms. In the face of climate change, a crucial question is how will poikilothermic organisms evolve when faced with changing thermal environments? In this paper, we integrate models for developmental timing and quantitative genetics. A simple model for determining developmental milestones (emergence times, egg hatch) is introduced, and the general quantitative genetic recursion for the mean value of developmental parameters presented. Evolutionary steps proportional to the difference between current median parameters and parameters currently selected for depend on the fitness, which is assumed to depend on emergence density. Asymptotic states of the joint model are determined, which turn out to be neutrally stable (marginal) fixed points in the developmental model by itself, and an associated stable emergence distribution is also described. An asymptotic convergence analysis is presented for idealized circumstances, indicating basic stability criteria. Numerical studies show that the stability analysis is quite conservative, with basins of attraction to the asymptotic states that are much larger than expected. It is shown that frequency-dependent selection drives oscillatory dynamics and that the asymptotic states balance the asymmetry of the emergence distribution and the fitness function.

AB  - The ability of animals to adapt to warming will depend on the evolutionary potential of thermally sensitive traits. The number of studies measuring the quantitative genetics of a wide variety of thermally sensitive traits has steadily increased; however, no study has yet investigated the quantitative genetics of thermal sensitivity for courtship traits. Since courtship often precedes mating, the ability of these traits to respond to warming may impact reproduction and therefore population persistence. Here, we use classic quantitative genetics breeding design to estimate heritability of various aspects of the thermal sensitivity of courtship behaviours in the treehopper Enchenopa binotata. We generated individual-level thermal courtship activity curves for males and females and measured levels of genetic variation in the thermal sensitivity of courtship activity. We found low heritability with 95% credible intervals that did not approach zero for most traits. Levels of genetic variation were highest in traits describing thermal tolerance. We also found some evidence for genetic correlations between traits within but not across sexes. Together, our results suggest that the range of temperatures over which these treehoppers actively court can evolve, although it remains unclear whether adaptation can happen quickly enough to match the speed of warming.

AB  - Our knowledge about how the environment influences sexual selection regimes and how ecology and sexual selection interact is still limited. We performed an integrative study of wing pigmentation in calopterygid damselflies, combining phylogenetic comparative analyses, field observations and experiments. We investigated the evolutionary consequences of wing pigmentation for sexual dimorphism, speciation, and extinction and addressed the possible thermoregulatory benefits of pigmentation. First, we reconstructed ancestral states of male and female phenotypes and traced the evolutionary change of wing pigmentation. Clear wings are the ancestral state and that pigmentation dimorphism is derived, suggesting that sexual selection results in sexual dimorphism. We further demonstrate that pigmentation elevates speciation and extinction rates. We also document a significant biogeographic association with pigmented species primarily occupying northern temperate regions with cooler climates. Field observations and experiments on two temperate sympatric species suggest a link between pigmentation, thermoregulation, and sexual selection, although body temperature is also affected by other phenotypic traits such as body mass, microhabitat selection, and thermoregulatory behaviors. Taken together, our results suggest an important role for wing pigmentation in sexual selection in males and in speciation. Wing pigmentation might not increase ecological adaptation and species longevity, and its primary function is in sexual signaling and species recognition.

AB  - Climate-mediated evolution plays an integral role in species migration and range expansion. Gaining a clearer understanding of how climate affects demographic history and adaptation provides fundamental insight into the generation of intra-and interspecific diversity. In this study, we used the natural colonization of the green anole (Anolis carolinensis) from the island of Cuba to mainland North America to investigate the role of evolution at the niche, phenotypic and genetic levels after long-term establishment in a novel environment. The North American green anole occupies a broader range of thermal habitats than its Cuban sister species. We documented niche expansion in the mainland green anole, mediated primarily through adaptation to winter temperatures. Common garden experiments strongly suggest a genetic component to differences in thermal performance found between populations in different temperature regimes. Analysis of geographic variation in population structure based on 53 486 single nucleotide variants from RAD loci revealed increased genetic isolation between populations in different vs. similar thermal environments. Selection scans for environment-allele correlations reveal 19 genomic loci of known function that may have played a role in the physiological adaptation of A. carolinensis to temperate environments on the mainland.

AB  - California's Central Valley contains an abundance of rivers with historical and potential productivity for anadromous salmonids, which are currently limited by impacts such as dams, water diversions, and high temperatures. We surveyed genetic variation in Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss within the upper Tuolumne and Merced rivers in and around Yosemite National Park to evaluate both population origins (ancestry) and the evolutionary response to natural and artificial barriers to migration (adaptation). This analysis revealed that despite extensive stocking with hatchery Rainbow Trout strains throughout the study area, most populations retained largely indigenous ancestry. Adaptive genomic variation associated with anadromy was distributed throughout the study area, with higher frequencies observed in populations connected to reservoirs that are known to support adfluvial life history variants. Fish in southern Central Valley rivers experience temperatures near the upper thermal limit for salmonids and represent an important reservoir of genomic diversity for adaptation to climate change. These results highlight the importance of local adaptation as well as the potential for resident Rainbow Trout populations above barrier dams to contribute to the recovery of steelhead (anadromous Rainbow Trout) once migratory connectivity is restored between upstream spawning and rearing habitats and the ocean.

AB  - Background: Many properties of organisms show great robustness against genetic and environmental perturbations. The terms canalization and developmental stability were originally proposed to describe the ability of an organism to resist perturbations and to produce a predictable target phenotype regardless of random developmental noise. However, the extent to which canalization and developmental stability are controlled by the same set of genes and share underlying regulatory mechanisms is largely unresolved.
   Results: We have analyzed the effects of clinal genetic variation ( inversion polymorphism) on wing asymmetry by applying the methods of geometric morphometrics in the context of quantitative genetics using isochromosomal lines of Drosophila subobscura. For the analysis of overall size, developmental stability was positively correlated with levels of heterozygosity and development at the optimal temperature. For analyses of shape, the overall comparisons by matrix correlations indicate that inter- and intraindividual variation levels were poorly correlated, a result also supported when comparing the vectors describing patterns of variation of landmark position. The lack of similarity was basically due to the discrepancy between the genetic and environmental components of the interindividual variation. Finally, the analyses have also underscored the presence of genetic variation for directional asymmetry.
   Conclusions: The results strongly support the hypothesis that environmental canalization and developmental stability share underlying regulatory mechanisms, but environmental and genetic canalization are not functionally the same. A likely explanation for this lack of association is that natural wing shape variation in Drosophila populations is loosely related to individual fitness.

AB  - Climate warming is threatening biodiversity worldwide. Climate specialists such as alpine species are especially likely to be vulnerable. Adaptation by rapid evolution is the only long-term option for survival of many species, but the adaptive evolutionary potential of heat resistance has not been assessed in an alpine invertebrate. Here, we show that the alpine fly Drosophila nigrosparsa cannot readily adapt to heat stress. Heat-exposed flies from a regime with increased ambient temperature and a regime with increased temperature plus artificial selection for heat tolerance were less heat tolerant than the control group. Increased ambient temperature affected negatively both fitness and competitiveness. Ecological niche models predicted the loss of three quarters of the climatically habitable areas of this fly by the end of this century. Our findings suggest that, alongside with other climate specialists, species from mountainous regions are highly vulnerable to climate warming and unlikely to adapt through evolutionary genetic changes.

AB  - Co-evolution of host-parasitoid interactions is determined by the costs of host resistance, which received empirical evidence, and the costs of parasitoid virulence, which have been mostly hypothesized. Asobara tabida is a parasitoid, which mainly parasitizes Drosophila melanogaster and D. subobscura, the first species being able to resist to the parasitoid development while the second species is not. To parasitize resistant hosts, including D. melanogaster, A. tabida develops sticky eggs, which prevent encapsulation, but this virulence mechanism may be costly. Interindividual and interpopulation variation in the proportion of sticky eggs respectively allowed us to (i) artificially select and compare life-history traits of a virulent and a nonvirulent laboratory strain, and (ii) compare a virulent and a nonvirulent field strain, to investigate the hypothetical costs of virulence. We observed strong differences between the 2 laboratory strains. The nonvirulent strain invested fewer resources in reproduction and walked less than the virulent one but lived longer. Concerning the field strains, we observed that the nonvirulent strain had larger wings while the virulent one walked more and faster. All together, our results suggest that virulence may not always be costly, but rather that different life histories associated with different levels of virulence may coexist at both intra- and interpopulation levels.

AB  - Clinal variation is one of the most emblematic examples of the action of natural selection at a wide geographical range. In Drosophila subobscura, parallel clines in body size and inversions, but not in wing shape, were found in Europe and South and North America. Previous work has shown that a bottleneck effect might be largely responsible for differences in wing trait-inversion association between one European and one South American population. One question still unaddressed is whether the associations found before are present across other populations of the European and South American clines. Another open question is whether evolutionary dynamics in a new environment can lead to relevant changes in wing traits-inversion association. To analyse geographical variation in these associations, we characterized three recently laboratory founded D.subobscura populations from both the European and South American latitudinal clines. To address temporal variation, we also characterized the association at a later generation in the European populations. We found that wing size and shape associations can be generalized across populations of the same continent, but may change through time for wing size.The observed temporal changes are probably due to changes in the genetic content of inversions, derived from adaptation to the new, laboratory environment. Finally, we show that it is not possible to predict clinal variation from intrapopulation associations. All in all this suggests that, at least in the present, wing traits-inversion associations are not responsible for the maintenance of the latitudinal clines in wing shape and size.

AB  - The fundamental equation of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) indicates that most of the variation in metabolic rate are a consequence of variation in organismal size and environmental temperature. Although evolution is thought to minimize energy costs of nutrient transport, its effects on metabolic rate via adaptation, acclimatization or acclimation are considered small, and restricted mostly to variation in the scaling constant, b(0). This contrasts strongly with many conclusions of evolutionary physiology and life-history theory, making closer examination of the fundamental equation an important task for evolutionary biologists. Here we do so using scorpions as model organisms. First, we investigate the implications for the fundamental equation Of metabolic rate variation and its temperature dependence in the scorpion Uroplectes carinatus following laboratory acclimation. During 22 days of acclimation at 25 degrees C metabolic rates declined significantly (from 127.4 to 78.2 mu W; P = 0.0001) whereas mean body mass remained constant (367.9-369.1 mg; P = 0.999). In field-fresh scorpions, metabolic rate-temperature (MRT) relationships varied substantially within and among individuals, and therefore had low repeatability values (tau = 0.02) and no significant among-individual variation (P = 0.181). However, acclimation resulted in a decline in within-individual variation of MRT slopes which subsequently revealed significant differences among individuals (P = 0.0031) and resulted in a fourfold increase in repeatability values (tau = 0.08). These results highlight the fact that MRT relationships can show substantial, directional variation within individuals over time. Using a randomization model we demonstrate that the reduction in metabolic rate with acclimation while body mass remains constant causes a decline both in the value of the mass-scaling exponent and the coefficient of determination. Furthermore, interspecific comparisons of activation energy, E, demonstrated significant variation in scorpions (0.09-1.14 eV), with a mean value of 0.77 eV, significantly higher than the 0.6-0.7 eV predicted by the fundamental equation. Our results add to a growing body of work questioning both the theoretical basis and empirical support for the MTE, and suggest that alternative models of metabolic rate variation incorporating explicit consideration of life history evolution deserve further scrutiny.

AB  - Although life histories are shaped by temperature and predation, their joint influence on the interdependence of life-history traits is poorly understood. Shifts in one life-history trait often necessitate shifts in anotherstructured in some cases by trade-offsleading to differing life-history strategies among environments. The offspring size-number trade-off connects three traits whereby a constant reproductive allocation (R) constrains how the number (O) and size (S) of offspring change. Increasing temperature and size-independent predation decrease size at and time to reproduction which can lower R through reduced time for resource accrual or size-constrained fecundity. We investigated how O, S, and R in a clonal population of Daphnia magna change across their first three clutches with temperature and size-independent predation risk. Early in ontogeny, increased temperature moved O and S along a trade-off curve (constant R) toward fewer larger offspring. Later in ontogeny, increased temperature reduced R in the no-predator treatment through disproportionate decreases in O relative to S. In the predation treatment, R likewise decreased at warmer temperatures but to a lesser degree and more readily traded off S for O whereby the third clutch showed a constant allocation strategy of O versus S with decreasing R. Ontogenetic shifts in S and O rotated in a counterclockwise fashion as temperature increased and more drastically under risk of predation. These results show that predation risk can alter the temperature dependence of traits and their interactions through trade-offs.

AB  - Mounting evidence of climatic effects on riverine environments and adaptive responses of fishes have elicited growing conservation concerns. Measures to rectify population declines include assessment of local extinction risk, population ecology, viability, and genetic differentiation. While conservation planning has been largely informed by neutral genetic structure, there has been a dearth of critical information regarding the role of non-neutral or functional genetic variation. We evaluated genetic variation among steelhead trout of the Columbia River Basin, which supports diverse populations distributed among dynamic landscapes. We categorized 188 SNP loci as either putatively neutral or candidates for divergent selection (non-neutral) using a multitest association approach. Neutral variation distinguished lineages and defined broad-scale population structure consistent with previous studies, but fine-scale resolution was also detected at levels not previously observed. Within distinct coastal and inland lineages, we identified nine and 22 candidate loci commonly associated with precipitation or temperature variables and putatively under divergent selection. Observed patterns of non-neutral variation suggest overall climate is likely to shape local adaptation (e.g., potential rapid evolution) of steelhead trout in the Columbia River region. Broad geographic patterns of neutral and non-neutral variation demonstrated here can be used to accommodate priorities for regional management and inform long-term conservation of this species.

AB  - Many studies document genetic and phenotypic trait changes of species in response to climate change, or document how evolution of individual species can impact population abundances and community composition. An integration of population and community-level responses requires, however, a multiple species approach. Here we quantify among- and within-species differences in thermal tolerance and life-history traits in three co-occurring Daphnia species upon exposure to a naturally occurring heat wave. Populations of randomly isolated clones of Daphnia magna, Daphnia pulicaria, and Daphnia galeata from the same pond were exposed to a natural heat wave in outdoor mesocosms. We subsequently conducted a common garden experiment in the laboratory using clonal lineages isolated at the end of the mesocosm selection experiment, at two rearing temperatures, measuring thermal tolerance and life-history traits. We find pronounced plasticity responses to higher rearing thermal regime in each study species. We observe only few significant microevolutionary responses involving evolution of plasticity in D. pulicaria. Yet in terms of effect size, evolutionary trait change within species contributes more than 25% to total trait change in response to the heat wave for a majority of the trait x species combinations. The relative importance of intraspecific to interspecific variation varies widely among traits. Our results show that the relative importance of interspecific variation, phenotypic plasticity, and evolutionary trait change differs strongly depending on the set of species and traits studied. Taking into account this variation at different levels of biological organization is important to predict community-wide responses to global change.

AB  - The question of parallel evolution-what causes it, and how common it is-has long captured the interest of evolutionary biologists. Widespread urban development over the last century has driven rapid evolutionary responses on contemporary time scales, presenting a unique opportunity to test the predictability and parallelism of evolutionary change. Here we examine urban evolution in an acorn-dwelling ant species, focusing on the urban heat island signal and the ant's tolerance of these altered urban temperature regimes. Using a common-garden experimental design with acorn ant colonies collected from urban and rural populations in three cities and reared under five temperature treatments in the laboratory, we assessed plastic and evolutionary shifts in the heat and cold tolerance of F1 offspring worker ants. In two of three cities, we found evolved losses of cold tolerance, and compression of thermal tolerance breadth. Results for heat tolerance were more complex: in one city, we found evidence of simple evolved shifts in heat tolerance in urban populations, though in another, the difference in urban and rural population heat tolerance depended on laboratory rearing temperature, and only became weakly apparent at the warmest rearing temperatures. The shifts in tolerance appeared to be adaptive, as our analysis of the fitness consequences of warming revealed that while urban populations produced more sexual reproductives under warmer laboratory rearing temperatures, rural populations produced fewer. Patterns of natural selection on thermal tolerances supported our findings of fitness trade-offs and local adaptation across urban and rural acorn ant populations, as selection on thermal tolerance acted in opposite directions between the warmest and coldest rearing temperatures. Our study provides mixed support for parallel evolution of thermal tolerance under urban temperature rise, and, importantly, suggests the promising use of cities to examine parallel and non-parallel evolution on contemporary time scales.

AB  - Offspring traits are greatly influenced by maternal effects, and these maternal effects may provide an important pathway through which populations can adapt to changing thermal environments. We investigated the effect of egg size on the among- and within-population variation in early life history traits among introduced Great Lakes Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations under varying thermal conditions. We reared Chinook salmon from three populations in a common-garden hatchery study at 6.5, 9.4, and 15.2 degrees C and measured a variety of fitness-related traits during development. We found that most of the among-population variation in early life history traits was explained by egg size. However, the contribution of egg size to the among-population variation decreased with an increase in temperature suggesting that other effects, such as genetic, contribute at high temperature. Within populations, egg size explained much of the dam variance and maternal effect for traits in every temperature, whereas egg size generally had little to no influence on the sire variance and heritability. Overall, our results demonstrate the significant contribution egg size makes to shaping early life history phenotypes among and within populations, and suggest that egg size is an important pathway through which offspring phenotypes can evolve on contemporary timescales.

AB  - High altitude glacier-fed streams are harsh environments inhabiting specialized invertebrate communities. Most research on biotic aspects in glacier-fed streams have focused on the simple relationship between presence/absence of species and prevailing environmental conditions, whereas functional strategies and potentials of glacial stream specialists have been hardly investigated so far. Using new and recent datasets from our investigations in the European Alps, we now demonstrate distinct functional properties of invertebrates that typically dominate glacier-fed streams and show significant relationships with declining glacier cover in alpine stream catchments. In particular, we present and argue about cause-effect relationships between glacier cover in the catchment and temperature, community structure, diversity, feeding strategies, early life development, body mass, and growth of invertebrates. By concentrating on key taxa in glacial and non-glacial alpine streams, the relevance of distinct adaptations in these functional components becomes evident. This clearly demonstrates that further studies of functional characteristics are essential for the understanding of peculiar diversity patterns, successful traits and their plasticity, evolutionary triggered species adaptions, and flexibilities.

AB  - Successful establishment and range expansion of non-native species often require rapid accommodation of novel environments. Here, we use common-garden experiments to demonstrate parallel adaptive evolutionary response to a cool climate in populations of wall lizards (Podarcis muralis) introduced from southern Europe into England. Low soil temperatures in the introduced range delay hatching, which generates directional selection for a shorter incubation period. Non-native lizards from two separate lineages have responded to this selection by retaining their embryos for longer before oviposition-hence reducing the time needed to complete embryogenesis in the nest-and by an increased developmental rate at low temperatures. This divergence mirrors local adaptation across latitudes and altitudes within widely distributed species and suggests that evolutionary responses to climate can be very rapid. When extrapolated to soil temperatures encountered in nests within the introduced range, embryo retention and faster developmental rate result in one to several weeks earlier emergence compared with the ancestral state. We show that this difference translates into substantial survival benefits for offspring. This should promote short-and long-term persistence of non-native populations, and ultimately enable expansion into areas that would be unattainable with incubation duration representative of the native range.

AB  - Sexual selection represents a potent force that can drive rapid population differentiation in traits related to reproductive success. Hence, sexual traits are expected to show greater population divergence than non-sexual traits. We test this prediction by exploring patterns of morphological differentiation of the exaggerated fore femur (a male-specific sexual trait) and the wing (a non-sexual trait) among allopatric and sympatric populations of the widespread sister dung fly species Sepsis neocynipsea and Sepsis cynipsea (Diptera: Sepsidae). While both species occur in Eurasia, S. neocynipsea also abounds in North America, albeit previous studies suggest strong differentiation in morphology, behavior, and mating systems. To evaluate the degree of differentiation expected under neutrality between S. cynipsea, European S. neocynipsea, and North American S. neocynipsea, we genotyped 30 populations at nine microsatellite markers, revealing almost equal differentiation between and minor differentiation among geographic populations within the three lineages. Landmark-based analysis of 18 populations reared at constant 18 and 24 degrees C in a laboratory common garden revealed moderate temperature-dependent phenotypic plasticity and significant heritable differentiation in size and shape of male forelegs and wings among iso-female lines of the three lineages. Following the biological species concept, there was weaker differentiation between cross-continental populations of S. neocynipsea relative to S. cynipsea, and more fore femur differentiation between the two species in sympatry versus allopatry (presumably due to character displacement). Contrary to expectation, wing morphology showed as much shape differentiation between evolutionary independent lineages as fore femora, providing no evidence for faster diversification of traits primarily engaged in mating.

AB  - Population genomic surveys suggest that climate-associated genetic variation occurs widely across species, but whether it is sufficient to allow population persistence via evolutionary adaptation has seldom been quantified. To ask whether rapid adaptation in reef-building corals can keep pace with future ocean warming, we measured genetic variation at predicted warm-adapted loci and simulated future evolution and persistence in a high-latitude population of corals from Rarotonga, Cook Islands. Alleles associated with thermal tolerance were present but at low frequencies in this cooler, southerly locality. Simulations based on predicted ocean warming in Rarotonga showed rapid evolution of heat tolerance resulting in population persistence under mild warming scenarios consistent with low CO2 emission plans, RCP2.6 and RCP4.5. Under more severe scenarios, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, adaptation was not rapid enough to prevent extinction. Population adaptation was faster for models based on smaller numbers of additive loci that determine thermal tolerance and for higher population growth rates. Finally, accelerated migration via transplantation of thermally tolerant individuals (1 to 5%/year) sped adaptation. These results show that cool-water corals can adapt to warmer oceans but only under mild scenarios resulting from international emissions controls. Incorporation of genomic data into models of species response to climate change offers a promising method for estimating future adaptive processes.

AB  - Population response to anthropogenic activities will be influenced by prior adaptation to environmental conditions. We tested how parasite-resistant and -susceptible strains of the freshwater snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, responded to cadmium and elevated temperature challenges after having been exposed to low-level cadmium continuously for multiple generations. Snails exposed to cadmium for three generations were removed for the fourth generation, and challenged in the fifth generation with (1) chronic cadmium exposure over the entire life cycle; (2) lethal cadmium exposure of adults; and (3) elevated temperature challenge of adults. The parasite susceptible NMRI strain is more cadmium tolerant than the parasite resistant BS90 strain and remained more tolerant than BS90 throughout this study. Additionally, NMRI exhibited greater adaptive capacity for cadmium than BS90 and became more tolerant of both chronic and lethal cadmium challenges, while BS90 became more tolerant of lethal cadmium challenge only. Fitness costs, reflected in population growth rate, were not apparent in fifth generation snails maintained in control conditions. However, costs were latent and expressed as decreased tolerance to a secondarily imposed temperature stress. Adaptation to prior selection pressures can influence subsequent adaptation to anthropogenic stresses and may have associated costs that reduce fitness in novel environments.

AB  - Variation in female reproductive morphology may play a decisive role in reproductive isolation by affecting the relative fertilization success of alternative male phenotypes. Yet, knowledge of how environmental variation may influence the development of the female reproductive tract and thus alter the arena of postcopulatory sexual selection is limited. Yellow dung fly females possess either three or four sperm storage compartments, a polymorphism with documented influence on sperm precedence. We performed a quantitative genetics study including 12 populations reared at three developmental temperatures complemented by extensive field data to show that warm developmental temperatures increase the frequency of females with four compartments, revealing striking hidden genetic variation for the polymorphism. Systematic genetic differentiation in growth rate and spermathecal number along latitude, and phenotypic covariance between the traits across temperature treatments suggest that the genetic architecture underlying the polymorphism is shaped by selection on metabolic rate. Our findings illustrate how temperature can modulate the preconditions for sexual selection by differentially exposing novel variation in reproductive morphology. This implies that environmental change may substantially alter the dynamics of sexual selection. We further discuss how temperature-dependent developmental plasticity may have contributed to observed rapid evolutionary transitions in spermathecal morphology.

AB  - I evaluated the effect of incubation temperature on phenotypes of the veiled chameleon, Chamaeleo calyptratus. I chose this species for study because its large clutch size (30-40 eggs or more) allows replication within clutches both within and among experimental treatments. The major research objectives were (1) to assess the effect of constant low, moderate, and high temperatures on embryonic development, (2) to determine whether the best incubation temperature for embryonic development also produced the "best" hatchlings, and (3) to determine how a change in incubation temperature during mid-development would affect phenotype. To meet these objectives, I established five experimental temperature regimes and determined egg survival and incubation length and measured body size and shape, selected body temperatures, and locomotory performance of lizards at regular intervals from hatching to 90 d, or just before sexual Maturity. Incubation temperature affected the length of incubation, egg survival, and body mass, but did not affect sprint speed or selected body temperature although selected body temperature affected growth in mass independently of treatment and clutch. Incubation at moderate temperatures provided the best conditions for both embryonic and post-hatching development. The highest incubation temperatures were disruptive to development; eggs had high mortality, developmental rate was low, and hatchlings grew slowly. Changes in temperature during incubation increased the among-clutch variance in incubation length relative to that of constant temperature treatments. J. Exp. Zool. 309A.-43.5-446, 2008.

AB  - Individual heterogeneity in life history shapes eco-evolutionary processes, and unobserved heterogeneity can affect demographic outputs characterising life history and population dynamical properties. Demographic frameworks like matrix models or integral projection models represent powerful approaches to disentangle mechanisms linking individual life histories and population-level processes. Recent developments have provided important steps towards their application to study eco-evolutionary dynamics, but so far individual heterogeneity has largely been ignored. Here, we present a general demographic framework that incorporates individual heterogeneity in a flexible way, by separating static and dynamic traits (discrete or continuous). First, we apply the framework to derive the consequences of ignoring heterogeneity for a range of widely used demographic outputs. A general conclusion is that besides the long-term growth rate lambda, all parameters can be affected. Second, we discuss how the framework can help advance current demographic models of eco-evolutionary dynamics, by incorporating individual heterogeneity. For both applications numerical examples are provided, including an empirical example for pike. For instance, we demonstrate that predicted demographic responses to climate warming can be reversed by increased heritability. We discuss how applications of this demographic framework incorporating individual heterogeneity can help answer key biological questions that require a detailed understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics.

AB  - Biotic invasions provide a natural experiment in evolution: when invasive species colonize new ranges, they may evolve new clines in traits in response to environmental gradients. Yet it is not clear how rapidly such patterns can evolve and whether they are consistent between regions. We compare four populations of the invasive cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae) from North America and Japan, independently colonized by P.rapae 150years ago and 300years ago, respectively. On each continent, we employed a northern and southern population to compare the effects of latitude on body mass, development rate and immune function. For each population, we used a split-sibling family design in which siblings were reared at either warm (26.7 degrees C) or cool (20 degrees C) temperatures to determine reaction norms for each trait. Latitudinal patterns in development time were similar between the two continents. In contrast, there were strong geographical differences in reaction norms for body size, but no consistent effects of latitude; there were no detectable effects of latitude or continent on immune function. These results imply that some life history traits respond consistently to selection along climatic gradients, whereas other traits may respond to local environmental factors, or not at all.

AB  - Stream ecosystems show gradual variation of various selection factors, which can result in a zonation of species distributions and gradient evolution of morphological and life-history traits within species. Identifying the selective agents underlying such phenotypic evolution is challenging as different species could show shared and/or unique (species-specific) responses to components of the river gradient. We studied a stream gradient inhabited by two mosquitofishes (genus Gambusia) in the Rio Grijalva basin in southern Mexico and found a patchy distribution pattern of both congeners along a stretch of 100 km, whereby one species was usually dominant at a given site. We uncovered both shared and unique patterns of diversification: some components of the stream gradient, including differences in piscine predation pressure, drove shared patterns of phenotypic divergence, especially in females. Other components of the gradient, particularly abiotic factors (max. annual temperature and temperature range) resulted in unique patterns of divergence, especially in males. Our study highlights the complexity of selective regimes in stream ecosystems. It exemplifies that even closely related, congeneric species can respond in unique ways to the same components of the river gradient and shows how both sexes can exhibit quite different patterns of divergence in multivariate phenotypic character suites.

AB  - Adaptation to different climates fuels the origins and maintenance of biodiversity. Detailing how organisms optimize fitness for their local climates is therefore an essential goal in biology. Although we increasingly understand how survival-related traits evolve as organisms adapt to climatic conditions, it is unclear whether organisms also optimize traits that coordinate mating between the sexes. Here, we show that dragonflies consistently adapt to warmer climates across space and time by evolving less male melanin ornamentation-a mating-related trait that also absorbs solar radiation and heats individuals above ambient temperatures. Continent-wide macroevolutionary analyses reveal that species inhabiting warmer climates evolve less male ornamentation. Communityscience observations across 10 species indicate that populations adapt to warmer parts of species' ranges through microevolution of smaller male ornaments. Observations from 2005 to 2019 detail that contemporary selective pressures oppose male ornaments in warmer years; and our climate-warming projections predict further decreases by 2070. Conversely, our analyses show that female ornamentation responds idiosyncratically to temperature across space and time, indicating the sexes evolve in different ways to meet the demands of the local climate. Overall, these macro- and microevolutionary findings demonstrate that organisms predictably optimize their mating-related traits for the climate just as they do their survival-related traits.

AB  - Hyphantria cunea Drury invaded Japan at Tokyo in 1945 and expanded its distribution gradually into northern and south-western Japan. All populations in Japan were bivoltine until the early 1970s, at which time trivoltine populations appeared in several southern regions. Presently, H. cunea exists as separate bivoltine and trivoltine populations divided around latitude 36 degrees. In the course of this voltinism change, the mean surface temperature in Japan rose by 1.0 degrees C.
   To determine whether and how this temperature increase might be responsible for the voltinism change, we constructed an age-structured model incorporating growth speed driven by actual daily temperature and detailed mechanisms of diapause induction triggered by both daily photoperiod and temperature.
   The simulation result suggests that both the acceleration of the growth speed and the prolongation of diapause induction are necessary to cause changes in voltinism, regardless of temperature increase. We concluded that the H. cunea population changed its life-history traits as an adaptation parallel with its invasion into the south-western parts of Japan.
   Though the temperature increase had little effect on the fitness and heat stress in bivoltine and trivoltine populations, the trivoltine life cycle has become advantageous at least in marginal regions such as Tokyo.

AB  - Cycles, such as seasons or tides, characterize many systems in nature. Overwhelming evidence shows that climate change-driven alterations to environmental cycles-such as longer seasons-are associated with phenological shifts around the world, suggesting a deep link between environmental cycles and life cycles. However, general mechanisms of life-history evolution in cyclical environments are still not well understood. Here, I build a demographic framework and ask how life-history strategies optimize fitness when the environment perturbs a structured population cyclically and how strategies should change as cyclicality changes. I show that cycle periodicity alters optimality predictions of classic life-history theory because repeated cycles have rippling selective consequences over time and generations. Notably, fitness landscapes that relate environmental cyclicality and life-history optimality vary dramatically depending on which trade-offs govern a given species. The model tuned with known life-history trade-offs in a marine intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus successfully predicted the shape of life-history variation across natural populations spanning a gradient of tidal periodicities. This framework shows how environmental cycles can drive life-history variation-without complex assumptions of individual responses to cues such as temperature-thus expanding the range of life-history diversity explained by theory and providing a basis for adaptive phenology.

AB  - 1. Species introductions provide insights into how populations respond to new environments and selection pressures through rapid adaptation and adaptive phenotypic plasticity. However, maladaptive responses are increasingly recognised to also be common in nature. The spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii, has rapidly invaded divergent environments providing the opportunity to examine adaptive and maladaptive phenotypic and evolutionary responses to its introduced range. 2. We studied how population density in the field and wing size of individuals varied over an elevational gradient on Hawaii. We then conducted a reciprocal common garden experiment to evaluate how temperature influenced wing size and other correlates of fitness. We did this by reciprocally rearing D. suzukii collected from low and high elevations in temperatures representative of low and high elevation. 3. We observed a wing size increase with elevation. Additionally, flies were more abundant at higher elevation. In the reciprocal common garden experiment, flies emerged faster in the warm, low-elevation temperature and developed larger wings in the cool, high-elevation temperature. Emergence of flies from high- and low-elevation sites showed a pattern suggesting maladaptation to the temperature representing their home environment. 4. We suggest that opposing selection pressures, the high vagility of flies, and extreme plasticity in body size constrain adaptation to temperature along an elevational gradient. Although successful invasive species such as D. suzukii often exhibit local adaptation, this research demonstrates that invasive species can be successful even without such adaptation.

AB  - Climate change is increasing global temperatures and intensifying the frequency and severity of extreme heat waves. How organisms will cope with these changes depends on their inherent thermal tolerance, acclimation capacity, and ability for evolutionary adaptation. Yet, the potential for adaptation of upper thermal tolerance in vertebrates is largely unknown. We artificially selected offspring from wild-caught zebrafish (Danio rerio) to increase (Up-selected) or decrease (Down-selected) upper thermal tolerance over six generations. Selection to increase upper thermal tolerance was also performed on warm-acclimated fish to test whether plasticity in the form of inducible warm tolerance also evolved. Upper thermal tolerance responded to selection in the predicted directions. However, compared to the control lines, the response was stronger in the Down-selected than in the Up-selected lines in which evolution toward higher upper thermal tolerance was slow (0.04 +/- 0.008 degrees C per generation). Furthermore, the scope for plasticity resulting from warm acclimation decreased in the Up-selected lines. These results suggest the existence of a hard limit in upper thermal tolerance. Considering the rate at which global temperatures are increasing, the observed rates of adaptation and the possible hard limit in upper thermal tolerance suggest a low potential for evolutionary rescue in tropical fish living at the edge of their thermal limits.

AB  - A long-standing debate in evolutionary biology concerns the relative importance of different evolutionary forces in explaining phenotypic diversification at large geographic scales. For example, natural selection is typically assumed to underlie divergence along environmental gradients. However, neutral evolutionary processes can produce similar patterns. We collected molecular genetic data from 14 European populations of Plantago lanceolata to test the contributions of natural selection versus neutral evolution to population divergence in temperature-sensitive phenotypic plasticity of floral reflectance. In P. lanceolata, reflectance plasticity is positively correlated with latitude/altitude. We used population pairwise comparisons between neutral genetic differentiation (F-ST and Jost's D) and phenotypic differentiation (P-ST) to assess the contributions of geographic distance and environmental parameters of the reproductive season in driving population divergence. Data are consistent with selection having shaped large-scale geographic patterns in thermal plasticity. The aggregate pattern of P-ST versus F-ST was consistent with divergent selection. F-ST explained thermal plasticity differences only when geographic distance was not included in the model. Differences in the extent of cool reproductive season temperatures, and not overall temperature variation, explained plasticity differences independent of distance. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that thermal plasticity is adaptive where growing seasons are shorter and cooler, that is, at high latitude/altitude.

AB  - Urban ecosystems are relatively recent and heavily human-altered terrestrial ecosystems with a surprisingly high diversity of animals, plants and other organisms. Urban habitats are also strongly fragmented and subject to higher temperatures, providing a compelling model for studying adaptation to global change. Crepis sancta (Asteraceae), an annual Mediterranean wasteland weed, occupies fragmented urban environments as well as certain unfragmented landscapes in southern France. We tested for shifts in dispersal, reproductive traits and size across a rural-urban gradient to learn whether and how selection may be driving changes in life history in urban and fragmented habitats. We specifically compared the structure of quantitative genetic variation and of neutral markers (microsatellites) between urban and rural and between fragmented and unfragmented habitats. We showed that fragmentation provides a better descriptor of trait variation than urbanization per se for dispersal traits. Fragmentation also affected reproductive traits and plant size though one rural population did conform to this scheme. Our study shows the role of fragmentation for dispersal traits shift in urban environments and a more complex pattern for other traits. We discuss the role of pollinator scarcity and an inhospitable matrix as drivers of adaptation.

AB  - The prediction of invasion patterns may require an understanding of intraspecific differentiation in invasive species and its interaction with climate change. We compare Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) plants from the core (100-150 yr old) and northern margin (< 65 yr old) of their North American invaded range to determine whether evolution during invasion increases the probability of future expansion.
   Plants from populations in the core and margin were compared in two sites beyond the northern range edge to assess their potential to invade novel areas. Data were compared with previous work to assess the effect of latitudinal climate on L. japonica spread. Winter survival in current climates was modeled and projected for future climates to predict future spread.
   Margin plants were larger and had 60% greater survival than core plants at sites beyond the northern range edge. Overall, winter survival decreased with increasing latitude and decreasing temperature, and was greater in margin plants than core plants.
   Models suggested that greater winter tolerance in margin populations has increased L. japonica's northward spread by 76 km, and that this survival advantage will persist under future climates. These results demonstrate that evolution during invasion may increase spread beyond predictions using increasing global temperatures alone.

AB  - Thermal acclimation capacity was investigated in adults of three tropical marine invertebrates, the subtidal barnacle Striatobalanus amaryllis, the intertidal gastropod Volegalea cochlidium and the intertidal barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite. To test the relative importance of transgenerational acclimation, the developmental acclimation capacity of A. amphitrite was investigated in F-1 and F-2 generations reared at a subset of the same incubation temperatures. The increase in CTmax (measured through loss of key behavioural metrics) of F-0 adults across the incubation temperature range 25.4-33.4 degrees C was low: 0.00 degrees C (V. cochlidium), 0.05 degrees C (S. amaryllis) and 0.06 degrees C (A. amphitrite) per 1 degrees C increase in incubation temperature (the acclimation response ratio; ARR). Although the effect of generation was not significant, across the incubation temperature range of 29.4-33.4 degrees C, the increase in CTmax in the F-1 (0.30 degrees C) and F-2 (0.15 degrees C) generations of A. amphitrite was greater than in the F-0 (0.10 degrees C). These correspond to ARR's of 0.03 degrees C (F-0), 0.08 degrees C (F-1) and 0.04 degrees C (F-2), respectively. The variability in CTmax between individuals in each treatment was maintained across generations, despite the high mortality of progeny. Further research is required to investigate the potential for transgenerational acclimation to provide an extra buffer for tropical marine species facing climate warming.

AB  - Recent anthropogenic eutrophication has meant that host plants of nettle-feeding insects became quasi-omnipresent in fertile regions of Western Europe. However, host plant resource quality - in terms of microclimate and nutritional value - may vary considerably between the original' forest habitat and recent' agricultural habitat. Here, we compared development in both environmental settings using a split-brood design, so as to explore to what extent larval survival and adult morphology in the nettle-feeding butterfly Aglais urticae are influenced by the anthropogenic environment. Nettles along field margins had higher C/N ratios and provided warmer microclimates to larvae. Larvae developed 20% faster and tended to improve their survival rates, on the agricultural land compared to woodland. Our split-brood approach indicated plastic responses within families, but also family effects in the phenotypic responses. Adult males and females had darker wing pigmentation in the drier and warmer agricultural environment, which contrasts with the thermal melanism hypothesis. Developmental plasticity in response to this microclimatically different and more variable habitat was associated with a broader phenotypic parameter space for the species. Both habitat expansion and developmental plasticity are likely contributors to the ecological and evolutionary success of these nettle-feeding insects in anthropogenic environments under high nitrogen load.

AB  - BackgroundLoss and fragmentation of Neotropical primates' habitat can alter the health and individual adaptation. Physiological parameters reflect health status and individuals responses to the habitat conditions.
   MethodsWe captured six wild adult females and six adult males of Alouatta pigra to evaluate their physical condition (body mass, respiratory and heart rate, and rectal temperature), hematology and blood chemistry on fragmentation habitat condition at southeastern Mexico.
   ResultsThe males weighed more than females, but the female' temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate were higher. Low values of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cells suggest some degree of anemia in these howler monkeys. Low levels of the total protein, albumin, albumin/globulin Ratio, and low levels of blood urea nitrogen suggest that howler monkeys could have protein and carbohydrate deficiencies.
   ConclusionsHowler monkeys living under the highly degraded conditions at Balancan, Tabasco, could be showing adaptability by modifying their physiology, hematology, and blood chemistry in response to the conditions of their fragmented landscape.

AB  - Ectotherms have evolved preferences for particular body temperatures, but the nutritional and life-history consequences of such temperature preferences are not well understood. We measured thermal preferences in Locusta migratoria (migratory locusts) and used a multi-factorial experimental design to investigate relationships between growth/development and macronutrient utilization (conversion of ingesta to body mass) as a function of temperature. A range of macronutrient intake values for insects at 26, 32 and 38 degrees C was achieved by offering individuals high-protein diets, high-carbohydrate diets or a choice between both. Locusts placed in a thermal gradient selected temperatures near 38 degrees C, maximizing rates of weight gain; however, this enhanced growth rate came at the cost of poor protein and carbohydrate utilization. Protein and carbohydrate were equally digested across temperature treatments, but once digested both macronutrients were converted to growth most efficiently at the intermediate temperature (32 degrees C). Body temperature preference thus yielded maximal growth rates at the expense of efficient nutrient utilization.

AB  - Fish and other ectotherms living in warmer waters often grow faster as juveniles, mature earlier, but become smaller adults. Known as the temperature-size rule (TSR), this pattern is commonly attributed to higher metabolism in warmer waters, leaving fewer resources for growth. An alternative explanation focuses on growth and reproduction trade-offs across temperatures. We tested these hypotheses by measuring growth, maturation, metabolism and reproductive allocation from zebrafish populations kept at 26 and 30 degrees C across six generations. Zebrafish growth and maturation followed TSR expectations but were not explained by baseline metabolic rate, which converged between temperature treatments after a few generations. Rather, we found that females at 30 degrees C allocated more to reproduction, especially when maturing at the smallest sizes. We show that elevated temperatures do not necessarily increase baseline metabolism if sufficient acclimation is allowed and call for an urgent revision of modelling assumptions used to predict population and ecosystem responses to warming.

AB  - Organismal traits and their evolution can strongly influence food web structure and dynamics. To what extent the evolution of such traits impacts food web structure, however, is poorly understood. Here, we investigate a simple three-species omnivory food web module where the attack rates of all predators evolve as ecological dynamics unfold, such that predator trophic levels are themselves dynamic. We assume a timescale where other vital rates that govern population dynamics are constant and incorporate a well-known tradeoff between attack rates and the conversion of prey into predator biomass. We show that this eco-evolutionary model yields a surprisingly rich array of dynamics. Moreover, even small amounts of selection lead to important differences in the abundance, trophic, and biomass structure of the food web. Systems in which intermediate predators are strongly constrained by tradeoffs lead to hourglass-shaped food webs, where basal resources and top predators have large abundances, but intermediate predators are rare, like those observed in some marine ecosystems. Such food webs are also characterized by a relatively low maximum trophic level. Systems in which intermediate predators have weaker tradeoffs lead to pyramid-shaped food webs, where basal resources are more abundant than intermediate and top predators, such as those observed in some terrestrial system. These food webs also supported a relatively higher maximum trophic level. Overall, our results suggest that eco-evolutionary dynamics can strongly influence the abundance-, trophic-, and biomass-structure of food webs, even in the presence of small levels of selection, thus stressing the importance of taking traits and trait evolution into account to further understand community-level patterns and processes.

AB  - Temperature changes in the environment, which realistically include environmental fluctuations, can create both plastic and evolutionary responses of traits. Sexes might differ in either or both of these responses for homologous traits, which in turn has consequences for sexual dimorphism and its evolution. Here, we investigate both immediate changes in and the evolution of sexual dimorphism in response to a changing environment (with and without fluctuations) using the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We investigate sex differences in plasticity and also the genetic architecture of body mass and developmental time dimorphism to test two existing hypotheses on sex differences in plasticity (adaptive canalization hypothesis and condition dependence hypothesis). We found a decreased sexual size dimorphism in higher temperature and that females responded more plastically than males, supporting the condition dependence hypothesis. However, selection in a fluctuating environment altered sex-specific patterns of genetic and environmental variation, indicating support for the adaptive canalization hypothesis. Genetic correlations between sexes (rMF) were affected by fluctuating selection, suggesting facilitated independent evolution of the sexes. Thus, the selective past of a population is highly important for the understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of sexual dimorphism.

AB  - The consequences of climate change for local biodiversity are little understood in process or mechanism, but these changes are likely to reflect both changing regional species pools and changing competitive interactions. Previous empirical work largely supports the idea that competition will intensify under climate change, promoting competitive exclusions and local extinctions, while theory and conceptual work indicate that relaxed competition may in fact buffer communities from biodiversity losses that are typically witnessed at broader spatial scales. In this review, we apply life history theory to understand the conditions under which these alternative scenarios may play out in the context of a range-shifting biota undergoing rapid evolutionary and environmental change, and at both leading-edge and trailing-edge communities. We conclude that, in general, warming temperatures are likely to reduce life history variation among competitors, intensifying competition in both established and novel communities. However, longer growing seasons, severe environmental stress and increased climatic variability associated with climate change may buffer these communities against intensified competition. The role of life history plasticity and evolution has been previously underappreciated in community ecology, but may hold the key to understanding changing species interactions and local biodiversity under changing climates.

AB  - Eco-evolutionary dynamics can mediate species and community responses to habitat warming and fragmentation, two of the largest threats to biodiversity and ecosystems. The eco-evolutionary consequences of warming and fragmentation are typically studied independently, hindering our understanding of their simultaneous impacts. Here, we provide a new perspective rooted in trade-offs among traits for understanding their eco-evolutionary consequences. On the one hand, temperature influences traits related to metabolism, such as resource acquisition and activity levels. Such traits are also likely to have trade-offs with other energetically costly traits, like antipredator defences or dispersal. On the other hand, fragmentation can influence a variety of traits (e.g. dispersal) through its effects on the spatial environment experienced by individuals, as well as properties of populations, such as genetic structure. The combined effects of warming and fragmentation on communities should thus reflect their collective impact on traits of individuals and populations, as well as trade-offs at multiple trophic levels, leading to unexpected dynamics when effects are not additive and when evolutionary responses modulate them. Here, we provide a road map to navigate this complexity. First, we review single-species responses to warming and fragmentation. Second, we focus on consumer-resource interactions, considering how eco-evolutionary dynamics can arise in response to warming, fragmentation, and their interaction. Third, we illustrate our perspective with several example scenarios in which trait trade-offs could result in significant eco-evolutionary dynamics. Specifically, we consider the possible eco-evolutionary consequences of (i) evolution in thermal performance of a species involved in a consumer-resource interaction, (ii) ecological or evolutionary changes to encounter and attack rates of consumers, and (iii) changes to top consumer body size in tri-trophic food chains. In these scenarios, we present a number of novel, sometimes counter-intuitive, potential outcomes. Some of these expectations contrast with those solely based on ecological dynamics, for example, evolutionary responses in unexpected directions for resource species or unanticipated population declines in top consumers. Finally, we identify several unanswered questions about the conditions most likely to yield strong eco-evolutionary dynamics, how better to incorporate the role of trade-offs among traits, and the role of eco-evolutionary dynamics in governing responses to warming in fragmented communities.

AB  - Bay anchovy egg abundance in the Manatee River estuary, Florida, was compared with conditions in the spawning ground before and after spawning to distinguish prey-supply-based spawning responses from post-spawning advective effects. Plume fronts were a prominent feature of the spawning ground. Egg distribution, copepod distribution and front development were surveyed 25 times across a wide range of freshwater inflow conditions. Surface-front strength (maximum interpolated salinity slope) was strongly correlated with the size of the frontal zone, as defined by surface areas having slopes >1 psu km(-1). Eggs were most abundant landward of the frontal zone at a location with consistently high abundance of the copepod Acartia tonsa, which is consumed by adult and larval bay anchovies. Large, significant changes in egg abundance were observed over both long (seasons) and short (<3 d) periods (Tukey 95% HSD multiple range tests). An El Nino-associated flood event caused the rapid evolution of a large, seaward-moving frontal system that initially had a negative effect on egg abundance. Spawning resumed in reduced salinity following passage of the front, demonstrating a level of plasticity in spawning response to salinity change. A stepwise regression model explained 92% of the variation in egg abundance and suggested that tidal amplitude was not a significant determinant of abundance. Instead, egg abundance appeared to be determined initially by pre-spawning prey supply and temperature, and subsequently by variable retention behind the frontal zone.

AB  - Successions of Jurassic strata located in the Arctic region normally yield rich assemblages of terrestrially-derived and marine palynomorphs, reflecting relatively warm air and sea-surface temperatures. The land plant floras were prone to the development of local communities and regional provincialism, whereas the marine biotas thrived across extensive open marine areas with high productivity, resulting in the rapid evolution of dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) following their earliest fossil record in the Triassic. Dinocysts exhibit low taxonomic richness and provide low biostratigraphic resolution throughout the Lower Jurassic sections. By contrast, they are diverse in Middle and Upper Jurassic strata where they provide excellent biostratigraphic markers for correlating and dating both surface and subsurface sections. Over twenty formal and informal biozonations based on the first and last occurrences of dinocysts have been erected in Alaska, Arctic Canada, the Barents Sea region, Greenland and northern Russia, many of which are correlated with macrofossils, including ammonites, that occur in the same sections. This paper presents a compilation of 214 Jurassic palynostratigraphic events (118 first occurrences and 96 last occurrences) that have regional chronostratigraphic value in the Circum-Arctic, based on their published records. Each event is correlated with the base of a chronostratigraphical unit (including formal stages and sub-Boreal ammonite zones), or as an estimated percentage above the base of the chronostratigraphical unit relative to the entire unit. The relationships of each event to stages and key fossil zonal schemes is shown on chronostratigraphic plots using the 2020 version of TimeScale Creator (R).

AB  - The accidentally introduced beetle Ophraella communa was first found in 1996 in Japan and has rapidly expanded its distribution range to include regions with substantially different climates. During this range expansion and subsequent establishment in new habitats, the life history traits of O.communa have changed depending on new habitat environmental conditions. In this study, we investigated the photoperiodic response of O.communa controlling its reproductive diapause, an important trait that adjusts the life cycle to local climate and phenology of host-plants. We examined temporal changes and geographical differences in this trait. In the Tsukuba population of O.communa, the diapause incidence under conditions of 12h light:12h dark (LD 12:12), 13:11 and 14:10 did not consistently increase or decrease during 2005-2012, although it fluctuated yearly. The diapause incidence in this period, however, was lower than that in 1999 reported previously and the critical day-length inducing diapause was shortened by >1h from 1999 to 2005. These results suggest that the photoperiodic response of O.communa shifted during this period. To examine geographical differences in this trait, we compared the Hirosaki, Morioka, Tsukuba and Koshi lines. The diapause incidence at LD13:11 was significantly different between the O.communa lines: 86.5% in the Hirosaki line (collected in 2010) , 81.4% in Morioka (collected in 2010), 45.0% in Tsukuba (collected in 2011) and 7.1% in Koshi (collected in 2009), and was positively correlated with the latitude of the origin. These results suggest that this trait shifted, responding to the environmental conditions in the colonized regions.

AB  - Environmental constraints can be determinant key factors conditioning predator life history evolution. Prey seems to have conditioned life history evolution in their ladybird predator, with the predators of aphids apparently presenting faster development, greater fecundity and shorter longevity than species preying on coccids. However a rigorous comparison has never been done. We hypothesize that aphids and coccids differ by their developmental rate, abundance, and distribution in the field, which act as ecological constraints promoting life history evolution in ladybird predators. Field data reveal that aphids are ephemeral resources available in the form of large colonies randomly distributed in the habitat whereas coccids form smaller colonies that tend to be aggregated in space and available for longer periods. A comparison in laboratory conditions of two predatory species belonging to the tribe Scymnini (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) show that the aphidophagous species lives at a faster pace than the coccidophagous: it develops faster, matures earlier, is more fecund, has a shorter reproductive life-span and allocate proportionally more fat in its gonads relative to soma. This indicates that the life histories of aphidophagous and coccidophagous ladybird predators appear to have evolved in response to particular patterns of prey availability in time and space. Under the light of these results, the existence of a slow-fast continuum in ladybirds is briefly addressed.

AB  - Climate plays a key role in shaping population trends and determining the geographic distribution of species because of limits in species' thermal tolerance. An evaluation of species tolerance to temperature change can therefore help predict their potential spatial shifts and population trends triggered by ongoing global warming. We assessed inter- and intraspecific variations in heat resistance in relation to body mass, local mean temperatures, and evolutionary relationships in 39 bumblebee species, a major group of pollinators in temperate and cold ecosystems, across 3 continents, 6 biomes, and 20 regions (2386 male specimens). Based on experimental bioassays, we measured the time before heat stupor of bumblebee males at a heatwave temperature of 40 degrees C. Interspecific variability was significant, in contrast to interpopulational variability, which was consistent with heat resistance being a species-specific trait. Moreover, cold-adapted species are much more sensitive to heat stress than temperate and Mediterranean species. Relative to their sensitivity to extreme temperatures, our results help explain recent population declines and range shifts in bumblebees following climate change.

AB  - During the downward trend of Quaternary global temperatures, crown-group marmots evolved to occupy harsh, seasonal environments at high latitudes and elevations. Marmots evolved hibernation and large body size, which allowed them to cope with a long, cold season with low, stressful ambient temperatures when food was unavailable. Harsh conditions during a short active season frequently cause reproductive failure and reproductive skipping in marmots. Seasonal phenology is controlled by a circannual rhythm that directs metabolic changes and fat accumulation for hibernation and reproduction. Metabolism and water balance in marmots are adapted to the low environmental temperatures of hibernation. Thus, marmots are subject to heat stress from solar radiation and high ambient temperatures during the active season. Energy conservation characterizes metabolism in marmots throughout the annual cycle: metabolic rates are lower than predicted from body size and decline during the active season, metabolism is actively suppressed to enter torpor, and most of the time during hibernation is spent at low metabolism in deep torpor. Young typically require 2 or more of the short active seasons to reach reproductive maturity and are retained at home, which leads to sociality based on kinship. Competition within the social group is expressed primarily as reproductive suppression, which delays the age of 1st reproduction that in turn strongly affects demography. Early snowmelt due to global warming may enable marmots to colonize new habitats or increase population growth. However, climate change most likely will diminish the ability of marmots to mobilize sufficient energy resources in a drier, warmer active season, which will reduce both survivorship and reproduction.

AB  - Fluid flows have proved to be an integral part of many metallurgical processing operations. Metal, slag, and gas flows invariably affect the viability, effectiveness, and efficiency, of our reactor vessels. The performance characteristics of our blast furnaces and steelmaking vessels, such as BOF's, OBM's, ladles, tundishes, and the moulds of continuous casting machines, are all strongly influenced by such flows. Similarly, liquid metal quality and cast micro-structures, are also bound up with the way fluids have flowed and interacted. In all these aspects, the rapid evolution in our techniques and abilities to mathematically and physically model single and multi-phase flows and their attendant heat and mass transfer processes, have contributed significantly to our understanding, and ability, to control and improve these metallurgical processing operations, and to develop new and better processes. The evolution and application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) over the past four decades has been particularly impressive. The author's many fine Japanese graduate students have made very valuable contributions to this new field of research for Process Metallurgists, as well as to the founding and scientific support of the McGill Metals Processing Centre, MMPC, following their return to Japan.

AB  - Hypothesis: Phenotypic variation in traits induced by different incubation temperatures does not persist into the lifetime of young lizards, and therefore contributes little to variation in long-term fitness.
   Organism: Western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis).
   Methods: Split-clutch laboratory incubation experiment including eggs from two different populations under two different incubation regimes, measurement of morphological traits at hatching, and tracking of morphology and temperature preference behaviour for 7 weeks after hatching.
   Results: Several morphological traits, including body mass, hindlimb length, inter-limb length, and tail length, initially differed between the two incubation treatments, but only the difference in tail length persisted to age 7 weeks. Thermal preference was relatively conserved, with juveniles showing no difference in mean selected body temperatures across treatments; however, warm-incubated lizards thermoregulated more precisely than their cool-incubated counterparts.
   Conclusion: Studies of incubation effects can reveal changes in animal phenotypes post-hatching, but if these effects do not persist, they may not be subject to natural selection and consequently be of little ecological relevance.

AB  - The delta(13)C record of total organic carbon in the Lake Baikal core BDP-93-2 over the last glacial/interglacial transition shows remarkable correlation with atmospheric CO2 fluctuations and the negative isotopic shift of 3.5-4 parts per thousand in response to the global increase in paleo-pCO(2) level. With rapid evolution of the Lake Baikal carbon cycle from full glacial to full interglacial modes, however, the pCO(2) signal in the Baikal delta(13)C sedimentary organic matter is inundated by the basin-wide productivity signal, in the Holocene. The Baikal diatom abundance record, as a paleotemperature proxy, lags behind the GISP2 ice core delta(18)O temperature proxy record by ca. 1 ka, possibly reflecting the response time of the Baikal ecosystem to major climatic transitions. There is no lag associated with the pronounced Younger Dryas cooling, however, suggesting a different forcing mechanism, with a short response time, for this abrupt climatic event in continental interior Asia. The phase difference observed between the diatom abundance and delta(13)C proxies in Lake Baikal care BDP-93-2 suggests their independent responses to different forcing mechanisms, further justifying their importance for paleoclimate reconstructions from Lake Baikal records.

AB  - The genetic architecture of adaptive traits is of key importance to predict evolutionary responses. Most adaptive traits are polygenic-i.e., result from selection on a large number of genetic loci-but most molecularly characterized traits have a simple genetic basis. This discrepancy is best explained by the difficulty in detecting small allele frequency changes (AFCs) across many contributing loci. To resolve this, we use laboratory natural selection to detect signatures for selective sweeps and polygenic adaptation. We exposed 10 replicates of a Drosophila simulans population to a new temperature regime and uncovered a polygenic architecture of an adaptive trait with high genetic redundancy among beneficial alleles. We observed convergent responses for several phenotypes-e.g., fitness, metabolic rate, and fat content-and a strong polygenic response (99 selected alleles; mean s = 0.059). However, each of these selected alleles increased in frequency only in a subset of the evolving replicates. We discerned different evolutionary paradigms based on the heterogeneous genomic patterns among replicates. Redundancy and quantitative trait (QT) paradigms fitted the experimental data better than simulations assuming independent selective sweeps. Our results show that natural D. simulans populations harbor a vast reservoir of adaptive variation facilitating rapid evolutionary responses using multiple alternative genetic pathways converging at a new phenotypic optimum. This key property of beneficial alleles requires the modification of testing strategies in natural populations beyond the search for convergence on the molecular level.

AB  - I summarize marine studies on plastic versus adaptive responses to global change. Due to the lack of time series, this review focuses largely on the potential for adaptive evolution in marine animals and plants. The approaches were mainly synchronic comparisons of phenotypically divergent populations, substituting spatial contrasts in temperature or CO2 environments for temporal changes, or in assessments of adaptive genetic diversity within populations for traits important under global change. The available literature is biased towards gastropods, crustaceans, cnidarians and macroalgae. Focal traits were mostly environmental tolerances, which correspond to phenotypic buffering, a plasticity type that maintains a functional phenotype despite external disturbance. Almost all studies address coastal species that are already today exposed to fluctuations in temperature, pH and oxygen levels. Recommendations for future research include (i) initiation and analyses of observational and experimental temporal studies encompassing diverse phenotypic traits (including diapausing cues, dispersal traits, reproductive timing, morphology) (ii) quantification of nongenetic trans-generational effects along with components of additive genetic variance (iii) adaptive changes in microbe-host associations under the holobiont model in response to global change (iv) evolution of plasticity patterns under increasingly fluctuating environments and extreme conditions and (v) joint consideration of demography and evolutionary adaptation in evolutionary rescue approaches.

AB  - Disentangling evolutionary forces that may interact to determine the patterns of genetic differentiation within and among wild populations is a major challenge in evolutionary biology. The objective of this study was to assess the genetic structure and the potential influence of several ecological variables on the extent of genetic differentiation at multiple spatial scales in a widely distributed species, the Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar. A total of 2775 anadromous fish were sampled from 51 rivers along the North American Atlantic coast and were genotyped using 13 microsatellites. A Bayesian analysis clustered these populations into seven genetically and geographically distinct groups, characterized by different environmental and ecological factors, mainly temperature. These groups were also characterized by different extent of genetic differentiation among populations. Dispersal was relatively high and of the same magnitude within compared to among regional groups, which contrasted with the maintenance of a regional genetic structure. However, genetic differentiation was lower among populations exchanging similar rates of local as opposed to inter-regional migrants, over the same geographical scale. This raised the hypothesis that gene flow could be constrained by local adaptation at the regional scale. Both coastal distance and temperature regime were found to influence the observed genetic structure according to landscape genetic analyses. The influence of other factors such as latitude, river length and altitude, migration tactic, and stocking was not significant at any spatial scale. Overall, these results suggested that the interaction between gene flow and thermal regime adaptation mainly explained the hierarchical genetic structure observed among Atlantic salmon populations.

AB  - The life-histories of exploited fish species, such as Pacific salmon, are vulnerable to a wide variety of anthropogenic stressors including climate change, selective exploitation and competition with hatchery releases for finite foraging resources. However, these stressors may generate unexpected changes in life-histories due to developmental linkages when species complete their migratory life cycle in different habitats. We used multivariate time-series models to quantify changes in the prevalence of different life-history strategies of sockeye salmon from Bristol Bay, Alaska, over the past half-century-specifically, how they partition their lives between freshwater habitats and the ocean. Climate warming has decreased the time spent by salmon in their natal freshwater habitat, as climate-enhanced growth opportunities have enabled earlier migration to the ocean. Migration from freshwater at a younger age, and increasing competition from wild and hatchery-released salmon, have tended to delay maturation toward the salmon spending an additional year feeding in the ocean. Models evaluating the effects of size-selective fishing on these patterns had only small support. These stressors combine to reduce the size-at-age of fish vulnerable to commercial fisheries and have increasingly favoured a single-age class, potentially affecting the age class complexity that stabilizes this highly reliable resource.

AB  - Contemporary climate change triggers a poleward range shift in many species. A growing number of studies document evolutionary changes in traits accelerating range expansion (such as growth rate and dispersal-related traits). In contrast, the direct impact of decreasing conspecific densities towards the very edge of the expansion front has been neglected. Density effects may, however, have a profound direct impact on traits involved in range expansion and influence range dynamics. In this study, we contrast the effects of high conspecific larval density typical for established populations and low larval density typical for newly founded populations at the edge of the expansion front on a set of larval traits that may affect the range dynamics in the poleward moving damselfly Coenagrion scitulum. We therefore ran an outdoor mesocosm experiment with a low- and high-density treatment close to the species' northern expansion front. Density effects on survival, growth rate and body size are scored both during the pre-winter growth period and during the subsequent winter period. Additionally, foraging activity was scored at the end of the pre-winter period and body condition [size-corrected body mass, fat content and activity of phenoloxidase (PO)] was scored at the end of the winter period. The low-density treatment had strong direct positive effects on survival, growth rate and body size of larvae before winter indicating relaxed competition. Lower foraging activity at the low-density treatment indicated higher food availability at low conspecific densities. Interestingly, the initial density treatment had stronger effect than densities experienced at the time of quantification on survival during the pre-freezing winter period and body condition estimates at the end of the experiment, indicating also delayed effects of the initial density treatment. Survival throughout a freezing period indicated extreme winter conditions are not likely a limiting factor in the range expansion of this Mediterranean species. The increased survival and individual growth rates (through causing shifts in voltinism) at low conspecific density will translate in increased population growth rates. Furthermore, nutritional advantages at low conspecific density may increase investment in dispersal ability. Together, these direct and delayed density-dependent effects that gradually increase towards the expansion front are expected to accelerate range expansion.

AB  - The Driftless Area in southeastern Minnesota is on the southwestern edge of the native range of Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis. It was assumed that native Brook Trout were extirpated from this region in the early 1900s due to degraded stream conditions and stockings of eastern-origin Brook Trout and European Brown Trout Salmo trutta. Our objectives were to examine Brook Trout populations in the region to determine their spatial and genetic distribution and quantify population characteristics. Information on presence or absence of Brook Trout was gathered by electrofishing 174 streams in southeastern Minnesota. Brook Trout were present in 68% of coldwater streams compared with only in 3% in the early 1970s. The increase is likely due to increasing stream discharge throughout the Driftless Area, enabling recolonization or successful establishment of stocked populations. Streams with higher base flow discharge also had higher abundance, larger size at maturity, and larger Brook Trout present. Genetic data on 74 populations were analyzed to characterize genetic variation within populations, assess genetic structure among populations, and determine possible origins. Numerous populations were not associated with known hatchery sources but were primarily composed of geographic groupings that could represent remnant lineages. Although population characteristics were similar among genetic origins, potentially remnant populations should be given conservation priority because they have proven their ability to sustain themselves in this region. Management actions that emphasize maintaining or increasing stream base flows throughout the region will likely enhance remnant Brook Trout populations in the Driftless Area.

AB  - Because biological invasions can be swift and are rarely examined immediately and/or followed over time, spatial genetic diversity analyses grounded in a well-developed body of theory are often used to reconstruct historical patterns of expansion. Unfortunately, the role of selection in shaping and potentially disrupting such reconstructions has seldom been examined. The mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus is a temperate, cold-adapted species native to northern Japan that has recently established populations on the island of Hawaii. We used variation at seven microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial locus to examine Hawaiian populations collected in 2004, shortly after its first detection, and then in 2010-2011. Samples were collected along an elevational/temperature gradient, ranging from sea level to 1,200 m. Specimens collected near sea level in 2004 from the earliest detected population exhibited high genetic diversity. Contrary to expectations that diversity would decrease outward from the point of introduction, in 2010-2011 high elevation populations had the greatest genetic diversity, while low elevation populations (including those with high diversity in 2004) now had lower diversity and were significantly differentiated from each other, suggesting severe bottlenecks. We hypothesize that differential survival across temperatures at high versus low elevations has subverted the expected genetic signature of an expanding population.

AB  - This paper reviews the observations of crater-like features on cometary nuclei. We compare potential crater sizes and morphologies, and we discuss the probability of impacts between small asteroids in the Main Belt and a comet crossing this region of the Solar System. Finally, we investigate the fate of the impactor and its chances of survival on the nucleus.
   We find that comets do undergo impacts although the rapid evolution of the surface erases most of the features and make craters difficult to detect. In the case of a collision between a rocky body and a highly porous cometary nucleus, two specific crater morphologies can be formed: a central pit surrounded by a shallow depression, or a pit, deeper than typical craters observed on rocky surfaces.
   After the impact, it is likely that a significant fraction of the projectile will remain in the crater. During its two years long escort of comet 67P/Churyumov Gerasimenko, ESA's mission Rosetta should be able to detect specific silicates signatures at the bottom of craters or crater-like features, as evidence of this contamination.
   For large craters, structural changes in the impacted region, in particular compaction of material, will affect the local activity. The increase of tensile strength can extinct the activity by preventing the gas from lifting up dust grains. On the other hand, material compaction can help the heat flux to travel deeper in the nucleus, potentially reaching unexposed pockets of volatiles, and therefore increasing the activity. Ground truth data from Rosetta will help us infer the relative importance of those two effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climatic changes are projected to result in rapid adaptive events with considerable phenotypic shifts. In order to reconstruct the impact of increased mean water temperatures during past decades and to reveal possible thermal micro-evolution, we applied a resurrection ecology approach using dormant eggs of the freshwater keystone species Daphnia galeata. To this end, we compared the adaptive response of D.galeata clones from Lake Constance of two different time periods, 1965-1974 (historical) versus 2000-2009 (recent), to experimentally increased temperature regimes. In order to distinguish between genetic versus environmentally induced effects, we performed a common garden experiment in a flow-through system and measured variation in life-history traits. Experimental thermal regimes were chosen according to natural temperature conditions during the reproductive period of D.galeata in Central European lakes, with one additional temperature regime exceeding the currently observable maximum (+2 degrees C). Increased water temperatures were shown to significantly affect measured life-history traits, and significant temperaturexclonal age interactions were revealed. Compared to historical clones, recent clonal lineages exhibited a shorter time to first reproduction and a higher survival rate, which may suggest temperature-driven micro-evolution over time but does not allow an explicit conclusion on the adaptive nature of such responses.

AB  - A component of metabolic scaling theory has worked towards understanding the influence of metabolism over the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. Specific models within this 'metabolic theory of biodiversity' (MTB) have addressed temperature gradients in speciation rate and species richness, but the scope of MTB has been questioned because of empirical departures from model predictions. In this study, we first show that a generalized MTB is not inconsistent with empirical patterns and subsequently implement an eco-evolutionary MTB which has thus far only been discussed qualitatively. More specifically, we combine a functional trait (body mass) approach and an environmental gradient (temperature) with a dynamic eco-evolutionary model that builds on the current MTB. Our approach uniquely accounts for feedbacks between ecological interactions (size-dependent competition and predation) and evolutionary rates (speciation and extinction). We investigate a simple example in which temperature influences mutation rate, and show that this single effect leads to dynamic temperature gradients in macroevolutionary rates and community structure. Early in community evolution, temperature strongly influences speciation and both speciation and extinction strongly influence species richness. Through time, niche structure evolves, speciation and extinction rates fall, and species richness becomes increasingly independent of temperature. However, significant temperature-richness gradients may persist within emergent functional (trophic) groups, especially when niche breadths are wide. Thus, there is a strong signal of both history and ecological interactions on patterns of species richness across temperature gradients. More generally, the successful implementation of an eco-evolutionary MTB opens the perspective that a process-based MTB can continue to emerge through further development of metabolic models that are explicit in terms of functional traits and environmental gradients.

AB  - A population's potential for rapid evolutionary adaptation can be estimated from the amount of genetic variation in fitness-related traits. Inshore populations of the mustard hill coral (Porites astreoides) have been shown to be more tolerant to thermal stress than offshore populations, but it is unclear whether this difference is due to long-term physiological acclimatization or genetic adaptation. Here, we evaluated variation in growth rate and survival among 38 families of juvenile recruits of P. astreoides spawned by colonies originating from inshore and offshore locations. Recruits were reared in a common garden for 5 weeks and then subjected to two thermal treatments (28 and 31 degrees C) for 2.5 weeks. The most significant effects were detected during the first 5 weeks, before thermal stress was applied: 27-30% of variance in growth and 94% of variance in recruit survival was attributable to parental effects. Genotyping of eight microsatellite loci indicated that the high early mortality of some of the recruit families was not due to higher inbreeding. Post treatment, parental effects diminished such that only 10-15% of variance in growth rate was explained, which most likely reflects the dissipation of maternal effects. However, offshore-origin recruits still grew significantly less under elevated temperature compared with inshore-origin recruits. These differences observed in naive juvenile corals suggest that population-level variation in fitness in response to different thermal environments has a genetic basis and could represent raw material for natural selection in times of climate change.

AB  - We evaluate the potential for decapod larvae to develop under temporally limited daily access to food across a broad thermal range. Larvae of the European lobster Homarus gammarus and velvet swimming crab Necora puber were successfully reared to juvenile and megalopa stages, respectively, at four temperatures (range 15-24 degrees C) under both permanent (24 h) and limited (4 h) daily access to prey. Survival was high in both species with no consistent effect of food limitation. Larvae developed faster with increasing temperature. Model selection indicated that limited access to food in N. puber slowed development from zoea III onwards by 10-25% depending on stage and temperature. Food limitation slowed development of H. gammarus in zoea III and stage IV by 6-30%, with significant interactions of food x temperature. Dry mass, carbon and nitrogen content of H. gammarus all decreased with temperature and were lower under limited access to food. Decapod larvae of the tested species show a high potential to survive and develop with a temporally patchy food resource, although a longer development and smaller body mass at the time of settlement may lead to fitness costs.

AB  - To enhance the epsilon-poly-L-lysine (epsilon-PL) productivity of Streptomyces sp. FEEL-1, a novel breeding strategy of atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis with streptomycin resistance screening was developed. After three rounds of recursive breeding, one strain designated AS3-14 was selected with a epsilon-PL yield of 2.91 g/L in shake-flask fermentation, which was elevated by 66.3 % compared to that of the parent strain FEEL-1. Subsequent batch and fed-batch fermentation was performed in a 5 L fermenter, and 8.2 g/L and 41.2 g/L epsilon-PL productions were achieved, which were 49.1 % and 68.1 % higher, respectively, than those of the parent strain. Analysis of enzyme activities indicated that key enzymes, e.g., hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase and aspartate kinase, were more active in the mutant AS3-14 than in FEEL-1, which might explain the enhanced epsilon-PL productivity. The results of amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis indicated that the genomic DNA of AS3-14 became more variable after ARTP mutagenesis. Therefore, ARTP combined with streptomycin resistance is an efficient breeding approach for the rapid evolution of epsilon-PL-producing Streptomyces strains.

AB  - 1. Integral projection models (IPMs) provide a powerful approach to investigate ecological and rapid evolutionary change in quantitative life-history characteristics and population dynamics. IPMs are constructed from functions that describe the demographic rates - survival, growth and reproduction - in relation to the characteristics of individuals and their environment. Currently, however, demographic rates are estimated using phenomenological regression models that lack a mechanistic representation of the biological processes that give rise to observed demographic variation. This lack of mechanistic underpinning limits the ability of the model to predict future dynamics under novel environmental conditions because the model ingredients pertain to current environmental conditions only. Here, we use dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory to construct DEB-IPMs based on a mechanistic representation of individual life-history trajectories. We derive the demographic functions describing growth and reproduction from a simple DEB growth model. The functions describing mortality and the association between parent and offspring characteristics do not follow DEB theory and hence are estimated from individual-level observations. We apply the DEB-IPM to two contrasting systems: the small, fast-reproducing bulb mite Rhizoglyphus robini and the large, slow-reproducing reef manta ray Manta alfredi. In both cases, predictions of population growth rate, lifetime reproductive success and generation time agree with empirical observations. In case of the bulb mite, predictions and observations even agree across different feeding conditions. If the DEB energetics model is accepted as describing growth and reproduction, DEB-IPMs can be parameterised using easy-to-collect life cycle information (growth rate, length at birth, maturation and old age) making them suitable for data-deficient species. Because species differ only in these DEB parameters, comparative studies of character and population dynamics between species are straightforward, particularly since DEB-IPMs can be extended to include population feedback on resources, of which we give an example. Most crucially, because DEB theory specifies growth and reproduction rates as explicitly dependent on environmental conditions such as food availability or temperature, DEB-IPMs provide a mechanistic platform to investigate the biological processes that determine joint change in phenotypic characters, life-history traits, population size and community structure.

AB  - Climate change is altering ecological and evolutionary processes across biological scales. These simultaneous effects of climate change pose a major challenge for predicting the future state of populations, communities and ecosystems. This challenge is further exacerbated by the current lack of integration of research focused on these different scales. We propose that integrating the fields of quantitative genetics and food web ecology will reveal new insights on how climate change may reorganize biodiversity across levels of organization. This is because quantitative genetics links the genotypes of individuals to population-level phenotypic variation due to genetic (G), environmental (E) and gene-by-environment (G x E) factors. Food web ecology, on the other hand, links population-level phenotypes to the structure and dynamics of communities and ecosystems. We synthesize data and theory across these fields and find evidence that genetic (G) and plastic (E and G x E) phenotypic variation within populations will change in magnitude under new climates in predictable ways. We then show how changes in these sources of phenotypic variation can rewire food webs by altering the number and strength of species interactions, with consequences for ecosystem resilience. We also find evidence suggesting there are predictable asymmetries in genetic and plastic trait variation across trophic levels, which set the pace for phenotypic change and food web responses to climate change. Advances in genomics now make it possible to partition G, E and G x E phenotypic variation in natural populations, allowing tests of the hypotheses we propose. By synthesizing advances in quantitative genetics and food web ecology, we provide testable predictions for how the structure and dynamics of biodiversity will respond to climate change.

AB  - Many ectotherms grow more slowly but mature at a larger size in colder environments, according to the pattern called the temperature-size rule. Thermal variation of cell size is suspected to be inherent in the origin of this pattern, but empirical testing of this hypothesis has been conducted in only a few taxa. In the laboratory, we reared two subspecies of the land snail Cornu aspersum (formerly Helix aspersa), C. a. aspersum and C. a. maximum, at two thermal regimes (15 and 20 degrees C), aiming to examine the relationship between cell size and adult mass across temperatures. The warmer environment led to larger adult mass in both taxa, contrary to the temperature-size rule. Using histological techniques, we found that snails grown at the warmer temperature produced heavier shells, smaller muscle and epithelial cells, but larger hepatopancreatic cells and nuclei. These results strongly suggest that the temperature-size rule for body size cannot be explained by a simple consequence of thermal sensitivity of cell size. Focusing on the patterns between the two taxa, we found that aspersum grew more slowly, with faster metabolic rates and smaller mass at the end of the experiment, when compared with maximum, regardless of temperature. The subspecies aspersum evolved larger muscular and epithelial cells than maximum, but both had a similar size of hepatopancreatic cells and a similar shell mass. Interestingly, when compared across a range of small body masses, aspersum had a heavier hepatopancreas than maximum. We propose that the evolutionary divergence between the two subspecies might involve a trade-off between growth and hepatopancreatic functions, but not a trade-off caused by the costs of shell production and maintenance of cell membranes.

AB  - Urbanization is an increasingly important dimension of global change, and urban areas likely impose significant natural selection on the species that reside within them. Although many species of plants and animals can survive in urban areas, so far relatively little research has investigated whether such populations have adapted (in an evolutionary sense) to their newfound milieu. Even less of this work has taken place in tropical regions, many of which have experienced dramatic growth and intensification of urbanization in recent decades. In the present study, we focus on the neotropical lizard, Anolis cristatellus. We tested whether lizard ecology and morphology differ between urban and natural areas in three of the most populous municipalities on the island of Puerto Rico. We found that environmental conditions including temperature, humidity, and substrate availability differ dramatically between neighboring urban and natural areas. We also found that lizards in urban areas use artificial substrates a large proportion of the time, and that these substrates tend to be broader than substrates in natural forest. Finally, our morphological data showed that lizards in urban areas have longer limbs relative to their body size, as well as more subdigital scales called lamellae, when compared to lizards from nearby forested habitats. This shift in phenotype is exactly in the direction predicted based on habitat differences between our urban and natural study sites, combined with our results on how substrates are being used by lizards in these areas. Findings from a common-garden rearing experiment using individuals from one of our three pairs of populations provide evidence that trait differences between urban and natural sites may be genetically based. Taken together, our data suggest that anoles in urban areas are under significant differential natural selection and may be evolutionarily adapting to their human-modified environments.

AB  - Despite the surging interest in the interactions between toxicants and non-chemical stressors, and in evolutionary ecotoxicology, we have poor knowledge whether these patterns differ among genotypes within a population. Warming and toxicants are two widespread stressors in aquatic systems that are known to modify each other's effects. We studied to what extent effects of sequential exposure to a heat spike and the pesticide esfenvalerate differed among genotypes in the water flea Daphnia magna. Esfenvalerate had similar negative effects on survival and body size across genotypes, and for most genotypes it increased time to maturation, yet the effects on the reproductive performance were only detected in some genotypes and were inconsistent in direction. Across genotypes, the heat spike increased the heat tolerance, yet the negative effects of the heat spike on survival, reproductive performance and body size, and the positive effects on grazing rate and the shortened time to maturation were only seen in some genotypes. Notably, the interaction type between both stressors differed among genotypes. In contrast to our expectation, the impact of esfenvalerate was only magnified by the heat spike in some genotypes and only for a subset of the traits. For survival and time to maturation, the interaction type for the same stressor combination covered all three categories: additions, synergisms and antagonisms. This illustrates that categorizing the interaction type between stressors at the level of populations may hide considerable intrapopulation variation among genotypes. Opposite to our expectation, the more pesticide-tolerant genotypes showed a stronger synergism between both stressors. Genotype-dependent interaction patterns between toxicants and non-chemical stressors may explain inconsistencies among studies and challenges ecological risk assessment based on single genotypes. The observed genetic differences in the responses to the (combined) stressors may fuel the evolution of the stressor interaction pattern, a largely ignored topic in evolutionary ecotoxicology.

AB  - Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are hydrophobic compounds deposited on the arthropod cuticle that are of functional significance with respect to stress tolerance, social interactions and mating dynamics. We characterized CHC profiles in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster at five levels: across a latitudinal transect in the eastern United States, as a function of developmental temperature during culture, across seasonal time in replicate years, and as a function of rapid evolution in experimental mesocosms in the field. Furthermore, we also characterized spatial and temporal changes in allele frequencies for SNPs in genes that are associated with the production and chemical profile of CHCs. Our data demonstrate a striking degree of parallelism for clinal and seasonal variation in CHCs in this taxon; CHC profiles also demonstrate significant plasticity in response to rearing temperature, and the observed patterns of plasticity parallel the spatiotemporal patterns observed in nature. We find that these congruent shifts in CHC profiles across time and space are also mirrored by predictable shifts in allele frequencies at SNPs associated with CHC chain length. Finally, we observed rapid and predictable evolution of CHC profiles in experimental mesocosms in the field. Together, these data strongly suggest that CHC profiles respond rapidly and adaptively to environmental parameters that covary with latitude and season, and that this response reflects the process of local adaptation in natural populations of D. melanogaster.

AB  - In the first days of life, the daily evaporative loss from premature neonates can reach up to 20% of body mass. Such loss can be reduced by increasing the air humidity inside the incubator. Neither passive humidification nor open loop systems allow high humidity rates to be maintained or easily controlled: at 34 degrees C, the maximum levels vary with the system from 40% to 77% of relative humidity. The skin evaporative exchanges between the neonate and the environment are directly proportional to the water vapour partial pressure difference between the neonate's skin and the air. An active closed loop system has been designed, which permits reliable and accurate control of humidity according to the water vapour partial pressure set, between 1 and 6kPa, in an air temperature range of 28-39 degrees C. It is characterised by variations of about 0.05kPa around the set value and a maximum humidification speed of 0.25kPa min(-1). The algorithm is based on optimal control and the dynamic programming principles. Test results place this active system above usual systems for its power, precision and adaptability. It is an exploitable tool in fundamental and clinical research, to precisely study the humidity effects on neonatal comfort and thermo-regulation evolution.

AB  - Temperature during embryonic development irreversibly determines gonadal sex in many oviparous reptiles. Although embryonic temperature also influences a number of other traits in these species. it is unclear whether such effects are primarily due to incubation temperature or to gonadal sex. Here we dissociated these normally confounding effects via hormonal manipulations of snapping turtle embryos (Chelydra serpentina), a species with temperature-dependent sex determination. We then ascertained temperature and xx effects on residual yolk mass, abdominal fat body mass: and total mass in neonates shortly after hatching or after one month without feeding. Yolk mass was initially affected by incubation temperature. clutch identity, and rh;ir interaction, but not gonadal sex. Yolk mass was not influenced by any of these variables 30 d after hatching. Fat mass was initially affected by temperature and clutch, but not sex. Gonadal sex did, however, affect fat mass at 30 d of age as did temperature and clutch. Incubation temperature affected total mass in a complex manner. There were significant clutch by temperature interactions initially, bur no main effect of temperature. These effects changed so that the temperature effect was significant bur interaction effects il ere nor detected at 30 d of age. Repeated measures analysis of total mass after hatching and at 30 d of age indicated that turtles from lower temperatures lost more mass than turtles From higher incubation temperatures, and that females lost more mass than malts. These data indicate that some hatchling traits were influenced directly by incubation temperature, whereas others were independently affected by; gonadal sex. These results are consistent with a leading hypothesis for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination.

AB  - In living organisms with sexual reproduction, the presence of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is common. The main explanations for this phenomenon are based on sexual selection or the fecundity advantage hypothesis (natural selection). Here, we tested Rensch's rule in species of the viviparous lizard genus Phymaturus; additionally, we tested if there is a pattern of sexual size dimorphism or if it depends upon other morphological traits. We found no evidence for Rensch's rule in these lizards. After testing for multiple or single regime evolutionary models, we found that body size most likely evolved under multiregime Ornstein-Uhlenbeck evolutionary model; the same was observed for abdomen width in females, a fecundity advantage hypothesis trait. For species with female biased SSD there is a positive relationship between snout-vent length and width of the belly, supporting the fecundity advantage hypothesis. Additionally, the relationship between brood size and brood mass with body size and body mass (respectively) were positive giving strength to the fecundity advantage hypothesis. Finally, our results show males did not show a clear pattern in relation to the sexual selection hypothesis, probably because sexual selection is a complex aspect that involves behavior and color. On the other hand, female body size and reproductive output are related to mean seasonal air temperature and its combination with mean annual air temperature in an evolutionary fashion framework, such as fecundity advantage hypothesis in these lizards.

AB  - Alpine biotas are paradigmatic of the countervailing roles of geographical isolation and dispersal during diversification. In temperate regions, repeated distributional shifts driven by Pleistocene climatic oscillations produced both recurrent pulses of population fragmentation and opportunities for gene flow during range expansions. Here, we test whether a model of divergence in isolation vs. with gene flow is more likely in the diversification of flightless alpine grasshoppers of the genus Podisma from the Iberian Peninsula. The answer to this question can also provide key insights about the pace of evolution. Specifically, if the data fit a divergence in isolation model, this suggests rapid evolution of reproductive isolation. Genomic data confirm a Pleistocene origin of the species complex, and multiple analytical approaches revealed limited asymmetric historical hybridization between two taxa. Genomic-based demographic reconstructions, spatial patterns of genetic structure and range shifts inferred from palaeodistribution modelling suggest severe range contraction accompanied by declines in effective population sizes during interglacials (i.e., contemporary populations confined to sky islands are relicts) and expansions during the coldest stages of the Pleistocene in each taxon. Although limited hybridization during secondary contact leads to phylogenetic uncertainty if gene flow is not accommodated when estimating evolutionary relationships, all species exhibit strong genetic cohesiveness. Our study lends support to the notion that the accumulation of incipient differences during periods of isolation were sufficient to lead to lineage persistence, but also that the demographic changes, dispersal constraints and spatial distribution of the sky islands themselves mediated species diversification in temperate alpine biotas.

AB  - Climate change is predicted to increase the average global air temperature by up to 4.0 A degrees C by the end of the century. This increased temperature could have negative effects on many life history traits that are closely linked to fitness. Many species will therefore have to adapt to the warmer environment, but life history traits often have limited additive genetic variance. Here, we investigated population demographics and the evolutionary response of life history traits, as well as genetic diversity in guppies (Poecilia reticulata), in response to an experimentally increased temperature. There were fewer successful pregnancies, smaller brood sizes, and males matured earlier at a higher temperature as compared to control populations. However, there was no sign of an evolutionary response in these traits after 24 months of exposure to the increased temperature. We also found that population size, brood survivorship, sex ratio, and male length at maturity were unaffected by the increased temperature. Genetic diversity decreased rapidly in the increased temperature populations at a rate equivalent to an effective population size of only one quarter of the controls, revealing a clear signature of selection in response to increased temperature. This genetic erosion, however, could hamper the adaptive potential of the populations to other environmental changes associated with climate change.

AB  - Laboratory insect rearing provides well-developed tested insects for research in general biology, pest science and development of pest management technology and products. The effects of environmental conditions on various traits in laboratory populations are often extrapolated to field populations; for example, the thermal performances of laboratory populations are used to predict the phenology and abundance of wild pest populations. However, these studies generally do not consider the potential rapid evolution of the laboratory populations. Therefore, it is not certain whether laboratory populations reflect the performance of field populations in natural fluctuating and sometimes extreme conditions. Here, we used a global insect pest, the English grain aphid [Sitobion avenae (Hemiptera: Aphididae)] as the model system, to compare the demography of field and laboratory populations experimentally under constant and ecologically relevant fluctuating temperatures. Our results indicated that the field population adapted better to fluctuating temperatures and high temperatures. By contrast, the laboratory population adapted better to mild constant temperatures but reduced ability to withstand extremely high temperatures under diurnal fluctuations and chronic high temperatures. Therefore, caution is needed when extending the ecological effects of temperature from laboratory populations to wild populations, especially in environments with extreme events. Laboratory populations require regular replenishing or rearing under fluctuating temperature conditions to maintain the genetic diversity and prevent rapid adaptation to rearing environments.

AB  - Local selection can promote phenotypic divergence despite gene flow across habitat mosaics, but adaptation itself may generate substantial barriers to genetic exchange. In plants, life-history, phenology, and mating system divergence have been proposed to promote genetic differentiation in sympatry. In this study, we investigate phenotypic and genetic variation in Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflowers) across a geothermal soil mosaic in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Plants from thermal annual and nonthermal perennial habitats were heritably differentiated for life-history and mating system traits, consistent with local adaptation to the ephemeral thermal-soil growing season. However, genome-wide genetic variation primarily clustered plants by geographic region, with little variation sorting by habitat. The one exception was an extreme thermal population also isolated by a 200 m geographical gap of no intermediate habitat. Individual inbreeding coefficients (F-IS) were higher (and predicted by trait variation) in annual plants and annual pairs showed greater isolation by distance at local (<1 km) scales. Finally, YNP adaptation does not reuse a widespread inversion that underlies M. guttatus life-history ecotypes range-wide, suggesting a novel genetic mechanism. Overall, this work suggests that life-history and mating system adaptation strong enough to shape individual mating patterns does not necessarily generate incipient speciation without geographical barriers.

AB  - Thermal reaction norms of ectotherms exhibit a distinctive latitudinal pattern: the temperature at which performance is maximized coincides with the mean habitat temperature in tropical ectotherms but exceeds the mean temperature in temperate ectotherms. We hypothesize, on the basis of Jensen's inequality, that this pattern is driven by latitudinal variation in seasonal temperature fluctuations. We test this hypothesis with an eco-evolutionary model that integrates the quantitative genetics of reaction norm evolution with stage-structured population dynamics, which we parameterize with data from insects. We find that thermal optima of temperate and Mediterranean species evolve to exceed the mean habitat temperature if seasonal fluctuations are strong, while the thermal optimum of tropical species evolves to coincide with the mean habitat temperature if fluctuations are weak. Importantly, ecological dynamics can impose a constraint on reaction norm evolution. Tropical species cannot tolerate an increase in seasonal fluctuations at the high mean habitat temperature it experiences, while the temperate species cannot tolerate a reduction in seasonal fluctuations if the mean temperature is higher. In both cases, stochastic extinction during periods of low abundances precludes adaptation to a novel thermal environment. Our findings suggest a potential directionality in colonization success. Tropical ectotherms, because of their high thermal optima, can successfully colonize temperate habitats, while temperate ectotherms, because of their low optima, are less successful in colonizing tropical habitats.

AB  - Aim The influence of anthropogenic climate change on organisms is an area of great scientific concern. Increasingly there is recognition that abrupt climate transitions have occurred over the late Quaternary; studies of these shifts may yield insights into likely biotic responses to contemporary warming. Here, we review research undertaken over the past decade investigating the response of Neotoma (woodrats) body size and distribution to climate change over the late Quaternary (the last 40,000 years). By integrating information from woodrat palaeomiddens, historical museum specimens and field studies of modern populations, we identify potential evolutionary responses to climate change occurring over a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Specifically, we characterize climatic thresholds in the past that led to local species extirpation and/or range alterations rather than in situ adaptation, and apply them to anticipate potential biotic responses to anthropogenic climate change.
   Location Middens were collected at about 55 sites scattered across the western United States, ranging from about 34 to 46 degrees N and about 104 to 116 degrees W, respectively. Data for modern populations were drawn from studies conducted in Death Valley, California, Missoula, Montana and the Sevilleta LTER site in central New Mexico.
   Methods We analysed faecal pellets from midden series collected at numerous cave sites across the western United States. From these we estimated body mass using techniques validated in earlier studies. We compared body size fluctuations at different elevations in different regions and integrated these results with studies investigating temperature-body size tradeoffs in modern animals. We also quantify the rapidity of the size changes over the late Quaternary to estimate the evolutionary capacity of woodrats to deal with predicted rates of anthropogenic climate change over the next century.
   Results We find remarkable similarities across the geographical range to late Quaternary climate change. In the middle of the geographical range woodrats respond in accordance to Bergmann's rule: colder climatic conditions select for larger body size and warmer conditions select for smaller body size. Patterns are more complicated at range boundaries, and local environmental conditions influence the observed response. In general, woodrat body size fluctuates with approximately the same amplitude and frequency as climate; there is a significant and positive correlation between woodrat body size and generalized climate proxies (such as ice core records). Woodrats have achieved evolutionary rates of change equal to or greater than those needed to adapt in situ to anthropogenic climate change.
   Main conclusions In situ body size evolution is a likely outcome of climate change, and such shifts are part of a normal spectrum of adaptation. Woodrats appear to be subject to ongoing body size selection in response to fluctuating environmental conditions. Allometric considerations suggest that these shifts in body size lead to substantial changes in the physiology, life history and ecology of woodrats, and on their direct and indirect interactions with other organisms in the ecosystem. Our work highlights the importance of a finely resolved and long-term record in understanding biotic responses to climatic shifts.

AB  - To reach the reduced carbon emission targets proposed by the Paris agreement, one of the widely proposed decarbonizing strategies, referred to as negative emissions technologies (NETs), is the production and combustion of bioenergy crops in conjunction with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). However, concerns have been increasingly raised that relying on the potential of BECCS to achieve negative emissions could result in delayed reductions in gross CO(2)emissions, with consequent high risk of overshooting global temperature targets. We focus on two particular issues: the carbon efficiency and payback time of bioenergy use in BECCS and the potential constraints on the supply of bioenergy. The simplistic vision of BECCS is that 1 tonne of CO(2)captured in the growth of biomass equates to 1 tonne of CO(2)sequestered geologically, but this cannot be the case as CO(2)is emitted by variable amounts during the lifecycle from crop establishment to sequestration below ground in geological formations. The deployment of BECCS is ultimately reliant on the availability of sufficient, sustainably sourced, biomass. The two most important factors determining this supply are land availability and land productivity. The upper bounds of the area estimates required correspond to more than the world's harvested land for cereal production. To achieve these estimates of biomass availability requires the rapid evolution of a multitude of technological, social, political and economic factors. Here, we question whether, because of the limited sustainable supply of biomass, BECCS should continue to be considered the dominant NET in IPCC and other scenarios achieving the Paris targets, or should it be deemed no longer fit for purpose?

AB  - Thermal flight performance curves (TFPCs) may be a useful proxy for determining dispersal on daily timescales in winged insect species. Few studies have assessed TFPCs across a range of species under standard conditions despite that they may be useful in predicting variation in performance, abundance or geographic range shifts with forecast climate variability. Indeed, the factors determining realized dispersal within and among flying insect species are generally poorly understood. To better understand how flight performance may be correlated with geographic range extent and potential latitudinal climate variability, we estimated the thermal performance curves of flight ability in 11 Drosophilidae species (in 4 degrees C increments across 16-28 degrees C) after standard laboratory rearing for two generations. We tested if key morphological, evolutionary or ecological factors (e.g. species identity, sex, body mass, wing loading, geographic range size) predicted traits of TFPCs (including optimum temperature, maximum performance, thermal breadth of performance) or flight ability (success/failure to fly). Although several parameters of TFPCs varied among species these were typically not statistically significant probably owing to the relatively small pool of species assessed and the limited trait variation detected. The best explanatory model of these flight responses across species included significant positive effects of test temperature and wing area. However, the rank of geographic distribution breadth and phylogeny failed to explain significant variation in most of the traits, except for thermal performance breadth, of thermal flight performance curves among these 11 species. Future studies that employ a wider range of Drosophilidae species, especially if coupled with fine-scale estimates of species' environmental niches, would be useful.

AB  - Previous work has suggested that zebra mussel populations differ in temperature tolerance and researchers have hypothesized that these differences have been caused by natural selection. For selection to act on a phenotypic character such as heat tolerance, there must be additive genetic variation for the character within populations. Individuals must have different alleles at loci that contribute to measurable differences in the phenotypic character of interest. We tested the hypothesis that heat tolerance of zebra mussel veligers has an additive genetic component and is therefore heritable. We used a full-sib, half-sib design with a large number of full-sib families (20), half-sib families (5), and offspring (averaging 41) per family (estimated power, beta = 0.75). We exposed family groups to a lethal temperature of 34degreesC and determined individual time-to-death. Our best estimate of heritability (which can range from 0 to 1) was -0.125 ( +/-0.095), which implies that heritability of heat tolerance among veligers was extremely low. These results are surprising given the high genetic diversity reported for North American zebra mussel populations. A lack of additive genetic variation for heat tolerance within the studied population means that heat tolerance of the veliger stage is not likely to increase further via natural selection. Further studies examining both the veliger and adult stages, and examining populations in different watersheds are required to show whether this lack of variation is widespread among North American zebra mussel populations.

AB  - The complex effects of global climate change on freshwater ecosystems limit our ability to predict biological responses in a standard way and may compromise ecosystem management with respect to potential changes. I present a theoretical framework that shows the usefulness of resurrection ecology for standardizing cross-system comparisons of ecological responses to global climate change. Resurrection ecology makes use of plant seed and animal resting-egg (propagule) banks that integrate past environmental histories in the gene pools of their organisms. Resurrected organisms that have undergone different periods of dormancy can be studied comparatively using evolutionary/genetic and experimental approaches. Both approaches combined can provide insights into how the dimensions of species' ecological niches have shifted over time and could help reveal whether direct effects of climate change (increased temperatures and CO2 concentrations and hydrological alterations) or other anthropogenic stressors (e.g., contamination, landuse change) have caused microevolution. Insights gained from resurrection ecology could be used to manage gene flow between populations and to help prevent extinctions of threatened populations. These insights could be used to help manage ecosystem structure and function and maintain ecological sustainability. However, our ability to apply results from resurrection ecology to organisms that do not have long-term dormancy stages in their life cycles may be limited, and the usefulness of resurrection ecology will have to be evaluated along gradients of hydroperiod and flood frequency, which may determine rates of microevolution in aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Resting metabolic rate (RMR), i.e. spent energy necessary to maintain basic life functions, is a basic component of energy budget in ectotherms. The evolution of RMR through natural selection rests on the premise of its non-zero repeatability and heritability, i.e. consistent variation within individual lifetimes and resemblance between parents and their offspring, respectively. Joint estimates of RMR repeatability and heritability are missing in ectotherms, however, which precludes estimations of the evolutionary potential of this trait. We examined RMR repeatability and heritability in a long-lived ectotherm, the alpine newt (Ichthyosaura alpestris). Individual RMR was repeatable over both six-month (0.28 +/- 0.09 [SE]) and five-year (0.16 +/- 0.07) periods. While there was no resemblance between parent and offspring RMR (0.21 +/- 0.34), the trait showed similarity among offspring within families (broad-sense heritability; 0.25 +/- 0.09). Similar repeatability and broad-sense heritability values in parental and offspring generations, respectively, and non-conclusive narrow-sense heritability suggest the contribution of non-additive genetic factors to total phenotypic variance in this trait. We conclude that RMR evolutionary trajectories are shaped by other processes than natural selection in this long-lived ectotherm.

AB  - Distributions of non-native fish represent the outcome of a match between the habitat and the traits of a given species. Thermal tolerance, in particular, is highly variable among species and is one of the dominant organismal traits limiting the establishment and persistence of non-native species. Population and individual variation in thermal tolerance has implications for ecological processes such as the establishment of non-native species, especially when non-native species are introduced at the periphery of their thermal niche. Cold tolerance of wild-caught (escaped) and farm-raised (farmed) populations of green swordtail (Xiphophorus hellerii) was determined using field surveys and thermal tolerance methodology to examine whether populations exhibit predictable patterns of cold tolerance distributed across the landscape. The green swordtail, native to tropical Central America, is common in the ornamental trade with some evidence of establishment in subtropical Florida, USA. Seven escaped or farmed populations were examined: one import farmed (Thailand), two Florida farmed, two interior Florida escaped and two coastal Florida escaped. Highly variable chronic lethal minimum temperatures (CLmin) were found for individual fish, ranging from 5.5 to 11.3 degrees C. Significant population differences were also found where escaped populations (range 6.1-7.1 degrees C) exhibited lower CLmin than farmed populations (7.9-8.0 degrees C) and were nearly 50 % lower than those imported from Thailand (8.9 degrees C). The field exposure experiment revealed similar patterns; escaped populations exhibited greater survival during cold January conditions. Escaped populations were captured throughout the year, suggesting locally persistent populations. Whether of genetic or plastic origins, variation in thermal tolerance shown here has implications for the persistence and predicted range of introduced species.

AB  - Global change is altering biodiversity locally and globally and subsequently affecting the dynamics of communities and ecosystems. Biodiversity can be impacted both at the interspecific (i.e., species composition of communities) and at the intraspecific (evolutionary modification of phenotypic traits through selection or plasticity) levels. Changes in intraspecific diversity have been demonstrated to generate evolutionary feedbacks acting on ecological dynamics. Quantifying the role of intraspecific trait variation, global change and their interactions on ecological dynamics is of utmost importance. Here, we used the range-expanding dragonfly Crocothemis erythraea as a model species to test the relative effects of intraspecific trait variation in larvae and thermal conditions on the dynamics of freshwater community and ecosystem functioning. Using experimental mesocosms, we manipulated intraspecific trait variation arising from genetic (G), early developmental environment (E-E) and late developmental environment (E-L) contributions in a full factorial design. We showed that intraspecific trait variation arising from genetic effects has the strongest consequences on community and ecosystem dynamics relative to trait variation driven by the thermal environment (E-E and E-L). Importantly, the ecological effects of trait variation due to genetic effects were partly modulated by thermal conditions (G x E-L, and to a lesser extent G x E-E interactions) and varied among ecological response variables. For instance, the strongest G x E-L effects were observed on primary productivity and zooplankton dynamics. Trait variation driven by plasticity related to early or late developmental environments has an overall weak effect on ecological dynamics. Intraspecific trait variation induced by genetic effects can affect ecological dynamics (evo-to-eco dynamics) more strongly than variation induced by the developmental environment. However, they likely interact to modulate the structure of communities and the functioning of ecosystems, highlighting the strong context (environmental) dependency of evo-to-eco dynamics.

AB  - The extent to which global change will impact the long-term persistence of species depends on their evolutionary potential to adapt to future conditions. While the number of studies that estimate the standing levels of adaptive genetic variation in populations under predicted global change scenarios is growing all the time, few studies have considered multiple environments simultaneously and even fewer have considered evolutionary potential in multivariate context. Because conditions will not be constant, adaptation to climate change is fundamentally a multivariate process so viewing genetic variances and covariances over multivariate space will always be more informative than relying on bivariate genetic correlations between traits. A multivariate approach to understanding the evolutionary capacity to cope with global change is necessary to avoid misestimating adaptive genetic variation in the dimensions in which selection will act. We assessed the evolutionary capacity of the larval stage of the marine polychaete Galeolaria caespitosa to adapt to warmer water temperatures. Galeolaria is an important habitat-forming species in Australia, and its earlier life-history stages tend to be more susceptible to stress. We used a powerful quantitative genetics design that assessed the impacts of three temperatures on subsequent survival across over 30 000 embryos across 204 unique families. We found adaptive genetic variation in the two cooler temperatures in our study, but none in the warmest temperature. Based on these results, we would have concluded that this species has very little capacity to evolve to the warmest temperature. However, when we explored genetic variation in multivariate space, we found evidence that larval survival has the potential to evolve even in the warmest temperatures via correlated responses to selection across thermal environments. Future studies should take a multivariate approach to estimating evolutionary capacity to cope with global change lest they misestimate a species' true adaptive potential.

AB  - Poleward range expansions are observed for an increasing number of species, which may be an effect of global warming during the past decades. However, it is still not clear in how far these expansions reflect simple geographical shifts of species ranges, or whether new genetic adaptations play a role as well. Here, we analyse the expansion of the wasp spider Argiope bruennichi into Northern Europe during the last century. We have used a range-wide sampling of contemporary populations and historical specimens from museums to trace the phylogeography and genetic changes associated with the range shift. Based on the analysis of mitochondrial, microsatellite and SNP markers, we observe a higher level of genetic diversity in the expanding populations, apparently due to admixture of formerly isolated lineages. Using reciprocal transplant experiments for testing overwintering tolerance, as well as temperature preference and tolerance tests in the laboratory, we find that the invading spiders have possibly shifted their temperature niche. This may be a key adaptation for survival in Northern latitudes. The museum samples allow a reconstruction of the invasion's genetic history. A first, small-scale range shift started around 1930, in parallel with the onset of global warming. A more massive invasion of Northern Europe associated with genetic admixture and morphological changes occurred in later decades. We suggest that the latter range expansion into far Northern latitudes may be a consequence of the admixture that provided the genetic material for adaptations to new environmental regimes. Hence, global warming could have facilitated the initial admixture of populations and this resulted in genetic lineages with new habitat preferences.

AB  - Background: Temperature changes dramatically throughout the growing season in temperate latitudes, and seasonal changes in temperature are especially pronounced in alpine lakes where water stratifies into distinct thermal layers during summer.
   Hypothesis: Populations are expected to maintain a greater degree of plasticity in more heterogeneous environments, such as when lake stratification occurs.
   Organism: We studied seasonal variation in plasticity of a population of Daphnia, a key grazer in alpine lakes.
   Methods: We isolated maternal lines of Daphnia pulicaria from Blue Lake (Sierra Nevada, CA) at four different times throughout the growing season, then measured phenotypic traits and survivorship after individuals were reared at two temperatures (17 degrees C and 24 degrees C).
   Results: We found mixed evidence for the role of thermal variation in maintaining plasticity. Thermal plasticity for offspring number and age at maturity varied seasonally; however, inconsistent with our hypothesis, neither response was related to stratification. Similarly, we observed lower plasticity for the clutch interval when the lake experienced peak thermal stratification in mid-summer compared with early-fall conditions. In contrast, plasticity for critical maximum temperature (CTmax) was highest during peak stratification. As CTmax is a direct measurement of upper thermal limits, it should be related to maximum temperature experienced in the water column. Thus, this result is consistent with a positive correlation between thermal variation and plasticity.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that the degree of plasticity in response to temperature varies throughout the season in relation to thermal stratification, with different life-history traits showing distinct seasonal patterns of plasticity.

AB  - Agricultural settings are hypothesized to impose strong selection on invading weed species, and the direction of selection can be consistent across many generations, depending on crop-rotation schedules. Because the history of selection is often known, agricultural environments provide a useful experimental setting for studies testing mechanisms of adaptation and rates of evolutionary response. Here, two populations of Abutilon theophrasti with known evolutionary histories of competing either in agricultural or nonagricultural settings were reciprocally transplanted across experimental treatments simulating the site of origin ( rotating corn and soybean cultivation, local weeds, or no-competition control). Consistent with hypotheses of local adaptation, the agricultural population had higher fitness than the nonagricultural population in the cornfield treatment. The nonagricultural population had higher fitness in the no-competition control. Because weedy, nonagricultural sites are typically patchy and consist of both high- and low-density (i.e., noncompetitive) microsites, the observed population differences in fitness in the no-competition control also indicate local adaptation. In addition to fitness, the two populations differed in the expression of life-history traits such that the life-history of the agricultural population was accelerated relative to the nonagricultural population. The observed life-history differences probably reflect adaptive synchronization of life-history events to the shorter growth season duration of agricultural relative to nonagricultural sites. Because the two experimental populations have histories of only 10 - 50 yr in the site of origin, the results provide evidence of rapid differentiation.

AB  - Experimentally elevated testosterone has been shown to increase the daily activity period of free-ranging lizards, but it is unknown whether the effect depends upon additional factors present in nature (i.e., conspecific interactions) or whether it can be elicited in the laboratory. In a relatively simple laboratory environment, male Mountain Spiny Lizards (Sceloporus jarrovi) implanted with testosterone had significantly greater activity levels throughout the day than sham-implanted males. Differences were greatest during the morning and late afternoon, with testosterone-treated males more likely to be out earlier and to stay out later. This general result was repeated in both spring and fall experiments using separate groups of males. Although testosterone-treated males were more active (i.e., out in the open) than control males, there was not a significant difference in the frequency of movements (>20 cm), nor did the groups differ in selected body temperature in their home cages. Nonetheless, testosterone-implanted males lost significantly more body mass than controls over the course of the experiments. Because the effect of testosterone on daily activity period occurs in the laboratory as well as in the field, it is suggested that the effect is not dependent upon interactions with complex environmental stimuli.

AB  - Natural populations are constantly exposed to fluctuating environmental changes that negatively affect their fitness in unpredictable ways. While theoretical models show the possibility of counteracting these environmental changes through rapid evolutionary adaptations, there have been few empirical studies demonstrating such adaptive tracking in natural populations. Here, we analyzed environmental data, fitness-related phenotyping and genomic time-series data sampled over 3 years from a natural Chironomus riparius (Diptera, Insecta) population to address this question. We show that the population's environment varied significantly on the time scale of the sampling in many selectively relevant dimensions, independently of each other. Similarly, phenotypic fitness components evolved significantly on the same temporal scale (mean 0.32 Haldanes), likewise independent from each other. The allele frequencies of 367,446 SNPs across the genome showed evidence of positive selection. Using temporal correlation of spatially coherent allele frequency changes revealed 35,574 haplotypes with more than one selected SNP. The mean selection coefficient for these haplotypes was 0.30 (s.d. = 0.68). The frequency changes of these haplotypes clustered in 46 different temporal patterns, indicating concerted, independent evolution of many polygenic traits. Nine of these patterns were strongly correlated with measured environmental variables. Enrichment analysis of affected genes suggested the implication of a wide variety of biological processes. Thus, our results suggest overall that the natural population of C. riparius tracks environmental change through rapid polygenic adaptation in many independent dimensions. This is further evidence that natural selection is pervasive at the genomic level and that evolutionary and ecological time scales may not differ at all, at least in some organisms.

AB  - Thermal adaptation theory predicts that thermal specialists evolve in environments with low temporal and high spatial thermal variation, whereas thermal generalists are favored in environments with high temporal and low spatial variation. The thermal environment of many organisms is predicted to change with globally increasing temperatures and thermal specialists are presumably at higher risk than thermal generalists. Here we investigated critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and preferred temperature (T-p) in populations of the common pond snail (Radix balthica) originating from a small-scale system of geothermal springs in northern Iceland, where stable cold (ca. 7 degrees C) and warm (ca. 23 degrees C) habitats are connected with habitats following the seasonal thermal variation. Irrespective of thermal origin, we found a common T-p for all populations, corresponding to the common temperature optimum (T-opt) for fitness-related traits in these populations. Warm-origin snails had lowest CTmax. As our previous studies have found higher chronic temperature tolerance in the warm populations, we suggest that there is a trade-off between high temperature tolerance and performance in other fitness components, including tolerance to chronic thermal stress. T-p and CTmax were positively correlated in warm-origin snails, suggesting a need to maintain a minimum "warming tolerance" (difference in CTmax and habitat temperature) in warm environments. Our results highlight the importance of high mean temperature in shaping thermal performance curves.

AB  - The introduced beetle Ophraella communa LeSage has adapted to local environments in Japan in a short period by adjusting the photoperiodic response for induction of reproductive diapause. Based on these results, we predicted that the O. communa population has significant genetic variation in this trait on which natural selection should act. To examine the type and amount of genetic variation in photoperiodic response in O. communa, we performed artificial selection on this trait in opposite directions, i. e., directions of diapausing and nondiapausing under a photoperiod of 13: 11 (L: D) h, using three Tsukuba (Japan) lines derived from different years (2005, 2006, and 2012). Bidirectional selection shifted the diapause incidence to 100% in six or seven generations (diapausing selection) or 0% in five to eight generations (nondiapausing selection). The offspring produced by hybridization between diapausing and nondiapausing lines exhibited a wide range of diapause incidence under a photoperiod of 13: 11 (L: D) h, depending on the differences in the number of selected generations between the two parental lines. These results show that the photoperiodic response of O. communa is not inherited in a simple Mendelian manner but under polygenic control. Based on the results of artificial selection, we estimated the heritability of photoperiodic response, assuming polygenic inheritance. The heritability estimates were 0.770 to 0.856 in diapausing lines and 0.208 to 0.620 in nondiapausing lines, indicating substantial genetic variation in this trait. Thus, genetic variation in photoperiodic response of O. communa is one factor allowing the beetle to adapt rapidly to newly colonized habitats.

AB  - The composition of tissue and membrane fatty acids in ectothermic vertebrates is influenced by both temperature acclimation and diets. If such changes in body lipid composition and thermal physiology were linked, a diet-induced change in body lipid composition should result in a change in thermal physiology. We therefore investigated whether the selected body temperature of the agamid lizard Amphibolarus nuchalis (body mass 20 g) is influenced by the lipid composition of dietary fatty acids and whether diet-induced changes in thermal physiology are correlated with changes in body lipid composition. The selected body temperature in two groups of lizards was indistinguishable before dietary treatments. The selected body temperature in lizards after 3 weeks on a diet rich in saturated fatty acids rose by 2.1 degrees C (photophase) and 3.3 degrees C (scotophase), whereas the body temperature of lizards on a diet rich in unsaturated fatty acids fell by 1.5 degrees C (photophase) and 2.0 degrees C (scotophase). Significant diet-induced differences were observed in the fatty acid composition of depot fat, liver and muscle. These observations suggest that dietary lipids may influence selection of body temperature in ectotherms via alterations of body lipid composition.

AB  - Balancing the disparate objectives of fishery augmentation and conservation of an endemic fish population presents a substantial challenge. In the case of Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery (Warm Springs Hatchery), strategies for achieving both objectives included incorporation of natural fish into the hatchery broodstock and restricting proportions of hatchery fish on the spawning grounds. The hatchery has been more successful in implementing the latter than the former. We analyzed 76 single nucleotide polymorphism markers in Spring Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha collected from the Warm Springs River in 1976-1977 (prior to hatchery production) and 2001-2011 (posthatchery) to examine whether the genetic characteristics of the endemic population had changed during that time. Pre- and posthatchery collections clustered together when compared with those from Round Butte Hatchery, which has a nearby segregated program, and other Columbia River populations. The difference between pre- and posthatchery collections was nonsignificant, but posthatchery samples exhibited significantly lower expected heterozygosity. We observed some evidence of reduced effective size and increased genetic drift in fish produced at Warm Springs Hatchery (relative to natural-origin fish) and even stronger evidence of this in fish produced at Round Butte Hatchery. We conclude that natural-origin Chinook Salmon returning to the Warm Springs River form a distinct group within the interior Columbia Basin spring-run lineage and have changed very little over the past eight generations. We further speculate that differences between hatchery-and natural-origin fish at Warm Springs Hatchery are expected to increase if hatchery operations remain static (i.e., little integration of natural-origin fish and incorporation of Round Butte Hatchery fish in the broodstock).

AB  - Latitudinal clinal variation in wing size and shape has evolved in North American populations of Drosophila subobscura within about 20 years since colonization. While the size cline is consistent to that found in original European populations (and globally in other Drosophila species), different parts of the wing have evolved on the two continents. This clearly suggests that 'chance and necessity' are simultaneously playing their roles in the process of adaptation. We report here rapid and consistent thermal evolution of wing shape (but not size) that apparently is at odds with that suggestion. Three replicated populations of D. subobscura derived from an outbred stock at Puerto Montt (Chile) were kept at each of three temperatures (13, 18 and 22 degreesC) for 1 year and have diverged for 27 generations at most. We used the methods of geometric morphometrics to study wing shape variation in both females and males from the thermal stocks, and rates of genetic divergence for wing shape were found to be as fast or even faster than those previously estimated for wing size on a continental scale. These shape changes did not follow a neat linear trend with temperature, and are associated with localized shifts of particular landmarks with some differences between sexes. Wing shape variables were found to differ in response to male genetic constitution for polymorphic chromosomal inversions, which strongly suggests that changes in gene arrangement frequencies as a response to temperature underlie the correlated changes in wing shape because of gene-inversion linkage disequilibria. In fact, we also suggest that the shape cline in North America likely predated the size cline and is consistent with the quite different evolutionary rates between inversion and size clines. These findings cast strong doubts on the supposed 'unpredictability' of the geographical cline for wing traits in D. subobscura North American colonizing populations.

AB  - We urgently need to predict species responses to climate change to minimize future biodiversity loss and ensure we do not waste limited resources on ineffective conservation strategies. Currently, most predictions of species responses to climate change ignore the potential for evolution. However, evolution can alter species ecological responses, and different aspects of evolution and ecology can interact to produce complex eco-evolutionary dynamics under climate change. Here we review how evolution could alter ecological responses to climate change on species warm and cool range margins, where evolution could be especially important. We discuss different aspects of evolution in isolation, and then synthesize results to consider how multiple evolutionary processes might interact and affect conservation strategies. On species cool range margins, the evolution of dispersal could increase range expansion rates and allow species to adapt to novel conditions in their new range. However, low genetic variation and genetic drift in small range-front populations could also slow or halt range expansions. Together, these eco-evolutionary effects could cause a three-step, stop-and-go expansion pattern for many species. On warm range margins, isolation among populations could maintain high genetic variation that facilitates evolution to novel climates and allows species to persist longer than expected without evolution. This 'evolutionary extinction debt' could then prevent other species from shifting their ranges. However, as climate change increases isolation among populations, increasing dispersal mortality could select for decreased dispersal and cause rapid range contractions. Some of these eco-evolutionary dynamics could explain why many species are not responding to climate change as predicted. We conclude by suggesting that resurveying historical studies that measured trait frequencies, the strength of selection, or heritabilities could be an efficient way to increase our eco-evolutionary knowledge in climate change biology.

AB  - The thermal environment can affect the evolution of morpho-behavioral adaptations of ectotherms. Heat is transferred from substrates to organisms by conduction and reflected radiation. Because brightness influences the degree of heat absorption, substrates could affect the evolution of integumentary optical properties. Here, we show that vipers (Squamata:Viperidae) inhabiting hot, highly radiative and superficially conductive substrates have evolved bright ventra for efficient heat transfer. We analyzed the brightness of 4161 publicly available images from 126 species, and we found that substrate type, alongside latitude and body mass, strongly influences ventral brightness. Substrate type also significantly affects dorsal brightness, but this is associated with different selective forces: activity-pattern and altitude. Ancestral estimation analysis suggests that the ancestral ventral condition was likely moderately bright and, following divergence events, some species convergently increased their brightness. Vipers diversified during the Miocene and the enhancement of ventral brightness may have facilitated the exploitation of arid grounds. We provide evidence that integument brightness can impact the behavioral ecology of ectotherms. Jonathan Goldenberg et al. use photographic data and ancestral state reconstruction of 126 viper species to show that substrate type influences the evolution of ventral brightness for efficient heat transfer. Their results suggest that these patterns may have been involved in the diversification of vipers during the Miocene, and highlight the importance of ventral body regions when considering behavioral ecology and evolution.

AB  - Metabolism defines the energetic cost of life, yet we still know relatively little about why intraspecific variation in metabolic rate arises and persists. Spatio-temporal variation in selection potentially maintains differences, but relationships between metabolic traits (standard metabolic rate (SMR), maximum metabolic rate (MMR), and aerobic scope) and fitness across contexts are unresolved. We show that associations between SMR, MMR, and growth rate (a key fitness-related trait) vary depending on the thermal regime (a potential selective agent) in offspring of wild-sampled brown trout from two populations reared for approximately 15 months in either a cool or warm (+1.8 degrees C) regime. SMR was positively related to growth in the cool, but negatively related in the warm regime. The opposite patterns were found for MMR and growth associations (positive in warm, negative in the cool regime). Mean SMR, but not MMR, was lower in warm regimes within both populations (i.e. basal metabolic costs were reduced at higher temperatures), consistent with an adaptive acclimation response that optimizes growth. Metabolic phenotypes thus exhibited a thermally sensitive metabolic 'floor' and a less flexible metabolic 'ceiling'. Our findings suggest a role for growth-related fluctuating selection in shaping patterns of metabolic variation that is likely important in adapting to climate change.

AB  - In order to assess the significance of local adaptation relative to environmental plasticity on the evolution of life history traits, we analysed the possible genetic basis of differences between pond- and stream-breeding fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) in Germany. These salamanders typically deposit their larvae in small streams, where they grow until they are sufficiently large to metamorphose. However, some populations in Western Germany use ponds as larval habitat. Because habitat quality of streams differs from that of ponds one expects life history differences in the pond animals, which may result either from a plastic response or through genetic differentiation (i.e. local adaptation). Using a phylogeographical analysis of mitochondrial D-loop sequences, we show that both stream and pond populations in Western Germany are derived from a single lineage that recolonized following the last glaciation. This finding suggests that pond breeding originated very recently. Our studies of habitat quality and metamorphic behaviour of larvae in natural ponds and streams disclosed that pond larvae experience a significantly reduced food supply and greater risk of drying than do stream larvae. Pond larvae metamorphose earlier at the cost of reduced mass. Common-environment experiments with pond and stream larvae show that metamorphic behaviour of pond larvae under limited-food conditions is determined genetically and is not simply a plastic response to the differing habitat conditions. These results show that phenotypic plasticity is less important than local adaptation in explaining differences in ecological diversification within this species and suggests the possibility of rapid evolution of genetic adaptations when new habitats are exploited.

AB  - We introduce a global data bank on body composition of aquatic organisms that is available at http://www.thomas-brey.de/science/virtualhandbook. It covers ratios between body mass (wet, dry, ash free dry mass), body composition (protein, lipid, carbohydrate), macro-elements (C, N, P) and energy content (J).Sofar, data for 3158 different taxa (animals, plants, bacteria) were collected from 725 different sources. The principal purpose of the data bank is mining for conversion factors, as necessary in ecological studies that require a common energetic currency. The data bank can be used to explore general ecological principles, too: among all animals, carnivorous swimmers have the highest energy density, presumably an across-taxon selection for propulsion power and handling force. Plants and animals do not only differ in their C/N and C/P ratios, but these ratios change with temperature in opposite directions. In plants, C/N and C/P increase with temperature, most likely a response to the higher levels of N and P in polar waters. In animals C/N and C/P decrease with temperature, an indicator for selection towards lower activity and larger lipid stores in polar animals. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Metabolism is linked with the pace-of-life, co-varying with survival, growth, and reproduction. Metabolic rates should therefore be under strong selection and, if heritable, become less variable over time. Yet intraspecific variation in metabolic rates is ubiquitous, even after accounting for body mass and temperature. Theory predicts variable selection maintains trait variation, but field estimates of how selection on metabolism varies are rare. We use a model marine invertebrate to estimate selection on metabolic rates in the wild under different competitive environments. Fitness landscapes varied among environments separated by a few centimeters: interspecific competition selected for higher metabolism, and a faster pace-of-life, relative to competition-free environments. Populations experience a mosaic of competitive regimes; we find metabolism mediates a competition-colonization trade-off across these regimes. Although high metabolic phenotypes possess greater competitive ability, in the absence of competitors, low metabolic phenotypes are better colonizers. Spatial heterogeneity and the variable selection on metabolic rates that it generates is likely to maintain variation in metabolic rate, despite strong selection in any single environment.

AB  - Rapid adaptation of defenses can alter ecological dynamics following introduction of a new predator. We tested for local adaptation in Wood Frog (Rana sylvatica) populations that face varying selection from an apex predator, the Marbled Salamander (Ambystoma opacum), which is expanding its distribution in the study region. We performed a reciprocal transplant experiment with Wood Frog eggs and tadpoles and tested survival of tadpoles when exposed to Marbled Salamander larvae in experimental predation trials. We also evaluated life history, behavioral, and morphological trait variation with respect to origin and transplant environments. We found that tadpoles from populations exposed to high risk from Marbled Salamanders survived better when raised in high-risk environments than tadpoles from low-risk populations. However, tadpoles from high-risk environments experienced lower survival than those from low-risk environments when raised in low-risk environments. Development rate, activity, and morphology differed among populations and environments. Faster development of high-risk populations in high-risk environments and activity patterns best explained observed survival differences. These results suggest that tadpoles have evolved adaptive plasticity at microgeographic scales in response to a mosaic of varying predation risk. Fine-scaled evolution of prey survival and local gene flow could enhance the resilience of Wood Frogs to this predator expansion. As warming winters allow Marbled Salamanders to increase in abundance and distribution, the rapid and fine-scaled evolution of their prey could mediate predicted changes to temporary pond communities and ecosystems. Rapid prey evolution might often promote ecological resilience to predator introductions.

AB  - Long-term studies enable the identification of eco-evolutionary processes that occur over extended time periods. In addition, they provide key empirical data that may be used in predictive modelling to forecast evolutionary responses of natural ecosystems to future environmental changes. However, excluding a few exceptional cases, long-term studies are scarce because of logistic difficulties associated with accessing temporal samples. Temporal dynamics are frequently studied in the laboratory or in controlled mesocosm experiments with exceptional studies that reconstruct the evolution of natural populations in the wild.
   Here, a standard operating procedure (SOP) is provided to revive or resurrect dormant Daphnia magna, a widespread zooplankton keystone species in aquatic ecosystems, to dramatically advance the state-of-the-art longitudinal data collection in natural systems. The field of Resurrection Ecology was defined in 1999 by Kerfoot and co-workers, even though the first attempts at hatching diapausing zooplankton eggs date back to the late 1980s. Since Kerfoot's seminal paper, the methodology of resurrecting zooplankton species has been increasingly frequently applied, though propagated among laboratories only via direct knowledge transfer. Here, an SOP is described that provides a step-by-step protocol on the practice of resurrecting dormant Daphnia magna eggs.
   Two key studies are provided in which the fitness response of resurrected Daphnia magna populations to warming is measured, capitalizing on the ability to study historical and modern populations in the same settings. Finally, the application of next generation sequencing technologies to revived or still dormant stages is discussed. These technologies provide unprecedented power in dissecting the processes and mechanisms of evolution if applied to populations that have experienced changes in selection pressure over time.

AB  - Standing genetic variation enables or restricts a population's capacity to respond to changing conditions, including the extreme disturbances expected to increase in frequency and intensity with continuing anthropogenic climate change. However, we know little about how populations might respond to extreme events with rapid genetic shifts, or how population dynamics may influence and be influenced by population genomic change. We use a range-wide epizootic, sea star wasting disease, that onset in mid-2013 and caused mass mortality in Pisaster ochraceus to explore how a keystone marine species responded to an extreme perturbation. We integrated field surveys with restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data to (i) describe the population dynamics of mortality and recovery, and (ii) compare allele frequencies in mature P. ochraceus before the disease outbreak with allele frequencies in adults and new juveniles after the outbreak, to identify whether selection may have occurred. We found P. ochraceus suffered 81% mortality in the study region between 2012 and 2015, and experienced a concurrent 74-fold increase in recruitment beginning in late 2013. Comparison of pre- and postoutbreak adults revealed significant allele frequency changes at three loci, which showed consistent changes across the large majority of locations. Allele frequency shifts in juvenile P. ochraceus (spawned from premortality adults) were consistent with those seen in adult survivors. Such parallel shifts suggest detectable signals of selection and highlight the potential for persistence of this change in subsequent generations, which may influence the resilience of this keystone species to future outbreaks.

AB  - The egg parasitoid wasp, Anagrus takeyanus Gordh & Dunbar (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae), is one of the few natural enemies of the andromeda lace bug, Stephanitis takeyai Drake & Maa (Heteroptera: Tingidae). Studying this wasp in two habitats, I found that at Kyoto, where the bug alternates its host plants seasonally, most wasp individuals in the overwintering eggs of the bug entered summer diapause immediately after winter diapause. However, at Nara, where the bug does not alternate its host plant, the wasp proved to have no summer diapause. Changes in the parasitization rate between generations differed at the two study sites. In Kyoto, the overwintered generation suffered the highest parasitism among the three generations of the year. In contrast, the first and second generations suffered higher parasitization rates in Nara. This difference in level of parasitization between the two study sites corresponded to the different diapause regime of the wasp and the seasonal population trends of the lace bug. Laboratory experiments showed that short photoperiod in combination with low temperature could terminate the long diapause at the time the non-aestivating individuals terminate winter diapause. As a life cycle without host plant alternation is likely to be an ancestral character of the bug, the aestivation of the wasp is thought to have been appended to overwintering as an adaptation to the evolution of seasonal host plant alternation in the lace bug.

AB  - Background: Hsp-90 from the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is unique in that it fails to bind to the specific Hsp-90 inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA). Here we surveyed 24 different freeliving or parasitic nematodes with the aim of determining whether C. elegans Hsp-90 was the exception or the norm amongst the nematodes. We combined these data with codon evolution models in an attempt to identify whether hsp-90 from GA-binding and non-binding species has evolved under different evolutionary constraints.
   Results: We show that GA-binding is associated with life history: free-living nematodes and those parasitic species with free-living larval stages failed to bind GA. In contrast, obligate parasites and those worms in which the free-living stage in the environment is enclosed within a resistant egg, possess a GA-binding Hsp-90. We analysed Hsp-90 sequences from fifteen nematode species to determine whether nematode hsp-90s have undergone adaptive evolution that influences GA-binding. Our data provide evidence of rapid diversifying selection in the evolution of the hsp-90 gene along three separate lineages, and identified a number of residues showing significant evidence of adaptive evolution. However, we were unable to prove that the selection observed is correlated with the ability to bind geldanamycin or not.
   Conclusion: Hsp-90 is a multi-functional protein and the rapid evolution of the hsp-90 gene presumably correlates with other key cellular functions. Factors other than primary amino acid sequence may influence the ability of Hsp-90 to bind to geldanamycin.

AB  - Many organisms can acclimate to new environments through phenotypic plasticity, a complex trait that can be heritable, subject to selection, and evolve. However, the rate and genetic basis of plasticity evolution remain largely unknown. We experimentally evolved outbred populations of the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei under an acute heat shock during early larval development. When raised in a non-stressful environment, ancestral populations were highly sensitive to a 36.8 degrees heat shock and exhibited high mortality. However, initial exposure to a nonlethal high temperature environment resulted in significantly reduced mortality during heat shock (hormesis). Lines selected for heat shock resistance rapidly evolved the capacity to withstand heat shock in the native environment without any initial exposure to high temperatures, and early exposure to high temperatures did not lead to further increases in heat resistance. This loss of plasticity would appear to have resulted from the genetic assimilation of the heat induction response in the noninducing environment. However, analyses of transcriptional variation via RNA-sequencing from the selected populations revealed no global changes in gene regulation correlated with the observed changes in heat stress resistance. Instead, assays of the phenotypic response across a broader range of temperatures revealed that the induced plasticity was not fixed across environments, but rather the threshold for the response was shifted to higher temperatures over evolutionary time. These results demonstrate that apparent genetic assimilation can result from shifting thresholds of induction across environments and that analysis of the broader environmental context is critically important for understanding the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - Bathyplectes anurus, a parasitoid of the alfalfa weevils, forms a cocoon in the late larval stage and exhibits jumping behaviour. Adaptive significance and costs of the cocoon jumping have not been thoroughly studied. We hypothesised that jumping has the fitness benefits of enabling habitat selection by avoiding unfavourable environments. We conducted laboratory experiments, which demonstrated that jumping frequencies increased in the presence of light, with greater magnitudes of temperature increase and at lower relative humidity. In addition, when B. anurus individuals were allowed to freely jump in an arena with a light gradient, more cocoons were found in the shady area, suggesting microhabitat selection. In a field experiment, mortality of cocoons placed in the sun was significantly higher than for cocoons placed in the shade. B. anurus cocoons respond to environmental stress by jumping, resulting in habitat selection. In the presence of potential predators (ants), jumping frequencies were higher than in the control (no ant) arenas, though jumping frequencies decreased after direct contact with the predators. Body mass of B. anurus cocoons induced to jump significantly decreased over time than cocoons that did not jump, suggesting a cost to jumping. We discuss the benefits and costs of jumping behaviour and potential evolutionary advantages of this peculiar trait, which is present in a limited number of species.

AB  - Weakly electric gymnotiform fishes with wave-type electric organ discharge (EOD) are less hypoxia-tolerant and are less likely to be found in hypoxic habitats than weakly electric gymnotiforms with pulse-type EOD, suggesting that differences in metabolism resulting from EOD type affects habitat choice. Although gymnotiform fishes are common in most Neotropical freshwaters and represent the dominant vertebrates in some habitats, the metabolic rates of these unique fishes have never been determined. In this study, O-2 consumption rates during EOD generation are reported for 34 gymnotiforms representing 23 species, all five families and 17 (59%) of the 28 genera. Over the size range sampled (0.4 g to 125 g), O-2 consumption of gymnotiform fishes was dependent on body mass, as expected, fitting a power function with a scaling exponent of 0.74, but the O-2 consumption rate was generally about 50% of that expected by extrapolation of temperate teleost metabolic rates to a similar ambient temperature (26degreesC). O-2 consumption rate was not dependent on EOD type, but maintenance of 'scan swimming' (continuous forwards and backwards swimming), which is characteristic only of gymnotiforms with wave-type EODs, increased O-2 consumption 2.83+/-0.49-fold (mean+/-SD). This suggests that the increased metabolic cost of scan swimming could restrict gymnotiforms with wave-type EODs from hypoxic habitats.

AB  - 1. Locomotor impairment and shift in thermal preferences during gestation have been documented in some lizards, but few studies have investigated their timing. Here, endurance capacity, sprint speed and selected body temperature of gravid females of the viviparous lizard Lacerta vivipara (Jacquin) were measured weekly before and after parturition.
   2. Significant temporal variation of endurance and sprint speed was detected. A marked decrease in locomotor abilities occurred 2 weeks before parturition (c. 35% for endurance and 25% for sprint speed). A rapid recovery was observed a few days after parturition for endurance, while sprint speed recovered more slowly.
   3. A physical impairment due to body mass was detected for endurance capacity, but not for sprint speed. The recovery of locomotor abilities after parturition was independent of the intensity of reproductive investment. Mass-independent variation in locomotor performances might be explained by physiological consequences of reproduction independent of the physical burden.
   4. Females basking under laboratory conditions selected low body temperatures during the final month of gestation (29.8 degreesC +/- 0.12 SE) and a drastic increase occurred in the few days following parturition (33.4 degreesC +/- 0.13 SE).
   5. These results call for a more detailed investigation of the mechanisms underlying trade-offs between reproduction, locomotion and thermoregulation in lizards.

AB  - This paper reviews the status of the use of grafting in two solanaceous crops of global importance, tomato and eggplant, for the control of biotic and abiotic stresses. Flooding and soil-borne diseases cause severe crop losses of tomato during the hot and wet summer months in the lowland tropics. Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC) recommended since 2003 the use of eggplant rootstocks VI046103 (EG195) and VI045276 (EG203) for grafting tomato scions to provide a high degree of tolerance and resistance against flooding, bacterial wilt, root-knot nematodes and other soil-borne diseases. These two eggplant rootstocks and the tomato rootstock VI043614 (Hawaii 7996) are widely used in Southeast and East Asia for successful tomato production in both the tropical lowlands and highlands, providing significant economic returns to farmers. Given the rapid evolution of plant pathogens that might cause a breakdown of the limited rootstocks currently available, as well as the challenges of other abiotic stresses such as salinity and supra-optimal temperatures, it is necessary to expand the search for new rootstocks and evaluate new rootstock-scion combinations. Breeding and evaluation of appropriate rootstocks is still a matter of trial and error because desired rootstock traits, especially for abiotic stresses, are quite complex and regulated by multiple genes. Physiological and genetic markers to guide the selection process are still lacking but are essential to fast-track the identification of rootstocks with multiple benefits. This review supports an initiative to upgrade grafting technology through evaluation of a new and wider range of rootstocks sourced from the AVRDC genebank.

AB  - Many species that are moving polewards encounter novel thermal regimes to which they have to adapt. Therefore, rapid evolution of thermal tolerance and of thermal plasticity in fitness-related traits in edge populations can be crucial for the success and speed of range expansions.
   We tested for adaptation in cold tolerance and in life history, behavioural and physiological traits and their thermal plasticity during a poleward range expansion.
   We reconstructed the thermal performance curves of life history (survival, growth and development rates), behaviour (food intake) and cold tolerance (chill coma recovery time) in the aquatic larval stage of the damselfly Ischnura elegans that is currently showing a poleward range expansion in northern Europe. We studied larvae from three edge and three core populations using a common-garden experiment.
   Consistent with the colder annual temperatures, larvae at the expansion front evolved an improved cold tolerance. The edge populations showed no overall (across temperatures) evolution of a faster life history that would improve their range-shifting ability. Moreover, consistent with damselfly edge populations from colder latitudes, edge populations evolved at the highest rearing temperature (28 degrees C) a faster development rate, likely to better exploit the rare periods with higher temperatures. This was associated with a higher food intake and a lower metabolic rate.
   In conclusion, our results suggest that the edge populations rapidly evolved adaptive changes in trait means and thermal plasticity to the novel thermal conditions at the edge front. Our results highlight the importance of considering besides trait plasticity and the evolution of trait means, also the evolution of trait plasticity to improve forecasts of responses to climate change.

AB  - As the mean temperature and the duration of the growing season decline with elevation, growth of immature insects should initiate at a lower temperature, but it should also be faster to complete development prior to season's end. Although flightless, Mormon crickets migrate in large aggregations across broad spatial and elevational distances that might limit adaptations to local environments. In addition, selection to be active at cooler temperatures might limit selection to maximize growth rate. I measured growth rate in controlled environments for nymphs from three populations that vary in altitude (87-2,688 m) but are similar in latitude (43.2-45.7 degrees N). Growth rate increased significantly with mean rearing temperature between 22 and 30 degrees C. The intercept of the regression of growth rate on temperature increased with elevation, whereas the slope did not change significantly. For any given rearing temperature, growth rate increased with elevation, which suggests that selection to initiate growth at cooler temperatures did not corn promise growth rate. Body mass did not differ between the two lower elevations, whereas the highest elevation population had smaller hatchlings and adults. Critical thermal minimum (base temperature) declined with elevation (0.7 degrees C per 1,000 m), and the degree days were 509 across all elevations. For pest management, a base temperature from midelevation of 15.3 degrees C (60 degrees F) and growing degree days of 509 (equivalent to 916 Fahrenheit-based degree days) are reasonable estimates for applications from sea level to 2,700 m.

AB  - Surviving changing climate conditions is particularly difficult for organisms such as insects that depend on environmental temperature to regulate their physiological functions. Insects are extremely threatened by global warming, since many do not have enough physiological tolerance even to survive continuous exposure to the current maximum temperatures experienced in their habitats. Here, we review literature on the physiological mechanisms that regulate responses to heat and provide heat tolerance in insects: (i) neuronal mechanisms to detect and respond to heat; (ii) metabolic responses to heat; (iii) thermoregulation; (iv) stress responses to tolerate heat; and (v) hormones that coordinate developmental and behavioural responses at warm temperatures. Our review shows that, apart from the stress response mediated by heat shock proteins, the physiological mechanisms of heat tolerance in insects remain poorly studied. Based on life-history theory, we discuss the costs of heat tolerance and the potential evolutionary mechanisms driving insect adaptations to high temperatures. Some insects may deal with ongoing global warming by the joint action of phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation. Plastic responses are limited and may not be by themselves enough to withstand ongoing warming trends. Although the evidence is still scarce and deserves further research in different insect taxa, genetic adaptation to high temperatures may result from rapid evolution. Finally, we emphasize the importance of incorporating physiological information for modelling species distributions and ecological interactions under global warming scenarios. This review identifies several open questions to improve our understanding of how insects respond physiologically to heat and the evolutionary and ecological consequences of those responses. Further lines of research are suggested at the species, order and class levels, with experimental and analytical approaches such as artificial selection, quantitative genetics and comparative analyses.

AB  - The deep brine pools of the Red Sea comprise extreme, inhospitable habitats yet house microbial communities that potentially may fuel adjacent fauna. We here describe a novel bivalve from a deep-sea (1525 m) brine pool in the Red Sea, where conditions of high salinity, lowered pH, partial anoxia and high temperatures are prevalent. Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) footage showed that the bivalves were present in a narrow (20 cm) band along the rim of the brine pool, suggesting that it is not only tolerant of such extreme conditions but is also limited to them. The bivalve is a member of the Corbulidae and named Apachecorbula muriatica gen. et sp. nov. The shell is atypical of the family in being modioliform and thin. The semi-infaunal habit is seen in ROV images and reflected in the anatomy by the lack of siphons. The ctenidia are large and typical of a suspension feeding bivalve, but the absence of 'guard cilia' and the greatly reduced labial palps suggest that it is non-selective as a response to low food availability. It is proposed that the low body mass observed is a consequence of the extreme habitat and low food availability. It is postulated that the observed morphology of Apachecorbula is a result of paedomorphosis driven by the effects of the extreme environment on growth but is in part mitigated by the absence of high predation pressures.

AB  - Following the initial discovery of the heat shock RNA omega (hsr?) gene of Drosophila melanogaster to be non-coding (nc) and also inducible by cell stress, other stress-inducible long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been described in diverse organisms. In view of the rapid sequence divergence of lncRNAs, present knowledge of stress trasncriptome is limited and fragmented. Several known stress-related lncRNAs, associated with specific nuclear speckled domains or nucleolus, provide structural base for sequestering diverse RNA-processing/regulatory proteins. Others have roles in transcriptional or translational inhibition during stress or in signaling pathways; functions of several other lncRNAs are not yet known. Most stress-related lncRNAs act primarily by modulating activity of the proteins to which they bind or by sequestering specific sets of proteins away from the active pool. A common emerging theme is that a given lncRNA targets one or more protein/s with key role/s in the cascade of events triggered by the stress and therefore has a widespread integrative effect. Since proteins associate with RNA through short sequence motifs, the overall base sequence of functionally similar ncRNAs is often not conserved except for specific motifs. The rapid evolvability of ncRNA sequences provides elegant modules for adaptability to changing environment as binding of one or the other protein to ncRNA can alter its structure and functions in distinct ways. Thus the stress-related lncRNAs act as hubs in the cellular networks to coordinate activities of the members within and between different networks to maintain cellular homeostasis for survival or to trigger cell death.

AB  - In tropical rainforests, insects show especially high species richness and local endemism of species relative to vertebrates. One possible cause is that insects respond to historical fluctuations of rainforests on a smaller spatial scale than do vertebrates. To evaluate this hypothesis, we combine environmental niche models and mitochondrial DNA phylogeography for two pairs of sister species of the dung beetle genus Temnoplectron (T. aeneopiceum-T. subvolitans and T. politulum-T. reyi) from the rainforests of northeastern Australia, where climate-driven rainforest fluctuations in the Quaternary have strongly influenced genetic and species diversity of vertebrates. Within both species pairs, the bioclimatic niche was conserved, but the T. aeneopiceum-T. subvolitans species pair had the narrower environmental range, and thus more restricted potential distribution. Coalescent analyses indicated Late Pliocene or Early Pleistocene divergences for both species pairs, and earlier speciation in (T. aeneopiceum-T. subvolitans) than in (T. politulum-T. reyi). Phylogeographic structure in (T. aeneopiceum-T. subvolitans) was more pronounced than in (T. politulum-T. reyi), with significant isolation-by-distance in the former species-pair only. Nested clade and coalescence analyses indicated local range expansions for the T. aeneopiceum-subvolitans species pair and range-wide expansion for both T. politulum and T. reyi. We suggest that stronger phylogeographic structure and earlier divergence in (T. aeneopiceum-T. subvolitans) than in (T. politulum-T. reyi) reflects a stronger influence of environmental barriers to gene flow under the present climate and greater sensitivity to warmer and drier periods of the Quaternary. The two species pairs evidently responded to Quaternary rainforest fluctuations at spatial scales similar to those seen within low-vagility species of vertebrate. Despite this similarity of scale, these insect lineages are reproductively isolated at parapatric boundaries, whereas analogous lineages of vertebrates often are not. We suggest that rapid evolution of genitalia may facilitate geographic speciation in rainforest beetles.

AB  - A distinctive signature of living systems is Darwinian evolution, that is, a propensity to generate its well as self-select individual diversity. To capture this essential feature of life while describing the dynamics Of Populations, mathematical models must be rooted in the microscopic, stochastic description of discrete individuals characterized by one or several adaptive traits and interacting with each other. The simplest models assume asexual reproduction and haploid genetics: an offspring usually inherits the trait values of her progenitor, except when a Mutation causes the offspring to take it mutation step to new trait values; selection follows from ecological interactions among individuals. Here we present it rigorous construction of the microscopic population process that captures the probabilistic dynamics over continuous time of birth, mutation, and death, as influenced by the trait values of each individual, and interactions between individuals. A by-product of this formal construction is a general algorithm for efficient numerical simulation of the individual-level model. Once the microscopic process is in place, we derive different macroscopic models of adaptive evolution. These models differ in the renormalization they assume, i.e. in the limits taken, in specific orders, on population size, initiation rate, mutation step, while rescaling time accordingly. The macroscopic models also differ in their mathematical nature: deterministic, in the form of ordinary, integro-, or partial differential equations, or probabilistic, like stochastic partial differential equations or superprocesses. These models include extensions of Kimura's equation (and of its approximation for small mutation effects) to frequency- and density-dependent selection. A novel class of macroscopic models obtains when assuming that individual birth and death occur on a short timescale compared with the timescale of typical Population growth. On a timescale of very rare mutations, we establish rigorously the models of "trait substitution sequences" and their approximation known as the "canonical equation of adaptive dynamics". We extend these models to account for mutation bias and random drift between multiple evolutionary attractors. The renormalization approach used in this Study also opens promising avenues to Study and predict patterns of life-history allometries, thereby bridging individual physiology, genetic variation, and ecological interactions in it common evolutionary framework.

AB  - Populations at the margins of a species' geographic range are often thought to be poorly adapted to their environment. According to theoretical predictions, gene flow can inhibit these range edge populations if it disrupts adaptation to local conditions. Alternatively, if range edge populations are small or isolated, gene flow can provide beneficial genetic variation and may facilitate adaptation to environmental change. We tested these competing predictions in the annual wildflower Clarkia pulchella using greenhouse crosses to simulate gene flow from sources across the geographic range into two populations at the northern range margin. We planted these between-population hybrids in common gardens at the range edge and evaluated how genetic differentiation and climatic differences between edge populations and gene flow sources affected lifetime fitness. During an anomalously warm study year, gene flow from populations occupying historically warm sites improved fitness at the range edge and plants with one or both parents from warm populations performed best. The effects of the temperature provenance of gene flow sources were most apparent at early life history stages, but precipitation provenance also affected reproduction. We also found benefits of gene flow that were independent of climate: after climate was controlled for, plants with parents from different populations performed better at later lifestages than those with parents from the same population, indicating that gene flow may improve fitness via relieving homozygosity. Further supporting this result, we found that increasing genetic differentiation of parental populations had positive effects on fitness of hybrid seeds. Gene flow from warmer populations, when it occurs, is likely to contribute adaptive genetic variation to populations at the northern range edge as the climate warms. On heterogeneous landscapes, climate of origin may be a better predictor of gene flow effects than geographic proximity.

AB  - 1. Raising global temperatures are predicted to have strong consequences for ectotherms, as metabolic rates depend directly on external temperatures. To understand consequences for population fitness, a full life cycle approach is important because (a) temperature can have opposite effects on different vital rates (growth, survival, reproduction) and (b) sensitivities of population growth rate to changes in vital rates can vary in magnitude. As vital rates are concurrently influenced by other factors, adequately predicting temperature effects requires factors such as body size, population density and genetics to be taken into account.
   2. The aim of this study was to quantify the role of temperature on all vital rates of Daphnia magna individuals and their integrated effects on population dynamics. In addition, we evaluated how clonal lineages differed in their temperature response, both on the vital rate and population level.
   3. We performed a laboratory experiment, in which we followed 40 populations (five clonal lineages x eight temperatures) during 80 days. Due to our novel set-up, we were able to quantify vital rates of individuals within those populations. We identified relations between vital rates and body size, lineage, temperature and population density and used a size-structured integral projection model to integrate the experimental effects over all vital rates.
   4. We found negative density dependence in growth and reproduction, resulting in lineage-specific carrying capacities. Population fitness showed a thermal optimum that differed among genotypes. It is interesting that we found that clones had different life-history strategies, optimizing population fitness via different routes. As no lineage outperformed the others in all vital rates, we identified trade-offs between vital rates, which had strong effects on the dynamics of the population. Moreover, simulations suggest that the genetic composition of mixed populations is temperature-dependent.
   5. Our results underscore the importance of studying individuals within their population when predicting responses to environmental change. The observed density effects, which were as strong as temperature effects but explained considerably more variation in population growth, would have been overlooked in life table experiments. Furthermore, differential temperature responses emphasize the importance of genetic variation in the ability of ectotherm species such as Daphnia magna to respond to climate change.

AB  - Background and Aims The Arctic tundra, with its extreme temperatures and short growing season, is evolutionarily young and harbours one of the most species-poor floras on Earth. Arctic species often show little phenotypic and genetic divergence across circumpolar ranges. However, strong intraspecific post-zygotic reproductive isolation (RI) in terms of hybrid sterility has frequently evolved within selfing Arctic species of the genus Draba. Here we assess whether incipient biological species are common in the Arctic flora. Methods We conducted an extensive crossing experiment including six species representing four phylogenetically distant families collected across the circumpolar Arctic. We crossed conspecific parental populations representing different spatial scales, raised 740 F-1 hybrids to maturity and measured fertility under laboratory conditions. We examined genetic divergence between populations for two of these species (Cardamine bellidifolia and Ranunculus pygmaeus). Key Results In five of the six species, we find extensive reduction in pollen fertility and seed set in F-1 hybrids; 219 (46 %) of the 477 F-1 hybrids generated between parents separated by >= 427 km had <20 % pollen fertility. Isolation with migration (IM) and *BEAST analyses of sequences of eight nuclear genes in C. bellidifolia suggests that reproductively isolated populations of this species diverged during, or even after, the last glaciation. Likewise, Arctic populations of R. pygmaeus were genetically very similar despite exhibiting strongly reduced fertility in crosses, suggesting that RI evolved recently also in this species. Conclusion We show that post-zygotic RI has developed multiple times within taxonomically recognized Arctic species belonging to several distantly related lineages, and that RI may have developed over just a few millennia. Rapid and widespread evolution of incipient biological species in the Arctic flora might be associated with frequent bottlenecks due to glacial cycles, and/or selfing mating systems, which are common in the harsh Arctic environment where pollinators are scarce.

AB  - For ectotherms, environmental temperatures influence numerous life history characteristics, and the body temperatures (T-b) selected by individuals can affect offspring fitness and parental survival. Reproductive trade-offs may therefore ensue for gravid females, because temperatures conducive to embryonic development may compromise females' body condition. We tested whether reproduction influenced thermoregulation in female Arizona Bark Scorpions (Centruroides sculpturatus). We predicted that gravid females select higher T-b and thermoregulate more precisely than nonreproductive females. Gravid C.sculpturatus gain body mass throughout gestation, which exposes larger portions of their pleural membrane, possibly increasing their rates of transcuticular water loss in arid environments. Accordingly, we tested whether gravid C.sculpturatus lose water faster than nonreproductive females. We determined the preferred T-b of female scorpions in a thermal gradient and measured water loss rates using flow-through respirometry. Gravid females preferred significantly higher T-b than nonreproductive females, suggesting that gravid C.sculpturatus alter their thermoregulatory behaviour to promote offspring fitness. However, all scorpions thermoregulated with equal precision, perhaps because arid conditions create selective pressure on all females to thermoregulate effectively. Gravid females lost water faster than nonreproductive animals, indicating that greater exposure of the pleural membrane during gestation enhances the desiccation risk of reproductive females. Our findings suggest that gravid C.sculpturatus experience a trade-off, whereby selection of higher T-b and increased mass during gestation increase females' susceptibility to water loss, and thus their mortality risk. Elucidating the mechanisms that influence thermal preferences may reveal how reproductive trade-offs shape the life history of ectotherms in arid environments.

AB  - When temperature and other kinds of barrier divide formerly continuous populations and confine them to more restricted geographical areas, there is an evolutionary reaction that will, over time, result in the formation of endemic species. In such cases, an allopatric speciation process is considered to have taken place because reproductive isolation was caused by physical means instead of by natural selection. In contrast, when populations exist in a very high-diversity area and remain undivided by physical events, they exhibit a tendency to speciate by means of sympatry (or parapatry). This process, sometimes called competitive or ecological speciation, does involve reproductive isolation by means of natural selection. Populations that exist in geographical provinces bounded by physical barriers add to the overall diversity through the production of endemic species. This increase by species packing is relatively slow due to the very gradual tempo of the allopatric speciation process. Populations existing in centres of origin add to the general diversity through the production of species that are dominant in terms of their ability to spread over large parts of the world. It is proposed that such species are usually formed by sympatric speciation, a process that can be c. 20 times faster than species formation by allopatry. It is not suggested that sympatry is exclusive to centres of origin, nor that allopatry is confined to peripheral provinces. Both processes are widespread, but there do appear to be distinctive geographical concentrations. Considering that numbers of widespread species produced by centres of origin may eventually become subdivided by barriers, and thus give rise to descendants by allopatry, it is difficult to say how much of our present species diversity has come from one source or the other. Both speciation by sympatry from centres of origin and speciation by allopatry in peripheral provinces appear to be important sources of marine biodiversity.

AB  - Altering thermal environments impose strong selection pressures on organisms, whose local persistence depends on adaptive phenotypic plastic and genetic responses. Thus far, adaptive change is monitored using phenotypic shifts or molecular markers, although inevitable obstacles are inherent in both methods. In order to circumvent these, it is necessary to find a causal link between adaptive alleles and fitness. Combining both approaches by linking genetic analyses and life-history measurements, a potential genotype-phenotype relationship can be assessed and adaptation at the molecular level demonstrated. For our study, clonal lineages of the freshwater keystone species D. galeata from seven different populations distributed along a latitudinal gradient across Europe were tested for local thermal adaptation in common garden experiments. Fitness-related life-history responses were quantified under different thermal regimes and experimental clones were genotyped at three candidate gene marker loci to investigate a potential genotypephenotype association. The analyses of the life-history data showed a significant temperature effect on several fitness-related life-history traits recorded in our experiments. However, wecould not detect evidence for a direct association at neither candidate gene locus between genotypes and life-history traits. The observed phenotypic shiftsmight therefore not be based on the tested marker loci EA, M and TF, or in general not coding sequence-based and thus rather reveal phenotypic plasticity in response to thermal variation. Nonetheless, we revealed significant genotype by environment (GxE) interactions at all tested loci, potentially reflecting a contribution of marker loci to certain life-history trait values and contribution of multiple genetic loci to phenotypic traits.

AB  - Marine ectotherms have evolved a range of physiological strategies to cope with temperature changes that persist across generations. For example, metabolic rates are expected to increase following an acute exposure to temperature, with potential detrimental impacts for fitness. However, they may be downregulated in the following generation if offspring experience the thermal conditions of their parents, with a resulting decrease in maintenance costs and fitness maximization. Yet, trans-generational studies on metabolic rates are few in marine ectotherms, thus limiting our ability to accurately predict longer-term implications of ocean warming on organisms' performance, metabolic rates being the fundamental pacemaker for all biological processes. This is particularly true for small-size organisms, for which the determination of individual metabolic rates has been historically challenging, and for many groups of marine invertebrates, such as annelids, which are under-represented in physiological investigations. Here, we exposed the subtidal annelid Ophryotrocha labronica (body length: similar to 4 mm) to a thermal gradient (21, 24, 26, 29 degrees C) and measured, for the first time in this species, the temperature dependence of metabolic rates across two generations. We found that metabolic rates were positively related to temperature, but this relationship did not differ between generations. Our study provides additional evidence for the diversity of temperature-associated physiological responses of marine ectotherms and offers a number of methodological recommendations for unveiling the mechanisms underpinning the observed trans-generational responses of metabolic rates in marine annelid species.

AB  - Building occupants' perception of thermal comfort can be influenced by a number of contextual factors, such as their demographic and anthropometric characteristics, behavioural patterns and cultural aspects. The objective of this work is to investigate the relationship between various contextual factors and the perception of thermal comfort in workplaces, by examining the gap between the current thermal comfort criteria and the actual requirements observed for different groups of occupants. The classic thermal comfort field research design i.e. simultaneous measurements of physical environmental parameters and questionnaire surveys, was implemented for two years in both centralised HVAC and mixed-mode office buildings located in Southern Brazil. Over 7500 questionnaires were completed by occupants of the buildings. Key variables including the participants' gender, age, body mass index, prior exposure to air-conditioning and building ventilation type were investigated in order to identify their association with thermal discomfort in the office workplace. Our results suggest that males, overweight occupants and those who are more frequently exposed to air-conditioning are more likely to express thermal discomfort due to feeling 'warm', compared to females, non-overweight occupants and those who were exposed to air-conditioning less frequently. In comparison, females, non-overweight occupants, air-conditioning light users, and occupants of centralised HVAC buildings were more likely to declare 'cold' discomfort. We also investigated how those variables were related to the width of thermal comfort zone. The analysis indicates that different groups of occupants require different comfort zones, suggesting that group differences should be considered when designing/operating spaces for diverse groups of occupants.

AB  - Closely related clonal and sexual populations may coexist in spite of the theorized lower potential for the evolution of clonal genotypes. Water frogs of the Rana esculenta complex have hemiclonal inheritance but most populations coexist with one of the recombinant parental species. We examine whether hemiclonal lineages may counterbalance their limitations of genetic variability by the adoption of one or more non-exclusive mechanisms: the general-purpose genotype or the frozen niche-variation model. Three coexisting hemiclones of the hybrid R. esculenta (GUT1, GUT2, GUT3) and both parental species (syntopic R. lessonae and allopatric R. ridibunda) were raised at two larval densities to examine morphological traits affecting jumping performance at the time of metamorphosis and size-independent jumping ability tested at three temperatures. Hind leg length and body mass at metamorphosis, traits that explain most of the variance in jumping performance, differed across hemiclones of R. esculenta. Metamorphs of hemiclone GUT1 had the longest hindlimbs and were bigger than metamorphs of the other hemiclones at low larval density but not at high density. Size adjusted jumping performance exhibited a significant genotype by larval density interaction. Metamorphs of GUT1 showed maximal jumping performance when raised at low larval density but at high density metamorphs of GUT1 were the best jumpers. In addition, within particular traits, differences were found between hemiclones across densities. These results appear to be consistent with both frozen niche-variation model and the general-purpose genotype model. Comparison with parental species revealed syntopic R. lessonae was smaller than hemiclones at metamorphosis but conversely exhibited better size-adjusted jumping performance when raised at low larval density. Temperature affected size-adjusted jumping performance only for frogs raised at low larval density but not for those raised at high larval densities. There was no significant temperature by hemiclone interaction.

AB  - In the Mediterranean basin, the globally increasing temperatures are expected to be accompanied by longer heat waves. Commonly assumed to benefit cold-limited invasive alien species, these climatic changes may also change their feeding preferences, especially in the case of omnivorous ectotherms. We investigated heat wave effects on diet choice, growth and energy reserves in the invasive red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. In laboratory experiments, we fed juvenile and adult crayfish on animal, plant or mixed diets and exposed them to a short or a long heat wave. We then measured crayfish survival, growth, body reserves and Fulton's condition index. Diet choices of the crayfish maintained on the mixed diet were estimated using stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15). The results suggest a decreased efficiency of carnivorous diets at higher temperatures, as juveniles fed on the animal diet were unable to maintain high growth rates in the long heat wave; and a decreased efficiency of herbivorous diets at lower temperatures, as juveniles in the cold accumulated less body reserves when fed on the plant diet. Heat wave treatments increased the assimilation of plant material, especially in juveniles, allowing them to sustain high growth rates in the long heat wave. Contrary to our expectations, crayfish performance decreased in the long heat wave, suggesting that Mediterranean summer heat waves may have negative effects on P. clarkii and that they are unlikely to boost its populations in this region. Although uncertain, it is possible that the greater assimilation of the plant diet resulted from changes in crayfish feeding preferences, raising the hypotheses that i) heat waves may change the predominant impacts of this keystone species and ii) that by altering species' trophic niches, climate change may alter the main impacts of invasive alien species.

AB  - The preservation of life history and other phenotypic complexity is central to the resilience of Pacific salmon stocks. Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) express a diversity of life-history strategies such as the propensity to migrate (anadromy/residency) and the timing and state of maturation upon return to freshwater (run-timing), providing an opportunity to study adaptive phenotypic complexity. Historically, the Eel River supported upwards of 1 million salmon and steelhead, but the past century has seen dramatic declines of all salmonids in the watershed. Here we investigate life-history variation in Eel River steelhead by using Rapture sequencing, on thousands of individuals, to genotype the region diagnostic for run-timing (GREB1L) and the region strongly associated with residency/anadromy (OMY5) in the Eel River and other locations, as well as determine patterns of overall genetic differentiation. Our results provide insight into many conservation-related issues. For example, we found that distinct segregation between winter and summer-run steelhead correlated with flow-dependent barriers in major forks of the Eel, that summer-run steelhead inhabited the upper Eel prior to construction of an impassable dam, and that both life history and overall genetic diversity have been maintained in the resident trout population above; and we found no evidence of the summer-run allele in the South Fork Eel, indicating that summer run-timing cannot be expected to arise from standing genetic variation in this and other populations that lack the summer-run phenotype. The results presented in this study provide valuable information for designing future restoration and management strategies for O. mykiss in Northern California and beyond.

AB  - Obesity, defined as excessive accumulation of fat in adipose tissue, is a metabolic disorder resulting from behavioral, environmental and heritable causes. Obesity increases the risks of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, respiratory problems, osteoarthritis and cancer. Meanwhile, the negative impact of obesity on male reproduction is gradually recognized. According to the clinical investigations and animal experiments, obesity is correlated with reductions in sperm concentration and motility, increase in sperm DNA damage and changes in reproductive hormones. Several mechanisms can elucidate the effects of obesity on sperm functions and male subfertility, i.e., the excessive conversion of androgens into estrogens in redundant adipose tissue causes sexual hormone imbalance, subsequently resulting in hypogonadism. Secondly, adipokines produced by adipose tissue induce severe inflammation and oxidative stress in male reproductive tract, directly impairing testicular and epididymal tissues. Moreover, increased scrotal adiposity leads to increase gonadal heat, continuously hurting spermatogenesis. Therefore, obesity alters the systematic and regional environment crucial for spermatogenesis in testis and sperm maturation in epididymis, and finally results in poor sperm quality including decreased sperm motility, abnormal sperm morphology and acrosome reaction, changed membrane lipids and increased DNA damage. Furthermore, recent studies indicate that epigenetic changes may be a consequence of increased adiposity. A major effort to identify epigenetic determinants of obesity revealed that sperm DNA methylation and non-coding RNA modification are associated with BMI changes and proposed to inherit metabolic comorbidities across generations. This review will explain how obesity-related changes in males to influence sperm function and male fertility as well.

AB  - The Au-deposit of the Dungash gold mine area, Eastern Desert of Egypt, is situated in an EW-trending quartz vein along a shear zone in metavolcanic and metasedimentary host rocks. Petrographic and micro-chemical analyses show that the style of alterations (chloritization, sericitization, carbonatization and silicification) and mineralization (formation of sulphides and gold) are not limited to only the auriferrous quartz ore body (massive mineralization) but occurs also in the wall rocks (disseminated mineralization). Foliation, fracturing and shearing of the wall rocks are the major factors controlling the alterations and the mineralizations as these provided favourable channel ways for fluid flow. These fluid flows were generated under post-peak metamorphic greenschist facies conditions. The post-metamorphic hydrothermal origin of different stages of alteration/mineralization are documented based on various observations among which the most important are: (i) relics of undigested wall-rock materials and rutile (being a constituent of the wall rocks) are included in sulphides, carbonates and quartz (mainly concentrated in the quartz ore body); (ii) arsenopyrite, pyrite, gold and carbonate occur in various generations and are distributed over eight parageneses; (iii) the temperature of formation of the hydrothermal minerals varies between 500 degreesC and <300 degreesC (using the composition of chlorite and the stability of the (Ni-Co-Fe)AsS minerals (gersdorffite and arsenopyrite)).

AB  - The historical distribution of Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in the Columbia River basin has been constrained by the species' dependence on nursery lakes for juvenile rearing. Several productive lake systems were impounded by dams during the last century leading to the extirpation of Sockeye Salmon from many nursery lakes in the region. Recent efforts to re-establish populations in historically natal areas are exemplified by the Cle Elum Lake reintroduction program. The program is founded on outplanting adult fish from two middle Columbia River donor populations with different adaptive potentials. We used genetic stock identification methods to differentiate stock origins between Osoyoos Lake (OSO) and Lake Wenatchee (WEN) donor stocks and to evaluate the relative productivity from two brood years (2011 and 2012) of natural spawning in the novel environment. Spawning ground surveys revealed assortative mating between earlier-spawning WEN fish that were more abundant farthest upstream and later-spawning OSO fish that were concentrated (82%) downstream nearest the lake. Hybrids accounted for only 5% of sampled smolts and 4% of adult returns. Smolts rearing in Cle Elum Lake were significantly larger overall (OSO, 140 mm; WEN, 129 mm) than smolts in either donor population (84 mm). However, the average size of OSO smolts varied among emigration years, and relative smolt abundances favored the WEN stock (70% overall), indicative of a rearing survival advantage. In relation, the WEN stock exhibited a better average rate of replacement (0.80) in adult-to-adult escapement compared with the OSO stock (0.17). Continued monitoring will focus on trends in productivity and potential demographic shifts that may arise in the Cle Elum Lake population and will provide managers with information concerning limiting factors in the environment that might affect similar approaches to reintroductions in other lake systems.

AB  - The plastic capability of species to cope with the new conditions created by climate change is poorly understood. This is particularly relevant for organisms restricted to high elevations because they are adapted to cold temperatures and low oxygen availability. Therefore, evaluating trait plasticity of mountain specialists is fundamental to understand their vulnerability to environmental change. We transplanted mountain lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni, 800 m downhill to evaluate the plastic response in body condition, thermoregulation traits, haemoglobin level, and haemoparasite load. Initial measurements of body mass, total haemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), hematic parasite intensities, dorsal luminance, and thermoregulatory behaviour were resampled after two and four weeks of acclimation. We also tested whether an anti-parasitic drug reduced haemoparasite intensity. After only two weeks of acclimation to a lower elevation, lizards decreased 42% in [Hb], had 17% less parasite intensities, increased body condition by 25%, and raised by similar to 3% their mean preferred temperatures and their voluntary thermal maximum. The anti-parasitic treatment had no significant effect on the intensity of hematic parasites, but our results suggest that negative effects of haemoparasites on [Hb] are relaxed at lower elevation. The rapid plastic changes observed in thermal preferences, body condition, [Hb], and parasite intensity of I. cyreni demonstrate a potential plastic response of a mountain specialist. This may be adaptive under the climatic extremes typical of mountain habitats. However, there is uncertainty in whether the observed plasticity can also help overcome long term environmental changes.

AB  - Protective colouration in animals includes camouflage (i.e., crypsis), that decreases the risk of detection, and conspicuous colouration, which is often used in combination with chemical defences to deter predators from attacking. Experiments have shown that the efficacy of conspicuous colouration increases with increasing size of pattern elements and larger body size. Prey species that have acquired avoidance inducing colouration therefore may be exposed to selection for larger body size, and such colouration may more easily evolve in large than in small prey species. Here we test for a difference in body size between species with different colouration modes and perform a comparative analysis based on phylogenetically independent contrasts to examine if evolutionary shifts in colour pattern have been associated with evolutionary changes in body size, using data for 578 species of moths. Larval body size did not differ between species with signalling and non-signalling larvae, and results from the comparative analysis suggest that these two traits have not evolved in parallel. The lack of association between evolutionary changes in colouration and body size may reflect a confounding influence of lifestyle, because evolutionary shifts from solitary to group-living larvae were associated with decreased larval body length and adult wing span. Because evolutionary changes in larval body size were associated with evolutionary changes in adult wing span the predicted association between colouration and size may have been confounded also by conflicting selection on body size in larvae and adults.

AB  - Temperature challenges are one of the leading abiotic causes of success or failure of non-native species in a novel environment, and this is particularly true for low temperatures. Establishing and reproducing in a novel thermal environment can alter survival, behavior, and traits related to fitness. It has been proposed that plasticity or adaptation of thermal tolerance may allow an introduced species to thrive, or that successful invaders may be those with a thermal breadth in their native habitat that encompasses their new environment. Here, we tested these hypotheses using native and invasive populations of Australian redback spiders (Latrodectus hasselti). We measured how exposure to temperatures common to invasive and native range habitats (exposure to 15 and 25 degrees C, respectively) affected behavioral and life-history traits and trade-offs that may underlie fitness in an invasive population detected in 1995 in Japan and a native population from Australia. We found that the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) was higher in the invasive population from Japan than in the native population, but critical thermal maximum (CTmax) did not differ between populations. Compared to the invasive population, eggs from the native population had a longer development time and lower hatching success at 15 degrees C. Both populations performed equally well at 25 degrees C, as measured by egg development time and hatching success. Invasive juveniles tested at 15 degrees C were faster to explore a novel environment and bolder compared to those tested at 25 degrees C. In comparison, the native population showed faster average exploration, with no differences in boldness or exploration at the two development or testing temperatures. Overall, L. hasselti from Japan maintained hatching success and development across a wider temperature range than the native population, indicating greater thermal breadth and higher behavioral plasticity. These results support the importance of plasticity in thermal tolerance and behavior for a successful invasion under novel environmental temperatures.

AB  - Death Valley, California is today the hottest hyperarid area in the western Hemisphere with temperatures of 57 degrees C (134 degrees F) recorded. During the late Quaternary, pluvial Lake Manly covered much of the Valley and contributed to a much more moderate climate. The abrupt draining of Lake Manly in the mid-Holocene and coincident dramatic shifts in temperature and aridity exerted substantial selection pressure on organisms living in this area. Our research investigates the adaptive response of Neotoma (woodrats) to temperature change over the late Quaternary along a steep elevational and environmental gradient. By combining fieldwork, examination of museum specimens, and collection of paleomiddens, our project reconstructs the divergent evolutionary histories of animals from the valley floor and nearby mountain gradients (-84 to >3400 m). We report on recent paleomidden work investigating a transition zone in the Grapevine Mountains (Amargosa Range) for two species of woodrats differing significantly in size and habitat preferences: N. lepida, the desert woodrat, and N. cinerea, the bushy-tailed woodrat. Here, at the limits of these species' thermal and ecological thresholds, we demonstrate dramatic fluctuations in the range boundaries over the Holocene as climate shifted. Moreover, we find fundamental differences in the adaptive response of these two species related to the elevation of the site and local microclimate. Results indicate that although N. cinerea are currently extirpated in this area, they were ubiquitous throughout the late Pleistocene and into the middle Holocene. They adapted to climate shifts over this period by phenotypic changes in body mass, as has been demonstrated for other areas within their range; during colder episodes they were larger, and during warmer intervals, animals were smaller. Their presence may have been tied into a much more widespread historical distribution of juniper (Juniperus sp.); we document a downward displacement of approximately 1000 m relative to juniper's modern extent in the Amargosa Range. These results suggest a cooler and more mesic habitat association persisting for longer and at lower elevations than previously reported. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Revealing the causes and consequences of differential habitat use among previously untrackable species will help advance our understanding of how organisms have survived and adapted during their evolutionary histories. Among loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting on one Japanese beach, small females tend to forage on planktonic prey in oceanic waters (depth > 200 m) as the juveniles do, while large females tend to forage on benthic prey in neritic waters (depth < 200 m). These alternative foraging behaviors are presumably maintained by a strategy depending on growth conditions during oceanic early life, and each tactic would be consistently used throughout the adult stage. To verify whether the morphology of emerged hatchlings varies with maternal alternative foraging behaviors, the clutches of similar egg characteristics derived from oceanic and neritic foragers were incubated in a common beach area (30 degrees 24'N, 130 degrees 26'E), Yakushima Island, Japan, 2014. There were no significant differences in straight carapace length and width and body mass of emerged hatchlings between the two foraging groups, which were classified based on stable isotope ratios, suggesting that the development process of hatchling tissue from yolk and albumen is genetically similar between the two groups. Egg size and mass significantly increased with female body size only in neritic foragers that laid larger clutches than oceanic foragers, whereas hatchling size and mass significantly increased with egg mass in both groups. This suggested that larger females produced larger hatchlings within neritic foragers, and indeed, there was a significant positive correlation in body size between females and hatchlings only within neritic foragers. However, significant negative correlations between the number of eggs reburied per nest and emergence success that might explain the above phenomenon were not found in either oceanic or neritic foragers. Effects of a seasonal rise in ambient temperature on embryonic development and hatchling morphology were also similar between the two foraging groups, implying their genetic similarity in thermal response, consistent with their phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - Rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension are increasing rapidly in urbanizing sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). While lifestyle factors drive the increases in T2D and hypertension prevalence, evidence across populations shows that genetic variation, which is driven by evolutionary forces including a natural selection that shaped the human genome, also plays a role. Here we report the evidence for the effect of selection in African genomes on mechanisms underlying T2D and hypertension, including energy metabolism, adipose tissue biology, insulin action and salt retention. Selection effects found for variants in genes PPARA and TCF7L2 may have enabled Africans to respond to nutritional challenges by altering carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Likewise, African-ancestry-specific characteristics of adipose tissue biology (low visceral adipose tissue [VAT], high intermuscular adipose tissue and a strong association between VAT and adiponectin) may have been selected for in response to nutritional and infectious disease challenges in the African environment. Evidence for selection effects on insulin action, including insulin resistance and secretion, has been found for several genes including MPHOSPH9, TMEM127, ZRANB3 and MC3R. These effects may have been historically adaptive in critical conditions, such as famine and inflammation. A strong correlation between hypertension susceptibility variants and latitude supports the hypothesis of selection for salt retention mechanisms in warm, humid climates. Nevertheless, adaptive genomics studies in African populations are scarce. More work is needed, particularly genomics studies covering the wide diversity of African populations in SSA and Africans in diaspora, as well as further functional assessment of established risk loci.

AB  - Context: Time of day has been shown to impact athletic performance. with improved performance observed in the late afternoon-early evening. Diurnal variations in physiological factors may contribute to variations in pacing selection; however, research investigating time-of-day influence on pacing is limited. Purpose: To investigate the influence of time-of-day on pacing selection in a 4-km cycling time trial (11). Methods: Nineteen trained male cyclists (mean [SD] age 39.0 [10.7] y, height 1.8 [0.1] m, body mass 78.0 [9.4] kg, VO(2)max 62.1 [8.7] mL.kg(-1)-min(-1)) completed a 4-km TT on 5 separate occasions at 08:30, 11:30, 14:30, 17:30, and 20:30. All TTs were completed in a randomized order, separated by a minimum of 2 d and maximum of 7 d. Results: No time-of-day effects were observed in pacing as demonstrated by similar power outputs over 0.5-km intervals (P = .78) or overall mean power output (333.0 [38.9], 339.8 [37.2], 335.5 [31.2], 336.7 [35.2], and 334.9 [35.7] W; P = .45) when TTs were performed at 08:30, 11:30, 14:30, 17:30, and 20:30. Preexercise tympanic temperature demonstrated a time-of-day effect (P < .001), with tympanic temperature higher at 14:30 and 17:30 than at 08:30 and 11:30. Conclusion: While a biological rhythm was present in tympanic temperature, pacing selection and performance when completing a 4-km cycling TT were not influenced by time of day. The findings suggest that well-trained cyclists can maintain a robust pacing strategy for a 4-km TT regardless of time of the day.

AB  - Terrestrial isopods have evolved pleopodal lungs that provide access to the rich aerial supply of oxygen. However, isopods occupy conditions with wide and unpredictable thermal and oxygen gradients, suggesting that they might have evolved adaptive developmental plasticity in their respiratory organs to help meet metabolic demand over a wide range of oxygen conditions.
   To explore this plasticity, we conducted an experiment in which we reared common rough woodlice (Porcellio scaber) from eggs to maturation at different temperatures (15 and 22 degrees C) combined with different oxygen levels (10% and 22% O-2). We sampled animals during development (only females) and then examined mature adults (both sexes). We compared woodlice between treatments with respect to the area of their pleopod exopodites (our proxy of lung size) and the shape of Bertalanffy's equations (our proxy of individual growth curves).
   Generally, males exhibited larger lungs than females relative to body size. Woodlice also grew relatively fast but achieved a decreased asymptotic body mass in response to warm conditions; the oxygen did not affect growth. Under hypoxia, growing females developed larger lungs compared to under normoxia, but only in the late stage of development. Among mature animals, this effect was present only in males. Woodlice reared under warm conditions had relatively small lungs, in both developing females (the effect was increased in relatively large females) and among mature males and females.
   Our results demonstrated that woodlice exhibit phenotypic plasticity in their lung size. We suggest that this plasticity helps woodlice equilibrate their gas exchange capacity to differences in the oxygen supply and metabolic demand along environmental temperature and oxygen gradients. The complex pattern of plasticity might indicate the effects of a balance between water conservation and oxygen uptake, which would be especially pronounced in mature females that need to generate an aqueous environment inside their brood pouch.

AB  - In many ectotherms, incubation temperature has profound effects on the timing of hatching and size of hatchlings, but the mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. We studied the energetics of embryonic development and growth in the lizard Sceloporus undulatus. Eggs were incubated at six constant temperatures, ranging from 28 degrees to 38 degreesC, and embryonic metabolism, incubation period,and body size at hatching were determined. The duration of embryonic development decreased significantly from 55 d at 28 degrees to 40 d at 32 degreesC but did not differ significantly between 32 degrees and 34 degreesC. Embryos incubated at temperatures above 34 degreesC did not survive to hatching. Metabolic rate at specific stages of development (percentage of total incubation period) did not differ among embryos incubated at 28 degrees, 30 degrees, and 34 degreesC. As a result, the total amount of energy expended during the incubation period at 28 degreesC (2.0 kJ) was greater than that at 30 degrees -34 degreesC (1.7-1.8 kJ). However, the difference in energy expenditure did not affect body size at hatching; neither snout-vent length nor body mass varied significantly with incubation temperature, and both were the same as those of hatchlings collected in the field. Thus, there was no apparent , trade-off between hatching date and body size of lizards at hatching.
   In a natural population in New Jersey, USA, we quantified soil temperatures at potential nesting sites and studied the thermoregulatory, behavior of gravid females to examine the possible consequences of female behaviour for hatching phenotypes. In females and at potential nest sites, embryos would experience temperatures that resulted in high mortality in the laboratory experiment (>32 degreesC). Gravid females had a field body temperature of 33.9 degreesC (95% CI = 0.8 degreesC) and selected a body temperature of 33.3 degreesC (95% CI = 1.9 degreesC) when placed in thermal gradients in the laboratory. Soil temperatures rose above 32 degreesC for several hours each day. Embryos must be able to survive intermittent exposure to temperatures that were lethal under conditions of chronic exposure in the laboratory. Selection of relatively high body temperatures by gravid females, coupled with tolerance of acute exposure to relatively high soil temperatures, would reduce the incubation period without a concomitant reduction in body size at hatching.

AB  - While human-induced stressors such as warming and pollutants may co-occur and interact, evolutionary studies typically focus on single stressors. Rapid thermal evolution may help organisms better deal with warming, yet it remains an open question whether thermal evolution changes the toxicity of pollutants under warming. We investigated the effects of exposure to a novel pollutant (zinc oxide nanoparticles, nZnO) and 4 degrees C warming (20 degrees C vs. 24 degrees C) on key life history and physiological traits of the water flea Daphnia magna, a keystone species in aquatic ecosystems. To address the role of thermal evolution, we compared these effects between clones from an experimental evolution trial where animals were kept for two years in outdoor mesocosms at ambient temperatures or ambient +4 degrees C. The nZnO was more toxic at 20 degrees C than at 24 degrees C: only at 20 degrees C, it caused reductions in early fecundity, intrinsic growth rate and metabolic activity. This was due to a higher accumulated zinc burden at 20 degrees C than at 24 degrees C, which was associated with an upregulation of a metallothionein gene at 20 degrees C but not at 24 degrees C. Clones from the heated mesocosms better dealt with warming than clones from the ambient mesocosms, indicating rapid thermal evolution. Notably, rapid thermal evolution did not change the toxicity of nZnO, neither at 20 degrees C nor at 24 degrees C, suggesting no pleiotropy or metabolic trade-offs were at work under the current experimental design. Evaluating whether thermal evolution influences the toxicity of pollutants is important for ecological risk assessment. It provides key information to extrapolate laboratory-derived toxicity estimates of pollutants both in space to warmer regions and in time under future global warming scenarios. In general, studying how the evolution of tolerance to one anthropogenic stressor influence tolerance to other anthropogenic stressors should get more attention in a rapidly changing world where animals increasingly face combinations of stressors.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change and invasive species are two of the greatest threats to biodiversity, affecting the survival, fitness and distribution of many species around the globe. Invasive species are often expected to have broad thermal tolerance, be highly plastic, or have high adaptive potential when faced with novel environments. Tropical island ectotherms are expected to be vulnerable to climate change as they often have narrow thermal tolerance and limited plasticity. In Fiji, only one species of endemic bee, Homalictus fijiensis, is commonly found in the lowland regions, but two invasive bee species, Braunsapis puangensis and Ceratina dentipes, have recently been introduced into Fiji. These introduced species pollinate invasive plants and might compete with H. fijiensis and other native pollinators for resources. To test whether certain performance traits promote invasiveness of some species, and to determine which species are the most vulnerable to climate change, we compared the thermal tolerance, desiccation resistance, metabolic rate and seasonal performance adjustments of endemic and invasive bees in Fiji. The two invasive species tended to be more resistant to thermal and desiccation stress than H. fijiensis, while H. fijiensis had greater capacity to adjust their CTmax with season, and H. fijiensis females tended to have higher metabolic rates than B. puangensis females. These findings provide mixed support for current hypotheses for the functional basis of the success of invasive species; however, we expect the invasive bees in Fiji to be more resilient to climate change because of their increased thermal tolerance and desiccation resistance.

AB  - Most studies on consequences of environmental change focus on evolutionary and phenotypic plastic responses, but parental effects represent an additional mechanism by which organisms respond to their local environment. Parental effects can be adaptive if they enhance offsprings ability to cope with environments experienced by their parents, but can also be non-adaptive for instance when offspring from benign environments are just better provisioned and hence perform better than offspring from less benign environments. Parental effects originate from both the abiotic and biotic environmental variation. However, the effects of the parental abiotic and biotic environment are rarely studied together. We make use of an experimental set-up containing plots in a natural heath land, where summer precipitation was manipulated to reflect either ambient or drought conditions. In both plot types, competition from grasses was prevalent. We assessed survival and reproduction of Hieracium umbellatum offspring originating from ambient and drought plots grown in a factorial design with two levels of moisture (control and drought) and two levels of competition (grown with and without a local perennial grass). The maternal environment strongly affected offspring performance. Biomass and reproduction was higher in offspring from ambient plots in agreement with the hypothesis of a better maternal provisioning in the most benign environment. However, adding competition revealed potentially adaptive responses to survival, and altered allocation to reproduction in offspring from maternal drought plots. Under combined competition and drought (mimicking maternal drought plots), survival was only reduced in offspring from ambient plots, and offspring from drought plots survived best. When grown in competition under control watering conditions mimicking maternal ambient plots, offspring from drought plots (growing in an environment different from their maternal one) showed a 25% reduction in reproduction. Potential adaptive responses to the home maternal environment were only revealed when jointly manipulating levels of competition and water availability.

AB  - AimAnalysing how species niches shift between native and introduced ranges is a powerful tool for understanding the determinants of species distributions and for anticipating range expansions by invasive species. Most studies only consider the climatic niche, by correlating widely available presence-only data with regional climate. However, habitat characteristics and disturbance also shape species niches, thereby potentially confounding shifts attributed only to differences in climate. Here we used presence and abundance data for Oxalis pes-caprae, a species native to South Africa and invading areas globally, to understand how niche shifts may be influenced by disturbance at habitat and landscape scales in addition to climate.
   LocalityMediterranean climate areas world-wide.
   MethodsWe used available presence-only data and also conducted extensive surveys of the abundance of Oxalis (c. 11,000 plots) across different habitats in South Africa and in the introduced range in the Mediterranean Basin. We extended principal component analysis methods for measuring niche shifts by using Bayesian generalized linear models to identify climatic and disturbance niche shifts.
   ResultsWe found a large climatic niche expansion towards stronger seasonality and lower temperature in the introduced range, but this expansion was greatly reduced when considering only conditions available in both ranges. Oxalis occupied more natural landscapes in the native range that remained unoccupied in the introduced range (niche unfilling'). In contrast to the similar abundances in natural and disturbed habitats in its native range, Oxalis was more abundant in disturbed habitats in the introduced range.
   ConclusionsThe large climatic niche expansion most likely reflects significant plasticity of Oxalis rather than rapid evolution. Furthermore, the unfilling of its disturbance niche in the introduced range suggests high potential for further invasion of natural areas. Together, these findings suggest that the potential for future spread of invasive species may be underestimated by approaches that characterize species niches based only on climate or partial information about their distributions.

AB  - To test the hypothesis that the variance of incubation temperature may have constituted a significant selective force for reptilian viviparity, we incubated eggs of the slender forest skink Scincella modesta in five thermally different natural nests and at two constant temperatures (18 degrees C and 21 degrees C). Our manipulation of incubation temperature had significant effects on incubation length and several hatchling traits (snout-vent length, tail length, fore-limb length, and sprint speed), but not on hatching success and other hatchling traits examined (body mass, head size, and hind-limb length). Incubation length was nonlinearly sensitive to temperature, but it was not correlated with the thermal variance when holding the thermal mean constant. The 18 degrees C treatment not only produced smaller sized hatchlings but also resulted in decreased sprint speed. Eggs in the nest with the greatest proportion of temperatures higher than 28 degrees C also produced smaller sized hatchlings. None of the hatchling traits examined was affected by the thermal variance. Thermal fluctuations did result in longer incubation times, but females would benefit little from maintaining stable body temperatures or selecting thermally stable nests in terms of the reduced incubation length. Our data show that the mean rather than the variance of temperatures has a key role in influencing incubation length and hatchling phenotypes, and thus do not support the hypothesis tested [Current Zoology 58 (6): 812-819, 2012].

AB  - Food choice and habitual diet-related health outcomes are strongly influenced by the oral sensations elicited by food. Of the biological-based mediators of orosensation, thermal tasting-the capacity to experience phantom taste sensations on lingual thermal stimulation-has not been investigated with respect to orosensation and liking of sampled foods.
   Twenty-three female thermal tasters (TTs) and 21 female thermal non-tasters (TnTs) scored liking of (9-point hedonic scale) and the intensity of orosensations elicited by (gVAS) 22 food and beverage items in duplicate using a randomized complete block design in a customized sensory evaluation laboratory. Foods selected included high fat, high sugar, and high salt items. Sampled items were grouped according to the dominant orosensation(s) elicited (sweet, bitter, sour, salty, astringent, creamy, crunchy, crispy, firm, menthol cool, and grainy), and intensity and liking assessed for each group.
   No significant differences were found for thermal tasting status (TTS) in intensity ratings of orosensory groupings (p(t) > 0.05). TnTs gave higher liking ratings for creamy foods than TTs (t = 5.99, p = 0.015), and their liking of the "aversive" food grouping was higher than for TTs and approached significance (t = 2.97, p = 0.086).
   The previously reported variation in orosensation due to TTS observed with simple aqueous solutions, and some beverages may not extend to sampled foods. However, differences in liking are suggested for some food groupings and are worthy of further investigation.

AB  - Global climate change is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity; one of the most important effects is the increase in the mean earth surface temperature. However, another but poorly studied main characteristic of global change appears to be an increase in temperature variability. Most of the current analyses of global change have focused on mean values, paying less attention to the role of the fluctuations of environmental variables. We experimentally tested the effects of environmental temperature variability on characteristics associated to the fitness (body mass balance, growth rate, and survival), metabolic rate (VCO2) and molecular traits (heat shock protein expression, Hsp70), in an ectotherm, the terrestrial woodlouse Porcellio laevis. Our general hypotheses are that higher values of thermal amplitude may directly affect life-history traits, increasing metabolic cost and stress responses. At first, results supported our hypotheses showing a diversity of responses among characters to the experimental thermal treatments. We emphasize that knowledge about the cellular and physiological mechanisms by which animals cope with environmental changes is essential to understand the impact of mean climatic change and variability. Also, we consider that the studies that only incorporate only mean temperatures to predict the life-history, ecological and evolutionary impact of global temperature changes present important problems to predict the diversity of responses of the organism. This is because the analysis ignores the complexity and details of the molecular and physiological processes by which animals cope with environmental variability, as well as the life-history and demographic consequences of such variability.

AB  - The investigation was carried out in typical wintertime (January 2016) of China. Relationships between health discomforts, which includes physiological effects to the nervous system, digestive system, respiratory system, skin and mucous membranes, and temperature steps were analyzed with the adjustment of subjects' anthropometric information. The Odds Ratio (OR) was applied to evaluate the possibility of suffering from certain kinds of discomforts for different groups of people in comparison to the control group. If the OR is higher than 1.0 (P < 0.05), it indicates that the focused group is more vulnerable than the control group. Results show that people in cold winter regions suffered higher risk (OR: 1335-2.044) of several discomforts than those in warm winter areas. For hot summer and cold winter region, air-conditioning usage intensified discomforts (OR >1) since the rates of 8 kinds of discomforts for people who use air-conditioning both at their offices and homes were significant higher than the control group (people use air-conditioning neither in their homes nor offices) with OR ranging from 1.455 to 2.276. Adaptability also has significant impact on human discomforts, showing as people whose residential period are less than 10 years have higher relative risks in several discomforts than people living here for more than 10 years (OR varying from 1.342 to 1.954), especially the psychological and nervous system effects. Body mass index, gender and age are also remarkable factors associated with human discomforts in winter. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although climate warming poses a grave threat to amphibians, little is known about the capacity of this group to evolve in response to warming. The capacity of key traits to evolve depends on the presence of genetic variation on which selection can act. Here, we use repeatability estimates to estimate the potential upper bounds of heritable genetic variation in voluntary and critical thermal maxima of gray-cheeked salamanders (Plethodon metcalfi). Increases in thermal tolerance may also require concordant increases in resistance to water loss because hotter temperatures incur greater evaporative risk. Therefore, we also tested for a correlation between voluntary thermal maxima and resistance to water loss and conducted an acclimation study to test for covariation between these traits in response to warming. Voluntary thermal maxima exhibited low to moderate levels of repeatability (R=0.32, P=0.045), while critical thermal maxima exhibited no statistically significant repeatability (R=0.10, P=0.57). Voluntary thermal maxima also correlated positively with resistance to water loss (R=0.31, P=0.025) but only when controlling for body mass. Voluntary thermal maxima and resistance to water loss also exhibited different acclimatory responses across control (12 & DEG;C-18 & DEG;C) and warm (18 & DEG;C-24 & DEG;C) temperature regimes, indicating a potential decoupling of traits in different thermal environments. By addressing the repeatability of thermal tolerance and the potential for covariation with resistance to water loss, we begin to address some of the key requirements of amphibians to evolve in warming climates.

AB  - The current policy has the world on track to experience around 3 degrees C of warming by 2100. The responses of organisms to our warming world will be mediated by changes in physiological processes, including metabolic rate. Metabolic rate represents the energetic cost of living, and is fundamental to understanding the energy required to sustain populations. Current evidence indicates that animals have a limited capacity to adapt to warmer environments by reducing their metabolic rate. Consequently, animals may be more reliant on metabolic plasticity to ameliorate the thermodynamic effect of rising temperatures on physiological rates. However, metabolic plasticity is influenced by other environmental factors, including the nutritional quality of food. Elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 are expected to reduce the protein and increase the carbohydrate concentration in plants, but we do not know how this will affect the response of metabolic rate to climate warming.
   Here we test the interactive effects of developmental dietary protein and carbohydrate concentrations on the metabolic plasticity of adultDrosophila melanogasterin response to a 3 degrees C increase in temperature while accounting for variation associated with body mass and activity (resting metabolic rate).
   We show that the thermal sensitivity of resting metabolic rate is modulated by developmental nutrition with animals reared on nutritionally poor, low-protein diets showing the greatest increase in resting metabolic rate in response to simulated climate warming. We also show that if the nutritional quality of resources is unaffected by climate change, then temperature-induced increases in resting metabolic rate will be offset by decreases in mass, but the absolute energy requirements of animals will be elevated relative to current conditions despite this. If, on the other hand, temperatures rise and resources become more calorie-dense and carbohydrate-rich, then the resting metabolic rate of animals will remain relatively unchanged, but decreases in mass and activity may drive down the absolute energy requirements of animals.
   In the absence of evolutionary adaptation, these findings suggest that the combined plastic response of physiological, morphological and behavioural traits to temperature and nutrition may be an important determinant of the ultimate outcome of climate change for populations.

AB  - Severe environmental conditions affect organisms in two major ways. The environment may be predictably severe such as in deserts, polar and alpine regions, or individuals may be exposed to temporarily extreme conditions through weather, presence of predators, lack of food, social status etc. Existence in an extreme environment may be possible, but then to breed or molt in addition can present major bottlenecks that have resulted in the evolution of hormone-behavior adaptations to cope with unpredictable events. Examples of hormone-behavior adaptations in extreme conditions include attenuated testosterone secretion because territoriality and excess courtship may be too costly when there is one opportunity to reproduce. The individual may even become insensitive to testosterone when target areas of the brain regulating reproductive behavior no longer respond to the hormone. A second example is reduced sensitivity to glucocorticoids following acute stress during the breeding season or molt that allows successful reproduction and/or a vital renewal of the integument to endure extreme conditions during the rest of the year. Reduced sensitivity could involve: (a) modulated response of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, (b) reduced sensitivity to high glucocorticoid levels, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b). Moreover, corticosteroid binding proteins (CBP) buffer responses to stress by reducing the movement of glucocorticoids into target cells. Finally, intracellular enzymes (11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and variants) can deactivate glucocorticoids entering cells thus reducing interaction with receptors. These mechanisms have important implications for climate change and increasing extremes of weather [Current Zoology 57 (3): 363-374, 2011].

AB  - Temperature influences almost all life-history traits. For a period of 3 mo, we placed four groups of snakes under four contrasted thermal treatments: (1) a natural regime (NR), based on daily variations (24-h cycle); (2) an accelerated regime (AR), where the thermoperiod fluctuated rapidly (12-h cycle); (3) a slow regime (SR; 48-h cycle); and (4) a cool stable regime (ZR; no fluctuation). The mean temperature, set at 23 degrees C, was identical for the four groups. For the first three groups (NR, AR, SR), ambient temperature fluctuated between 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C. Relative humidity and photoperiod were constant. We recorded feeding success, digestion efficiency, growth rate, activity, and ecdysis events. Differences between groups were expected because of varied exposure to the optimal temperatures, most notably in the ZR group, where the preferred body temperature for digestion (similar to 30 degrees C) would not be reached. Surprisingly, there was no significant effect of the experimental treatment on feeding rate, digestion, body mass increase, and growth rate. Our results do not conform to the paradigm stipulating that maximal body temperature selected by ectotherms necessarily corresponds to the most efficient for resource assimilation and that temperature fluctuations are essential. We propose that increasing the digestive tract's performance through body-temperature elevation trades off against elevated (parasite) energy expenditure from the rest of the body. The main advantage of high body temperatures would be to reduce the amount of time necessary to assimilate prey rather than to improve the net mass gain during digestion.

AB  - There is mounting evidence that the widespread phenotypic changes in response to urbanization may reflect adaptations caused by rapid evolutionary processes driven by urban-related stressors. Compared to increased habitat fragmentation and pollution, adaptations towards another typical urban-related stressor, that is higher and longer lasting very high temperatures (heatwaves), are much less studied. Notably, the sensitivities to heatwaves of life-history traits and important fitness-related physiological traits such as immune responsiveness and bioenergetic variables (energy availability, energy consumption and their balance) have never been contrasted between urban and rural populations. By conducting a laboratory common-garden experiment, we compared effects of a simulated heatwave on life history (survival and growth rate), immune responsiveness and bioenergetic variables between three urban and three rural populations of the damselflyCoenagrion puella. Because energy-mediated trade-off patterns may only be detected under energetically costly manipulations, all larvae were immune-challenged by simulating ectoparasitism by water mites. As expected, the simulated heatwave caused negative effects on nearly all response variables. The immune responsiveness, on the other hand, increased under the heatwave, consistent with a trade-off pattern between immune function and growth, and this similarly between urban and rural populations. A key finding was that urban larvae suffered less from the simulated heatwave compared to the rural larvae in terms of a lower heatwave-induced depletion in energy availability. This suggests an adaptation of urban populations to better cope with the stronger and more frequent heatwaves in cities. Notably, this urbanization-driven evolution in the bioenergetic variables was not apparent in the absence of a heatwave. Given that changes in energy budgets have strong fitness consequences, our findings suggest that the evolved higher ability to cope with heatwaves is fundamental for the survival of urban damselfly populations.

AB  - Ecosystems are under increasing stress from environmental change, including invasion by non-native species that can disrupt ecological processes and functions. Chinese tallow [Triadica sebifera (L.) Small] is a highly invasive tree species in southeastern US forests, prairies, and wetlands, and effectively managing this invasive species is a significant challenge for scientists and land managers. In this review, we synthesize the literature on invasion ecology and management of Chinese tallow. Our review suggests that the invaded range of Chinese tallow is currently limited by dispersal in many areas and by low temperatures and low soil moisture, and by high soil salinity and frequent flooding in others, but these barriers may be overcome by increased dispersal, phenotypic plasticity, and/or rapid evolution. Invasions by Chinese tallow are facilitated by both the invasiveness of the species and the invasibility of the recipient communities. Invasiveness of Chinese tallow has been attributed to fast growth, high fecundity, a persistent seed bank, aggressive resprouting, abiotic stress tolerance, and the ability to transform fire maintained ecosystems. Some of these traits may be enhanced in invasive populations. Anthropogenic and natural disturbances, lack of herbivore pressure, and facilitation by soil microbes enhance the intensity of Chinese tallow invasions. Biological control of Chinese tallow is being developed. Treatments such as herbicides, prescribed fire, and mechanical control can effectively control Chinese tallow at the local scale. A combination of these treatments improves results. However, a proactive management approach would simultaneously achieve invasion control and promote subsequent ecological restoration, especially in the context of legacy effects, secondary invasions, and/or variable ecosystem responses to different control treatments. Future research should clarify the roles of species invasiveness and community invasibility, increase our understanding of the effects of Chinese tallow in invaded communities, and develop viable management regimes that are effective in both controlling or reducing the probability of Chinese tallow invasion and restoring desired native communities.

AB  - Deep-sea benthic foraminifera live in the largest habitat on Earth, constitute an important part of its benthic biomass, and form diverse assemblages with common cosmopolitan species. Modern deep-sea benthic foraminiferal assemblages are strongly influenced by events affecting their main food source, phytoplankton (a relationship known as bentho-pelagic coupling). Surprisingly, benthic foraminifera did not suffer significant extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, when phytoplankton communities underwent severe extinction. Possibly, bentho-pelagic coupling was less strong than today in the warm oceans of the Cretaceous-Paleogene, because of differences in the process of food transfer from surface to bottom, or because more food was produced below the photic zone by litho-autotrophs. Alternatively, after the end-Cretaceous extinction the food supply from the photic zone recovered in less time than previously thought. In contrast, deep-sea benthic foraminifera did undergo severe extinction (30%-50% of species) at the end of the Paleocene, when planktic organisms show rapid evolutionary turnover, but no major extinction. Causes of this benthic extinction are not clear: net extinction rates were similar globally, but there is no independent evidence for global anoxia or dysoxia, nor of globally consistent increase or decrease in productivity or carbonate dissolution. The extinction might be linked to a global feature of the end-Paleocene environmental change, i.e., rapid global warming. Cenozoic deep-sea benthic faunas show gradual faunal turnover during periods of pronounced cooling and increase in polar ice volume: the late Eocene-early Oligocene, the middle Miocene, and the middle Pleistocene. During the latter turnover, taxa that decreased in abundance during the earlier two turnovers became extinct, possibly because of increased oxygenation of the oceans, or because of increased seasonality in food delivery. The Eocene-Oligocene was the most extensive of these turnovers, and bentho-pelagic coupling may have become established at that time.

AB  - Background: On August 9th 2012, we published an original research article in Scientific Reports, concluding that artificial radionuclides released from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant exerted genetically and physiologically adverse effects on the pale grass blue butterfly Zizeeria maha in the Fukushima area. Immediately following publication, many questions and comments were generated from all over the world. Here, we have clarified points made in the original paper and answered questions posed by the readers.
   Results: The following points were clarified. (1) There are many advantages to using the pale grass blue butterfly as an indicator species. (2) The forewings of the individuals collected in Fukushima were significantly smaller than in the northern and southern localities. (3) We observed growth retardation in the butterflies from the Fukushima area. (4) The aberrant colour patterns in the butterflies obtained in the Fukushima area were different from the colour patterns induced by temperature and sibling crosses but similar to those induced by external and internal exposures to the artificial radionuclides and by a chemical mutagen, suggesting that genetic mutations caused the aberrations. (5) This species of butterfly has been plentiful in Fukushima area for at least half a century. We here present specimens collected from Fukushima Prefecture before the accident. (6) Mutation accumulation was detected by the increase in the abnormality rates from May 2011 to September 2011. (7) The abnormal traits were heritable. (8) Our sampling localities were not affected by the tsunami. (9) We used a high enough number of samples to obtain statistically significant results. (10) The standard rearing method was followed, producing normal adults in the control groups. (11) The exposure experiments successfully reproduced the results of the field work. This species of butterfly is vulnerable to long-term low-dose internal and external exposures; however, insect cells are known to be resistant to short-term high-dose irradiation. This discrepancy is reconcilable based on the differences in the experimental conditions.
   Conclusions: We are just beginning to understand the biological effects of long-term low-dose exposures in animals. Further research is necessary to accurately assess the possible biological effects of the accident.

AB  - Environmental temperature has strong effects on the rate and efficiency of resource use in ectotherms, but little is known about how changes in temperature influence their diet selection patterns. Changes in temperature may alter the balance of nutrients required by ectotherms by affecting metabolism. In response to temperature changes, ectotherms are predicted to express a preference for a specific nutrient (protein or carbohydrate) to match their altered nutrient requirement. Here, we examined the nutritional consequences of mealworm beetles (Tenebrio molitor L.) that were constrained to diets varying in protein:carbohydrate balance (P:C = 1:5, 1:1, or 5:1) or offered a choice between two nutritionally complementary diets (1:5 vs. 5:1) at four different temperatures (20, 25, 30, or 35 A degrees C). Beetles had high mortality and reduced body mass at higher temperatures. Post-ingestive use efficiencies of both protein and carbohydrate decreased as temperature rose. Warming-driven decrease in carbohydrate use efficiencies occurred most profoundly when carbohydrates were consumed excessively. When given a choice, beetles selected protein and carbohydrate equally at 25 and 30 A degrees C, but exhibited a significant preference for carbohydrate at 35 A degrees C. Since carbohydrate is an immediate source of energy, this warming-driven preference for carbohydrate is explicable as an adaptive response of beetles to meet increased energy needs at high temperature. Beetles exposed to 20 A degrees C ate substantially less food, but preferentially consumed carbohydrate over protein possibly to cope with reduced energy intake. The present findings have implications for the impact of temperature on foraging and resource use in ectotherms.

AB  - Fish stocking programs designed for species rehabilitation aim to match the strains being stocked with the environments the fish will inhabit. The ability of different lake trout Salvelinus namaycush populations to adjust their physiological performance over a broad range of environmental conditions will be advantageous as water temperatures rise with climate warming. This study compares the adaptive physiological potential of 6 strains of lake trout stocked within the Laurentian Great Lakes by comparing growth, metabolic and cardiovascular performance, and organ-system tradeoffs across a temperature gradient. Using a common garden design, lake trout were raised from the embryonic stage until 2 years of age, when they were acclimated to temperatures of 8, 11, 15 and 19 degrees C before undergoing experiments to test their metabolic performance. For all strains, growth rates showed a dome-shaped response with temperature, peaking at 11 degrees C and reaching negative rates at 19 degrees C. For 5 of 6 strains, metabolic rates increased while in all strains cardiovascular performance declined with increasing temperature. Higher metabolic rates at higher temperatures generally came at the cost of slower growth, less investment into gastrointestinal mass, and reduced cardiovascular fitness and investment. Importantly, though, the Seneca strain was unique by showing a reduction of aerobic scope at the highest temperature, possibly indicating increased costs as temperature rises in this smaller-sized, potentially slower pace-of-life strain. However, the overall low interpopulation variability in our study suggests limited diversity in the physiological responses to temperature in strains stocked across the Great Lakes basin.

AB  - Amphipod crustaceans in freshwater springs offer excellent opportunities for testing hypotheses of life-history ecology and evolution. In this study, several hypotheses were tested regarding variation in brood mass, brood size (number of embryos per brood) and individual embryo mass within and among populations of Gammarus minus in ten cold springs in central Pennsylvania, U.S.A. Brood mass and brood size showed strong relationships with maternal body mass both within and among populations. Most of the relationships between brood mass and maternal mass were isometric or nearly so, as predicted by the hypothesis that available body volume within a confining exoskeleton is the major factor causing body-size scaling of reproductive investment in amphipods. However, as expected from optimal offspring investment theory, embryo mass was usually unrelated to maternal mass and its variation was much less than that of brood mass and brood size. The effects of other factors were assessed by adjusting each reproductive trait to maternal mass (designated by the term "relative"). As predicted by life-history theory, relative embryo mass and number were negatively correlated among populations. However, such trade-offs were usually absent within populations. Relative embryo mass was significantly greater during winter than summer in all four populations sampled, though varied seasonal effects occurred on relative brood mass and brood size. This seasonal variation in offspring size was unexpected, because in other amphipods it has usually been attributed tb changes in water temperature, which varied little during the year in the study springs. Other potential causes of this variation are seasonal changes in food availability and watercress coverage. Relative brood mass, brood size and embryo mass varied significantly among the ten populations sampled. This variation was independent of differences in water chemistry among the springs. However, predation and watercress coverage appeared to have significant effects on reproductive investment in G. minus. Amphipods in springs with watercress and sculpin predators produced relatively many small eggs, whereas those in springs without watercress and sculpin predators produced relatively few large eggs. Eggs of intermediate size and number were produced in springs with watercress, but no sculpin predators. In addition, female size at maturation was smaller, and the slopes of brood mass and embryo mass regressed on maternal mass were steeper in predator-rich vs, predator-poor springs. It is suggested that these patterns are the result of habitat differences in age-specific growth and mortality rates, as predicted by life-history theory. However, it is not known whether the interpopulation differences in offspring investment are the result of evolutionary or phenotypically plastic responses to environmental variation.

AB  - The main stems of large rivers throughout the world have been highly modified with little consideration for effects on fishes that rely on these areas to complete their life histories. Particularly important is the ability of riverine habitats to provide foraging opportunities for young fish. We explored how temperature, flow, and food availability influenced diet content, prey selection (Strauss's linear selectivity index), and energy condition of age-0 shovelnose sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorynchus and pallid sturgeon S. albus in major habitat areas (e.g., islands, channel borders, wing dikes, and side channels) of the middle Mississippi River during spring (March-May) and summer (June-August) 2008. Standardized diet mass (dry mass standardized for fish body mass) of the age-0 sturgeon peaked at about 19 degrees C and at a flow velocity of 0.5 m/s. Although potential prey taxa were diverse, the diets for age-0 sturgeon of all sizes were dominated by mayflies (Ephemeroptera) and midge larvae (Chironomidae) across all habitats. As age-0 sturgeon grew, the relative energy return per habitat appeared to diverge; island tips upstream of the main channel and channel border areas behind wing dikes provided higher gains in standardized diet mass than other habitats. No differences in energy condition (kJ/g) occurred among habitats, although large (51-200 mm total length [TL]) age-0 sturgeon had higher energy densities than their small (<= 50 mm TL) counterparts. Enhancement of areas with flow and substrates that facilitate the production and availability of midges and mayflies (e.g., instream island complexes) is critical for the recruitment of age-0 Scaphirhynchus sturgeon in large rivers.

AB  - 1. Dominance hierarchy, the dominance ranking of members in a community, is determined by the relative population fitness of coexisting species. Climate change can shift dominance hierarchies depending on how species respond to changing climate, but ecological mechanisms underlying such shifts remain largely unknown. Specifically, dominance hierarchy shifts under climate change have rarely been linked to eco-evolutionary responses to thermal extremes, which we consider in this study.
   2. We conducted an 8-year field survey to link extreme high-temperature events to the shift in dominance hierarchy of two worldwide cereal aphid species (Rhopalosiphum padi and Sitobion avenae), which may respond rapidly through evolutionary or plastic responses to thermal extremes due to their short generation duration, clonal structure and high thermal sensitivity. To further understand the mechanism involved in this change in species' dominance, we characterised aphid heat tolerance and demography of the two species sourced from relatively mild (Xinxiang) and hot (Wuhan) locations in a common garden design and compared the same measures in up-and down-selected lines of the two aphid species.
   3. We found that accumulation of extreme high-temperature events (EHTs) affected per capita growth rate of S. avenae but not R. padi, driving a shift in annual relative dominance of these two common species in wheat fields. Furthermore, evidence from common garden tests and artificial thermal selection revealed that evolutionary and plastic changes in thermal tolerance under EHTs were species-dependent; R. padi evolved higher heat tolerance without reducing fitness while S. avenae did not evolve heat tolerance but showed detrimental transgenerational plastic changes under thermal extremes. Rhopalosiphum padi may take over the dominant position of S. avenae in a warmer future, due to a higher evolutionary potential of heat tolerance and less detrimental plasticity following selection.
   4. Field surveys and laboratory experiments together point to a shift in species dominance related to interspecific differences in species' evolutionary rates and transgenerational plasticity of thermal traits during selection events associated with extreme climatic conditions. This study highlights that eco-evolutionary dynamics can contribute to community responses to natural thermal extremes.

AB  - Distribution of species across the Earth shows strong latitudinal and altitudinal gradients with the number of species decreasing with declining temperatures. While these patterns have been recognized for well over a century, the mechanisms generating and maintaining them have remained elusive. Here, we propose a mechanistic explanation for temperature-dependent rates of molecular evolution that can influence speciation rates and global biodiversity gradients. Our hypothesis is based on the effects of temperature and temperature-adaptation on stability of proteins and other catalytic biomolecules. First, due to the nature of physical forces between biomolecules and water, stability of biomolecules is maximal around. 20 degrees C and decreases as temperature either decreases or increases. Second, organisms that have adapted to cold temperatures have evolved especially flexible (but unstable) proteins to facilitate catalytic reactions in cold, where molecular movements slow down. Both these effects should result in mutations being on average more detrimental at cold temperatures (i.e. lower mutational robustness in cold). At high temperatures, destabilizing water-biomolecule interactions, and the need to maintain structures that withstand heat denaturation, should decrease mutational robustness similarly. Decreased mutational robustness at extreme temperatures will slow down molecular evolution, as a larger fraction of new mutations will be removed by selection. Lower mutational robustness may also select for reduced mutation rates, further slowing down the rate of molecular evolution. As speciation requires the evolution of epistatic incompatibilities that prevent gene flow among incipient species, slow rate of molecular evolution at extreme temperatures will directly slow down the rate at which new species arise. The proposed mechanism can thus explain why molecular evolution is faster at warm temperatures, contributing to higher speciation rate and elevated species richness in environments characterized by stable and warm temperatures.

AB  - Parasite virulence has been hypothesised to increase with the degree of host sociality because highly social hosts have a greater probability of encountering horizontal transmission of parasites and experiencing infections with multiple strains of the same parasites than do solitary hosts. As compared with the defences of closely related social host species, we predicted that solitary hosts should have relatively weak defences against parasites, thus being relatively more affected when parasitised by a novel parasite. We tested this prediction by either experimentally infesting 12 nests of the solitarily nesting red-rumped swallow Hirundo daurica with 50 individuals of the generalist martin bug Oeciacus hirundinis or by fumigation of nine nests. Nestlings 13 days old from the parasite addition group experienced increased mortality, attained lower body mass and tended to have shorter tarsi compared to nestlings from fumigated nests. Surprisingly, nestlings from the parasite addition group had higher packed cell volume (cellular fraction of blood) and lower levels of heat shock proteins (HSP60) than nestlings from the fumigation group. A measure of immunocompetence was not significantly affected by treatment, but its magnitude was positively related to packed cell volume and negatively related to level of HSP60. Solitary hosts like the red-rumped swallow have weak immune responses and low levels of heat shock proteins when infested with ectoparasites while highly social hosts have strong immune responses and high levels of heat shock proteins when infested. These findings partially support the hypothesis that potential host species with weak defences are more susceptible to infection and the deleterious effects of evolving parasites than potential hosts with strong defences.

AB  - Viruses are under relentless selective pressure from host immune defenses. To study how poxviruses adapt to innate immune detection pathways, we performed serial vaccinia virus infections in primary human cells. Independent courses of experimental evolution with a recombinant strain lacking E3L revealed several high-frequency point mutations in conserved poxvirus genes, suggesting important roles for essential poxvirus proteins in innate immune subversion. Two distinct mutations were identified in the viral RNA polymerase gene A24R, which seem to act through different mechanisms to increase virus replication. Specifically, a Leu18Phe substitution encoded within A24R conferred fitness trade-offs, including increased activation of the antiviral factor protein kinase R (PKR). Intriguingly, this A24R variant underwent a drastic selective sweep during passaging, despite enhanced PKR activity. We showed that the sweep of this variant could be accelerated by the presence of copy number variation (CNV) at the K3L locus, which in multiple copies strongly reduced PKR activation. Therefore, adaptive cases of CNV can facilitate the accumulation of point mutations separate from the expanded locus. This study reveals how rapid bouts of gene copy number amplification during accrual of distant point mutations can potently facilitate poxvirus adaptation to host defenses.
   IMPORTANCE Viruses can evolve quickly to defeat host immune functions. For poxviruses, little is known about how multiple adaptive mutations emerge in populations at the same time. In this study, we uncovered a means of vaccinia virus adaptation involving the accumulation of distinct genetic variants within a single population. We identified adaptive point mutations in the viral RNA polymerase gene A24R and, surprisingly, found that one of these mutations activates the nucleic acid sensing factor PKR. We also found that gene copy number variation (CNV) can provide dual benefits to evolving virus populations, including evidence that CNV facilitates the accumulation of a point mutation distant from the expanded locus. Our data suggest that transient CNV can accelerate the fixation of mutations conferring modest benefits, or even fitness trade-offs, and highlight how structural variation might aid poxvirus adaptation through both direct and indirect actions.

AB  - Aim Alien species successfully colonize new ranges if they encounter favourable environmental conditions there and possess traits that match new challenges. Climate-matching approaches comparing native and exotic ranges mostly consider temperature and precipitation niches of alien species, but have largely ignored UV-B radiation. UV-B fundamentally differs between hemispheres, with much higher levels at southern than at northern latitudes. Consequently, UV-B might act at the global scale and present a so far neglected filter that species need to overcome when invading high-UV-B environments. Location We performed two multi-species common garden experiments, conducted in the native European range (Germany) and the high-UV-B exotic range (New Zealand) to test for preadaptation to UV-B. Methods We used 25 herbaceous species from open habitats, which we exposed in each range to three UV radiation treatments: (a) natural sunlight, (b) exclusion of UV-B while allowing natural UV-A, and (c) exclusion of UV-B and UV-A. We additionally used plant traits (TRY), global distribution data (GBIF, GloNAF) and global UV-B satellite data (glUV) to determine species-specific characteristics as fostering agents of UV-B tolerance. The joint analysis of experimental and macroecological data allowed quantification of species plasticity and identification of beneficial species traits in high-UV-B environments. Results Our results showed an overall limiting effect of UV-B in both common gardens but the UV-stress response tended to be more pronounced in the invaded range. Across all species, we found little evidence for preadaptation by functional plant traits. In contrast, preadaptation to climatic conditions related to the species' native UV-B niche was of greater importance for plant performance in the presence of UV-B radiation. Main conclusions For predicting alien species' ability to expand into high-UV-B environments, macroclimatic niche characteristics of the species' native range might be better predictors than functional traits and should be more considered in future projection models.

AB  - The developmental trajectory of an organism is influenced by the interaction between its genes and the environment in which it develops. For example, the phenotypic traits of a hatchling reptile can be influenced by the organism's genotype, by incubation temperature, and by genetically coded norms of reaction for thermally labile traits. The evolution of parthenogenesis provides a unique opportunity to explore such effects: a hybrid origin of this trait in vertebrates modifies important aspects of the genotype (e.g., heterozygosity, polyploidy) and may thus impact not only on the phenotype generally, but also on the ways in which incubation temperature affects expression of the phenotype. The scarcity of vertebrate parthenogenesis has been attributed to developmental disruptions, but previous work has rarely considered reaction norms of embryogenesis in this respect. We used closely related sexual and asexual races of the Australian gecko Heteronotia binoei, which include those with multiple origins of parthenogenesis, to explore the ways in which reproductive modes (sexual, asexual), incubation temperatures (24, 27, and 30degreesC), and the interaction between these factors affected hatchling phenotypes. The hatchling traits we considered included incubation period, incidence of deformities, hatchling survivorship, body size and shape, scalation (including fluctuating asymmetry), locomotor performance, and growth rate. Developmental success was slightly reduced (higher proportion of abnormal offspring) in parthenogenetic lineages although there was no major difference in hatching success. Incubation temperature affected a suite of traits including incubation period, tail length, body mass relative to egg mass, labial scale counts, running speed, growth rate, and hatchling survival. Our data also reveal an interaction between reproductive modes and thermal regimes, with the phenotypic traits of parthenogenetic lizards less sensitive to incubation temperature than was the case for their sexual relatives. Thus, the evolution of asexual reproduction in this species complex has modified both mean hatchling viability and the norms of reaction linking hatchling phenotypes to incubation temperature. Discussions on the reasons why parthenogenetic organisms are scarce in nature should take into account interactive effects such as these; future work could usefully try to tease apart the roles of parthenogenesis, its hybrid origin (and thus effects on ploidy and heterozygosity, etc.), and clonal selection in generating these divergent embryonic responses.

AB  - This study aims to assess morphological variation of the ring-necked or common pheasant Phasianus colchicus across mainland China in response to environmental factors. We collected 399 pheasant and divided them into two groups: high altitude ( 1500m) and low altitude (<1500m). The results that all morphological size measures of males were significantly higher than those of females (P<0.05). Most measures of size at low altitude significantly greater than those at high altitudes, including body weight, body length, and wing length for males (P<0.05), and body weight and wing length for females. The results showed that males and females are different in response to environmental factors. The body weight, wing length, tarsus, skull length and interorbital distance in females were significantly correlated with atmospheric pressure (P<0.05), along with body weight, body length, rictus, wing length, tarsus and skull length in males (P<0.05). A significant positive correlation was observed between wing length of males and wind speed (P=0.017). Conversely, body weight, body length, wing length and tail length in males were significantly negatively correlated with air temperature (P<0.05). Many measures of body size (wing length and tail length for males; tail length for females) increased with latitude after controlling for altitude, indicating that the body size of this species, especially in males, is significantly larger at high latitudes. It is the common pheasant?s adaptability to considerable environmental change that has facilitated the vast distribution of this species.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate potential differences in preferred Personal Comfort Systems (PCS) settings of Japanese and Han-Chinese versus white-western-middle-Europeans.
   Method: A series of five experiments (n=167) with similar methodology is reported that allowed participants to self-select their preferred PCS outlet air temperature in a warm controlled climatic chamber setup with and without solar radiation. Test groups were matched for age, height, weight, body-surface-area and body-mass-index to remove the influence of these confounding factors on the results. Participants were first exposed to solar radiation (exp-1-4; simulating glazed building without proper shading or a car) before starting to control the outlet temperature of the PCS, or (exp-5, simulating warm building) were exposed to a warm room temperature and immediately could control the PCS. Ethnicity effects were studied through the chosen preferred PCS outlet temperatures and the microclimate temperature close to the participants' chest.
   Results: In all experiments, Asian groups selected a PCS outlet temperature significantly higher, on average by 5 degrees C, leading to a 1.9 degrees C higher microclimate temperature at chest level. While absolute selected temperatures of the PCS differed between experiments, related to different designs of the PCS and climate conditions, no interaction between ethnicity and experiment was present.
   Conclusions: Despite removing important confounding factors that could explain earlier observed differences between Asian and white western middle-European ethnicities tested, a substantial, consistently higher thermal preference temperature of the PCS was found in the two Asian groups. This has implications for the design parameters of PCS for use in offices or air-conditioning systems in cars.

AB  - Only model organisms live in a world of endless summer. Fitness at temperate latitudes reflects the ability of organisms in nature to exploit the favorable season, to mitigate the effects of the unfavorable season, and to make the timely switch from one life style to the other. Herein, we define fitness as Ry, the year-long cohort replacement rate across all four seasons, of the mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, reared in its natural microhabitat in processor-controlled environment rooms. First, we exposed cohorts of W. smithii, from southern, midlatitude, and northern populations (30-50degreesN) to southern and northern thermal years during which we factored out evolved differences in photoperiodic response. We found clear evidence of evolved differences in heat and cold tolerance among populations. Relative cold tolerance of northern populations became apparent when populations were stressed to the brink of extinction; relative heat tolerance of southern populations became apparent when the adverse effects of heat could accumulate over several generations. Second, we exposed southern, midlatitude, and northern populations to natural, midlatitude day lengths in a thermally benign midlatitude thermal year. We found that evolved differences in photoperiodic response (1) prevented the timely entry of southern populations into diapause resulting in a 74% decline in fitness, and (2) forced northern populations to endure a warm-season diapause resulting in an 88% decline in fitness. We argue that reciprocal transplants across latitudes in nature always confound the effects of the thermal and photic environment on fitness. Yet, to our knowledge, no one has previously held the thermal year constant while varying the photic year. This distinction is crucial in evaluating the potential impact of climate change. Because global warming in the Northern Hemisphere is proceeding faster at northern than at southern latitudes and because this change represents an amelioration of the thermal environment and a concomitant increase in the duration of the growing season, we conclude that there should be more rapid evolution of photoperiodic response than of thermal tolerance as a consequence of global warming among northern, temperate ectotherms.

AB  - BackgroundThe impressive adaptive radiation of notothenioid fishes in Antarctic waters is generally thought to have been facilitated by an evolutionary key innovation, antifreeze glycoproteins, permitting the rapid evolution of more than 120 species subsequent to the Antarctic glaciation. By way of contrast, the second-most species-rich notothenioid genus, Patagonotothen, which is nested within the Antarctic clade of Notothenioidei, is almost exclusively found in the non-Antarctic waters of Patagonia. While the drivers of the diversification of Patagonotothen are currently unknown, they are unlikely to be related to antifreeze glycoproteins, given that water temperatures in Patagonia are well above freezing point. Here we performed a phylogenetic analysis based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) in a total of twelve Patagonotothen species.ResultsWe present a well-supported, time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis including closely and distantly related outgroups, confirming the monophyly of the genus Patagonotothen with an origin approximately 3 million years ago and the paraphyly of both the sister genus Lepidonotothen and the family Notothenidae. Our phylogenomic and population genetic analyses highlight a previously unrecognized linage and provide evidence for shared genetic variation between some closely related species. We also provide a mitochondrial phylogeny showing mitonuclear discordance.ConclusionsBased on a combination of phylogenomic and population genomic approaches, we provide evidence for the existence of a new, potentially cryptic, Patagonotothen species, and demonstrate that genetic boundaries between some closely related species are diffuse, likely due to recent introgression and/or incomplete linage sorting. The detected mitonuclear discordance highlights the limitations of relying on a single locus for species barcoding. In addition, our time-calibrated phylogenetic hypothesis shows that the early burst of diversification roughly coincides with the onset of the intensification of Quaternary glacial cycles and that the rate of species accumulation may have been stepwise rather than constant. Our phylogenetic framework not only advances our understanding of the origin of a high-latitude marine radiation, but also provides the basis for the study of the ecology and life history of the genus Patagonotothen, as well as for their conservation and commercial management.

AB  - Intraspecific variation in sexual traits may arise from a variety of processes such as genetic drift, sexual selection, or spatial heterogeneity of environmental conditions. Recent empirical studies suggest that sexual selection may vary with environmental conditions accelerating differentiation of sexual traits among populations. Land snails are simultaneously hermaphroditic animals characterized by low mobility and limited dispersal, so that life cycle characteristics of their populations are strongly influenced by local environmental conditions. In this study, we report results on intraspecific variation in sexual selection intensity as well as in behavioral and anatomical reproductive traits in the land snail Cornu aspersum. We performed a common garden experiment of adult snails originating from four populations from either of two regions in Greece differing in habitat temperature and predictability of rainfall during their reproductive season. Our results indicate substantial intra-specific variation in the opportunity for sexual selection, which was associated with differences in both behavioral and anatomical reproductive characters. Snails from populations that experienced unpredictable habitat conditions expanded their reproductive activity period, exhibited higher mating frequency, and showed longer copulation duration, relative to snails living in more predictable habitats. Additionally, snails originating from populations with unpredictable habitat conditions showed a distinct reproductive morphology with a shorter bursa tract length, which we interpret as indicative of an enhanced ability to hydrolyze the received spermatophores. We conclude that local environmental conditions experienced by the different populations could have triggered differences in the opportunity for sexual selection, which may ultimately lead to allopatric speciation through sexual selection.
   Significance statement
   Environment-dependent sexual selection is considered to promote allopatric speciation of distant populations. However, empirical studies testing for geographic differences in the strength of sexual selection and associated reproductive characters are scarce. In C. aspersum, variation in both behavioral and anatomical reproductive traits among populations is well-documented, but the extent to which this is driven by diverse pressures of sexual selection under heterogeneous environmental conditions among populations remains unexplored. We demonstrate that snails from two geographically distant regions of Greece, with contrasting natural habitats, differ mainly in their behavioral traits and in several morphological traits, which are associated with differences in the opportunity for pre-and post-copulatory sexual selection.

AB  - Most main sequence stars are binaries or higher multiplicity Systems and it appears that at birth most stars have circumstellar disks. It is commonly accepted that planetary systems arise from the material of these disks; consequently, binary and multiple systems may have a main role in planet formation. In this paper, we study the stage of planetary formation during which the particulate material is still dispersed as centimetre-to-metre sized primordial aggregates. We investigate the response of the particles, in a protoplanetary disk with radius R(D) = 100 AU around a solar-like star, to the gravitational field of bound perturbing companions in a moderately wide (300-1600 AU) orbit. For this purpose, we have carried out a series of simulations of coplanar hierarchical configurations using a direct integration code that models gravitational and viscous forces. The massive protoplanetary disk is around one of the components of the binary. The evolution in time of the dust sub-disk depends mainly on the nature (prograde or retrograde) of the relative revolution of the stellar companion, and on the temperature and mass of the circumstellar disk. Our results show that for binary companions near the limit of tidal truncation of the disk, the perturbation leads to an enhanced accretion rate onto the primary, decreasing the lifetime of the particles in the protoplanetary disk with respect to the case of a single star. As a consequence of an enhanced accretion rate the mass of the disk decreases faster, which leads to a longer resultant lifetime for particles in the disk. On the other hand, binary companions may induce tidal arms in the dust phase of protoplanetary disks. Spiral perturbations with m = 1 may increase in a factor 10 or more the dust surface density in the neighbourhood of the arm, facilitating the growth of the particles. Moreover, in a massive disk (0.01M.) the survival time of particles is significantly shorter than in a less massive nebula (0.001M.) and the temperature of the disk severely influences the spiral-in time of particles. The rapid evolution of the dust component found in post T Tauri stars can be explained as a result of their binary nature. Binarity may also influence the evolution of circumpulsar disks.

AB  - Global warming and pesticide pollution are major threats for aquatic biodiversity. Yet, how pesticide effects are influenced by the increased frequency of extreme temperatures under global warming and how local thermal adaptation may mitigate these effects is unknown. We therefore investigated the combined impact of larval chlorpyrifos exposure, larval food stress and adult heat exposure on a set of fitness-related traits in replicated low- and high-latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans. Larval pesticide exposure resulted in lighter adults with a higher water content, lower fat content, higher Hsp70 levels and a lower immune function (PO activity). Heat exposure reduced water content, mass, fat content and flying ability. Importantly, both stressors interacted across metamorphosis: adult heat exposure lowered the reduction of fat content, and generated a stronger decrease in PO activity in pesticide-exposed animals. Larval pesticide exposure and larval food stress also reduced the defense response to the adult heat stress in terms of increased Hsp70 levels. In line with strong life history differences in the unstressed control situation, high-latitude animals were less sensitive to food stress (body mass and water content), but more sensitive to pesticide stress (development time and PO activity) and heat exposure (PO activity and Hsp70 levels). While low-latitude adults could better withstand the extreme temperature as suggested by the weaker increase in Hsp70, heat exposure similarly affected the delayed effects of larval pesticide exposure at both latitudes. Our study highlighted two key findings relevant for ecological risk assessment under global warming. Firstly, the delayed effects of larval pesticide exposure on adult damselflies depended upon subsequent adult heat exposure, indicating that larval pesticide stress and adult heat stress interacted across metamorphosis. Secondly, low- and high-latitude animals responded differently to the imposed stressors, highlighting that intraspecific evolution along natural thermal gradients may shape sensitivity to pesticides.

AB  - The New World silversides (family Atherinopsidae) are found in marine, estuarine and inland waters of North, Central and South America, where they are ecologically important as forage fishes and sometimes economically important for commercial and recreational fisheries. This report reviews the knowledge of the reproductive attributes of temperate and subtropical atherinopsids in relation to temperature and discusses the potential effects of climate change on their reproduction and adaptive responses. Their reproductive cycles are primarily entrained by photoperiod with high temperature acting as a limiting factor. They are generally multiple spawners which release successive batches of eggs in spring, but some species can spawn also in autumn and even summer when temperatures do not increase excessively. The decoupling of temperature patterns and photoperiod with further global warming and associated asymmetric thermal fluctuations could lead to spawning at times or temperatures that are unsuitable for larval development and growth. Many members of this family show temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), where the phenotypic sex of an individual is determined partly or wholly by the temperature experienced during gonadal sex differentiation, and high-temperature induced germ cell degeneration and decreased fertility. The predicted short-term reproductive responses of atherinopsids to climate change therefore include acceleration, shortening or overall disruption of spawning activity, and also more subtle, but nonetheless equally population-threatening, dysfunctions such as highly skewed sex ratios and partial or total loss of fertility. In the case of species with TSD, asymmetric thermal fluctuations could also cause larvae to encounter temperatures lower than normal during early development and be feminized. Such dysfunctions have been documented already in natural populations but are confined so far to landlocked, inland water habitats, perhaps because they impose more severe thermal fluctuations and limitations to migration and dispersal. The severity and recurrence of these dysfunctions with further climate change will depend both on the magnitude, speed and pattern of change and on how much (or how fast) physiological and behavioural traits can evolve to match the new conditions imposed by the climate, which is largely unknown. In this regard, compelling evidence is shown that numerous traits, including the sex determination system, are capable of rapid evolution and could mitigate the negative effects of temperature increases on population viability in atherinopsids.

AB  - The polyplacophoran Chiton articulatus Sowerby, 1832, is distributed along the tropical Pacific coast of Mexico and has been collected for generations in an artisanal manner for bait or as a complement in domestic cookery of coastal inhabitants; nevertheless, recently, some restaurants are offering this chiton to the tourists as a gourmet and aphrodisiac food, thus becoming of potential economic interest. This study explores in a population of C. articulatus adults from Oaxaca, southern Mexican Pacific, the changes in morphometry and in somatic and reproductive indices throughout one year, reporting on five reproductive indices, five somatic indices, body shape (BS), and length-weight relationships. An attempt is made to elucidate the energetic trade-off between somatic and reproductive tissues, including an assessment of whether these can be estimated from noninvasive indices. Somatic indices diminished considerably as gonad development proceeded, thus showing an inverse relationship with reproductive indices. Body mass index (BMI, i.e., physical conditions) patterns revealed that chitons were overweight (in the sense of high accumulation of lipids in the gonad) during reproductive seasons. The C. articulatus body was mainly oval-shaped throughout the whole sampling period. The slope of the length-weight regressions indicated an allometric growth (b, between 2.2 and 2.8). Gonad development is fueled by energy and nutrients derived from food rather than from reallocation of somatic reserves, although some somatic tissue constituents (in particular from foot) of reproducing adults may be mobilized in the short-term to meet nutrient and energy needs for reproduction. Reproductive seasons of C. articulatus according to the measured indices, occurred around May (late-spring) and again around August-September (late-summer), and these periods were correlated with maximum sea surface temperatures. The measurement of BS together with BMI can be used nearly as effectively as the more invasive reproductive indices to estimate reproductive seasonality.

AB  - Since DeNiro and Epstein's discovery that the C-13 and N-15 isotopic signatures of animals approximate those of their respective diets, the measurement of stable isotope signatures has become an important tool for ecologists studying the diets of wild animals. This study used Madagascar hissing cockroaches (Gromphadorhina portentosa) to examine several preexisting hypotheses about the relationship between the isotopic composition of an animal and its diet. Contrary to my predictions, the results revealed that the tissues of adult cockroaches raised for two generations on a diet of known isotopic composition did not demonstrate enrichment of heavy stable isotopes. More-over, the N-15 signatures of cockroaches were neither influenced by periods of rapid growth (i.e.,300-fold increase in dry body mass over 120 d) nor by imposed periods of starvation lasting up to 80 d. The offspring born to mothers raised on known diets were enriched in N-15. Diet-switching experiments showed that turnover times of C-13 were highly correlated with age and ranged from 9 to 10 d to 60 to 75 d in subadults and adults, respectively. Adults subjected to diet switches differed from the subadults in that the adults achieved equilibrated isotopic signatures that were shifted approximately 1.0 parts per thousand toward their respective original diets. Lipid fractions of adult cockroaches averaged 2.9 parts per thousand more depleted in C-13 than in lipid-free fractions, but no changes in 13C were observed in aging adults. Exposure to reduced ambient temperature from 33 degrees C to 23 degrees C over 120 d did not influence isotopic signatures of tissues. Overall, the results of this study reveal that different endogenous and exogenous factors can influence the isotopic signatures of cockroaches. These findings reinforce the need to conduct controlled studies to further examine environmental factors that influence the relationships between the isotopic signatures of animals and their diets.

AB  - 1. The field of acoustic telemetry has evolved rapidly and now permits the remote sensing of animal behaviour, movement, physiology and survival in environments, and species not previously possible. However, an inability to detect when a telemetered animal is consumed by a predator can complicate accurate interpretation of the telemetry data. In this paper, we describe the efforts taken to test the two generations of a novel prototype acoustic telemetry transmitter designed specifically to detect predation.
   2. Testing involved either staged predation events where tagged prey (Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and Yellow Perch Perca flavescens) were fed to captive Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, or false-positive testing where prey fish were tagged and held without the risk of predation. Metrics of interest were (i) the rate of correctly identifying the predation events, (ii) signal lag (i.e. the time required to detect a predation event), (iii) tag retention time in the predator's gut, and (iv) the rate of false-positive triggering in both live and dead prey fishes.
   3. Staged predation events were successfully identified in 61/65 and 52/55 trials for generation 1 and 2 tags, respectively. Signal lag time was reduced in generation 1 tags (generally between 1 and 9 h) relative to generation 2 (3-29 h); although signal lag was highly variable. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) indicated strong evidence that signal lag and tag retention were both negatively correlated with water temperature, but were not affected by prey species and only slightly by individual predator traits. There was preliminary evidence that prey size may be an important determinant of both signal lag and tag retention. False-positives in live fish were absent after 120 days for generation 1 tags (n = 31), however, the false-positive rates were significantly higher (10/44) after only 66 days for generation 2 tags. False-positives in dead fish showed that 20% of the generation 2 predation tags would falsely trigger 2-3 days post-mortem.
   4. Testing of the novel predation tags was encouraging, however, further testing is recommended. Predation tags will be an important contribution to the field of acoustic telemetry, thus, permitting the improved data interpretation and less-subjective estimates of predation rates in biotelemetry studies.

AB  - Examples of phenotypic plasticity-the ability of organisms of identical genotypes to produce different phenotypes in response to the environment-are abundant, but often lack data on the causative physiology and biochemistry. Phenotypes associated with increased protection against or reduced damage from harmful environments may, in fact, be downstream effects of hidden adaptive responses that remain elusive to experimental measurement or be obscured by homeostatic or over-compensatory effects. The freshwater zooplankton crustacean Daphnia drastically increases its heat tolerance as the result of acclimation to high temperatures, an effect often assumed to be based on plastic responses allowing better protection against oxidative stress. Using several geographically distant Daphnia magna genotypes, we demonstrate that the more heat tolerant individuals have a higher total antioxidant capacity (TAC) both in the comparison of heat-acclimated vs. non heat-acclimated females and in the comparison of females to age- and body size-matched males, which show lower heat tolerance than females. However, experimental manipulations of hypothesized antioxidant pathways by either glutathione addition or glutathione synthesis inhibition had no effect on heat tolerance. Lipid peroxidation (LPO), contrary to expectations, did not appear to be a predictive measure of susceptibility to thermal damage: LPO was higher, not lower, in more heat tolerant heat-acclimated individuals after exposure to a lethally high temperature. We hypothesize that LPO may be maintained in Daphnia at a constant level in the absence of acute exposure to elevated temperature and increase as a by-product of a possible protective antioxidant mechanism during such exposure. This conclusion is corroborated by the observed short-term and long-term changes in phospholipid composition that included an increase in fatty acid saturation at 28 A degrees C and up-regulation of certain long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Phospholipid composition was more strongly affected by recently experienced temperature (4-day transfer) than by long-term (2 generations) temperature acclimation. This is consistent with partial loss of thermal tolerance after a short-term switch to a reciprocal temperature. As predicted under the homeoviscous adaptation hypothesis, the more heat tolerant Daphnia showed lower membrane fluidity than their less heat tolerant counterparts, in comparison both between acclimation temperatures and among different genotypes. We conclude that thermal tolerance in Daphnia is influenced by total antioxidant capacity and membrane fluidity at high temperatures, with both effects possibly reflecting changes in phospholipid composition.

AB  - Standard metabolic rate (SMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR) were determined for Nile tilapia acclimated to six different experimental temperatures from 18 degrees C to 38 degrees C. SMR increased exponentially with temperature, from 79.8 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 18 degrees C, to 255.1 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 38 degrees C (Q(10) = 1.79). The main increase in Q(10) occurred within the highest temperature range, whereas in the lower temperature from 18 degrees C to 22 degrees C, temperature did not significantly affect SMR. MMR showed a hyperbolic correlation with increasing temperature, rising from 240.5 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 18 degrees C to a peak of 373.8 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 30 degrees C, before decreasing again at higher temperatures. Absolute aerobic scope (AAS) peaked at 26.0 degrees C, which we conclude to be the optimal temperature for Nile tilapia. The optimal temperature range, defined as the thermal range where 80% or more of the metabolic scope (MS) can be maintained, occurred between 19.5 and 32.1 degrees C. The lower (TCMIN) and upper (TCMAX) critical temperatures occurred at 13.1 degrees C and 38.8 degrees C. Nile tilapia showed a 4-fold scope for increasing ventilation frequency from 24 opercular beats min(-1) (OB min(-1)) during SMR at 18 degrees C, to a maximum of 100 OB min(-1) which occurred during MMR at 34 degrees C. f(V) during MMR increased with temperature, but above 30 degrees C became uncoupled with MO2, as fish were unable to sustain their rates of oxygen consumption despite a high f(V). There was a strong correlation between f(V) and SMR (r(2) = 0.83) across all temperatures indicating that fV is a good predictor of SMR. However, the correlation between MMR and f(V) was weak (r(2) = 0.06), due to a strong interacting effect of temperature. When selecting data from the thermal optimum range, a good correlation between f(V) and MO2 was obtained (r(2) = 0.74).

AB  - Haloalkane dehalogenases have the potential for use in high-value biocatalytic processes to convert haloalkanes into epoxides via intermediate haloalcohols. Initial bioreactor studies probing the hydrolysis of 1,2,3-trichloropropane by immobilized wild-type dehalogenase isolated from Rhodococcus rhodochrous demonstrated, however, that productivity was too low to realize a commercially viable process. A strategy to increase enzyme performance was undertaken to increase the reaction temperature, however it was determined that the wild-type enzyme was not stable for long periods of time at elevated temperatures. The accelerated laboratory evolution technique of Gene Site Saturation Mutagenesis (GSSM((TM))) was used to create a clonal enzyme library comprising all single site sequence variants of the Rhodococcus enzyme. Using high throughput screening techniques and rapid kinetics assays, this library was probed for improvements in thermostability and for the ability of the enzyme to undergo a fully reversible cycle of thermal denaturation-renaturation. Eight single site mutants were discovered that had considerable effects on these aspects of the dehalogenase phenotype. Compared to the parental dehalogenase (t(1/2) = It minutes at 55 degreesC) single site variants have half-lives ranging from 300 minutes to 2700 minutes. Combinations of these mutations dramatically improved the half-life demonstrating the enhancing effects of mutational additivity. Combining five of the mutations into a single protein (Dhla5) improved the half-life to 29,000 min and a combination of all eight single-site mutations (Dhla8) increased the half-life by another factor of ten. Thus, the final Was protein was 30,000 times more stable than the parent molecule as measured by its ability to refold after denaturation at high temperature. Kinetic analysis showed that the improvement in thermal stability associated with Dhla5 did not negatively affect the rate of catalysis at ambient temperature, and allowed a significant increase in rate with no deactivation at 55 degreesC. Differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated that mutational combinations in both Dhla5 and Dhla8 led to an 8 degreesC increase in T-m and substantiated that partial reversibility (Dhla5) and full reversibility of Dhla8. Thermal denaturation of Was was fully reversible upon scanning up to 90 degreesC. Bioreactor studies showed that improved thermal stability of Dhla5 and Was correlated qualitatively with increased productivity when haloalkane hydrolysis was conducted using immobilized forms of these evolved enzymes under high temperature conditions.

AB  - This study assesses the relative influence of an active warm rain process on precipitation development and hail formation in a series of cells in numerical simulations of the severe hailstorm case of 28 June 1989 from the North Dakota Thunderstorm Project. Two model runs are reported, Case I with rain autoconversion on and Case 11 with rain autoconversion off. Various aspects of hail production are examined within the context of these simulations. The results illustrate the importance of the microphysical path to precipitation on subsequent hail formation, especially for isolated cells.
   Precipitation is initiated earlier in Case I than in Case II. Frozen drops initiate the precipitating ice in Case 1; for Case 11, ice processes initiate the precipitating ice field and precipitation development is slower than in Case I. Pronounced differences in precipitation development, especially hail growth and production, are indicated for a relatively isolated cell undergoing rapid evolution. Much more hail mass and larger hail are produced in this cell in Case I than in Case 11, with the major embryo source for hail being frozen drops in Case I and ice embryos in Case II. Differences between Case I and Case 11 are much less pronounced for the other cells in the simulations which experience multiple growth surges. For a strong cell embedded in the storm system, the effect of the autoconversion process is of minor significance because the surrounding cloud mass provides an ample supply of embryos in both cases. The net effect is Case 11 produces slightly more hail for this embedded cell.
   Hail growth analyses indicate that the major growth of the ice particles occurs in high liquid water regions between -5 and -35 degreesC, usually between -10 and -25 degreesC. Trajectory analyses indicate that particles which grow to relatively large size begin their major growth cycle in a very narrow ribbon-like region in an area of weak updraft near the updraft/down draft interface on the forward flank of the storm cells, in agreement with recent observations.
   Model results compared favorably with recent aircraft observations of cloud properties in the neighborhood of -40 degreesC within fresh, vigorous deep convection. Substantial amounts of supercooled liquid water at temperatures as low as - 38 degreesC and an abrupt transition from water to ice at slightly colder temperatures were common features in the observations and model results.

AB  - early evolution of our Solar System. However, the collateral effects of these collisions are not well understood. In this paper, we quantify the efficiency of heating during high-velocity collisions between planetesimals using hydrocode modelling. We conducted a series of simulations to test the effect on shock heating of the initial porosity and temperature of the planetesimals, the relative velocity of the collision and the relative size of the two colliding bodies. Our results show that while heating is minor in collisions between non-porous planetesimals at impact velocities below 10 km in agreement with previous work, much higher temperatures are reached in collisions between porous planetesimals. For example, collisions between nearly equal-sized, porous planetesimals can melt all, or nearly all, of the mass of the bodies at collision velocities below 7 km s(-1). For collisions of small bodies into larger ones, such as those with an impactor-to-target mass ratio below 0.1, significant localised heating occurs in the target body. At impact velocities as low as 5 km s(-1), the mass of melt will be nearly double the mass of the impactor, and the mass of material shock heated by 100 K will be nearly 10 times the mass of the impactor. We present a first-order estimate of the cumulative effects of impact heating on a porous planetesimal parent body by simulating the impact of a population of small bodies until a disruptive event occurs. Before disruption, impact heating is volumetrically minor and highly localised; in no case was more than about 3% of the parent body heated by more than 100 K. However, heating during the final disruptive collision can be significant; in about 10% of cases, almost all of the parent body is heated to 700 K (from an initial temperature of similar to 300 K) and more than a tenth of the parent body mass is melted. Hence, energetic collisions between planetesimals could have had important effects on the thermal evolution of primitive materials in the early Solar System. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Most studies of climate change impacts focus on the effects of summer temperatures, which can immediately impact fitness of breeders, but winter temperatures are expected to have a greater impact on development and growth of animals with long-lasting consequences. Exposure to warmer temperatures can increase cellular oxidative damage in ectotherms. Yet, it is unknown whether thermal stress during early life has prolonged effects on oxidative status during adulthood. In an experiment using F1 fish originated from a wild three-spined stickleback population at the southern edge of its European distribution, we examined whether experimental thermal conditions experienced in winter had carry-over effects on oxidative status and telomere length, a marker of accumulated stress, in the soma and germline during adulthood. For this, oxidative DNA damage, enzymatic antioxidant activities and telomere length were measured three months after the termination of the temperature manipulation. In addition, we tested whether such delayed effects, if any, were due to individuals' compensatory growth after experiencing unfavourable growth conditions in winter. Warm acclimation during winter induced increased levels of oxidative DNA damage in muscle and sperm and increased enzymatic antioxidant defences in muscle during the breeding season. Telomere length of adult fish was not influenced by thermal conditions experienced during early life. Winter temperature manipulation influenced fish to alter the temporal pattern of growth trajectories across the juvenile and adult stages. Fish reared in warm winter conditions grew at a slower rate than the controls during the period of temperature manipulation then accelerated body mass gain to catch up during the breeding season. Faster somatic growth during the breeding season incurred a higher cost in terms of oxidative damage in the warm-treated individuals. For the first time, we experimentally show the long-lasting detrimental effects of thermal stress on and the positive link between catch-up growth and oxidative DNA damage in the soma and germline. Winter temperature increases due to climate change can reduce fertility and survival of fish by inducing catch-up growth. The detrimental effects of winter climate change may accumulate across generations through the pre-mutagenic DNA damage in the germline.

AB  - Disruptive effects of climate change include range shifts, phenological mismatches among consumers and producers, and population declines. While these biological alterations have been widely documented, studies identifying specific mechanisms linking climate change to population declines are scarce. Extreme events, such as heatwaves can have devastating effects on living organisms and are increasing in frequency as Earth warms. Hence, understanding the effects of heatwaves on insects is necessary to inform conservation efforts and to develop predictions of population dynamics under future climate scenarios. Here, we experimentally evaluated the effects of heatwaves on the survival and phenology of the Baltimore Checkerspot (Euphydryas phaeton phaeton), a wetland butterfly with imperiled populations that has incorporated a novel host. We performed laboratory manipulations (implementing realistic temperature regimes) to assess the effect of heatwaves during summer and winter on the survival and phenology of E. p. phaeton. In addition, we analyzed historical temperature records to quantify the incidence of heatwaves within E. p. phaeton's range to assess their potential role in the decline of southeastern populations. We found that winter heatwaves with maximum temperatures of 20 degrees C can have more devastating effects on survival than summer heatwaves (up to 41 degrees C). Eggs endured acute heat stress during summer with no significant effects on phenology and survival; similarly, pre-overwintering larvae were robust to heatwave exposure, as only the most intense heatwave treatment reduced their survival (37% reduction compared to control conditions). By contrast, dormant larvae were the most vulnerable stage, as they lost from 2 to 6% of their body mass after a three-day summer heatwave. Furthermore, their exposure to winter heatwaves resulted in 75 to 100% mortality. Feeding on the native host provided higher resilience under thermal stress than feeding on the invasive, recently acquired host. Finally, both heatwave incidence and severity have increased in the southern range of E. p. phaeton in the period from 1894 to 2011. We show that warm winter days induced severe mortality, providing a mechanistic explanation of how climate change can trigger population declines in E. p. phaeton and other insects.

AB  - 1.Life-history theory attributes the evolution of parental care to the benefits to offspring viability outweighing any costs to parental viability. However, the consequences of parental care tactics to parent(s) and the developmental environment have seldom been measured under field conditions. 2.Laboratory research on pythons shows that maternal nest-site selection and egg brooding benefit embryos, but prolonged nest attendance may impose fitness costs to free-ranging females. A population of water pythons (Liasis fuscus) in tropical Australia provides an excellent opportunity to examine this parentoffspring trade-off because females exhibit parental care polymorphism wherein some individuals brood their eggs only briefly (<10days) post-oviposition (short brooders) while others remain with their eggs throughout the incubation period (>50days; long brooders). 3.We used radiotelemetry, temperature and humidity data loggers, ultrasonography, haematological techniques, and habitat analyses to examine the correlates and consequences of maternal nesting decisions in 14 free-ranging female pythons over the 4-month reproductive season. 4.Nest-site selection and maternal attendance enhanced thermal and hydric regimes within the nest. Egg production by reproducing female pythons resulted in high energetic costs (loss of 60% of maternal body mass) and increased parasite load. However, the estimated mass loss because of brooding was (i) low (<5%), (ii) inversely related to fecundity (females that produced relatively large clutches tended to select lower temperatures and thus lost less mass during brooding) and (iii) surprisingly unrelated to brooding duration. Phenotypic traits of short and long brooders were similar, but long brooders had higher haemoparasite burdens prior to oviposition. Clutches of long brooders were laid in more open sites (less canopy cover) and experienced warmer and more humid conditions than did those of short brooders. 5.Together with previous research, we suggest several explanations for the maintenance of maternal care polymorphism within this population, such as a trade-off between offspring number and quality (long brooders may produce fewer clutches during their lifespan but enhance offspring quality). Our study provides detailed measurements of the correlates and consequences of parental care in a free-ranging reptile, and it clarifies the trade-offs mediated by taxonomically widespread maternal decisions (e.g. nest- or oviposition-site selection and nest attendance).

AB  - The geographic mosaic theory of coevolution posits that the form of selection between interacting species varies across a landscape with coevolution important and active in some locations (i.e., coevolutionary hotspots) but not in others (i.e., coevolutionary coldspots). We tested the hypothesis that the presence of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) affects the occurrence of coevolution between red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra complex) and Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia) and thereby provides a mechanism giving rise to a geographic mosaic of selection. Red squirrels are the predominant predispersal seed predator and selective agent on lodgepole pine cones. However, in four isolated mountain ranges east and west of the Rocky Mountains, red squirrels are absent and red crossbills are the main predispersal seed predator. These isolated populations of pine have apparently evolved without Tamiasciurus for about 10,000 to 12,000 years. Based on published morphological, genetic, and paleobotanical studies, we infer that cone traits in these isolated populations that show parallel differences from cones in the Rocky Mountains have changed in parallel. We used data on crossbill and conifer cone morphology and feeding preferences and efficiency to detect whether red crossbills and lodgepole pine exhibit reciprocal adaptations, which would imply coevolution. Cone traits that act to deter Tamiasciurus and result in high ratios of cone mass to seed mass were less developed in the isolated populations. Cone traits that act to deter crossbills include larger and thicker scales and perhaps increased overlap between successive scales and were enhanced in the isolated populations. In the larger, isolated mountain ranges crossbills have evolved deeper, shorter, and therefore more decurved bills to exploit these cones. This provides crossbills with higher feeding rates, and the change in bill shape has improved efficiency by reducing the concomitant increases in body mass and daily energy expenditures that would have resulted if only bill size had increased. These parallel adaptations and counter adaptations in red crossbills and lodgepole pine are interpreted as reciprocal adaptations and imply that these crossbills and pine are in coevolutionary arms races where red squirrels are absent (i.e., coevolutionary hotspots) but not where red squirrels are present (i.e., coevolutionary coldspots).

AB  - Age-related diseases may result from shared biological mechanisms in intrinsic processes of aging. Genetic effects on age-related diseases are often modulated by environmental factors due to their little contribution to fitness or are mediated through certain endophenotypes. Identification of genetic variants with pleiotropic effects on both common complex diseases and endophenotypes may reveal potential conflicting evolutionary pressures and deliver new insights into shared genetic contribution to healthspan and lifespan. Here, we performed pleiotropic meta-analyses of genetic variants using five NIH-funded datasets by integrating univariate summary statistics for age-related diseases and endophenotypes. We investigated three groups of traits: (1) endophenotypes such as blood glucose, blood pressure, lipids, hematocrit, and body mass index, (2) time-to-event outcomes such as the age-at-onset of diabetes mellitus (DM), cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), and (3) both combined. In addition to replicating previous findings, we identify seven novel genome-wide significant loci (<5e-08), out of which five are low-frequency variants. Specifically, from Group 2, we find rs7632505 on 3q21.1 in SEMA5B, rs460976 on 21q22.3 (1 kb from TMPRSS2) and rs12420422 on 11q24.1 predominantly associated with a variety of CVDs, rs4905014 in ITPK1 associated with stroke and heart failure, rs7081476 on 10p12.1 in ANKRD26 associated with multiple diseases including DM. CVDs, and NDs. From Group 3, we find rs8082812 on 18p11.22 and rs1869717 on 4q31.3 associated with both endophenotypes and CVDs. Our follow-up analyses show that rs7632505, rs4905014, and rs8082812 have age-dependent effects on coronary heart disease or stroke. Functional annotation suggests that most of these SNPs are within regulatory regions or DNase clusters and in linkage disequilibrium with expression quantitative trait loci, implying their potential regulatory influence on the expression of nearby genes. Our mediation analyses suggest that the effects of some SNPs are mediated by specific endophenotypes. In conclusion, these findings indicate that loci with pleiotropic effects on age-related disorders tend to be enriched in genes involved in underlying mechanisms potentially related to nervous, cardiovascular and immune system functions, stress resistance, inflammation, ion channels and hematopoiesis, supporting the hypothesis of shared pathological role of infection, and inflammation in chronic age-related diseases.

AB  - Environmental temperature can alter body size and thermal tolerance, yet the effects of temperature rise on the size-tolerance relationship remain unclear. Terrestrial ectotherms with larger body sizes typically exhibit greater tolerance of high (and low) temperatures. However, while warming tends to increase tolerance of high temperatures through phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary change, warming tends to decrease body size through these mechanisms and thus might indirectly contribute to worse tolerance of high temperatures. These contrasting effects of warming on body size, thermal tolerance, and their relationship are increasingly important in light of global climate change. Here, we used replicated urban heat islands to explore the size-tolerance relationship in response to warming. We performed a common garden experiment with a small acorn-dwelling ant species collected from urban and rural populations across three different cities and reared under five laboratory rearing temperatures from 21 to 29 degrees C. We found that acorn ant body size was remarkably insensitive to laboratory rearing temperature (ant workers exhibited no phenotypic plasticity in body size across rearing temperature) and among populations experiencing cooler rural versus warmer urban environmental temperatures (no evolved differences in body size between urban and rural populations). Further, this insensitivity of body size to temperature was highly consistent across each of the three cities we examined. Because body size was robust to temperature variation, previously described plastic and evolved shifts in heat (and cold) tolerance in acorn ant responses to urbanization were shown to be independent of shifts in body size. Indeed, genetic (colony-level) correlations between heat and cold tolerance traits and body size revealed no significant association between size and tolerance. Our results show how typical trait correlations, such as between size and thermal tolerance, might be decoupled as populations respond to contemporary environmental change.

AB  - Body size is a fundamental trait correlated with nearly every aspect of animal life. It is influenced by numerous genetic and non-genetic factors. Despite its central importance, proximate mechanisms of intra- and interspecific variability in body size are still not well understood even in such a largely studied group as reptiles. For our study, we concentrated on the gecko species Paroedura picta. We investigated whether differences in sexual size dimorphism and in final and asymptotic snout-vent length (induced by a range of incubation and rearing temperatures) are correlated with differences in the number of presacral vertebrae. Moreover, we tested whether changes in this number were associated with evolutionary changes in sexual size dimorphism and body size in the genus Paroedura. We found that the variation in the number of presacral vertebrae is very limited both intra- and interspecifically, ranging between 26 and 28 vertebrae with most individuals possessing the modal number of 27. We conclude that changes in the number of vertebrae do not contribute to developmental plasticity or evolutionary changes in body size nor, in contrast to some other squamate lineages, to sexual size dimorphism.

AB  - Conspicuous coloration is often used in combination with chemical defenses to deter predators from attacking. Experimental studies have shown that the avoidance inducing effect of conspicuous prey coloration increases with increasing size of pattern elements and with increasing body size. Here we use a comparative approach to test the prediction from these findings, namely that conspicuous coloration will evolve in tandem with body size. In our analysis, we use a previously published mitochondrial DNA-based phylogeny and comparative analysis of independent contrasts to examine if evolutionary shifts in color pattern have been associated with evolutionary changes in body size in aposematic poison frogs (Anura: Dendrobatidae). Information on body size (snout to vent length) and coloration were obtained from the literature. Two different measures of conspicuousness were used, one based on rankings by human observers and the other based on computer analysis of digitized photographs. The results from comparative analyses using either measure of coloration indicated that avoidance inducing coloration and body size have evolved in concert in poison frogs. Results from reconstruction of character change further indicate that the correlated evolution of size and coloration has involved changes in both directions within each of the different clades of the phylogenetic tree. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that selection imposed by visually guided predators has promoted the evolution of larger body size in species with conspicuous coloration, or enhanced evolution of conspicuous coloration in larger species.

AB  - Question: What ecological and evolutionary processes are associated with the 25% decrease in age-specific body size of herring (Clupea harengus) in the Bothnian Sea over the last 30 years?
   Data: Four decades of data on length, age, and sexual maturity of individual herrings as well as environmental variables, including abundances of predators, prey and competitors, and estimates of fishing intensity/mortality from the Bothnian Sea.
   Search methods: Information-theoretic assessment of the relative influence of ecological and fisheries' effects on temporal changes in body growth. Probabilistic maturation reaction norms to study changes in age-specific size at maturation. Decomposition of trait variation into ecological and evolutionary contributions.
   Conclusions: Our evolutionary ecosystem perspective shows that both ecological and evolutionary processes are important contributors to observed phenotypic changes in this commercially exploited species. Around 60% of the decrease in age-specific body length can be attributed to increased density-dependent body growth. Evolutionary changes towards earlier maturation, owing to an indirect effect of size-selective mortality from grey seals and fisheries, account for a further 25% of the decrease in age-specific body size.

AB  - I compared the thermal sensitivity of jumping performance of five populations of the striped marsh frog (Limnodynastes peronii) over a wide geographic range extending from the cool-temperate south to the tropical north of Australia. Maximum jumping performance of adult E peronii was assessed for each population at eight temperatures between 5degreesC and 32degreesC using a custom-designed force platform. From force recordings for each individual jump, maximum jumping force (F-max) and acceleration (A(max)) and maximum power output (P-max), take-off velocity (U-max), jump distance (D-J) and contact time on the platform (T-C) were calculated. The body mass of adult E peronii varied over their geographic range, from approximately 5 g for the lowland tropical population to more than 22 g for the cool-temperate populations. The thermal sensitivity of jumping performance varied over their geographic range, with the populations from the cooler climates generally performing better than those from the warmer climate populations at the cooler temperatures, and vice versa at the higher temperatures. However, not all parameters of jumping performance underwent parallel changes in thermal sensitivity amongst the populations of L. peronii. Only minor differences in the shape of the thermal sensitivity curves for F-max and A(max) were detected amongst the populations, while the thermal sensitivities of U-max, D-J and P-max all displayed considerable variation amongst the populations. The optimal temperatures for U-max, D-J and P-max were generally lower in the cool-temperate populations than in the tropical populations of L. peronii. To determine whether this geographic variation was due to genetic variation, or merely reflected phenotypic plasticity, I also compared the thermal sensitivity of jumping performance between metamorph L. peronii from two different populations raised under identical conditions in the laboratory. The maximum jumping distance of the metamorph L. peronii was assessed at seven temperatures between 8degreesC and 35degreesC for the two latitudinally extreme populations (i.e. lowland tropical Proserpine and cool-temperate Gippsland populations). Like adult L. peronii, the metamorphs from the cool-temperate population jumped further than those from the lowland tropical population at the lower temperatures, although no differences were detected at the higher temperatures. Thus, geographic variation in thermal sensitivity of jumping performance in L. peronii probably has a genetic component, and the different populations appear to have undergone genetic adaptation of their thermal sensitivity to the varied thermal environments.

AB  - The light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) shows high intraspecific variability in morphological, physiological, demographic and behavioural characters. To gain insight into the extent of adaptation and evolutionary changes in response to environmental heterogeneity in this species, quantitative genetic analyses of life-history variation were conducted for two natural populations under two thermal conditions (23 degrees C and 28 degrees C). Paternal half-sib heritability and genetic correlation in six life-history traits (i.e. development time, adult body weight, adult lifespan, age at first reproduction, the number of eggs laid during the first 5 days after emergence, and total fecundity) were compared. Significant heritabilities were shown consistently in development time; this is also true for adult body weight, except for the Canberra population at 23 degrees C. However, neither population differences nor the effect of temperature were statistically detectable for any of these heritabilities, confirming thr generically determined flexibility. Positive genetic correlations between development time and adult body weight, and negative genetic correlations between the number of eggs laid during the first 5 days and adult lifespan were present for these populations at both temperatures, indicating the presence of genetic constraints. Pairwise comparisons of genetic correlations revealed the heterogeneity of the mio populations and across temperatures. These results suggest that the structure of generic covariance might have changed significantly during the divergence of natural populations and in response to the alteration of environmental conditions in E. postvittana.

AB  - Difference in growth pattern is one of the proximate causes of geographic variation in body size. Such a difference in growth pattern could be explained by two extremes such as genetically determined outcome and phenotypic plasticity or by a combination of these. The Japanese four-lined snake (Elaphe quadrivirgata) on Yakushima Island, Japan, has small body size compared with snakes on the main islands. To examine whether the dwarfism of Yakushima snakes is a consequence of genetic modification or a direct phenotypic response to immediate environmental conditions, E. quadrivirgata from Yakushima and a main island (Shiga Prefecture in Honshu Island), were reared from hatching in a laboratory environment. Data of field surveys were used to examine feeding habits and growth in the wild. Free-ranging snakes on Yakushima had significantly smaller body size and lower growth rate than those in Shiga. Yakushima snakes consumed almost exclusively lizards, whereas frogs were the main prey for Shiga snakes. The proportion of snakes that contained food in their stomach was lower in Yakushima than in Shiga. Available information suggests that the dwarfism of Yakushima snakes cannot be explained by lower survivorship. At hatching, Yakushima snakes of both sexes were larger than Shiga snakes. However, Yakushima and Shiga snakes reached similar body size after approximately I year. Captive-reared snakes from the insular dwarf population can reach comparable size to those from the main island, indicating that the growth rate, and hence body size, of E. quadrivirgata is obviously highly plastic. Based on these results, I consider that the dwarfism of Yakushima snakes is attributable to a direct phenotypic response, presumably to food limitation, rather than to microevolutionary changes.

AB  - Adaptation to different thermal environments has the potential to cause evolutionary changes that are sufficient to drive ecological speciation. Here, we examine whether climate-based niche divergence in lizards of the Plestiodon skiltonianus species complex is consistent with the outcomes of such a process. Previous work on this group shows that a mechanical sexual barrier has evolved between species that differ mainly in body size and that the barrier may be a by-product of selection for increased body size in lineages that have invaded xeric environments; however, baseline information on niche divergence among members of the group is lacking. We quantified the climatic niche using mechanistic physiological and correlative niche models and then estimated niche differences among species using ordination techniques and tests of niche overlap and equivalency. Our results show that the thermal niches of size-divergent, reproductively isolated morphospecies are significantly differentiated and that precipitation may have been as important as temperature in causing increased shifts in body size in xeric habitats. While these findings alone do not demonstrate thermal adaptation or identify the cause of speciation, their integration with earlier genetic and behavioral studies provides a useful test of phenotype-environment associations that further support the case for ecological speciation in these lizards.

AB  - Sexual dimorphism in life history traits and their trade-offs is widespread among sexually reproducing animals and is strongly influenced by the differences in reproductive strategies between the sexes. We investigated how intrasexual competition influenced specific life history traits, important to fitness and their trade-offs in the outcrossing nematode Caenorhabditis remanei. Here, we altered the strength of sex-specific selection through experimental evolution with increased potential for intrasexual competition by skewing the adult sex ratio towards either females or males (1:10 or 10:1) over 30 generations and subsequently measured the phenotypic response to selection in three traits related to fitness: body size, fecundity and tolerance to heat stress. We observed a greater evolutionary change in females than males for body size and peak fitness, suggesting that females may experience stronger net selection and potentially harbour higher amounts of standing genetic variance compared to males. Our study highlights the importance of investigating direct and indirect effects of intrasexual competition in both sexes in order to capture sex-specific responses and understand the evolution of sexual dimorphism in traits expressed by both sexes.

AB  - Age and size at maturation decreased in several commercially exploited fish stocks, which, according to life history theory, may be due to fisheries-induced evolutionary change. However, the observed changes may also represent a plastic response to environmental variability. To disentangle phenotypic plasticity from evolutionary change, the probabilistic reaction norm approach was applied to 43 cohorts (1960 to 2002) of female sole Solea solea from market samples. The reaction norm for age and size at first maturation has significantly shifted towards younger age and smaller size. Size at 50% probability of maturation at Age 3 decreased from 28.6 cm (251 g) to 24.6 cm (128 g). This change was even stronger when condition was included as a third dimension in the reaction norm estimation. The influence of alternative factors was tested on the population level by regression of reaction norm midpoints on annual estimates of condition, temperature and competitive biomass. Although effects of temperature and competitive biomass were significant, the variation in the midpoints was best explained by the decreasing time trend. Therefore, the results provide strong evidence for a fisheries -induced evolutionary change in the onset of sexual maturity.

AB  - Microevolutionary changes in the body size of the bushy-tailed woodrat (Neotoma cinerea) since the last glacial maximum were estimated from measurements of fecal pellets preserved in paleomiddens from the Great Basin and Colorado Plateau of the United States. The changes closely track regional temperature fluctuations simulated by the Community Climate Model of the National Center for Atmospheric Research and also those estimated from deuterium isotope ratios of plant cellulose recovered from paleomiddens. Body size decreased during periods of climatic warming, as predicted from Bergmann's rule and from physiological responses to temperature stress. Fossil woodrat middens, by providing detailed temporal sequences of body sizes from many locations, permit precise quantification of responses to climatic change that have occurred in the past and may occur in the future.

AB  - The responses of organisms to temperature variations may be via short term responses of the phenotype (phenotypic plasticity), or they could involve long-term evolutionary change and adaptation (via selection) to the genotype. These could involve changes to the mean size of the animal or to the thermal reaction norm. We examined the effects of various temperatures (of 22, 25, 28, and 31 degrees C) on development time, adult body size and preadult survivorship in three populations of the cockroach, Eupolyphaga sinensis (Walker), collected at different latitudes. We found substantial temperature-induced plasticity in development time, body size, and preadult survivorship, indicating that developmental temperatures have strong impacts on growth and life history traits of E. sinensis. Genetic differences for development time, body size, and preadult survivorship were detected among populations, and the three traits exhibited highly significant variations in the responses of different populations to various temperature conditions, indicating genetic differences among populations in terms of thermal reaction norms. We also found that two populations seem to support the beneficial acclimation hypothesis whereas the third mid-latitude population does not. The results are likely because of differences in season length and voltinism, indicating that not only temperature regime but also its interactions with generation time (and development time), voltinism, and season length are likely to have considerable effects on insect development time and body size. Overall, changes in development time, body size, and preadult survivorship in E. sinensis can all be regarded as adaptations to changing thermal regimes.

AB  - Aim
   Bats are promising candidates for studying morphometric responses to anthropogenic climate or land-use changes. We assessed whether the cranial size of a common bat (Pipistrellus kuhlii) had changed between 1875 and 2007. We formulated the following hypotheses: (1) if heat loss is an important reaction to climate change, body size will have decreased in response to the increased temperatures, because small bats have a larger surface-to-volume ratio and dissipate heat more effectively; (2) if water loss is the main driver, body size will have increased in response to the temperature increase, because larger bats will lose water more slowly through a reduced surface-to-volume ratio; (3) the energetic benefits provided by urbanization (food concentration at street lamps, warmer maternity roosts in buildings) will lead to a general body size increase in P.kuhlii; and (4) because street lamps impair moth antipredatory manoeuvres, cranial size may have selectively increased as an adaptive response to handle larger prey (moths) in artificially illuminated sites. Ours is the first study to assess temporal trends in bat body size over more than a century and to relate them to urbanization.
   Location
   Mainland Italy.
   Methods
   We used traditional morphometrics to compare seven variables of skull size in 117 museum specimens (75 female, 42male).
   Results
   Cranial size increased after 1950, but this change was not paralleled by an increase in body size, measured as forearm length. This selective increase matched a rapid increase in electric public illumination in Italy.
   Main conclusions
   Street lights are crucial foraging sites for P.kuhlii. The directional change that we found in cranial size might represent microevolutionary adaptive tracking of a sudden shift in food size, making more profitable prey available.

AB  - Exposure to moderate environmental stress is one important source of evolutionary change. This evidence would support the hypothesis that hormesis is an evolutionary expectation. In this short review, I discuss relevant examples of genetic and phenotypic responses to moderate stress exposure that are compatible with hormesis and with paradigms of evolutionary theory such as evolutionary rescue or phenotypic plasticity. Genetic recombination, nonlethal mutations, activity of transposable elements, or gene expression are some of the molecular mechanisms through which hormesis might enable organisms to maintain or even increase evolutionary fitness in stressful environments. These mechanisms span the tree of life from plants to vertebrates.

AB  - Oceanic islands are often inhabited by endemic species that have undergone substantial morphological evolutionary change due to processes of multiple colonizations from various source populations, dispersal, and local adaptation. Galapagos marine iguanas are an example of an island endemic exhibiting high morphological diversity, including substantial body size variation among populations and sexes, but the causes and magnitude of this variation are not well understood. We obtained morphological measurements from marine iguanas throughout their distribution range. These data were combined with genetic and local environmental data from each population to investigate the effects of evolutionary history and environmental conditions on body size and shape variation and sexual dimorphism. Our results indicate that body size and shape are highly variable among populations. Sea surface temperature and island perimeter, but not evolutionary history as depicted by phylogeographic patterns in this species, explain variation in body size among populations. Conversely, evolutionary history, but not environmental parameters or island size, was found to influence variation in body shape among populations. Finally, in all populations except one, we found strong sexual dimorphism in body size and shape in which males are larger, with higher heads than females, while females have longer heads than males. Differences among populations suggest that plasticity and/or genetic adaptation may shape body size and shape variation in marine iguanas. This study will help target future investigations to address the contribution of plasticity versus genetic adaptation on size and shape variation in marine iguanas.

AB  - Understanding the physiological and genetic basis of growth and body size variation has wide-ranging implications, from cancer and metabolic disease to the genetics of complex traits. We examined the evolution of body and wing size in high-altitude Drosophila melanogaster from Ethiopia, flies with larger size than any previously known population. Specifically, we sought to identify life history characteristics and cellular mechanisms that may have facilitated size evolution. We found that the large-bodied Ethiopian flies laid significantly fewer but larger eggs relative to lowland, smaller-bodied Zambian flies. The highland flies were found to achieve larger size in a similar developmental period, potentially aided by a reproductive strategy favoring greater provisioning of fewer offspring. At the cellular level, cell proliferation was a strong contributor to wing size evolution, but both thorax and wing size increases involved important changes in cell size. Nuclear size measurements were consistent with elevated somatic ploidy as an important mechanism of body size evolution. We discuss the significance of these results for the genetic basis of evolutionary changes in body and wing size in Ethiopian D. melanogaster.

AB  - The size structure of phytoplankton assemblages strongly influences energy transfer through the food web and carbon cycling in the ocean. We determined the macroevolutionary trajectory in the median size of dinoflagellate cysts to compare with the macroevolutionary size change in other plankton groups. We found the median size of the dinoflagellate cysts generally decreases through the Cenozoic. Diatoms exhibit an extremely similar pattern in their median size over time, even though species diversity of the two groups has opposing trends, indicating that the macroevolutionary size change is an active response to selection pressure rather than a passive response to changes in diversity. The changes in the median size of dinoflagellate cysts are highly correlated with both deep ocean temperatures and the thermal gradient between the surface and deep waters, indicating the magnitude and frequency of nutrient availability may have acted as a selective factor in the macroevolution of cell size in the plankton. Our results suggest that climate, because it affects stratification in the ocean, is a universal abiotic driver that has been responsible for macroevolutionary changes in the size structure of marine planktonic communities over the past 65 million years of Earth's history.

AB  - Organisms can respond to variation in temperature through the direct effect of temperature on phenotypes (phenotypic plasticity), or through long-term adaptation to temperature (and thus evolution of either mean size or thermal reaction norm). We examined the effects of various temperatures (of 20 and 30 degrees C) on development time, adult body size (body length and body width) and pre-adult survivorship in six populations of Chrysomya megacephala, collected at different latitudes. We found that temperature changes induced substantial plasticity in terms of development time, body size and pre-adult survivorship. indicating that developmental temperature significantly affects growth and life history traits of C. megacephala. We also detected genetic differences among populations for body size and development time, and these two traits exhibited highly significant variations in the responses of different populations to various temperature conditions, indicating genetic differences among populations in terms of thermal reaction norms. The latitude of origin of the different populations (and hence mean temperature regimes in the environments from where the populations originated) did not appear to fully explain these genetic differences. In short, changes in development time and body size in C. megacephala can be regarded as adaptations to changing thermal regimes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examine genotype-environment interactions by using lines of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana artificially selected for differences in egg size in a full factorial design with two developmental and two oviposition temperatures. In accordance with the tempera tu re-size rule, egg size and pupal mass increased by 4-5 and 8%, respectively, at lower temperatures. Genotype-environment interactions for both traits suggest that plasticity is largely independent of the trait value, and that there is potential for evolutionary change. These findings cast further doubt on the notion that temperature-mediated plasticity might be purely a physiological constraint. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Drosophila kikkawai, which has colonized the Indian subcontinent in the recent past, exhibits geographical variations for five quantitative traits among eight Indian populations (5.29-32.7 degrees N). Body weight, wing length, thorax length, abdominal bristles and ovariole number exhibit significant clinal variation with increase in latitude, while sternopleural bristles do not demonstrate such a trend. For the female sex, the slope values for body weight (2.25) and wing length (2.40) are higher but they are lower for thorax length (0.64) and ovariole number (0.51 per degree latitude). There is significant sexual dimorphism for the slope values only for body weight and thorax length suggesting simultaneous action of latitudinal selection pressure on these trails. However, the two sexes do not differ statistically in the latitudinal slope values for the wing length. A regression analysis of different traits on body weight implies correlated selection response on wing length and wing/thorax ratio while thorax length corresponds to changes in body size and does not differ in the two sexes. Regression analysis, on the basis of temperature-related climatic variables, evidence significantly higher association between all the five size-related traits and coefficient of variation of mean annual temperature (seasonal thermal amplitude; T-ev), T-min and relative humidity. Thus, genetic differentiation for quantitative traits in D. kikkawai are due to selective pressure from variable climatic conditions occurring on the Indian subcontinent.

AB  - Aim: There is ongoing debate regarding the extent to which body size is selected by the environment. To address this issue, we assessed how thermo-oxygenic conditions select body size of rotifer species composing a regional species pool.
   Location: Approximately 600 different water bodies in Sweden.
   Taxon: Rotifers (188 species).
   Methods: Data were acquired from previously published studies. For the environmental parameters, we conducted principal component analysis (PCA) to recognize the pattern among the species-specific thermal and oxygenic preferences of rotifers of different ecology. We assigned a standard body length to each species. We performed phylogenetically correlated analyses to evaluate the relationships between body length and the parameters that were selected as PCA drivers.
   Results: Thermal and oxygenic tolerance ranges, designated by the differences between the minimum and maximum of species occurrence, were grouped separately from the optima designated by the conditions referring to the highest species abundance, according to PC1 versus PC2. The parameters representing temperature and oxygen occupied opposite positions on the PC2 axis. Body size selection was driven by both temperature and oxygen, but the cues for this selection differed; species with higher thermal optima were smaller, while species with wider oxygen tolerance ranges were larger.
   Main conclusion: The body sizes of rotifer species are filtered by both thermal and oxygenic conditions. Selection is driven by tolerance ranges and optima. Oxygenic conditions are as important as thermal conditions in body size selection within a species assemblage.

AB  - We investigated the role of cuticular lipids, body melanisation and body size in conferring contrasting levels of desiccation resistance in latitudinal populations of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila ananassae on the Indian subcontinent. Contrary to the well known role of cuticular lipids in water proofing in diverse insect taxa, there is lack of geographical variations in the amount of cuticular lipids per fly in both the species. In D. ananassae, quite low levels of body melanisation are correlated with lower desiccation resistance. By contrast, increased levels of desiccation resistance are correlated with quite high melanisation in D. melanogaster. Thus, species specific cuticular melanisation patterns are significantly correlated with varying levels of desiccation resistance within as well as between populations and across species. Role of body melanisation in desiccation resistance is further supported by the fact that assorted dark and light flies differ significantly in cuticular water loss, hemolymph and dehydration tolerance. However, similar patterns of body size variation do not account for contrasting levels of desiccation resistance in these two Drosophila species. Climatic selection is evidenced by multiple regression analysis with seasonal amplitude of thermal and humidity changes (Tcv and RHcv) along latitude on the Indian subcontinent. Finally, the contrasting levels of species specific distribution patterns are negatively correlated with RHcv of sites of origin of populations i.e. a steeper negative slope for D. ananassae corresponds with its desiccation sensitivity as compared with D. melanogaster. Thus, evolutionary changes in body melanisation impact desiccation resistance potential as well as distribution patterns of these two Drosophila species on the Indian subcontinent.

AB  - During recent climate warming, some species have expanded their ranges northwards to keep track of climate changes. Evolutionary changes in dispersal have been demonstrated in these expanding populations and here we show that increased dispersal is associated with reduced investment in reproduction in populations of the speckled wood butterfly, Pararge aegeria. Evolutionary changes in flight versus reproduction will affect the pattern and rate of expansion at range boundaries in the future, and understanding these responses will be crucial for predicting the distribution of species in the future as climates continue to warm.

AB  - Evolutionary changes in the seasonal timing of life-history events can alter a population's exposure to seasonally variable environmental factors. We illustrate this principle in Wyeomyia smithii by showing that: (1) geographic divergence in diapause timing reduces differences among populations in the thermal habitat experienced by nondiapause stages; and (2) the thermal habitat of the growing season is more divergent at high compared with low temperatures with respect to daily mean temperatures. Geographic variation in thermal reaction norms for development time was greater in a warm compared with a cool rearing treatment, mirroring the geographic trend in daily mean temperature. Geographic variation in body size was unrelated to geographic temperature variation, but was also unrelated to development time or fecundity. Our results suggest that proper interpretation of geographic trends may often require detailed knowledge of life-history timing.

AB  - Both development and evolution under chronic malnutrition lead to reduced adult size in Drosophila. We studied the contribution of changes in size vs. number of epidermal cells to plastic and evolutionary reduction of wing size in response to poor larval food. We used flies from six populations selected for tolerance to larval malnutrition and from six unselected control populations, raised either under standard conditions or under larval malnutrition. In the control populations, phenotypic plasticity of wing size was mediated by both cell size and cell number. In contrast, evolutionary change in wing size, which was only observed as a correlated response expressed on standard food, was mediated entirely by reduction in cell number. Plasticity of cell number had been lost in the selected populations, and cell number did not differ between the sexes despite males having smaller wings. Results of this and other experimental evolution studies are consistent with the hypothesis that alleles which increase body size through prolonged growth affect wing size mostly via cell number, whereas alleles which increase size through higher growth rate do so via cell size.

AB  - Climate change will test the evolutionary potential of populations. Information regarding the genetic architecture within and among populations is essential for prediction of evolutionary outcomes. However, little is known about the distribution of genetic variation for relevant traits in natural populations or alteration of genetic architecture in a changing environment. In this study, pedigreed families from three populations of the annual prairie legume Chamaecrista fasciculata were reciprocally transplanted in three environments across a broad latitudinal range in the Great Plains. The underlying premise of this work is that northern populations will in the future experience climates similar to current-day climates further south. Estimates of narrow-sense heritability ranged from 0.053 to 0.481, suggesting the potential for evolutionary change is possible for most traits. In general, the northern population harbored less genetic variation and had lower heritability for traits than the southern population. This population also experienced large reductions in fitness, as measured by estimated lifetime fecundity, when raised in either the intermediate or the southern climate, whereas the difference between the intermediate and southern population was less extreme. For fecundity, the pattern of cross-environment additive genetic correlations was antagonistic to evolutionary change in four of six cases when native and normative sites were compared. Six additional antagonistic positive correlations were found for the rate of phenological development and leaf thickness. Overall, the data suggest that if climate changes as predicted, the northern population will face a severe evolutionary challenge in the future because of low heritabilities, cross-environment genetic correlations antagonistic to selection, and demographic instability due to lower seed production in a hotter and drier climate.

AB  - On the central coast of Chile, distribution of body size in Graus nigra varied with tidal pool height. With the objective of determining whether environmental temperature is one of the possible causes which explains the observed distribution pattern, two behavioural responses were analysed during an experimental period of increasing water temperature: number of opercular movements (an indirect measure of energy expenditure) and activity levels. The interactions of temperature x time and body size x time had a significant effect on the number of opercular movements. At low temperatures (13-15degrees C, large fish reached a maximum number of opercular movements, while small fish reached a maximum only at high temperatures (23-25degreesC . The interaction temperature x time had a significant effect on activity levels of different body sizes. In general, large fish appeared to be less active than small fish, however, at very high temperatures (24-26degrees C all individuals increased their activity levels. These data indicate that small fish are acclimatized to live in a wider range of temperatures (13-23degrees C, and, for fish of all body sizes, the highest temperatures (23-26degrees C probably constitute a suboptimal microhabitat. Strong territoriality was observed, with large individuals displacing smaller individuals. These data suggest that temperature is an important factor in explaining why large individuals are not present in high tidal pools (high temperatures), whereas territoriality explains why small individuals are not in low tidal pools (habitat of large individuals).

AB  - Deeper knowledge about how species and communities respond to climate change and environmental gradients should be supported by evidence from the past, especially as modern responses are influenced by anthropogenic pressures, including human population growth, habitat destruction and fragmentation, and intensifying land use. There have been great advances in modeling species' geographic distributions over shallow time, where consideration of evolutionary change is likely less important due to shorter time for evolution and speciation to occur. Over these shallow time periods, we have more resources for paleoclimate interpretation across large geographic landscapes. We can also gain insight into species and community changes by studying deep records of temporal changes. However, modeling species geographic distributions in deep time remains challenging, because for many species there is sparse coverage of spatial and temporal occurrences and there are fewer paleoclimate general circulation models (GCMs) to help interpret the geographic distribution of climate availability. In addition, at deeper time periods, it is essential to consider evolutionary change within lineages of species. I will discuss a framework that integrates evolutionary information in the form of phylogenetic relatedness from clades of extant closely related species, where and when there are associated fossil occurrences, and the geographic distribution of paleoclimate in deep time to infer species past geographic response to climate change and to estimate where and when there were hotspots of ancient diversification. More work is needed to better understand the evolution of physiological tolerances and how physiological tolerances relate to the climate space in which species occur.

AB  - Relationships between morphological variation trends in individuals of the genus Hegeter and several environmental variables of altitudinal sites were investigated. Classification (UPGMA) and ordination (PCA) techniques were used to examine these data. Several grouping trends showing high taxonomic variability were observed, although some dominance by individuals of certain species was found in each group. The major trend was related to body size (robust bodies) especially with the dimensions of the abdomen (subelytral capsule) and legs (ambulation) and was conditioned by temperature and broad soil types (xeric habitats). The second trend (broad bodies) was related to burrowing habits and was influenced by rainfall, vegetational parameters and soil carbon and organic matter content (moist habitats). Climatic and edaphic variables are factors limiting both growth of populations and evolutionary change in these detritivorous darkling beetles and co-occurring individuals of these species show the same adaptations to the environment.

AB  - Life history in reproductive pattern in hares are affected by ambient temperature. We hypothesized that European hares dwelling in areas of higher energy demands would have larger body sizes, larger fat depots and a delayed first reproduction. To test this assumption we compared yearly reproductive output as well as age, body size, body weight and body condition of female European hares from Belgium (temperate oceanic climate) and Lower Austria (temperate continental climate). Our results reveal that there was no effect of study site on annual reproductive output in female European hares. However, adult female hares from Belgium were significantly smaller and had significantly lower body condition in late autumn compared to the Lower Austrian sample, although Belgian individuals were actually older than Lower Austrians. These findings suggest that females in Belgium are more under an r-selection regime whereas Lower Austrian females might be more under K-selection within the r-K-continuum.

AB  - Ontogenetic shifts in microhabitat use are widespread among taxa and can result in drastic shifts in thermal habitat among age classes. Likewise, geographic variation in climate along latitudinal gradients can cause differences in thermal environments among populations of a species. Using a common garden design, we examined four populations of a single species of semi-aquatic snake, Nerodia rhombifer, to determine whether ontogenetic shifts in habitat use (and/or body size) and latitudinal differences in ambient temperature have resulted in evolutionary changes in thermal tolerance. We found ontogenetic differences in thermal tolerance for all populations, with neonates tolerating temperatures 2degreesC higher than adults, a pattern that is consistent with ontogenetic shifts in body size and microhabitat use in this species. There were differences in thermal tolerance among latitudes in neonates, suggesting genetic differences among populations, but adults showed no latitudinal differences. In combination, the increased thermal tolerance of neonates and the age-specific response to latitude suggest individuals may be most sensitive to selection on thermal tolerance as neonates. Although latitudinal differences exist in neonates, their tolerances were not ranked according to latitude, suggesting the effects of some other local factor (e.g., microclimate) may be important. Lastly, among neonates, females tolerate higher temperatures than males. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Octopus vulgaris is considered a serious candidate for rearing, in terms of its biological and market potential: easy adaptation to captivity conditions, high growth rate and high market price. The aim of this study was to examine the combined effects of temperature and body weight on specific growth rate (SGR, % day(-1)), absolute growth rate (AGR, g day(-1)), absolute feeding rate (AFR, g day(-1)), feed efficiency (FE, %), protein retention efficiency (PRE: [g protein gain g protein ingested(-1)] x 100), energy retention efficiency (ERE: [kJ gain kJ ingested(-1)] x 100), proximate composition and PIE ratio (protein/energy) of the common octopus. The experiments were performed in a closed system with controlled temperature (15, 20 and 25 degrees C). The octopuses were fed on squids (Loligo vulgaris). In the multiple regression equations estimated for SGR, AGR, AFR, FE, PRE and ERE, the linear and quadratic effects of temperature, as well as the linear effects of body weight were significant. In addition, the interaction effects of temperature and body weight were significant for SGR, AGR, FE, PRE and ERE; the temperature for maximum response decreased with increasing size, being 25 degrees C for octopuses of 50-150 g and 15 degrees C for animals of 200-600 g. The weight exponent in the relationships of these indices vs. body weight decreased with increasing temperature. The levels of SGR, FE, PRE and ERE varied slightly with temperature in individuals of 150-200 g, and the respective response surfaces showed a plateau within this range of body sizes independently of temperature. The temperature for maximum AFR was estimated to be 21.88 degrees C independently of body weight. Proximate composition and PIE ratio of octopuses were not affected by temperature or body weight. It is concluded that temperature should be adjusted according to the body weight of O. vulgaris for optimizing the economic viability of rearing. Temperature should be high for small individuals (50-150 g) and should be reduced gradually in order for animals larger than 200 g to be reared at low temperature. Therefore, O. vulgaris should be reared in closed systems with temperature control. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change is affecting biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide, and the lowland tropics are of special concern because organisms living in this region experience temperatures that are close to their upper thermal limits. However, it remains unclear how and whether tropical lowland species will be able to cope with the predicted pace of climate warming. Additionally, there is growing interest in examining how quickly thermal physiological traits have evolved across taxa, and whether thermal physiological traits are evolutionarily conserved or labile. We measured critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and minimum (CTmin) in 56 species of lowland Amazonian frogs to determine the extent of phylogenetic conservatism in tolerance to heat and cold, and to predict species' vulnerability to climate change. The species we studied live in sympatry and represent similar to 65% of the known alpha diversity at our study site. Given that critical thermal limits may have evolved differently in response to different temperature constraints, we tested whether CTmax and CTmin exhibit different rates of evolutionary change. Measuring both critical thermal traits allowed us to estimate species' thermal breadth and infer their potential to respond to abrupt changes in temperature (warming and cooling). Additionally, we assessed the contribution of life history traits and found that both critical thermal traits were correlated with species' body size and microhabitat use. Specifically, small direct-developing frogs in the Strabomantidae family appear to be at highest risk of thermal stress while tree frogs (Hylidae) and narrow mouthed frogs (Microhylidae) tolerate higher temperatures. While CTmax and CTmin had considerable variation within and among families, both critical thermal traits exhibited similar rates of evolutionary change. Our results suggest that 4% of lowland rainforest frogs assessed will experience temperatures exceeding their CTmax, 25% might be moderately affected and 70% are unlikely to experience pronounced heat stress under a hypothetical 3 degrees C temperature increase.

AB  - We examined the mechanistic basis for two whole-animal performance traits, aerobic capacity and burst speed, in six laboratory-reared Trinidadian guppy populations from different native drainages with contrasting levels of predation. Using within- and between-population variation, we tested whether variation in organs and organ systems (heart, gill and swimming motor mass) and the activities of several enzymes that support locomotion (citrate synthetase, lactate dehydrogenase and myofibrillar ATPase) are correlated with aerobic performance (maximum rates of oxygen consumption, V(O2)max) or burst performance (maximum swim speed during escape responses). We also tested for associations between physiological traits and habitat type (different drainages and predation levels).
   Organ size and enzyme activities showed substantial size-independent variation, and both performance measures were strongly correlated to body size. After accounting for size effects, neither burst nor aerobic performance was strongly correlated to any organ size or enzymatic variable, or to each other. Two principal components (PCI, PC2) in both males and females accounted for most of the variance in the organ size and enzymatic variables. In both sexes, heart and gill mass tended to covary and were negatively associated with citrate synthetase and lactate dehydrogenase activity. In males (but not females), variation in aerobic performance was weakly but significantly correlated to variation in PCI, suggesting that heart and gill mass scale positively with V-O2max. Neither of the component variables and no single morphological or enzymatic trait was correlated to burst speed in either sex.
   Evolutionary changes in important life history traits occur rapidly in guppy populations subjected to different predation intensities (high mortality in downstream sites inhabited by large predatory fish; low mortality in upstream sites lacking large predators). We found significant differences between stream drainages in all morphological variables and most enzymatic variables, but only the mass of the swimming motor and LDH activity were significantly affected by predation regime. Overall, our data show that microevolution has occurred in the physiological foundations of locomotor performance in guppies, but evolutionary changes in physiology do not closely correspond to the predation-induced changes in life history parameters.

AB  - Populations of animals and plants often undergo conspicuous ecological changes when subjected to climatic extremes. Evolutionary changes may accompany them but are less easily detected. We show that Darwin's finches on a Galapagos island underwent two evolutionary changes after a severe El Nino event caused changes in their food supply. Small beak sizes were selectively favoured in one granivorous species when large seeds became scarce. The effects of selection were transmitted to the next generation as a result of high trait heritabilities. Hybridization between this species and two others resulted in gene exchange, but only after the El Nino when hybrid fitness was much enhanced under the altered feeding conditions. These observations imply that if global warming increases the frequency or severity of El Nino events on the Galapagos, microevolutionary changes in animal and plant populations are to be anticipated.

AB  - Living coyotes modify their behavior in the presence of larger carnivores, such as wolves. However, little is known about the effects of competitor presence or absence on morphological change in coyotes or wolves over long periods of time. We examined the evolution of coyotes and wolves through time from the late Pleistocene, during which many large carnivorous species coexisted as predators and competitors, to the Recent; this allowed us to investigate evolutionary changes in these species in response to climate change and megafaunal extinctions at the end of the Pleistocene. We measured postcranial skeletal morphologies of wolves (Canis lupus) and coyotes (C. latrans) from Pleistocene-aged tar deposits, as well as early, mid, and recent Holocene populations of both. We found few morphological differences between Pleistocene and Holocene wolf populations. Conversely, we found many differences in coyotes: Pleistocene coyotes were larger and more robust than Holocene populations. However, within 1,000 y of the megafaunal extinctions, coyotes are morphologically indistinguishable from modern populations. We cannot attribute these differences directly to climate change because modern coyotes do not follow Bergmann's rule, which states body size increases with decreasing temperature. Instead, we suggest that Pleistocene coyotes may have been larger and more robust in response to larger competitors and a larger-bodied prey base. Although we cannot separate competition from predator-prey interactions, this study indicates that the effects of biotic interactions can be detected in the fossil record.

AB  - We investigated the cellular basis of two extensive, continuous, latitudinal, genetic, body size clines of Drosophila melanogaster by measuring wing area and cell size in the wing blade of adult flies reared under standard, laboratory conditions. We report that the contribution of cell size to an Australian cline is much smaller than that to a South American cline. The data suggest that neither cell size nor cell number were the targets of selection, but rather wing area itself, or a trait closely related to it. We hypothesize that the differences between the continents were caused by differences in the initial pattern of genetic variation for the cell traits and/or by the direction of selection on the source populations of the clines. Despite large differences between continents in the cellular basis of the latitudinal variation, multiple regression analysis, using the individual variation within populations, showed that the relationship between cell size and cell number was changed with latitude in the same way in the two clines. The relative contribution of cell number to wing area variation increased with latitude, probably because of compensatory interactions with cell size as a consequence of the latitudinal increase in cell number. Our findings are discussed in relation to the cellular basis of evolutionary change in laboratory thermal selection lines and natural populations along latitudinal clines.

AB  - The major goal of evolutionary thermal biology is to understand how variation in temperature shapes phenotypic evolution. Comparing thermal reaction norms among populations from different thermal environments allows us to gain insights into the evolutionary mechanisms underlying thermal adaptation. Here, we have examined thermal adaptation in six wild populations of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) from markedly different natural environments by analyzing thermal reaction norms for fecundity, thorax length, wing area, and ovariole number under ecologically realistic fluctuating temperature regimes in the laboratory. Contrary to expectation, we found only minor differences in the thermal optima for fecundity among populations. Differentiation among populations was mainly due to differences in absolute (and partly also relative) thermal fecundity performance. Despite significant variation among populations in the absolute values of morphological traits, we observed only minor differentiation in their reaction norms. Overall, the thermal reaction norms for all traits examined were remarkably similar among different populations. Our results therefore suggest that thermal adaptation in D. melanogaster predominantly involves evolutionary changes in absolute trait values rather than in aspects of thermal reaction norms.

AB  - The genetic response of body size to temperature in the laboratory provides an interesting example of phenotypic plasticity. We found that females of Drosophila ananassae reared to adulthood at 18degreesC showed significant increase in body weight as compared to females reared at 25degreesC. At a given temperature, early productivity and lifetime productivity were the highest when the rearing and test temperature were the same. The effect of test temperature was highly significant for total productivity and early productivity. The interaction between test temperature and development temperature was also highly significant. Effect of development temperature was not significant. The females reared at 18degreesC showed greater body weight but their productivity was not significantly higher than smaller females reared at 25degreesC. Thus, the usually close relationship between size and fecundity is lost when the size change is due to rearing temperature. These findings provide evidence for adaptive plasticity in D. ananassae. We also found a negative correlation (trade-off) between longevity and productivity, the first report of such a trade-off between longevity and productivity in D. ananassae.

AB  - Heterochrony, an evolutionary change in developmental processes, is one of the major proximate causes of morphological diversity of organisms. It has been reported in the medaka Oryzias latipes that higher-latitude larvae have a genetic tendency to complete fin ray formation at larger body sizes, which results in relatively shorter anal and dorsal fins in adults. However, this latitudinal, heterochronic variation in fin length in the wild may be partially explained by latitudinal differences in thermal environments, if temperatures affect the timing of fin ray formation. Common-environment experiments revealed that the body size at which fin pterygiophore (a basal skeleton of fin rays) formation was completed was larger in higher-latitude larvae than in lower-latitude larvae at all temperatures examined, supporting the proposal that fin ray formation of the former is genetically delayed. However, phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature was also evident; lower temperatures caused delayed fin ray formation until a larger body size had been achieved in both high- and low-latitude larvae. These observations suggest that habitat temperatures also contribute to the latitudinal difference in the timing of fin development, magnifying phenotypic variation in fin length across latitudes. We discuss reasons for this positive covariance between genetic and environmental effects on the latitudinal, heterochronic variation, from the viewpoint of local adaptation and evolution of phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - Laboratory selection in thermal regimes that differed in the amplitude and the predictability of daily fluctuations had a marked effect on stress resistance and life history traits in Drosophila simulans. The observed evolutionary changes are expected to be the result of both direct and correlated responses to selection. Thus, a given trait might not evolve independently from other traits because of genetic correlations among these traits. Moreover, different test environments can induce novel genetic correlations because of the activation of environmentally dependent genes. To test whether and how genetic correlations among stress resistance and life history traits constrain evolutionary adaptation, we used three populations of D. simulans selected for 20 generations in constant, predictable and unpredictable daily fluctuating thermal regimes and tested each of these selected populations in the same three thermal regimes. We explored the relationship between genetic correlations between traits and the evolutionary potential of D. simulans by comparing genetic correlation matrices in flies selected and tested in different thermal test regimes. We observed genetic correlations mainly between productivity, body size, starvation and desiccation tolerance, suggesting that adaptation to the three thermal regimes was affected by correlations between these traits. We also found that the correlations between some traits such as body size and productivity or starvation tolerance and productivity were determined by test regime rather than selection regime that is expected to limit genetic adaptation to thermal regimes in these traits. The results of this study suggest that several traits and several environments are needed to explore adaptive responses, as genetic and environmentally induced correlations between traits as results obtained in one environment cannot be used to predict the response of the same population in another environment.

AB  - Phenotypic variation in body size can result from within-cohort variation in birth dates, among-individual growth variation and size-selective processes. We explore the relative effects of these processes on the maintenance of wide observed body size variation in stream-dwelling brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Based on the analyses of multiple recaptures of individual fish, it appears that size distributions are largely determined by the maintenance of early size variation. We found no evidence for size-dependent compensatory growth (which would reduce size variation) and found no indication that size-dependent survival substantially influenced body size distributions. Depensatory growth (faster growth by larger individuals) reinforced early size variation, but was relatively strong only during the first sampling interval (age-0, fall). Maternal decisions on the timing and location of spawning could have a major influence on early, and as our results suggest, later (>age-0) size distributions. If this is the case, our estimates of heritability of body size (body length = 0.25) will be dominated by processes that generate and maintain early size differences. As a result, evolutionary responses to environmental change that are mediated by body size may be largely expressed via changes in the timing and location of reproduction.

AB  - We identify instances of parallel morphological evolution in North American scincid lizards of the Eumeces skiltonianus species group and provide evidence that this system is consistent with a model of ecological speciation. The group consists of three putative species divided among two morphotypes, the small-bodied and striped E. skiltonianus and E. lagunensis versus the large-bodied and typically uniform-colored E. gilberti. Members of the group pass through markedly similar phenotypic stages during early development, but differ with respect to where terminal morphology occurs along the developmental sequence. The morphotypes also differ in habitat preference, with the large-bodied gilberti form generally inhabiting lower elevations and drier environments than the smaller, striped morphs. We inferred the phylogenetic relationships of 53 skiltonianus group populations using mtDNA sequence data from the ND4 protein-coding gene and three flanking tRNAs (900 by total). Sampling encompassed nearly the entire geographic range of the group, and all currently recognized species and subspecies were included. Our results provide strong evidence for parallel origins of three clades characterized by the gilberti morphotype, two of which are nested within the more geographically widespread E. skiltonianus. Eumeces lagunensis was also nested among populations of E. skiltonianus. Comparative analyses using independent contrasts show that evolutionary changes in body size are correlated with differences in adult color pattern. The independently derived association of gilberti morphology with warm, arid environments suggests that phenotypic divergence is the result of adaptation to contrasting selection regimes. We provide evidence that body size was likely the target of natural selection, and that divergences in color pattern and mate recognition are probable secondary consequences of evolving large body size.

AB  - The evolution of phenotypic plasticity requires that it is adaptive, genetically determined, and exhibits sufficient genetic variation. For the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana there is evidence that temperature-mediated plasticity in egg size is an adaptation to predictable seasonal change. Here we set out to investigate heritability in egg size and genetic variation in the plastic response to temperature in this species, using a half-sib breeding design. Egg size of individual females was first measured at a high temperature 4 days after eclosion. Females were then transferred to a low temperature and egg size was measured after acclimation periods of 6 and 12 days respectively. Overall, additive genetic variance explained only 3-11% of the total phenotypic variance, whereas maternal effects were more pronounced. Genotype-environment interactions and cross-environmental correlations of less than unity suggest that there is potential for short-term evolutionary change. Our findings strengthen the support for the adaptive nature of temperature-mediated plasticity in egg size.

AB  - Phenotypic variation in trait means is a common observation for geographically separated populations. Such variation is typically retained under common garden conditions, indicating that there has been evolutionary change in the populations, as a result of selection and/or drift. Much less frequently studied is variation in the phenotypic covariance matrix (hereafter, P matrix), although this is an important component of evolutionary change. In this paper, we examine variation in the phenotypic means and P matrices in two species of grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes and M. devastator. Using the P matrices estimated for 14 populations of M. sanguinipes and three populations of M. devastator we find that (1) significant differences between the sexes can be attributed to scaling effects; (2) there is no significant difference between the two species; (3) there are highly significant differences among populations that cannot be accounted for by scaling effects; (4) these differences are a consequence of statistically significant patterns of covariation with geographic and environmental factors, phenotypic variances and covariances increasing with increased temperature but decreasing with increased latitude and altitude. This covariation suggests that selection has been important in the evolution of the P matrix in these populations Finally, we find a significant positive correlation between the average difference between matrices and the genetic distance between the populations, indicating that drift has caused some of the variation in the P matrices.

AB  - Ongoing climate change has forced animals to face changing thermal and nutritional environments. Animals can adjust to such combinations of stressors via plasticity. Body size is a key trait influencing organismal fitness, and plasticity in this trait in response to nutritional and thermal conditions varies among genetically diverse, locally adapted populations. The standing genetic variation within a population can also influence the extent of body size plasticity. We generated near-isogenic lines from a newly collected population of Drosophila melanogaster at the mid-point of east coast Australia and assayed body size for all lines in combinations of thermal and nutritional stress. We found that isogenic lines showed distinct underlying patterns of body size plasticity in response to temperature and nutrition that were often different from the overall population response. We then tested whether plasticity in development time could explain, and therefore regulate, variation in body size to these combinations of environmental conditions. We selected five genotypes that showed the greatest variation in response to combined thermal and nutritional stress and assessed the correlation between response of developmental time and body size. While we found significant genetic variation in development time plasticity, it was a poor predictor of body size among genotypes. Our results therefore suggest that multiple developmental pathways could generate genetic variation in body size plasticity. Our study emphasizes the need to better understand genetic variation in plasticity within a population, which will help determine the potential for populations to adapt to ongoing environmental change.

AB  - Life history theory predicts that fishing may select for increased reproductive investment. A model of the reaction norm for reproductive investment in a capital breeder was developed to disentangle changes in reproductive investment from changes in growth rate in North Sea plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Trends in reproductive investment since 1960 were estimated as (i) the decrease in body weight of mature males and females between the start and end of the spawning period, (ii) the difference in weight of ripe and spent females, and (iii) the ovary weight of prespawning females. These estimates were related to somatic growth estimated by back-calculation of otoliths and temperature. The ovary weight and weight loss of females that had just started and just finished spawning did not reveal any trends. There was a significant increase in weight loss over the spawning season in both sexes, but much of this increase was likely due to changes in environmental conditions. Evidence for a fisheries-induced change in reproductive investment from our analyses thus remained inconclusive. However, fecundity and ovary-weight data from previous studies tentatively suggest that an increase in reproductive investment occurred between the late 1940s and the 1960s. Such an increase is consistent with a fisheries-induced evolutionary change.

AB  - The lengths of the body and appendages of the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Homoptera: Aphididae) vary seasonally in sexual North American and asexual Australian populations. The first generation of spring aphids in North America and winter aphids in Australia have short appendages in relation to body length. Excluding this phenotype, North American and Australian aphids cannot be discriminated morphometrically. The short appendages in North America are associated with a specialized morph called a fundatrix; the short appendages of Australian aphids are caused by exposure to low temperatures during prenatal development. The same temperature-sensitive mechanism operates in sexual and asexual North American aphids, but does not explain the short appendages of the fundatrix, which appear to anise through a separate mechanism. The short appendages are caused neither by a maternal effect from winged mothers, although such an effect exists, nor by seasonal changes in body length and allometry, nor by microevolutionary changes. The temperature-induced shortening of appendages is a seasonal polymorphism, which mimics the short appendages seen in fundatrices. The two types of phenotypic plasticity have the same consequence in sexual and asexual populations of the same species and may be an example of convergent evolution.

AB  - How will organisms respond to climate change? The rapid changes in global climate are expected to impose strong directional selection on fitness-related traits. A major open question then is the potential for adaptive evolutionary change under these shifting climates. At the most basic level, evolutionary change requires the presence of heritable variation and natural selection. Because organismal tolerances of high temperature place an upper bound on responding to temperature change, there has been a surge of research effort on the evolutionary potential of upper thermal tolerance traits. Here, I review the available evidence on heritable variation in upper thermal tolerance traits, adopting a biogeographic perspective to understand howheritability of tolerance varies across space. Specifically, I use meta-analytical models to explore the relationship between upper thermal tolerance heritability and environmental variability in temperature. I also explore how variation in the methods used to obtain these thermal tolerance heritabilities influences the estimation of heritable variation in tolerance. I conclude by discussing the implications of a positive relationship between thermal tolerance heritability and environmental variability in temperature and how this might influence responses to future changes in climate.

AB  - Despite the recognition that some species might quickly adapt to new conditions under climate change, demonstrating and predicting such a fundamental response is challenging. Morphological variations in response to climate may be caused by evolutionary changes or phenotypic plasticity, or both, but teasing apart these processes is difficult. Here, we built on the number of thoracic vertebrae (NTV) in ectothermic vertebrates, a known genetically based feature, to establish a link with body size and evaluate how climate change might affect the future morphological response of this group of species. First, we show that in old-world salamanders, NTV variation is strongly related to changes in body size. Secondly, using 22 salamander species as a case study, we found support for relationships between the spatial variation in selected bioclimatic variables and NTV for most of species. For 44% of species, precipitation and aridity were the predominant drivers of geographical variation of the NTV. Temperature features were dominant for 31% of species, while for 19% temperature and precipitation played a comparable role. This two-step analysis demonstrates that ectothermic vertebrates may evolve in response to climate change by modifying the number of thoracic vertebrae. These findings allow to develop scenarios for potential morphological evolution under future climate change and to identify areas and species in which the most marked evolutionary responses are expected. Resistance to climate change estimated from species distribution models was positively related to present-day species morphological response, suggesting that the ability of morphological evolution may play a role for species' persistence under climate change. The possibility that present-day capacity for local adaptation might help the resistance response to climate change can be integrated into analyses of the impact of global changes and should also be considered when planning management actions favouring species persistence.

AB  - The biological changes caused by autotriploidy are poorly studied in animals. To investigate this issue in depth, we compared genetics, morphology, life history, ecology and behaviour of the triploid marbled crayfish and its diploid parent, slough crayfish Procambarus fallax. We performed a meta-analysis of our data and literature data. Our COI based molecular tree, consisting of 27 species of Cambaridae, confirmed the close taxonomic relationship between marbled crayfish and P. fallax. Comparison of both crayfish revealed similarities in mitochondrial gene sequences, morphological characters, colouration, body proportions and behaviours. Considerable differences were recorded with respect to chromosome number in somatic cells, haploid genome size, DNA methylation level, body size, fecundity, longevity, population size structure, invasiveness, and the range of inhabited biomes. These differences have dimensions that are otherwise only observed between species supporting earlier proposed raising of marbled crayfish from P. fallax forma virginalis to a new species named Procambarus virginalis. Particularly noteworthy is the enhancement of the fitness traits that probably resulted from evolutionary changes in gene expression. These alterations and the transition from sexual reproduction to parthenogenesis are likely responsible for the increased invasiveness of marbled crayfish in tropical to cold-temperate biomes.

KW  - COMPARATIVE METHODS
KW  - CORRELATED EVOLUTION
KW  - PLEOMERISM
AB  - 1. In snakes body size and vertebral number vary considerably among species. To investigate whether the two traits are correlated, and similar to a pattern found in fish and termed pleomerism, data from the literature were examined for 771 species and subspecies of advanced snakes (superfamily Colubroidea; families Colubridae, Elapidae and Viperidae). A strong tendency was found for species with many vertebrae to reach a large maximum body size; in 12 groups of species examined all showed a positive correlation coefficient and in nine cases it was significant.
   2. To eliminate the possibility that this result is an effect of similarity owing to common ancestry, both a directional method and an independent comparison method were applied on groups for which a cladogram was available. The results were found to be robust, and it is concluded that the evolution of vertebral number has paralleled the evolution of body size in these groups of snakes. It appears that vertebral number, at least in part, has evolved as a correlated response to selection on body size.
   3. Deviations from the general pattern of pleomerism were examined to investigate whether they could be explained by family affiliation, body shape or by various ecological factors. The three families did not differ in either slope or elevation of the relationship between vertebral number and body size, but species with a mere elongated body had more vertebrae per size unit than stouter ones whereas burrowing species had fewer vertebrae per size unit than species occupying other habitats. Furthermore, the habit of constriction also appeared to affect vertebral number; constricting species had more vertebrae per size unit than non-constricting ones. Thus, vertebral number per se is also a target of selection and has been adjusted according to specific ecological circumstances apart from being affected by body size. Finally I examined whether body size and vertebral number might be affected by altitude, and thus presumably temperature as has been suggested. However, no effect of altitude on vertebral number or body size was found.

AB  - Selection experiments offer an efficient way to study the evolvability of traits that play an important role in insects' reproduction and/or survival and to trace correlations and trade-offs between them. We have exercised bi-directional selection on Drosophila montana flies' pre-adult development time under constant light and temperature conditions for 10 generations and traced the indirect effects of this selection on females' diapause induction under different day lengths, as well as on the body weight and cold tolerance of both sexes. Overall, selection was successful towards slow, but not towards fast development. However, all fast selection line replicates showed at the end of selection increased variance in females' photoperiodic diapause response and about one hour increase in the critical day (CDL), where more than 50% of emerging females enter diapause. Indirect effects of selection on flies' body weight and cold-tolerance were less clear, as the flies of the slow selection line were significantly heavier and less cold-tolerant than the control line flies after five generations of selection, but lighter and more cold-tolerant at the end of selection. Changes in females' diapause induction resulting from selection for fast development could be due to common metabolic pathways underlying these traits, collaboration of circadian clock and photoperiodic timer and/or by the interaction between the endocrine and circadian systems.

AB  - Natural populations are subjected to abiotic environmental stresses of varying intensity. Some organisms can increase their resistance to stress by a genetic reduction in metabolic rate. This relationship underlies negative associations of desiccation resistance with many life-history traits but a positive association with longevity in Drosophila melanogaster. The efficacy of stress as an environmental probe exposing such trade-offs follows from the high heritability of stress resistance in these experiments. Generalizations concerning evolutionary change come from the interaction between stress and its metabolic cost. At stressed species borders little available energy may remain beyond maintenance and survival needs so that extinctions become likely. In moderately stressed and narrowly fluctuating environments there should be sufficient genetic variability and metabolic energy to permit genetic adaptation. Phyletic gradualism is an expectation in these environments. In more stressed and widely fluctuating environments a punctuated evolutionary pattern is likely even though stasis may occur most of the time. An interpretation of evolutionary patterns therefore comes from an analysis of the interaction between stress (severity and variability), genetic variability, and energy availability, which can be summarized in an evolutionary templet.

AB  - Most life history traits are positively influenced by body size, whereas disadvantages of large body size are poorly documented. To investigate presumed intrinsic costs of large size in the yellow dung fly (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae), we established two replicates each of three body size laboratory selection lines (small, control and large; selection on males only), and subjected flies of the resulting extended body size range to various abiotic stresses. Response to selection was symmetrical in the small and large lines (realized h(2) = 0.16-0.18). After 24 generations of selection body size had changed by roughly 10%. Female size showed a correlated response to selection on male size, whereas sexual size dimorphism did not change. Development time also showed a correlated response as, similar to food limited flies, small line flies emerged earlier at smaller body size. At the lowest larval food limit possible, flies of all lines emerged at the same small body size after roughly the same development time; so overall phenotypic plasticity in body size and development time strongly increased following selection. Juvenile mortality increased markedly when food was extremely limited, large line flies showing highest mortality. Winter frost disproportionately killed large (line) flies because of their longer development times. Mortality at high temperatures was high but size-selective effects were inconsistent. In all environments the larger males suffered more. Initial growth rate was higher for males and at unlimited food. Small line individuals of both sexes grew slowest at unlimited larval food but fastest at limited larval food, suggesting a physiological cost of fast growth. Overall, extension of the natural body size range by artificial selection revealed some otherwise cryptic intrinsic juvenile viability costs of large size, mediated by longer development or faster growth, but only in stressful environments.

AB  - 1. Theoretical studies of the costs and benefits of migration predict that evolutionary changes in dispersal traits may take place in response to habitat fragmentation.
   2. For the butterfly Plebejus argus, we investigated five morphological characters potentially associated with flight ability, in locations that varied in level of habitat fragmentation. The traits were: total mass, relative thorax mass (containing flight muscle), relative abdomen mass (containing reproductive organs), relative wing area and wing aspect ratio. All characters were measured on individuals reared in a common environment.
   3. Morphology was related to the level of habitat fragmentation in both limestone and heathland habitats. Total mass increased with decreasing heathland habitat area lover the range 13 000-10 ha). Relative allocation to the thorax increased, while allocation to the abdomen decreased, with declining limestone habitat area lover the range 3.5-0.2 ha). Morphological characters were not significantly correlated with habitat isolation.
   4. Significant family effects for total mass, relative thorax mass, relative abdomen mass and (for females only) relative wing area indicate that these traits may have a heritable component, and therefore have the potential to respond to selection acting on flight ability.
   5. We suggest that evolutionary changes in life history traits are taking place in response to changes in landscape structure: in P. argus, these traits may be influenced by the effects of mate-location strategy on emigration rates. Specific changes in traits can be complex, and may vary among species and populations.
   6. P. argus had a 50% chance of occurring in heathland fragments of 33 ha, and was present on all heathlands above 50 ha, but population systems may not yet have achieved equilibrium. P. argus is unlikely to undertake major evolutionary changes in response to reduced habitat area in heathlands > 50 ha. Extinctions from smaller heathlands can be explained most plausibly by population/vegetation dynamics. Therefore, evolutionary changes in morphology may be more likely to be symptomatic of populations with altered costs and benefits of migration, rather than to be a direct cause of extinction.

AB  - In snakes, body size and reproductive output vary greatly among disjunct populations. Clutch size is notably influenced by food availability, thermal conditions and maternal body size. A comparison between three large-scale areas - north continental, south continental and island populations of European whip snakes - revealed significant variation in body size and reproductive output. More importantly, there was a geographical difference in the covariation between clutch size and maternal body size, two traits mechanistically linked as body size constrains clutch size. This suggests that clutch size can vary independently of maternal body size, a situation that provides opportunities to tease apart the contribution of phenotypic plasticity from local genetic adaptations in these two life-history traits.

AB  - Effects of geographical origin of strain, season of field collection, genetic background, and number of generations of laboratory rearing on flight initiation, body weight, and lipid content of lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica, were studied. Significant differences in flight initiation, body weight, and total lipid content occurred among the four field strains collected from Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Mexico. Flight activity tended to be higher for strains with higher average body weight. Oleic, palmitic, and linoleic acids accounted for about 95% of all fatty acids present in the strains tested. However, the percentage of lipids per fresh body weight was not significantly different among these four field strains. Beetles collected in summer tended to fly more and have a higher percentage of lipid content than beetles collected in spring and autumn. Results from crosses between strains with high and low flight responses suggested that the female contributes a higher proportion of additive genetic variance for flight initiation than the male. Rearing for 17 generations in laboratory conditions had no discernible effect on flight initiation of a strain of R. dominica collected from the field. Thus, flight behavior can persist for many generations of laboratory rearing. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: In a study conducted in 1966-1969, longitudinal measurements were made of the metabolic rate in growing infants. Statistical methods for analyzing longitudinal data weren't readily accessible at that time. Objectives: To measure minimal rates of oxygen consumption (V) over dotO(2), ml/min) in growing infants during the first postnatal weeks and to determine the relationships between postnatal increases in (V) over dotO(2), body size and postnatal age. Methods: We studied 61 infants of any birth weight or gestational age, including 19 of very low birth weight. The infants, nursed in incubators, were clinically well and without need of oxygen supplementation or respiratory assistance. Serial measures of (V) over dotO(2) using a closed-circuit method were obtained at approximately weekly intervals. (V) over dotO(2) was measured under thermoneutral conditions with the infant asleep or resting quietly. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects models. Results: During early postnatal growth, (V) over dotO(2) rises as surface area (m(2))(1.94) (standard error, SE 0.054) or body weight (kg)(1.24) (SE 0.033). Multivariate analyses show statistically significant effects of both size and age. Reference intervals (Rls) for (V)over dotO(2) for fixed values of body weight and postnatal age are presented. As (V)over dotO(2) rises with increasing size and age, there is an increase in the skin-operative environmental temperature gradient (T skin-op) required for heat loss. Required T skin-op can be predicted from surface area and heat loss (heat production minus heat storage). Conclusions:Generation of Rls for minimal rates of (V) over dotO(2) in growing infants from the 1960s was enabled by application of mixed-effects statistical models for analyses of longitudinal data. Results apply to the pre-caffeine era of neonatal care. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Understanding adaptive phenotypic variation is one of the most fundamental problems in evolutionary biology. Genes involved in adaptation are most likely those that affect traits most intimately connected to fitness: life-history traits. The genetics of quantitative trait variation (including life histories) is still poorly understood, but several studies suggest that (I) quantitative variation might be the result of variation in gene expression, rather than protein evolution, and (2) natural variation in gene expression underlies adaptation. The next step in studying the genetics of adaptive phenotypic variation is therefore an analysis of naturally occuring covariation of global gene expression and a life-history trait. Here, we report a microarray study addressing the covariation in larval gene expression and adult body weight, a life-history trait involved in adaptation. Natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster show adaptive geographic variation in adult body size, with larger animals at higher latitudes. Conditions during larval development also affect adult size with larger flies emerging at lower temperatures. We found statistically significant differences in normalized larval gene expression between geographic populations at one temperature (genetic variation) and within geographic populations between temperatures (developmental plasticity). Moreover, larval gene expression correlated highly with adult weight, explaining 81% of its natural variation. Of the genes that show a correlation of gene expression with adult weight, most are involved in cell growth or cell maintenance or are associated with growth pathways.

AB  - Senescence is a general decline of physiological state that accompanies advancing age. It affects nearly all organisms, but patterns of senescence vary markedly, even among closely related taxa. Understanding the evolution of this diversity requires information about environmental effects on the expression of variation among taxa. I examined genetically-based variation of senescence within and between two species complexes of Daphnia in four environments. The environments were defined by large differences in food and temperature, two factors known to influence senescence. The species studied were chosen to represent sister species that likely experience divergent (D. pulex and D. pulicaria) or similar (D. mendotate and D. dentifera) selection pressures on senescence. Overall, D. pulex expressed the greatest demographic senescence, D. mendotae and D. dentifera were intermediate, and D. pulicaria expressed the least. In environments representative of typical natural conditions, D. pulex had greater senescence than D. pudicaria, regardless of how late-life performance was assessed. This shows that genetic-environment interactions do not confound the interpretation of senescence differences between these species as the result of selective differences between their habitats. Comparison of D. mendotae and D. dentifera primarily revealed similar life histories, although differences in reproductive declines occurred in some environments. The joint observation of similar mortality patterns but dissimilar fecundity declines suggests that the trade-off between survival and reproduction changes with age. This calls into question the utility of only studying mortality for understanding evolutionary change of senescence in nature.

AB  - Little is known of the capacity that marine metazoans have to evolve under rapid pCO(2) changes. Consequently, we reared a marine polychaete, Ophryotrocha labronica, previously cultured for approximately 33 generations under a low/variable pH regime, under elevated and low pCO(2) for six generations. The strain used was found to be tolerant to elevated pCO(2) conditions. In generations F1 and F2 females' fecundity was significantly lower in the low pCO(2) treatment. However, from generation F3 onwards there were no differences between pCO(2) treatments, indicating that trans-generational effects enabled the restoration and maintenance of reproductive output. Whilst the initial fitness recovery was likely driven by trans-generational plasticity (TGP), the results from reciprocal transplant assays, performed using F7 individuals, made it difficult to disentangle between whether TGP had persisted across multiple generations, or if evolutionary adaptation had occurred. Nonetheless, both are important mechanisms for persistence under climate change. Overall, our study highlights the importance of multi-generational experiments in more accurately determining marine metazoans' responses to changes in pCO(2), and strengthens the case for exploring their use in conservation, by creating specific pCO(2) tolerant strains of keystone ecosystem species.

AB  - Evolutionary changes depend on adaptive evolution and two other components that traditionally have not been taken into account: chance and history. However, concepts in evolutionary biology are very often supported by descriptive studies but not by empirical approach. In order to disentangle the three components of evolutionary change, we have investigated the effects of long-term selection pressure on fitness and cell size in the bloom-forming dinoflagellate, Prorocentrum triestinum Schiller, under increased nutrient concentrations and temperature. Two strains of P. triestinum, previously adapted to grow under standard conditions (f/2 medium, 20 degrees C), were grown under increased nutrient concentrations and temperature (f medium, 25 degrees C) until fitness and cell size were invariant as a function of time (720 days, corresponding to c. 400 generations). The mean value for fitness of both strains of P. triestinum showed a significant increase whereas a decrease in mean cell size was found. The changes in fitness have adaptive value, but the changes in cell size were due to both adaptation and the contribution of chance-plus-history.

AB  - Generalism should be favoured evolutionarily when there is no genetic constraint or loss of fitness across alternative environments. However, evolution of generalism can require substantial evolutionary change, which can confer a general stress response to other aspects of the environment. We created generalist lineages from an ancestral, resource-specialized laboratory population of seed beetles (Callosobruchus maculatus) by rearing lines over 60 generations on a mixture of both ancestral and novel host species to test for costs associated with the evolution of generalism involving evolutionary changes in gene expression and correlated phenotypic responses during a shift to generalism. Evolved lines had higher fitness on the novel resource, with no loss of fitness on the ancestral resource, indicating that they overcame initial fitness trade-offs. This involved upregulation of major stress response (heat shock protein) genes and genes coding for metabolic enzymes, suggesting an underpinning metabolic and physiological cost. Resource generalist populations also evolved greater thermal tolerance breadth, highlighting that the evolution of resource generalism might pre-adapt species to respond favourably to other environmental stressors, following selection for generalized stress response gene upregulation. The rapid gain of novel hosts during a pest invasion might also confer greater thermal resilience to ongoing climate change.

AB  - Climate change is one of the greatest challenges that wildlife is facing. Rapid shifts in climatic conditions may accelerate evolutionary changes in populations as a result of strong selective pressure. Most studies focus on the impact of climatic conditions on phenologies and annual cycles, whereas there are fewer reports of empirical support for climate-driven changes in the phenotypic variability of free-living populations. We investigated whether climatic variables explain the prevalence of colour polymorphism in a population of the grass snake (Natrix natrix) with two morphotypes, the melanistic and non-melanistic ones, in the period 1981-2013. We found that the prevalence of the black phenotype was negatively related to spring temperature and winter harshness, expressed as the number of snow days. According to the thermal melanism hypothesis, a high predation rate during warmer springs may override relaxed thermal benefits and vice versa, i.e. black individuals may perform better than typical ones when thermal conditions in spring are unfavourable. In turn, because they are smaller, melanistic individuals may be exposed to a higher risk of winter mortality, particularly during longer winters. We highlight the need for more studies on the effects of climatic conditions on temporal variation in melanism prevalence in other populations and species as well as in various geographic regions.

AB  - Most life history traits are positively influenced by body size, while disadvantages of large size are poorly documented. To investigate presumed intrinsic costs of large body size in yellow dung flies (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae), we allowed larvae from replicate lines artificially selected for small and large body size for 21 generations to compete directly with each other at 20A degrees C (benign) and 25A degrees C (stressful) and low and high food (dung) availability. Greater mortality of large line flies was evident at low food independent of temperature, suggesting a cost of fast growth and/or long development for genetically large flies during larval scramble competition under food limitation. Our results are congruent with a previous study assessing mortality when competing within body size lines, so no additional mechanisms affecting scramble or contest behavior of larvae need be invoked to explain the results obtained beyond the costs of longer development and faster growth. Thus, artificial selection producing larger yellow dung flies than occur in nature revealed some, albeit weak mortality costs of large body size that otherwise might have remained cryptic. We conclude, however, that these costs are insufficient to explain the evolutionary limits of large body size in this species given persistently strong fecundity and sexual selection favoring large size in both sexes.

AB  - AimGeneral geographical patterns of insect body size are still a matter of considerable debate, mainly because the annual number of generations (voltinism) and its relationship with body size have largely been ignored. We present the first analyses of voltinism and body size of insect assemblages at a continental scale using lepidopteran and odonate species. We hypothesize that voltinism is strongly driven by environmental conditions and constrains body size on macroecological scales.
   LocationEurope.
   MethodsWe compiled the distribution, voltinism and body size of 943 lepidopteran and odonate species within a 50 km x 50 km grid system, thereby presenting a novel method for estimating the body volume of species from digital images. Regressions and structural equation modelling were applied to distinguish the effects of temperature, productivity and season length on mean voltinism and body size within grid cells. We accounted for spatial autocorrelation with autoregressive models and analysed the possible effect of species richness and intraspecific variability.
   ResultsVoltinism consistently decreased with latitude for both lepidopterans (r(2)=0.76) and odonates (r(2)=0.86), with species having on average fewer generations per year in northern Europe and more generations per year in southern Europe. The effects of temperature, productivity and season length on body size contrasted in sign between lepidopterans and odonates, leading to opposing geographical patterns across Europe.
   Main conclusionsVoltinism in insect assemblages is strongly driven by environmental temperature, and trade-offs between voltinism and body size influence the occurrence of species at macroecological scales. Insects with the ability to extend their generation time over multiple years can overcome this constraint, allowing for a relatively large body size in cold areas. Our results furthermore support the idea that body sizes of terrestrial and aquatic insects form contrasting geographical patterns because they are differently affected by temperature and resource constraints.

AB  - The link between biodiversity and climate has been obvious to biologists since the work of von Humboldt in the early 1800s, but establishing the relationship of climate to ecological and evolutionary patterns is more difficult. On evolutionary timescales, climate can affect supply of energy by biotic and abiotic effects. Some of the best evidence for a link between biodiversity and climate comes from latitudinal gradients in diversity, which provide an avenue to explore the more general relationship between climate and evolution. Among the wide range of biotic hypotheses, those with the greatest empirical support indicate that warmer climates have provided the energetic foundation for increased biodiversity by fostering greater population size and thus increased extinction resistance; have increased metabolic scope; have allowed more species to exploit specialized niches as a result of greater available energy; and generated faster speciation and/or lower extinction rates. In combination with geologic evidence for carbon dioxide levels and changing areas of tropical seas, these observations provide the basis for a simple, first-order model of the relationship between climate through the Phanerozoic and evolutionary patterns and diversity. Such a model suggests that we should expect greatest marine diversity during globally warm intervals with dispersed continents, broad shelves and moderately extensive continental seas. Demonstrating a significant evolutionary response to either climate or climatic change is challenging, however, because of continuing uncertainties over patterns of Phanerozoic marine diversity and the variety of factors beyond climate that influence evolution.

AB  - Ocean warming may lead to smaller body sizes of marine ectotherms, because metabolic rates increase exponentially with temperature while the capacity of the cardiorespiratory system to match enhanced oxygen demands is limited. Here, we explore the impact of rising sea water temperatures on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), an economically important fish species. We focus on changes in the temperature-dependent growth potential by a transfer function model combining growth observations with climate model ensemble temperatures. Growth potential is expressed in terms of asymptotic body weight and depends on water temperature. We consider changes between the periods 1985-2004 and 2081-2100, assuming that future sea water temperatures will evolve according to climate projections for IPCC AR5 scenario RCP8.5. Our model projects a response of Atlantic cod to future warming, differentiated according to ocean regions, leading to increases of asymptotic weight in the Barents Sea, while weights are projected to decline at the southern margin of the biogeographic range. Southern spawning areas will disappear due to thermal limitation of spawning stages. These projections match the currently observed biogeographic shifts and the temperature- and oxygen-dependent decline in routine aerobic scope at southern distribution limits.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the latitudinal variation in preadult competitive ability of Drosophila melanogaster. Two pairs of populations from Queensland and Tasmania, Australia, were examined. Queensland flies are genetically smaller and develop more slowly than the Tasmanian flies. Survival and body size of flies raised at different temperatures and densities were compared when larvae were challenged with a common competitor. No latitudinal variation in larval survival was detected. Body size (measured as wing length) decreased with increasing temperature and larval density. Flies from the Tasmanian populations were more sensitive to the effects of temperature and density and to the joint effect of increased temperature and density. This could explain the evolution of greater growth efficiency and larger body size at lower temperatures.

AB  - In view of its fundamental and pervasive influences and impacts on organism physiology and ecology, body size is recognized as a key component of evolutionary fitness and serves as the cornerstone of a seminal contribution in freshwater zooplankton ecology-the Size Efficiency Hypothesis (SEH) of Brooks & Dodson (Science 150:28-35, 1965). While the roles and implications of body size in predation and competition-central tenets of the SEH-have been widely considered and reviewed, no broader integrated synthesis exists of the collective array of body size determinants and their implications in the ecology in crustacean zooplankton-a numerically and functionally dominant group of aquatic organisms. Focusing on planktonic Cladocera and Copepoda in inland waters, in particular, we provide a wide-ranging overview of the direct and/or indirect effects of environmental conditions, consumable resources and biotic interactions that independently and/or collectively influence the phenotypic expression of body size (particularly as length), both within and between species. Some indirect ultimate evolutionary consequences of body size are considered, and we identify some controversies and unresolved issues related to this biologically crucial trait. While by no means exhaustive, our overview reveals a complex nexus of extrinsic proximate abiotic and biotic factors and interactions that influence body size, the phenotypic expression of which in natural systems commonly reflects contrasting outcomes related to conflicting direct and/or indirect selective pressures. In general, however, body size (both inter- and intra specifically) declines with rising temperature and increases with rising food supply (depending on its quality), although both temperature and food supply exert contrary influences on particular taxa (or life history stages) under certain environmental circumstances. Predation undoubtedly has an overriding influence on body size selection. Depending on its mechanistic basis (visual, tactile or both in tandem), it selectively favours either small or large body size, both within (adults vs. juveniles) and between prey species, which are accordingly often 'size-trapped' between contrasting selective pressures, with consequent indirect effects. The bioenergetics of fundamental physiological processes undoubtedly set constraints on body size and serve as the primary determinant. However, within such constraints, the phenotypic expression of body size reflects its adaptive modification in response to the prevailing abiotic and biotic environment. As such, body size represents an emergent ecological property, reflecting the outcome of specific circumstances and conditions, which vary both temporally within and spatially between different ecosystems, and are accordingly context dependent. Nevertheless, underlying physiological advantages of larger size (within and between species) among crustacean zooplankters-lower mass-specific metabolic rates (although recently challenged), higher individual feeding rates (at least among cladocerans), potentially wider food size-ranges, better starvation tolerances, higher potential fecundity, etc.-collectively favour the selection of increased body size, as predicted by the SEH. Although competitive superiority of large size (measured in terms of minimal food requirements) has been confirmed experimentally, this cannot be generalized to natural conditions, where conflicting and temporally variable pressures apply, and contribute to generally mixed, and temporally variable body size compositions.
   Complex undrlying ecological interactions and influences ultimately determine the phenotypic expression of body size in directions consistent with fitness optimization under prevailing circumstances. Certain specific and general deficiencies in information are identified. In particular, the overwhelming emphasis on daphniid cladocerans as model study taxa in freshwater ecosystems has marginalized the acquisition of a comparably broad and penetrating understanding of specific features both of non-daphniid cladoceran and copepod life histories and body size selection. Among daphniid cladocerans, contemporary definitive understanding devolves largely from reductionist laboratory approaches. Holistic re-integration of these mechanistic findings into natural system circumstances presents a difficult challenge that is attracting increasingly attention. With regard to copepods, synthetic integration of the expansive marine knowledge base appears crucial to inform and direct future investigations on freshwater taxa. The question of intrinsic body size regulation in copepods and cladocerans, especially in regard to final phenotypic plasticity in body size expression, awaits resolution. Overall, body size remains a multi-facetted and complex topic, offering promising challenges for further investigation.

AB  - Changes in the onset of sexual maturation, reproductive investment and growth of North Sea plaice are studied between three periods: 1900s, 1980s and 2000s. Probabilistic maturation reaction norms of both males and females, describing the probability of becoming mature conditional on age and size, shifted towards smaller sizes and younger ages, indicating a fisheries-induced evolutionary change. A higher rate of change was observed during the past 20 years, which may be related to higher temperature conditions. Reproductive investment was estimated from the decrease in lipid, protein, dry weight content and condition factor of the whole body between pre- and post-spawning adults. Reproductive investment expressed as the energy loss over the spawning period increased with body size from 19% at 20 cm to 30% at 40 cm in males and from 35% at 30 cm to 48% at 50 cm in females. No change in reproductive investment could be detected between the 1980s and the 2000s. Von Bertalanffy (VB) growth parameters showed a decrease in L-infinity the asymptotic size and an increase in K, the velocity to reach L-infinity, in both males and females. The changes in VB growth are consistent with an increase in energy acquisition and reproductive investment. The observed changes in maturation, reproductive investment and growth are consistent with fisheries-induced evolution, but the changes in reproductive investment and growth need further investigation to disentangle the role of phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) participates in the modulation of the cellular development, differentiation and proliferation in various vertebrate tissues. Therefore, variations in IGF-I gene are good candidates as growth regulators. In this study, a novel 79-bp insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism was identified in 3-flanking region of IGF-I gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing approaches in common carp Cyprinus carpio. To gain insight into the association of the 79-bp I/D polymorphism with growth-related traits, a total of 747 individuals from Heilongjiang carp Cyprinus cario haematopterus (YL) (n=263), selective line of German mirror carp Cyprinus carpio L. mirror (JL) (n=229), and cold-resistance line of Hebao red carp Cyprinus carpio var. wuyuanensis (HL) (n=255) were genotyped. The DD genotype of the polymorphism was significantly associated with higher body length (135), body weight (325, 385, and 445days), net weight (445days) and lower overwintering body loss rate in JL. In addition, in pooled population (YL+JL+HL), fish with DD genotype also showed significantly higher body weight (445days) and net weight (445days) than those with II genotype. Taken together, these results suggest that the novel polymorphism in IGF-I gene could be considered as a potential genetic marker for selection of growth performance in common carp.

AB  - Protein restriction (PR) has established feasible trade-offs in Drosophila melanogaster to understand lifespan or ageing in a nutritionally challenged environment. However, the phenotypes of body size, weight and wing length respond according to factors such as flies' genotype, environmental exposure and parental diet, and hence their understanding is essential. Here, we demonstrate the effect of long-term PR diet on body size, weight, normal and dry wing length of flies subjected to PR50 and PR70 (50% and 70% protein content present in control food, respectively) for 20 generations from the pre-adult stage. We found that PR-fed flies have lower body weight, relative water content (in males), unaltered (PR50%) and higher (PR70%) relative fat content in males, smaller normal and dry body size when compared with control and generations 1 and 2. Interestingly, the wing size and pupal size of PR flies are smaller and showed significant effects on diet and generation. Thus, these traits are sex and generation dependent along with a diet interaction, which is capable of modulating these results variably. Taken together, the trans-generational effect of PR on fitness and fitness-related traits might be helpful to understand the underpinning mechanisms of evolution and ageing in fruit flies D. melanogaster.

AB  - Two primary patterns of body size variation have been recorded in ectotherms in relation to latitudinal/altitudinal shifts. In some, body size increases with increasing latitude/altitude whereas, in others, body size decreases with increasing latitude/altitude. This clinal variation is generally assumed to be caused by local adaptation to environmental conditions however the selective variable(s) (temperature, humidity, diet quality, etc.) is still heavily debated. Here we investigate geographic variation in body size of dark and pale color morphs of males of the bush-cricket Isophya rizeensis collected from 15 locations along an elevation gradient ranging from 350 to 2 500 m. Using an information theoretical approach we evaluate the relative support of four different hypotheses (the temperature size rule, the moisture gradient hypothesis, the seasonal constraint hypothesis, and the primary productivity hypothesis) explaining body size variation along the altitudinal gradient. Body size variation in pale color morphs showed a curvilinear relationship with altitude while dark color morphs showed no variation in body size. Body size variation in pale color morphs was highly correlated with precipitation and temperature seasonality values thus giving strong support for the moisture gradient and seasonal constraint hypothesis. Our results reinforce the importance of gradients in humidity and seasonality over temperature in the creation of altitudinal body size clines and the role of selection for resistance to stress factors in the establishment of these clines. Whether a body size cline is observed or not might also depend on the phenotypic properties of the individuals, like coloration.

AB  - We measured temperature-dependent fertility selection on body size in Drosophila pseudoobscura in the laboratory. One hundred single females of each of the three karyotypes involving the 'sex-ratio' (SR) and the standard (ST) gene arrangement on the sex chromosome laid eggs at either 18 or 24-degrees-C. The experiment addressed the following hypotheses: (a) Fertility selection on body size is weaker at the higher temperature, explaining in part why genetically smaller flies appear to evolve in populations at warmer localities. (b) Homokaryotypic SR females are less fecund than homokaryotypic ST females, possibly mediated by the effect of body size on fertility, explaining the low frequencies of SR despite its strong advantage due to meiotic drive. The data were also expected to shed light on a mechanism for the evolution of plasticity of body size through fertility selection in environments with an unpredictable temperature regime. Hypothesis (a) was clearly refuted because phenotypically larger ST females had an even larger fertility surplus at the higher temperature and, more importantly, the genetic correlation between fertility and body size disappeared at the lower temperature. As to (b), we found that temperature affects fertility directly and indirectly through body size such that ST and SR females were about equally fecund at both temperatures, although different in size and size-adjusted fertility. We observed heterosis for both size and fertility, which might stabilize the polymorphism in nature. The reaction norms of body size to the temperature difference were steeper for ST females than for SR females, implying that fertility selection could change phenotypic plasticity of body size in a population. Selection on body size depended not only on the temperature, but also on the karyotypes, suggesting that models of phenotype evolution using purely phenotypic fitness functions may often be inadequate.

AB  - Many animal species face periods of chronic nutritional stress during which the individuals must continue to develop, grow, and/or reproduce despite low quantity or quality of food. Here, we use experimental evolution to study adaptation to such chronic nutritional stress in six replicate Drosophila melanogaster populations selected for the ability to survive and develop within a limited time on a very poor larval food. In unselected control populations, this poor food resulted in 20% lower egg-to-adult viability, 70% longer egg-to-adult development, and 50% lower adult body weight (compared to the standard food on which the flies were normally maintained). The evolutionary changes associated with adaptation to the poor food were assayed by comparing the selected and control lines in a common environment for different traits after 29-64 generations of selection. The selected populations evolved improved egg-to-adult viability and faster development on poor food. Even though the adult dry weight of selected flies when raised on the poor food was lower than that of controls, their average larval growth rate was higher. No differences in proportional pupal lipid content were observed. When raised on the standard food, the selected flies showed the same egg-to-adult viability and the same resistance to larval heat and cold shock as the controls and a slightly shorter developmental time. However, despite only 4% shorter development time, the adults of selected populations raised on the standard food were 13% smaller and showed 20% lower early-life fecundity than the controls, with no differences in life span. The selected flies also turned out less tolerant to adult malnutrition. Thus, fruit flies have the genetic potential to adapt to poor larval food, with no detectable loss of larval performance on the standard food. However, adaptation to larval nutritional stress is associated with trade-offs with adult fitness components, including adult tolerance to nutritional stress.

AB  - Organisms tend to decrease in size with increasing temperature by phenotypic plasticity (the temperature-size rule; ectotherms) and/or genetically (Bergmann's rule; all organisms). In this study, the evolutionary response of body size to temperature was examined in the cyclically parthenogenetic rotifer Brachionus plicatilis. Our aim was to investigate whether this species, already known to decrease in size with increasing temperature by phenotypic plasticity, presents a similar pattern at the genetic level. We exposed a multiclonal mixture of B. plicatilis to experimental evolution at low and high temperature and monitored body size weekly. Within a month, we observed a smaller size at higher temperature, as compared to body size at lower temperature. The pattern was consistent for the size of both mature females and eggs; rotifers kept at high temperature evolved to be on average 14% (after 2 weeks) and 3% (after 3 weeks) smaller than the ones kept at low temperature (10 and 5% in the case of eggs, respectively). We therefore found that B. plicatilis is genetically programmed to adjust its body size-to-environmental temperature.

AB  - We investigated the possible role of environmental variables in determining body size within a complex of salamander species (Desmognathus quadramaculatus). We analyzed data generated from life-history studies on populations from throughout the range of this species complex. We incorporated an alternative-hypothesis framework (sensu Platt) to determine the better predictor of adult body size, age at maturity, or size at metamorphosis. We found that almost 90% of the variation in adult body size was explained by size at metamorphosis, which was determined by a combination of rate of larval growth and length of the larval period. Environmental temperature and moisture level were positively correlated with larval growth rate and length of the larval period, respectively. We propose a simple model of body-size evolution that incorporates both adaptive and plastic components. We suggest that the length of the larval period may adaptively respond to moisture-level predictability. In addition, we suggest that the response of the larval growth rate to temperature may be plastic. Because the selection pressure due to drying-induced mortality is pervasive among species of amphibians, it may have played a role in shaping body-size radiation in desmognathines as well as the ecological structure of Appalachian streamside communities.

AB  - Variation in fitness generated by differences in functional performance can often be traced to morphological variation among individuals within natural populations. However, morphological variation itself is strongly influenced by environmental factors (e.g., temperature) and maternal effects (e.g., variation in egg size). Understanding the full ecological context of individual variation and natural selection therefore requires an integrated view of how the interaction between the environment and development structures differences in morphology, performance, and fitness. Here we use naturally occurring environmental and maternal variation in the frog Bombina orientalis in South Korea to show that ovum size, average temperature, and variance in temperature during the early developmental period affect body sizes, shapes, locomotor performance, and ultimately the probability of an individual surviving interspecific predation in predictable but nonadditive ways. Specifically, environmental variability can significantly change the relationship between maternal investment in offspring and offspring fitness so that increased maternal investment can actually negatively affect offspring over a broad range of environments. Integrating environmental variation and developmental processes into traditional approaches of studying phenotypic variation and natural selection is likely to provide a more complete picture of the ecological context of evolutionary change.

AB  - Body size acts as a proxy for many fitness-related traits. Body size is also subject to directional selection from various anthropogenic stressors such as increasing water temperature, decreasing dissolved oxygen, fisheries, as well as natural predators. Changes in individual body size correlate with changes in fecundity, behaviour, and survival and can propagate through populations and ecosystems by truncating age and size structures and changing predator-prey dynamics. In this review, we will explore the causes and consequences of changing body size in fish in the light of recent literature and relevant theories. We will investigate the central role of body size in ecology by first discussing the main selective agents that influence body size: fishing, increasing water temperature, decreasing dissolved oxygen, and predation. We will then explore the impacts of these changes at the individual, population, and ecosystem levels. Considering the relatively high heritability of body size, we will discuss how a change in body size can leave a genetic signature in the population and translate to a change in the evolutionary potential of the species.

AB  - Key evolutionary events associated with invasion success are traditionally thought to occur in the introduced, rather than the native range of species. In the invasive ant Wasmannia auropunctata, however, a shift in reproductive system has been demonstrated within the native range, from the sexual non-dominant populations of natural habitats to the clonal dominant populations of human-modified habitats. Because abiotic conditions of human- modified habitats are hotter and dryer, we performed lab experiments on workers from a set of native and introduced populations, to investigate whether these ecological and genetic transitions were accompanied by a change in thermotolerance and whether such changes occurred before establishment in the introduced range. Thermotolerance levels were higher in native populations from human-modified habitats than in native populations from natural habitats, but were similar in native and introduced populations from human-modified habitats. Differences in thermotolerance could not be accounted for by differences in body size. A scenario based on local adaptation in the native range before introduction in remote areas represents the most parsimonious hypothesis to account for the observed phenotypic pattern. These findings highlight the importance of human land use in explaining major contemporary evolutionary changes.

AB  - Complex organismal traits such as body size are influenced by innumerable selective pressures, making the prediction of evolutionary trajectories for those traits difficult. A potentially powerful way to predict fitness in natural systems is to study the composite response of individuals in terms of performance measures, such as foraging or reproductive performance. Once key performance measures are identified in this top-down approach, we can determine the underlying physiological mechanisms and gain predictive power over long-term evolutionary processes. Here we use marine iguanas as a model system where body size differs by more than one order of magnitude between island populations. We identified foraging efficiency as the main performance measure that constrains body size. Mechanistically, foraging performance is determined by food pasture height and the thermal environment, influencing intake and digestion. Stress hormones may be a flexible way of influencing an individual's response to low-food situations that may be caused by high population density, famines, or anthropogenic disturbances like oil spills. Reproductive performance, on the other hand, increases with body size and is mediated by higher survival of larger hatchlings from larger females and increased mating success of larger males. Reproductive performance of males may be adjusted via plastic hormonal feedback mechanisms that allow individuals to assess their social rank annually within the current population size structure. When integrated, these data suggest that reproductive performance favors increased body size (influenced by reproductive hormones), with an overall limit imposed by foraging performance (influenced by stress hormones). Based on our mechanistic understanding of individual performances we predicted an evolutionary increase in maximum body size caused by global warming trends. We support this prediction using specimens collected during 1905. We also show in a common-garden experiment that body size may have a genetic component in iguanids. This 'performance paradigm' allows predictions about adaptive evolution in natural populations.

AB  - Background: Many animals rely on their escape performance during predator encounters. Because of its dependence on body size and temperature, escape velocity is fully characterized by three measures, absolute value, size-corrected value, and its response to temperature (thermal sensitivity). The primary target of the selection imposed by predators is poorly understood. We examined predator (dragonfly larva)-imposed selection on prey (newt larvae) body size and characteristics of escape velocity using replicated and controlled predation experiments under seminatural conditions. Specifically, because these species experience a wide range of temperatures throughout their larval phases, we predict that larvae achieving high swimming velocities across temperatures will have a selective advantage over more thermally sensitive individuals.
   Results: Nonzero selection differentials indicated that predators selected for prey body size and both absolute and size-corrected maximum swimming velocity. Comparison of selection differentials with control confirmed selection only on body size, i.e., dragonfly larvae preferably preyed on small newt larvae. Maximum swimming velocity and its thermal sensitivity showed low group repeatability, which contributed to non-detectable selection on both characteristics of escape performance.
   Conclusions: In the newt-dragonfly larvae interaction, body size plays a more important role than maximum values and thermal sensitivity of swimming velocity during predator escape. This corroborates the general importance of body size in predator-prey interactions. The absence of an appropriate control in predation experiments may lead to potentially misleading conclusions about the primary target of predator-imposed selection. Insights from predation experiments contribute to our understanding of the link between performance and fitness, and further improve mechanistic models of predator-prey interactions and food web dynamics.

AB  - We present the first fecundity and egg size data for three species of lithodid crab from Antarctic waters south of the Polar Front, caught in the fisheries operating around the island of South Georgia. In all species, fecundity was observed to increase with body size, but reproductive allocation was found to differ significantly between species. The highest relative fecundity (eggs(-g) body weight) and smallest egg size was found in Paralomis spinosissima, which is found in shallower waters, whereas the lowest relative fecundity values and largest eggs were recorded in the deeper living species, Neolithodes diomedeae. Evidence is presented that closely related sympatric species may employ quite different reproductive strategies that suit their depth distribution whilst indicating the overriding evolutionary adaptation of reproductive traits to temperature and food availability.

AB  - Two major goals of laboratory evolution experiments are to integrate from genotype to phenotype to fitness, and to understand the genetic basis of adaptation in natural populations. Here we demonstrate that both goals are possible by re-examining the outcome of a previous laboratory evolution experiment in which the bacteriophage G4 was adapted to high temperatures. We quantified the evolutionary changes in the thermal reaction norms-the curves that describe the effect of temperature on the growth rate of the phages-and decomposed the changes into modes of biological interest. Our analysis indicated that changes in optimal temperature accounted for almost half of the evolutionary changes in thermal reaction norm shape, and made the largest contribution toward adaptation at high temperatures. Genome sequencing allowed us to associate reaction norm shape changes with particular nucleotide mutations, and several of the identified mutations were found to be polymorphic in natural populations. Growth rate measures of natural phage that differed at a site that contributed substantially to adaptation in the lab indicated that this mutation also underlies thermal reaction norm shape variation in nature. In combination, our results suggest that laboratory evolution experiments may successfully predict the genetic bases of evolutionary responses to temperature in nature. The implications of this work for viral evolution arise from the fact that shifts in the thermal optimum are characterized by tradeoffs in performance between high and low temperatures. Optimum shifts, if characteristic of viral adaptation to novel temperatures, would ensure the success of vaccine development strategies that adapt viruses to low temperatures in an attempt to reduce virulence at higher ( body) temperatures.

AB  - Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is often assumed to reflect the phenotypic consequences of differential selection operating on each sex. Species that exhibit SSD may also show intersexual differences in other traits, including field-active body temperatures, preferred temperatures, and locomotor performance. For these traits, differences may be correlated with differences in body size or reflect sex-specific trait optima. Male and female Yarrow's spiny lizards, Sceloporus jarrovii, in a population in southeastern Arizona exhibit a difference in body temperature that is unrelated to variation in body size. The observed sexual variation in body temperature may reflect divergence in thermal physiology between the sexes. To test this hypothesis, we measured the preferred body temperatures of male and female lizards when recently fed and fasted. We also estimated the thermal sensitivity of stamina at seven body temperatures. Variation in these traits provided an opportunity to determine whether body size or sex-specific variation unrelated to size shaped their thermal physiology. Female lizards, but not males, preferred a lower body temperature when fasted, and this pattern was unrelated to body size. Larger individuals exhibited greater stamina, but we detected no significant effect of sex on the shape or height of the thermal performance curves. The thermal preference of males and females in a thermal gradient exceeded the optimal temperature for performance in both sexes. Our findings suggest that differences in thermal physiology are both sex- and size-based and that peak performance at low body temperatures may be adaptive given the reproductive cycles of this viviparous species. We consider the implications of our findings for the persistence of S.jarrovii and other montane ectotherms in the face of climate warming.

AB  - To test the general assumption that global warming will induce body size reduction in aquatic organisms, we used a system of lakes continually heated for six decades by warm water discharge from power plants. Their temperature elevation of 3-4 degrees C corresponds with climate change forecasts for the end of the 21st century. We compared body size and reproduction of Daphnia longispina complex communities inhabiting heated and non-heated (control) lakes nearby. No difference in body size was found, but Daphnia communities from heated lakes had a wider thermal breadth for reproduction. The two lake groups varied in the taxonomic composition of Daphnia communities. Thus, to disentangle inter- and intraspecific sources of variation, and to examine evolution vs. phenotypic plasticity of investigated traits, we performed two life history experiments: (1) a between-species experiment compared D. galeata inhabiting heated lakes with D. longispina typical of nearby control lakes, under three temperature regimes; (2) a within-species experiment compared D. galeata from heated lakes with conspecifics from high latitude (cold control) and low latitude (warm control) lakes, under two temperature regimes. The experiments revealed countergradient variation: environmental constraints on body size in situ concealed evolution of larger potential body size in Daphnia from heated lakes. In turn, evolution of increased body size plasticity resulted in an efficient resource allocation trade-off: more effective reproduction at high temperature, at the cost of size reduction. We suggest that large size is adaptive during active overwintering, while plastic size reduction is a coping strategy for high temperatures.

AB  - The evolutionary and phenotypic responses to environmental gradients are often assumed to be the same, a phenomenon known as "cogradientvariation" .However, only a few insect species display cogradient variation in physiological traits along a latitudinal gradient. We found evidence for such a response in the examination of the life history traits of the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi from 6 different geographical populations at 16, 19, 22, 24, 26 and 28 degrees C. Our results showed that larval and pupal development times significantly decreased as rearing temperature increased, and that growth rates were positively correlated with temperature. Body weight tended to decrease with increasing temperature, consistent with the general pattern in ectothermic animals. Larval development time was positively correlated with latitude, whereas the growth rate decreased as latitude increased, showing an example of latitudinal cogradient variation. Body weight significantly decreased with increasing latitude in a stepwise manner, showing a negative latitudinal body weight cline. Females were significantly larger than males, consistent with the female biased sex dimorphism in insects. Body weight tended to decrease with increasing rearing temperature, whereas the differences in sexual size dimorphism (SSD) tended to decrease with increasing body weight, which biased our results toward acceptance of Rensch's rule. We found that weight loss was an important regulator of SSD, and because male pupae lost significantly more weight at metamorphosis than female pupae, SSD was greater in adults than in pupae. Overall, our data provide a new example that a latitudinal cogradient variation in physiological traits is associated with a negative latitudinal body weight cline.

AB  - Life-history trade-offs and the costs of reproduction are central concepts in evolution and ecology. Episodic climatic events such as drought and extreme temperatures provide strong selective pressures that can change the balance of these costs and trade-offs. We used size-structured matrix models parameterized from field and laboratory studies to examine the effect of periodic drought on two species of aquatic salamanders (greater siren, Siren lacertina; lesser siren, Siren intermedia) that differ in size at reproduction and maximum body size. Post-drought body size distributions of the larger species (S. lacertina) are consistent with size-dependent mortality. Smaller individuals were extirpated from the population during each drought while large animals persisted, a pattern that contrasted with that seen in several ectotherms. This appears to be largely explained by estivation proficiency and a positive relationship between body size and estivation potential. Increased body size, however, may come at the cost of fecundity and maturation rate compared to a closely related congener. The cost of somatic allocation in this case may manifest itself via reduced per-capita competitive ability, which (at least in simulation studies) allows the smaller, fast-maturing species to outcompete the larger, slow-maturing species when drought is minimal or nonexistent.

AB  - There is increasing evidence for morphological change in response to recent environmental change, but how this relates to fluctuations in geographic range remains unclear. We measured museum specimens from two time periods (19021950 and 20002008) that vary significantly in climate to assess if and how two high elevation contracting species of ground squirrels in the Sierra Nevada of California, Belding's ground squirrel (Urocitellus beldingi) and the golden-mantled ground squirrel (Callospermophilus lateralis), and one lower elevation, stable species, the California ground squirrel (Otospermophilus beecheyi), have responded morphologically to changes over the last century. We measured skull length (condylobasal length), an ontogenetically more labile trait highly correlated with body size, and maxillary toothrow length, a more developmentally constrained trait predictive of skull shape. C. lateralis and U. beldingi, both obligate hibernators, have increased in body size, but have not changed in shape. In contrast, O. beecheyi, which only hibernates in parts of its range, has shown no significant change in either morphometric trait. The increase in body size in the higher elevation species, hypothesized to be a plastic effect due to a longer growing season and thus prolonged food availability, opposes the expected direction of selection for decreased body size under chronic warming. Our study supports that population contraction is related to physiological rather than nutritional constraints.

AB  - The studies of climatic-niche shifts over evolutionary time accompanied by key morphological innovations have attracted the interest of many researchers recently. We applied ecological niche models (ENMs), ordination method (environment principal component analyses; PCA-env), combined phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs), and phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) regression methods to analyze the realized niche dynamics and correspondingly key morphological innovations across clades within Scutiger boulengeri throughout their distributions in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) margins of China. Our results show there are six clades in S. boulengeri and obvious niche divergences caused by niche expansion in three clades. Moreover, in our system, niche expansion is more popular than niche unfilling into novel environmental conditions. Annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, and precipitation of driest month may contribute to such a shift. In addition, we identified several key climatic factors and morphological traits that tend to be associated with niche expansion in S. boulengeri clades correspondingly. We found phenotypic plasticity [i.e., length of lower arm and hand (LAHL), hind-limb length (HLL), and foot length (FL)] and evolutionary changes [i.e., snout-vent length (SVL)] may together contribute to niche expansion toward adapting novel niche, which provides us a potential pattern of how a colonizing toad might seed a novel habitat to begin the process of speciation and finally adaptive radiation. For these reasons, persistent phylogeographic divisions and accompanying divergences in niche occupancy and morphological adaption suggest that for future studies, distinct genetic structure and morphological changes corresponding to each genetic clade should be included in modeling niche evolution dynamics, but not just constructed at the species level.

AB  - Sites that display strong environmental contrasts in close proximity, such as 'Evolution Canyon' on Mt. Carmel, Israel, are natural theatres for investigating adaptive evolution in action. We reared Drosophila melanogaster from collection sites along altitudinal transects on the north- and south-facing canyon slopes in each of three temperature environments, and assessed genetic variation in ovariole number and body size between and within collection sites, and temperature plasticity. Both traits exhibited significant genetic variation within collection sites and phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature, but not genetic variation for plasticity. Between-site genetic variation in ovariole number was negatively correlated with altitude on both slopes of the canyon, and collections from the north- and south-facing slopes were genetically differentiated for male, but not female, body size. Genetic variation between sites within easy dispersal range is consistent with the action of strong natural selection, although neither the selective agent(s) nor the direct targets of selection are known.

AB  - Stichocotys peregrina (Riedel) contributes to paleoceanography as a valuable stratigraphic tool for correlation of deep-sea siliceous sediments in world oceans and as a paleoceanographic indicator. This paper documents the evolutionary morphologic changes of the S. peregrina lineage from the middle Miocene to late Pliocene in the eastern equatorial and eastern North Pacific (IODP Site U1335 and ODP Site 887, respectively). The size and shape changes show that there are at least two geographical variations in the S. peregrina lineage. In the eastern equatorial Pacific, two significant morphological shifts took place about 11.0 and 7.0 Ma, but the morphology remained relatively stable from 7.0 to 3.0 Ma. Coincident with morphological changes in the S. peregrina lineage were changes in biogenic productivity. These changes suggest that there is a close correspondence between major paleoceanographic events in the late Neogene and evolutionary changes of the S. peregrina lineage in the low latitudes. In the high latitudes, the ratio of the third segment to fourth segment in width and height showed a maximum from 9.5 to 8.0 Ma, and decreased stepwise at about 8.0 and 6.5 Ma. However, the radiolarian data in the high latitudes do not show a clear relationship between the paleoceanographic events and size variation of this lineage. The evolutionary transition from Stichocotys delmontensis to S. peregrina can be used as a primary biostratigraphic marker in the low latitudes. However, it is not easy to use the evolutionary transition for biostratigraphic correlation and age determination in the high latitudes, because there is no obvious change in the ratio of the third to fourth segment widths that can be used to distinguish S. delmontensis from the descendant S. peregrina.

AB  - Background: Therapeutic hypothermia gathers impetus in the developed world as a safe and effective therapy for term asphyxia[ encephalopathy. Although many questions stilt remain about the optimal application of hypothermic neuroprotection it is difficult to ignore the developing world where the prevalence of asphyxia[ encephalopathy is much higher. Experimental studies to optimize high tech cooling need to run in parallel with trials to determine the possible benefits of therapeutic hypothermia in low resource settings.
   Methods: We used a validated newborn piglet model of transient HI to determine (i) whether optimal neuroprotection occurs at different temperatures in the cortical and deep grey matter; (ii) the effect of body size on regional brain temperature under normothermia and hypothermia; (iii) the effect of insult severity on the therapeutic window duration; (iv) whether cooling using a water bottle is feasible. In this model hypoxia-ischaemia is induced by reversible occlusion of the common carotid arteries by remotely controlled vascular occluders; and simultaneous reduction in the inspired oxygen fraction to 0.12. Intensive care can be administered to the piglet maintaining metabolic and physiological homeostasis throughout the experiment, and cerebral energy metabolism is monitored continuously providing quantitative measures of the HI insult, latent phase and secondary energy failure using phosphorus-31 (P-31) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
   Results: (i) The optimal temperature for cooling was lower in the cortex than deep grey matter. (ii) Cerebral temperatures were body-weight dependent: a smaller body weight led to a lower brain temperature especially with selective head cooling. (iii) Latent-phase duration is inversely related to insult severity. (iv) Low tech, simple cooling methods using a water bottle can induce and maintain moderate hypothermia.
   Conclusions: Small shifts in brain temperature critically influence the survival of neuronal cells and body size critically influences brain-temperature gradients - smaller subjects have a larger surface area to brain volume and hence more heat is lost. The clinical implication is that smaller infants may require higher cap or body temperatures to avoid detrimental effects of over-zealous cooling. Latent-phase brevity may explain less effective neuroprotection individual and regional characteristics may increase the effectiveness of therapeutic hypothermia in the developed world. Low tech cooling methods using water bottles may be feasible although adequate staffing and monitoring would be required. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of static magnetic fields on body size of Drosophila melanogaster was analyzed on 3 laboratory stocks reared under chronic exposure to a magnetic field 10-12-fold greater than the earth's. A significant increase in body size was observed which persisted even when the flies were returned to control environmental conditions after a few generations of exposure. The genetic basis of the differences observed between treated and control lines was assessed analyzing 2 fitness components and 4 dimensional characters. The increase in body size was mainly associated with cell number, suggesting that the magnetic field effect on size depends on genes which control cell proliferation. The evolution of the fitness components during the generations of exposure gives some evidence of the underlying genetic mechanisms involved. Lines made isogenic for the 3 major chromosomes were tested to establish whether the size response obtained was dependent on the genetic variability or not. These lines behaved in a similar fashion to outbred lines, suggesting that the response in size depends on an increased mutation rate. A mutagenic test confirmed that one generation of exposure induces X-linked lethal mutations. These events could reflect the fact that the magnetic field acts as a physical mutagenic agent at some stage during development.

AB  - In our globally changing planet many species show range expansions whereby they encounter new thermal regimes that deviate from those of their source region. Pressing questions are to what extent and through which mechanisms, plasticity and/or evolution, species respond to the new thermal regimes and whether these trait changes are adaptive. Using a common-garden experiment, we tested for plastic and evolutionary trait changes in life history and a set of understudied biochemical/physiological traits during the range expansion of the damselfly Ischnura elegans from France into a warmer region in Spain. To assess the adaptiveness of the trait changes we used the phenotype of its native sister species in Spain, I. graellsii, as proxy for the locally adapted phenotype. While our design cannot fully exclude maternal effects, our results suggest that edge populations adapted to the local conditions in the newly invaded region through the evolution of a faster pace-of-life (faster development and growth rates), a smaller body size, a higher energy budget and increased expression levels of the heat shock gene DnaJ. Notably, based on convergence toward the phenotype of the native sister species and its thermal responses, and the fit with predictions of life history theory these potential evolutionary changes were likely adaptive. Nevertheless, the convergence toward the native sister species is incomplete for thermal plasticity in traits associated with anaerobic metabolism and melanization. Our results highlight that evolution might at least partly contribute in an adaptive way to the persistence of populations during range expansion into new thermal environments and should be incorporated when predicting and understanding species' range expansions.

AB  - The role of temperature is central to both organic evolution and ecological processes. However, how temperature affects selection on body size is unknown. We tested whether small seed beetles (Stator limbatus) have an advantage over large beetles during scramble competition for mates, and whether this advantage varies with temperature. Within lines of beetles artificially selected to be large versus small, small males have a significant advantage over large males in scramble competition for females because the former takeoff more quickly and thus reach females before larger males. Selection favouring small male body size is significantly ( and substantially) more intense at cooler temperatures. The adaptive significance of small male body size thus depends on ambient temperature.

AB  - Many latitudinal clines exist in Drosophila melanogaster: in adult body size, in allele frequency at allozyme loci, and in frequencies of common cosmopolitan inversions. The question is raised whether these latitudinal clines are causally related. This review aims to connect data from two very different fields of study, evolutionary biology and cell biology, in explaining such natural genetic variation in D. melanogaster body size and development time. It is argued that adult body size clines, inversion frequency clines, and clines in allele frequency at loci involved in glycolysis and glycogen storage are part of the same adaptive strategy. Selection pressure is expected to differ at opposite ends of the clines. At high latitudes, selection on D. melanogaster would favour high larval growth rate at low temperatures, and resource storage in adults to survive winter. At low latitudes selection would favour lower larval critical size to survive crowding, and increased male activity leading to high male reproductive success. Studies of the insulin-signalling pathway in D. melanogaster point to the involvement of this pathway in metabolism and adult body size. The genes involved in the insulin-signalling pathway are associated with common cosmopolitan inversions that show latitudinal clines. Each chromosome region connected with a large common cosmopolitan inversion possesses a gene of the insulin transmembrane complex, a gene of the intermediate pathway and a gene of the TOR branch. The hypothesis is presented that temperate D. melanogaster populations have a higher frequency of a 'thrifty' genotype corresponding to high insulin level or high signal level, while tropical populations possess a more 'spendthrift' genotype corresponding to low insulin or low signal level.

AB  - Ten isofemale lines of Zaprionus indianus were analysed to study the reaction norms of five morphometrical traits (wing and thorax length, body weight, sternopleural bristle and ovariole number) in relation to growth temperature. All these traits exhibited nonlinear concave reaction norms and were characterized by the coordinates of their maximum: MV (maximum value), and TMV (temperature of maximum value). Wing/thorax ratio, which is related to flight capacity, was also calculated and exhibited a monotonically decreasing reaction norm. Intraclass correlations were on average quite low, with no significant differences between traits, temperature or sex; a highly significant trait-temperature interaction was, however, observed. Sex dimorphism was very low in Zaprionus. contrasting with data previously obtained in other species. MVs among lines were positively correlated for the three size-related traits, whereas sternopleural bristle and ovariole number were genetically independent. TMVs were different between the traits, but higher than in D. melanogaster and other cold-adapted species, in agreement with the hypothesis that the norm shape evolves according to species thermal adaptation. MVs and TMVs were never correlated, indicating that mean values and plasticity are genetically independent. Some positive correlations were observed among TMVs of different traits, suggesting that the same genetic system might regulate plasticity of different traits.

AB  - Two sets of four replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster were selected for large and small thorax with controls. F1 progeny of crosses between the selected lines within each size category showed (a) a reduction in preadult viability in large lines relative to control and small lines when they were cultured at medium or high density in competition with a standard mutant marked competitor stock, and (b) an increase in larval development time in large lines relative to control and small lines. Natural selection for increased body size in adults may therefore be opposed by adverse effects on larval viability. The results are discussed in terms of the developmental mechanisms probably responsible for the change in body size. The preadult survival of the large and control lines was measured at three different temperatures, and there was no evidence for a significant interaction between size and temperature. The observed evolutionary increase in body size in response to reduced temperature in Drosophila must therefore involve either different genes from those subject to selection for size at a single temperature, or a fitness component other than preadult survival. There was no significant asymmetry in response to selection, and thorax length showed heterosis in crosses between the selected lines.

AB  - The position and shape of thermal performance curves (TPCs, the functions relating temperature to physiological performance) for ecologically relevant functions will directly affect the fitness of ectotherms and therefore should be under strong selection. However, thermodynamic considerations predict that relationships between the different components of the TPC will confound its evolutionary optimization. For instance, the "jack-of-all-temperatures" hypothesis predicts a trade-off between the breadth of the TPC and the maximal performance capacity; the "warmer is better" hypothesis suggests that low thermal optima will come with low absolute performances. Semi-aquatic organisms face the additional challenge of having to adjust their TPCs to two environments that are likely to differ in mean temperature and thermal variability. In this paper, we examine how parameters of the TPCs for maximal running and swimming speed have co-evolved in the semi-aquatic newt genus Triturus. We consider evolutionary relationships between the width and the height of the TPCs, the optimal temperatures and maximal performance. Phylogenetic comparative analyses reveal that in Triturus, swimming and running differ substantially in the (co-)variation of TPC parameters. Whereas evolutionary changes in the TPC for swimming primarily concern the shape of the curve (generalist versus specialist), most interspecific variation in running speed TPCs involves shifts in overall performance across temperatures.

AB  - All insect ovaries are composed of functional units called ovarioles, which contain sequentially developing egg chambers. The number of ovarioles varies between and within species. Ovariole number is an important determinant of fecundity and thus affects individual fitness. Although Drosophila oogenesis has been intensively studied, the genetic and cellular basis for determination of ovariole number remains unknown. Ovariole formation begins during larval development with the morphogenesis of terminal filament cells (TFCs) into stacks called terminal filaments (TFs). We induced changes in ovariole number in Drosophila melanogaster by genetically altering cell size and cell number in the TFC population, and analyzed TF morphogenesis in these ovaries to understand the cellular basis for the changes in ovariole number. Increasing TFC size contributed to higher ovariole number by increasing TF number. Similarly, increasing total TFC number led to higher ovariole number via an increase in TF number. By analyzing ovarian morphogenesis in another Drosophila species we showed that TFC number regulation is a target of evolutionary change that affects ovariole number. In contrast, temperature-dependent plasticity in ovariole number was due to changes in cell-cell sorting during TF morphogenesis, rather than changes in cell size or cell number. We have thus identified two distinct developmental processes that regulate ovariole number: establishment of total TFC number, and TFC sorting during TF morphogenesis. Our data suggest that the genetic changes underlying species-specific ovariole number may alter the total number of TFCs available to contribute to TF formation. This work provides for the first time specific and quantitative developmental tools to investigate the evolution of a highly conserved reproductive structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Uncovering genetic responses to selection in wild populations typically requires tracking individuals over generations and use of animal models. Our group monitored the body size of one Swiss Yellow Dung Fly (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae) field population over 15 years, including intermittent common-garden rearing in the laboratory to assess body size with minimized environmental and maximized genetic variation. Contrary to expectations based on repeated heritability and phenotypic selection assessments over the years (reported elsewhere), field body sizes declined by >10% and common-garden laboratory sizes by >5% from 1993 to 2009. Our results confirm the temperature-size rule (smaller when warmer) and, albeit entirely correlational, could be mediated by climate change, as over this period mean temperature at the site increased by 0.5 degrees C, although alternative systematic environmental changes cannot be entirely excluded. Monitoring genetic responses to selection in wild invertebrate populations is thus possible, though indirect, and wild populations may evolve in directions not consistent with strongly positive directional selection favoring large body size.

AB  - Aim Body size is a key trait linked to other life history traits and influences several individual-, community- and ecosystem-level characteristics, processes, functions and services. Ecological and evolutionary body size responses at the intra- and inter-specific level to thermal geographic gradients (e.g. latitudinal or altitudinal ones) are widely studied. Whether this temperature-size relationship remains true for community-wide body size is still largely unknown. Location Northern temperate region. Taxon Ground beetles (Carabidae). Methods We assessed the temperature-size relationships using data from 11 northern temperate locations, spanning 25 latitudinal degrees. Furthermore, we quantified the effects of potential competing factors, such as body size and habitat preference of carabid assemblages and sub-assemblages along urbanisation gradients, as well as the urban heat island (UHI) effect on this relationship. Results We found significant negative relationship between the community-wide mean body size and the geographical latitude (converse Bergmann cline) for the whole ground beetle assemblage and the sub-assemblages of large-bodied species. This relationship was stronger in the urban localities than in rural ones. For the sub-assemblages of small-sized species, the relationship was not significant. We found significant negative relationship between the community-wide mean body size and the latitude for the sub-assemblages of both the non-forest and the forest species, and these became stronger in the urban habitats. Main Conclusions Our results highlight the leading role of the individual body size and the UHI effect in determining the community-wide body size-latitude relationship in ground beetles.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the significance of the body weight of hens for their productive adaptability.  Under controlled warm environmental conditions (Temp.  32-degrees-C and R. H. 45 %).
   In the course of the investigation, the performance data from a lightweight (LL) and from a lightmedium (LM) hybrid laying hen population were recorded with 1977 laying hens.  Within these two hybrid populations a qualitatively genetic subdivision of weight populations a qualitatively genetic subdivision of weight was achieved with the dwarf gene on the one hand.  On the other hand an additional body weight variability based on additive genetic effects was obtained by positively assortative mating.
   Independently of the genetic structure of the animal material the high environmental temperature had the following effects:  1.  Body weight was reduced by 13.6 % on an average associated with a narrowing of the breast angle by 11.3 % as well as a non-significant reduction in shank length.
   2.  The average egg weight was reduced by 12 %, number of eggs by 19.5 % and egg mass by 28.8 %.
   The negative effect of heat stress increased with increasing age of the animals.  In general th high environmental temperature impaired the performance of the heavier hens more strongly than that of the lighter hens.
   The changes caused by the dwarf gene independently of the environmental temperature were as follows:  1.  There was a reduction of 28.5 % in body weight, associated with a marked reduction in shank length by 21.5 % and a non-significant increase in breast angle.
   2.  On an average egg weight was reduced by 5.4 %, number of eggs by 20.3 % and egg mass by 24.3 %.
   The following could be established with respect to the relationship among the traits of body conformation and with egg production.  1.  There was a very strong multiple relationship between shank length, breast angle and body weight ranging from B = .82 to .91 within each genetic and environmental group.  Under high environmental temperature there was a very small reduction in the relationship.
   2.  At both temperature levels and in all genetic groups the body weight was more strongly determined by the size of the body (shank length) (r = .77 to .91) than by its condition (breast angle) (r = .47 to .62).
   3.  The performance traits were mainly determined by body weight or shank length.
   4.  In general, the relationship between body weight and egg mass were non-linear in temperate as well as warm environments.  There were high differences among the magnitudes of temperate and warm environments were B = .35 and B = .07, respectively.
   The investigation permits the conclusion that a close relationship exists between the body weight of laying hens and their productive adaptability.  Consequently, a specific optimum body weight can be defined for the achievement of maximum performance potential within each environmental temperature; this is to be taken into consideration by breeders, specially when there are large differences among the environmental conditions.

AB  - The endangered Socorro Isopod, Thermosphaeroma thermophilum, is endemic to a single thermal spring in Socorro, NM. This species is cannibalistic, with males more cannibalistic than females, and with females and juveniles more vulnerable than males as prey. In 1990, the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, created the Socorro Isopod Propagation Facility (SIPF) near the natural habitat, Sedillo Spring (SS), to increase total population size and to examine the effects of habitat heterogeneity on population growth. We report the genetic and morphological effects of this experiment, using the natural population as a control. Captive subpopulations experienced bottlenecks of known intensity and duration, as well as different intensities of cannibalism. Using 57 AFLP markers, we show that in 6 years (1990-1996), captive subpopulations diverged significantly from the natural population. Also during this 6-year period, body lengths of captive isopods diverged nearly 2-fold from the natural population, evidently because cannibalism and thus selection favoring large size was more intense in captive subpopulations than in nature. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that cannibalism and the apparent response to selection on body size became variable among captive subpopulations when physical structure was added to three of the four SIPF pools in April 1997. As expected if cannibalism was the source of selection for large body size, by August 1998 (15 months = 7-8 generations), the rate at which body size increased became inversely proportional to the amount of physical structure within pools. Although we are unable to separate the specific effects of population subdivision and cannibalism, our results show that these conditions in combination caused rapid changes in genetic variation and the external morphology of these captive subpopulations. Our results have important implications for future attempts to manage and propagate endangered species.

AB  - 1. Physiological rates are heavily dependent on temperature and body size. Most current predictions of organisms' response to environmental warming are based on the assumption that key physiological rates such as metabolism and excretion scale independently with body size and temperature and will not evolve. However, temperature is a significant driver for phenotypic variability in the allometric scaling and thermal sensitivity of physiological rates within ectotherm species, suggesting that evolution may play a role in shaping these parameters.
   2. We common-reared six populations of western mosquitofish that have recently established (similar to 100 years ago) in geothermal springs along a broad thermal gradient (19-33 degrees C) to determine whether these scaling parameters are affected by evolutionary and/or plastic responses to warming over ecological timescales. Each population was reared at four different temperatures (23, 26, 30 and 32 degrees C). We measured routine metabolic and nitrogen excretion rates on mosquitofish across a wide body size range.
   3. We found evidence for plasticity, but not evolution, increasing the allometric scaling of metabolic rate with temperature. Plasticity in metabolism allometry reflected a decrease in thermal sensitivity at smaller body sizes.
   4. We found evidence for evolution of phenotypic plasticity on the allometry of excretion rate, reflecting evolutionary differences in how thermal sensitivity varies with body size across different populations.
   5. Evolutionary differences in excretion rate scaling did not influence the relationship between excretion and metabolism across rearing temperatures, suggesting that warming does not affect the balance between mosquitofish energy demands and nutrient recycling rates.

AB  - As a major part of fish larval diet in nature, copepods constitute an appropriate live prey for aquaculture purposes. Considering the difficulty of mastering copepod mass production, studies on their growth performance at different environmental conditions are needed to improve their productivity. In this study a new selective approach based on temperature control is proposed to improve the physiological (body size, fecundity and lipid storage) performance of copepods. The estuarine copepod Eurytemora affinis known to have a high genetic variance in temperature tolerance was used as a biological model. First two different copepod lines were obtained after long-term culture at constant cold (7 degrees C) and warm (20 degrees C) temperatures. Then both populations were transferred to a higher temperature of 24 degrees C appropriate for aquaculture use and followed during five generations. During the first two generations (F1-F2) of a cold-acclimated population, female body size and fecundity decreased significantly whereas the survival rate remained high. The high lipid content of this population was used by females to compensate the heat shock of more than 10 degrees C. However, the survival rate decreased dramatically in F3 but allowed the selection of robust individuals which progressively improved their fitness during the following generations. So, compared to the warm acclimated population, the cold acclimated one showed larger body size, higher fecundity and better lipid storage. After only five generations at 24 degrees C the cold-acclimated population showed a significant genetic gain in prosome length compared to the warm acclimated one.

AB  - Terrestrial isopods have evolved adaptations to reduce water loss, which is necessary for life in low humidity environments. However, the evolution of a waterproofed cuticle to prevent loss of water to the environment could also impede oxygen uptake from the environment. We therefore postulate an evolutionary trade-off between water retention and gas exchange in this group of soil animals. The outcome of this trade-off is expected to be affected by both differences across species (different types of lung) and differences within species (body size and resulting surface area to volume ratios). To test these ideas, we compared two sympatric isopods: Porcellio scaber and Oniscus asellus. While P. scaber possesses covered lungs typical for drier habitats, O. asellus has simple open respiratory fields which are in direct contact with external air. For each species, we assessed how individuals across a broad range in body size differed in their hypoxia and desiccation tolerance. In addition, we assessed how hypoxia and low humidity affected their thermal preference. We found clear effects of species identity and body size on tolerance to hypoxia and low humidity. Desiccation resistance was tightly linked to water loss rates (R2 = 0.96) and strongly resembled the interspecific pattern across 20 isopod species. However, our results did not support the postulated trade-off. Tolerance to hypoxia and low humidity covaried, both increasing with body size and being higher in P. scaber. Thermal preference was affected by both hypoxia and low humidity, but not by body size. Our study increases understanding of the ecophysiology of both species, which can be useful in explaining the geographical distribution and use of microhabitats of isopod species in a climate change context.

AB  - To maximize potential fitness, reproductive females should invest available resources in either larger propagules (egg and/or hatchling size) or more propagules (clutch size). Females may also enhance offspring performance by selecting nest sites with optimal conditions for the developing eggs. This study examined maternal investment in a population of spotted turtles (Clemmys guttata) in Ontario, Canada over 2 y using radio telemetry, x-ray photography, and indirect assessments of hatchling fitness. Analyses were conducted at 2 scales (clutch and female), utilizing 2 measures of available resources (body size and body condition). Larger females produced wider eggs, and similarity in the slopes of egg width and maternal pelvic aperture on body size may indicate a physical constraint on egg size. However, body size did not explain variation in egg morphometrics (length, width, or mass) when considering the reproductive output of each female over the entire study. Instead, females in better body condition produced more eggs. With respect to nest site selection, no selection for thermal properties was observed, and females exhibited stronger fidelity to nest substrates than to nest locations. Hatchling righting response was not related to hatchling body size or condition, but hatchlings from a clutch performed similarly, indicating maternal genetic effects or an effect of nest conditions. Thus, females in good condition maximize the number of eggs produced over multiple years, and hatchling morphometrics may not directly influence hatchling success.

AB  - Previous analyses of evolutionary patterns, or modes, in fossil lineages have focused overwhelmingly on three simple models: stasis, random walks, and directional evolution. Here we use likelihood methods to fit an expanded set of evolutionary models to a large compilation of ancestor-descendant series of populations from the fossil record. In addition to the standard three models, we assess more complex models with punctuations and shifts from one evolutionary mode to another. As in previous studies, we find that stasis is common in the fossil record, as is a strict version of stasis that entails no real evolutionary changes. Incidence of directional evolution is relatively low (13%), but higher than in previous studies because our analytical approach can more sensitively detect noisy trends. Complex evolutionary models are often favored, overwhelmingly so for sequences comprising many samples. This finding is consistent with evolutionary dynamics that are, in reality, more complex than any of the models we consider. Furthermore, the timing of shifts in evolutionary dynamics varies among traits measured from the same series. Finally, we use our empirical collection of evolutionary sequences and a long and highly resolved proxy for global climate to inform simulations in which traits adaptively track temperature changes over time. When realistically calibrated, we find that this simple model can reproduce important aspects of our paleontological results. We conclude that observed paleontological patterns, including the prevalence of stasis, need not be inconsistent with adaptive evolution, even in the face of unstable physical environments.

AB  - In animals, behavioural responses may play an important role in determining population persistence in the face of environmental changes. Body size is a key trait central to many life-history traits and behaviours. Correlations with body size may constrain behavioural variation in response to environmental changes, especially when size itself is influenced by environmental conditions. Urbanization is an important human-induced rapid environmental change that imposes multiple selection pressures on both body size and (size-constrained) behaviour. How these combine to shape behavioural responses of urban-dwelling species is unclear. Using web building, an easily quantifiable behaviour linked to body size and the garden spider Araneus diadematus as a model, we evaluated direct behavioural responses to urbanization and body size constraints across a network of 63 selected populations differing in urbanization intensity. We additionally studied urbanization at two spatial scales to account for some environmental pressures varying across scales and to obtain first qualitative insights about the role of plasticity and genetic selection. Spiders were smaller in highly urbanized sites (local scale only), in line with expectations based on reduced prey biomass availability and the Urban Heat Island effect. Web surface and mesh width decreased with urbanization at the local scale, while web surface also increased with urbanization at the landscape scale. The latter two responses are expected to compensate, at least in part, for reduced prey biomass availability in cities. The use of multivariate mixed modelling reveals that although web traits and body size are correlated within populations, behavioural responses to urbanization do not appear to be constrained by size: there is no evidence of size-web correlations among populations or among landscapes, and web traits appear independent from each other. Our results demonstrate that responses in size-dependent behaviours may be decoupled from size changes, thereby allowing fitness maximization in novel environments. The spatial scale at which traits respond suggests contributions of both genetic adaptation (for web investment) and plasticity (for mesh width). Although fecundity decreased with local-scale urbanization, A. diadematus abundances were similar across urbanization gradients; behavioural responses thus appear overall successful at the population level.

AB  - We examined the evolutionary and developmental responses of body size to temperature in Drosophila melanogaster, using replicated lines of flies that had been allowed to evolve for 5 yr at 25 degrees C or at 16.5 degrees C. Development and evolution at the lower temperature both resulted in higher thorax length and wing area. The evolutionary effect of temperature on wing area was entirely a consequence of an increase in cell area. The developmental response was mainly attributable to an increase in cell area, with a small effect on cell number in males. Given its similarity to the evolutionary response, the increase in body size and cell size resulting from development at low temperature may be a case of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. The pattern of plasticity did not evolve in response to temperature for any of the traits. The selective advantage of the evolutionary and developmental responses to temperature is obscure and remains a major challenge for future work.

AB  - Harvesting may be a potent driver of demographic change and contemporary evolution, which both may have great impacts on animal populations. Research has focused on changes in phenotypic traits that are easily quantifiable and for which time series exist, such as size, age, sex, or gonad size, whereas potential changes in behavioural traits have been under-studied. Here, we analyse potential drivers of long-term changes in a behavioural trait for the Northeast Arctic stock of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, namely choice of spawning location. For 104years (1866-1969), commercial catches were recorded annually and reported by county along the Norwegian coast. During this time period, spawning ground distribution has fluctuated with a trend towards more northerly spawning. Spawning location is analysed against a suite of explanatory factors including climate, fishing pressure, density dependence, and demography. We find that demography (age or age at maturation) had the highest explanatory power for variation in spawning location, while climate had a limited effect below statistical significance. As to potential mechanisms, some effects of climate may act through demography, and explanatory variables for demography may also have absorbed direct evolutionary change in migration distance for which proxies were unavailable. Despite these caveats, we argue that fishing mortality, either through demographic or evolutionary change, has served as an effective driver for changing spawning locations in cod, and that additional explanatory factors related to climate add no significant information.

AB  - Latitudinal and elevational trends in body size are found in numerous animal taxa, with various adaptive explanations proposed. It is however debatable whether geographic trends in adult body size are accompanied by corresponding differences in juvenile growth rate (= mass gain per unit time). Respective studies have been complicated by conceptual and methodological problems related to defining and measuring this variable, particularly in organisms with discontinuous growth like arthropods. Using an original method for estimating differential (instantaneous) juvenile growth rates, we compared geographically distant European populations of six insect species in a common garden experiment. We found no among population differences in differential growth rate in any of the species. This result is in concert with concurrent increase in both adult size and developmental time towards the south. While opposite examples exist, we interpret our results as challenging the view that growth rate is a trait that readily responds to environmentally based selective pressures. Our results thus advocate the more classical view of growth rate maximisation within its physiological limits. We discuss the advantages of using differential (rather than integral) measures of growth rate in evolutionary ecological studies and evaluate the reasons for the detected latitudinal trends in life history traits.

AB  - Whether or not biogeographic rules dealing with spatial patterns of animal body sizes are valid for ectotherms is controversial. As the ectotherms grow all their lives, we explored the role of age and annual growth rate in body size variation in Phrynocephalus przewalskii in northern China. Morphological data were collected from 11 populations across a broad geographic gradient. Correlations between age, sex, climatic factors, and body size were analyzed using generalized linear model (GLM) and generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). GLM analysis indicated that the general body size of both sexes and the appendage size of females increased significantly with increasing temperature; however, the coefficient of determination was very small. GLMM analysis indicated that body size only correlated with age, whereas appendage size was affected by age, temperature, rainfall, and sunshine. Annual growth rates were positively correlated with temperature. We concluded that body size variation was mainly caused by age structure and plasticity of the growth rate in P. przewalskii and did not follow Bergmann's rule; however, females followed Allen's rule. Future studies to investigate the effect of energy restriction are needed to further understand the relationship between growth rate and body size. We also suggest that further studies on thermal advantage and sexual selection may be helpful to understand appendage size variation in P. przewalskii.

AB  - Phenotypic variation along environmental gradients-particularly in body size-occurs in a variety of species. Larger-bodied individuals are usually found in colder climates, as predicted by Bergmann's rule. In ectotherms, this pattern remains controversial. Among thermoconformers, smaller body sizes are expected in colder climates because these species might have relatively shorter warm-up times (advantageous in cold climates), whereas the reverse pattern can be expected in thermoregulators (heat-balance hypothesis). In amphibians, additional factors like humidity and thermal niche might also contribute to body-size variation. Following Allen's rule, there can also be a negative relationship between temperature and relative limb length. Here, we described associations among temperature, precipitation, body size, and relative limb length in Calotriton asper. We expected individuals from higher elevations (colder climates) to be smaller when compared to lowelevation conspecifics. We found an influence of temperature on body-size variation but, contrary to expectations, salamanders from colder climates were larger compared to low-elevation populations, which corroborates with the heat-balance hypothesis. In accordance with the converse water-availability hypothesis, we also demonstrated that precipitation was related to body-size variation in this species. Finally, our results supported the predictions of Allen's rule. This trend could be the result of evolutionary responses to harsh environments, driven by either local adaptation, plasticity processes, or a combination of both.

AB  - One of the most important research topics in evolutionary ecology is body size evolution. Actually, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the many observed patterns-also known as "rules"aEuro"of body size variation in across latitude, temperature, and time. The temperature-size rule (TSR), describes an inverse relationship between body size and temperature. We took advantage of the "natural laboratory" that the crustacean populations at the Chilean altiplano offers, to study the TSR in ostracods. We studied three populations of Limnocythere atacamae that are physically separated by several kilometers, and differ mainly by their permanent thermal regime. We found larger individuals in the hotspring compared to the cold ponds. Also, in the hotspring we found a significant quadratic selection coefficient, suggesting stabilizing selection in this population. The fitness profiles showed stabilizing selection in the hotspring, and positive directional selection in the ponds. Our results suggest the existence of an optimal body size above the population means. This optimal size is apparently attained in the hotspring population. Then, natural selection appears to be promoting a shift in the mean phenotype that, for some reason, is not attained in the cold environments. Genetic slippage and population bottleneck would explain this absence of response to selection.

AB  - Similar phenotypes evolve under equivalent environmental conditions through parallel evolution. Because they have repeatedly invaded and adapted to new freshwater environments, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) offers a powerful system for understanding the agents of selection in nature that drive parallel evolution. Here, we examine the ecological and environmental variables responsible for morphological variation in three-spined stickleback populations across its European range. We collected fish from 85 populations, encompassing much of the European latitudinal range of the species and including lowland rivers and lakes, coastal lagoons and moorland ponds. We measured biotic and environmental variables at all sites along with morphological traits for 2,358 individuals. Using an information theory approach, we identified body size, minimum average winter temperature and pH as primary predictors of stickleback armour evolution, challenging current hypotheses for stickleback morphological diversification and demonstrating the fundamental role played by body size and scaling in mediating responses to selection. Stickleback lateral plate phenotype represents a potentially powerful tool for monitoring change in climate variables across the northern temperate region.

AB  - Geographical populations of six Indian tropical drosophilids exhibited significant positive latitudinal correlations for body size (r = 0.92-0.99) and desiccation tolerance (r = 0.86-0.99): and for starvation tolerance there were significant negative correlations (r = -0.93 to -0.99). The extent of starvation as well as desiccation tolerance is significantly higher for species characterized by large body size (Drosophila repleta and Zapriomus indianus) in comparison with other Sophophoran species. For both traits. all the six species demonstrate significantly variable positive slope values for desiccation tolerance and negative slope values for starvation tolerance. Regression analysis of climatic data demonstrated a major role of coefficient of variation of mean monthly temperature (T-CV) and rainfall for higher desiccation tolerance of northern subtropical populations. For south Indian populations of ail six drosophilids, higher starvation tolerance could be selected due to T-min, higher metabolic stress in relation with smaller body size and higher population density and competition under tropical climatic conditions. Thr present data contrast with correlated selection response between these traits on the basis of laboratory selections. However, starvation and desiccation tolerance evolve as independent traits in geographical populations of these six tropical drosophilids; and such traits are significantly correlated with body size although in opposite directions. Furthermore, laboratory selection experiments demonstrated no change in body size whereas, under wild conditions, significant correlated body size changes are evident across populations as well as species. Present data suggest correlated selection pressure on body size and traits conferring resistance to climatic stress.

AB  - In temperate areas, seasonal changes entail a source of environmental variation potentially important for organisms. Temperate ectotherms may be adapted to the seasonal fluctuations in environmental traits. For lizards, behavioural adaptations regarding microhabitat selection could arise to improve thermoregulation during the different seasons. However, little is still known about which traits influence microhabitat selection of lizards and their adaptation to seasonality. Here we used Podarcis guadarramae to study the role of potential intrinsic (body size, sex, age) and environmental traits (air and substrate temperatures, wind speed, and sunlight) in the seasonal changes of body temperatures and microhabitat selection of lizards. We measured body temperatures of lizards in the same habitat during the four seasons and compared the climatic variables of the microhabitats selected by lizards with the mean climatic conditions available in their habitat. Body temperatures were similar for adult males, adult females, and juveniles within each season, being significantly higher in summer than in the other seasons, and in spring than in winter. The same pattern was found regarding substrate and air temperatures of the selected microhabitats. Wind speed and air temperature did not affect body temperatures, while body length was marginally significant and substrate temperatures and season did affect the body temperatures of lizards. Our results during the whole year support the idea that the seasonality could be the most important factor affecting body temperatures of these temperate species. Regarding micro habitat selection, environmental constraints, as environmental temperatures and wind speed, affected the seasonal changes on behavioural thermoregulation of lizards. This effect was similar between sexes and age classes, and was independent of body size. In addition, importance of sunlight exposure of the selected microhabitats (full sun, filtered sun, or shade) also changed between seasons. Hence, environmental constraints were the main forces driving seasonal changes in microhabitat selection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study was carried out to study the diet type, genetic, morphometric and histological variations between two natural populations of Trachylepis quinquetaeniata inhabiting Abu-Rawash, Embaba, North Giza and Garfas-Senoures, El-Faiyum habitats. In this study, morphometric examination showed that Trachylepis quinquetaeniata is a typically ground-dwelling Skink and seems to be frequently associated with grass and below shrubs. Geographic variation in sexual size dimorphism (SSD) and head size dimorphism (HSD) with greater dimensions in Garfas-Senoures, El-Faiyum compared with Abu-Rawash, Embaba, North Giza might be correlated with spatial food availability and abundance or micro-evolutionary change or phenotypic plasticity. Also, the increase of body size and mass in individuals from Garfas-Senoures, El-Faiyum might be an adaptation to lower ambient temperature and hypoxia. Diet analysis showed that the bulk of gut contents were beetles, plant bugs, hymenopterans and dipterans. The remainder of the plant material was probably ingested secondarily. Moreover, the increase in the activity of Ldh in liver tissues of T. quinquetaeniata inhabiting Abu-Rawash, Embaba, North Giza could be confirmed by the significant increase in the accumulation of the total lipids in liver and muscle tissues than that in the other population. As well as, a marked degeneration, necrosis and desquamation of spermatogoneal cells lining seminiferous tubules in testes of T. quinquetaeniata inhabiting Garfas-Senoures, El-Faiyum than that in the other population inhabiting Abu-Rawash, Embaba, North Giza that could be attributed to the bioaccumulation of soil heavy metals in testes. Higher carbohydrate accumulation in the former lizards' population was confirmed by the high availability and diversity of diet in El-Faiyum habitat. Thus we concluded that T. quinquetaeniata inhabiting Abu-Rawash, Embaba, North Giza is more active, energetic and adaptable in its habitat than T. quinquetaeniata inhabiting Garfas-Senoures, El-Faiyum.

AB  - Body size of many animals increases with increasing latitude, a phenomenon known as Bergmann's rule (Bergmann clines). Latitudinal gradients in mean temperature are frequently assumed to be the underlying cause of this pattern because temperature covaries systematically with latitude, but whether and how temperature mediates selection on body size is unclear. To test the hypothesis that the "relative" advantage of being larger is greatest at cooler temperatures we compare the fitness of replicate lines of the seed beetle, Stator limbatus, for which body size was manipulated via artificial selection ("Large," "Control," and "Small" lines), when raised at low (22 degrees C) and high (34 degrees C) temperatures. Large-bodied beetles (Large lines) took the longest to develop but had the highest lifetime fecundity, and highest fitness (r(c)), at both low and high temperatures. However, the relative difference between the Large and Small lines did not change with temperature (replicate 2) or was greatest at high temperature (replicate 1), contrary to the prediction that the fitness advantage of being large relative to being small will decline with increasing temperature. Our results are consistent with two previous studies of this seed beetle, but inconsistent with prior studies that suggest that temperature-mediated selection on body size is a major contributor to the production of Bergmann clines. We conclude that other environmental and ecological variables that covary with latitude are more likely to produce the gradient in natural selection responsible for generating Bergmann clines.

AB  - Microwave assisted electric arc furnace technology is a new steelmaking technology under development at Michigan Technological University. This technology is a revolutionary change from the current technology. It is achieved through the combination of microwave, electric arc and exothermal heating. This technology can produce molten steel directly from a shippable agglomerate (green ball) consisting of iron oxide concentrate, coal, and fluxing agent without the intermediate steps of coking, sintering, Blast Furnace (BF) ironmaking, and Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) steelmaking. The unique aspect of this technology utilizes the advantages of rapid volumetric heating, high energy efficiency, and chemical reaction acceleration through the use of microwaves. The viability of the technology lies in the fact that iron ore and carbon are excellent microwave absorbers. This new, simplified process translates into less capital cost, higher productivity, less environmental pollution and treatment cost, higher energy efficiency, and lower production cost.

AB  - Color polymorphic animals offer a unique system for studying intraspecific phenotypic responses to climate change. Discrete color morphs are easy to identify, and correlated trait responses of morphs can indicate how climate warming may facilitate long-term maintenance of polymorphisms. We use a historical dataset spanning 43 years to examine temporal shifts in color morph frequency and body size in response to climate in the Eastern Red-backed Salamander, Plethodon cinereus, which contains a widespread striped/unstriped color polymorphism. We created a pipeline to extract high-throughput trait data from fluid-preserved museum specimens where we batch-photographed salamanders, de-aggregated individual specimens from photographs, and solicited help of community scientists to score color morphs. We used a linear modeling framework that includes information about spatial population structure to demonstrate that color morph frequency and body size vary in response to climate, elevation, and over time, with an overall trend of higher frequency and decreased body size of the striped morph, but increased size of the unstriped morph. These surprising results suggest that morphs may be responding to multiple climate and geographic drivers through co-adapted morphological changes. This work highlights new practices of extracting trait data from museum specimens to demonstrate species phenotypes response to climate change.

AB  - 1. Reaction norms for size and age at maturity were studied in Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera, Geometridae). Growth rates were manipulated by rearing larvae on different levels of food quality and quantity, and instar-specific final weights and development times were recorded.
   2. Food level and initial weight of an instar accounted for most of the variance in final weights. Sexual dimorphism in pupal weights could be entirely ascribed to sex differences in initial weights of the last instar.
   3. There were problems with considering the reaction norms optimal within the conventional demographic explanatory framework. Because fecundity increases linearly with body size and no costs of large adult size are known, one should expect female larvae to grow larger to increase their individual fitness. It is therefore likely that constraints play a major role in the determination, and evolution, of size in this species.
   4. A focus on individual instars may be the best way to reveal the constraints on, and space for, adaptive evolution of insect growth. Some limit to the initial:final weight ratio of an instar, and the fixed number of instars, may represent important constraints.
   5. Reaction norms like the ones described in this study lead to strong environmental determination rather than canalization of body size. Food quality throughout larval development may thus be very important for individual fitness and population dynamics in E. autumnata.

AB  - Understanding how natural environments shape phenotypic variation is a major aim in evolutionary biology. Here, we have examined clinal, likely genetically based variation in morphology among 19 populations of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) from Africa and Europe, spanning a range from sea level to 3000 m altitude and including locations approximating the southern and northern range limit. We were interested in testing whether latitude and altitude have similar phenotypic effects, as has often been postulated. Both latitude and altitude were positively correlated with wing area, ovariole number, and cell number. In contrast, latitude and altitude had opposite effects on the ratio between ovariole number and body size, which was negatively correlated with egg production rate per ovariole. We also used transgenic manipulation to examine how increased cell number affects morphology and found that larger transgenic flies, due to a higher number of cells, had more ovarioles, larger wings, and, unlike flies from natural populations, increased wing loading. Clinal patterns in morphology are thus not a simple function of changes in body size; instead, each trait might be subject to different selection pressures. Together, our results provide compelling evidence for profound similarities as well as differences between phenotypic effects of latitude and altitude.

AB  - DNA sequence variation is abundant In wild populations. While molecular biologists use genetically homogeneous strains of model organisms to avoid this variation, evolutionary biologists embrace genetic variation as the material of evolution since heritable differences in fitness drive evolutionary change. Yet, the relationship between the phenotypic variation affecting fitness and the genotypic variation producing it is complex. Genetic buffering mechanisms modify this relationship by concealing the effects of genetic and environmental variation on phenotype. Genetic buffering allows the build-up and storage of genetic variation in phenotypically normal populations. When buffering breaks down, thresholds governing the expression of previously silent variation are crossed. At these thresholds, phenotypic differences suddenly appear and are available for selection. Thus, buffering mechanisms modulate evolution and regulate a balance between evolutionary stasis and change. Recent work provides a glimpse of the molecular details governing some types of genetic buffering. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Predicting the spread of invasive species is a challenge for modern ecology. Although many invasive species undergo genetic bottlenecks during introduction to new areas resulting in a loss of genetic diversity, successful invaders manage to flourish in novel environments either because of pre-adaptations or because important traits contain adaptive variation enabling rapid adaptation to changing conditions. To predict and understand invasion success, it is crucial to analyse these features. We assessed the potential of a well-known invader, the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), to expand north of its current range in Europe. A short growing season and harsh overwintering conditions are apparent limiting factors for this species' range. By rearing full-sib families from four geographically distinct populations (Russia, Estonia, Poland, Italy) at two fluctuating temperature regimes, we investigated (a) possible differences in survival, development time, and body size among populations and (b) the amount of adaptive variation within populations in these traits. All populations were able to complete their development in cooler conditions than in their current range. A significant genotype-environment interaction for development time and body size suggests the presence of adaptive genetic variation, indicating potential to adapt to cooler conditions. The northernmost population had the highest survival rates and fastest development times on both temperature regimes, suggesting pre-adaptation to cooler temperatures. Other populations had minor differences in development times. Interestingly, this species lacks the classical trade-off between body size and development time which could have contributed to its invasion potential. This study demonstrates the importance of considering both ecological and evolutionary aspects when assessing invasion risk.

AB  - Background: Genetically based body size differences are naturally occurring in populations of Drosophila melanogaster, with bigger flies in the cold. Despite the cosmopolitan nature of body size clines in more than one Drosophila species, the actual selective mechanisms controlling the genetic basis of body size variation are not fully understood. In particular, it is not clear what the selective value of cell size and cell area variation exactly is. In the present work we determined variation in viability, developmental time and larval competitive ability in response to crowding at two temperatures after artificial selection for reduced cell area, cell number and wing area in four different natural populations of D. melanogaster.
   Results: No correlated effect of selection on viability or developmental time was observed among all selected populations. An increase in competitive ability in one thermal environment (18 C) under high larval crowding was observed as a correlated response to artificial selection for cell size.
   Conclusion: Viability and developmental time are not affected by selection for the cellular component of body size, suggesting that these traits only depend on the contingent genetic makeup of a population. The higher larval competitive ability shown by populations selected for reduced cell area seems to confirm the hypothesis that cell area mediated changes have a relationship with fitness, and might be the preferential way to change body size under specific circumstances.

AB  - The environmental temperatures preferred or selected by postlarval black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon (body weight 84 +/- 25 mg and body length 2.66 +/- 0.21 cm, mean +/- s.d.) acclimatized to 16, 20, 24, 28, 32 or 36 degrees C, were determined in a horizontal gradient (17-37 degrees C). The results indicated that the crustaceans were competent in detecting thermal discontinuities and in showing preference. The mean temperature selected by the postlarvae rose from 20.0 degrees C to 25.6 degrees C and the mode from 15 degrees C to 27 degrees C when the acclimation temperature was increased from 16 degrees C to 36 degrees C. The preferred temperature of the shrimp was not significantly different among the groups acclimatized at 24 degrees C, 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C. The final preferendum of the shrimp was estimated to be 23.2 degrees C, which is considerably lower than the optimal growth temperature for the species.

AB  - Models that predict organismal and population responses to climate change may be improved by considering ecological factors that affect species thermal tolerance. Species differences in microhabitat use can expose animals to diverse thermal selective environments at a given site and may cause sympatric species to evolve different thermal tolerances. We tested the hypothesis that species differences in body size and microhabitat use (above- vs. below-ground activity) would correspond to differences in thermal tolerance (maximum critical temperatures: CTmax). Thermal buffering effects of soil can reduce exposure to extreme high temperatures for below-ground active species. We predicted larger-bodied individuals and species would have higher CTmax and that species mean CTmax would covary positively with degree of above-ground activity. We used Neotropical army ants (Formicidae: Ecitoninae) as models. Army ants vary in microhabitat use from largely subterranean to largely above-ground active species and are highly size polymorphic. We collected data on above- and below-ground temperatures in habitats used by army ants to test for microhabitat temperature differences, and we conducted CTmax assays for army ant species with varying degrees of surface activity and with different body sizes within and between species. We then tested whether microhabitat use was associated with species differences in CTmax and whether microhabitat was a better predictor of CTmax than body size for species that overlapped in size. Microhabitat use was a highly significant predictor of species' upper thermal tolerance limits, both for raw data and after accounting for the effects of phylogeny. Below-ground species were more thermally sensitive, with lower maximum critical temperatures (CTmax). The smallest workers within each species were the least heat tolerant, but the magnitude of CTmax change with body size was greater in below-ground species. Species-typical microhabitat was a stronger predictor of CTmax than body size for species that overlapped in size. Compared to the soil surface, 10-cm subsoil was a significantly moderated thermal environment for below-ground army ants, while maximum surface raid temperatures sometimes exceeded CTmax for the most thermally sensitive army ant castes. We conclude sympatric species differences in thermal physiology correspond to microhabitat use. These patterns should be accounted for in models of species and community responses to thermal variation and climate change.

AB  - The relation between oxygen consumption rate and larval growth rate in Drosophila melanogaster at different temperatures and food levels was analyzed to investigate whether different larval growth rates and adult body sizes are the consequences of different costs of growth. Four isofemale lines from two populations collected from France and Tanzania were compared. The rate of oxygen consumption per mg body weight increased with the relative rate of growth. Costs of growth (C-g), i.e., the increase in oxygen consumption due to growth, took 17.4% of the total energy invested in growth. No significant effect on C-g could be shown of either temperature or food level. Basal metabolic rate (R-b), i.e., the rate of oxygen consumption in the absence of growth, increased with temperature and food level at the intermediate temperature. The two French lines showed a higher rate of growth, independent of the environmental conditions, leading to a larger final body size. The two Tanzanian lines show a reduced C-g as compared to the French lines at 27.5 degrees C, while showing no such difference at 17.5 degrees C and 22.5 degrees C. Yet, these differences in C-g do not lead to clear differences in growth efficiency between populations, indicating that differences in absorption rate are the main cause of both environmental and genetic differences in growth rate.

AB  - Patterns of geographic variation in body size are predicted to evolve as adaptations to local environmental gradients. However, many of these clinal patterns in body size, such as Bergmann's rule, are controversial and require further investigation into ectotherms such as reptiles on a regional scale. To examine the environmental variables (temperature, precipitation, topography and primary productivity) that shaped patterns of geographic variation in body size in the reptile Calotes versicolor, we sampled 180 adult specimens (91 males and 89 females) at 40 locations across the species range in China. The MANOVA results suggest significant sexual size dimorphism in C. versicolor (F-23,F-124 = 11.32, p < .001). Our results showed that C. versicolor failed to fit the Bergmann's rule. We found that the most important predictors of variation in body size of C. versicolor differed for males and females, but mechanisms related to heat balance and water availability hypotheses were involved in both sexes. Temperature seasonality, precipitation of the driest month, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of the driest quarter were the most important predictors of variation in body size in males, whereas mean precipitation of the warmest quarter, mean temperature of the wettest quarter, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of the wettest month were most important for body size variation in females. The discrepancy between patterns of association between the sexes suggested that different selection pressures may be acting in males and females.

AB  - The growth and demise of glaciers during the Late Paleozoic ice age had profound consequences on the marine biota. In central western Argentina the transition from glacial to non-glacial interval during the Pennsylvanian, caused a major regional turnover which remodeled the bathymetric diversity gradient. In order to understand the nature of the environmental changes related to such turnover event, we compared selectivity patterns in extirpation and immigration of bivalves and brachiopods using logistic regression. We tested for a wide range of potential drivers of extirpation and immigration, namely body size, geographic range size, environmental breadth, preferred depth, metabolic rates, infaunalism and taxonomic identity. While extirpation preferentially hit brachiopods and genera having smaller geographic ranges and smaller body sizes, immigration was related to genera with preference for deeper environment and small geographic ranges.
   Extirpation selectivity was not uniform along the bathymetric gradient. Both geographic range and body size selectivity are stronger towards deeper environments. Each Glade, on the other hand, showed idiosyncratic responses to climate change. While brachiopods show extirpation selectivity for smaller geographic ranges, small sized bivalves were preferentially extirpated. These contrasting selectivity regimes, however, could be reflecting different faunal responses to the same environmental changing factor, namely higher thermal amplitude. Immigration in both brachiopods and bivalves was related to preference to deep environments, confirming previous results. However, brachiopods also showed preferential immigration of small geographic range genera, which is puzzling given the extinction selectivity related to the glacial non-glacial transition. Possible explanations point to a brief time span in which an increase in thermal amplitude occurred. The rapid climate changes, particularly related to a rise in maximum temperatures, lead the ecological response of the benthic faunas. Differences in extinction and immigration selectivity along the bathymetric gradient, suggest that the turnover event also remodeled the bathymetric gradient in body size and biogeographic structure and brachiopod:bivalve proportions. Such changes were driven by extirpation, contrasting with the remodeling of the bathymetric diversity gradient that was driven by immigration. Our results, therefore, highlight that immigration and extirpation can shape different aspects of the bathymetric biotic gradient.

AB  - Variation in the subtle differences between the right and left sides of bilateral characters or fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been considered as an indicator of an organism's ability to cope with genetic and environmental stresses during development. However, due to inconsistency in the results of empirical studies, the relationship between FA and stress has been the subject of intense debate. In this study, we investigated whether stress caused by artificial bidirectional selection for body size has any effect on the levels of FA of different morphological traits in Drosophila ananassae. The realised heritability (h(2)) was higher in low-line females and high-line males, which suggests an asymmetrical response to selection for body size. Further, the levels of FA were compared across 10 generations of selection in different selection lines in both sexes for sternopleural bristle number, wing length, wing-to-thorax ratio, sex comb-tooth number and ovariole number. The levels of FA differed significantly among generations and selection lines but did not change markedly with directional selection. However, the levels of FA were higher in the G10 generation (at the end of selection) than G0 (at the start of selection) but lower than the G5 generation in different selection lines, suggesting that the levels of FA are not affected by the inbreeding generated during the course of selection. Also, the levels of FA in the hybrids of high and low lines were significantly lower than the parental selection lines, suggesting that FA is influenced by hybridisation. These results are discussed in the framework of the literature available on FA and its relationship with stress.

AB  - Climate change is proceeding rapidly in high mountain regions worldwide. Rising temperatures will impact insect physiology and associated fitness and will shift populations in space and time, thereby altering community interactions and composition. Shifts in space are expected as insects move upslope to escape warming temperatures and shifts in time will occur with changes in phenology of resident high-elevation insects. Clearly, spatiotemporal shifts will not affect all species equally. Terrestrial insects may have more opportunities than aquatic insects to exploit microhabitats, potentially buffering them from warming. Such responses of insects to warming may also fuel evolutionary change, including hitchhiking of maladaptive alleles and genetic rescue. Together, these considerations suggest a striking restructuring of high-elevation insect communities that remains largely unstudied.

AB  - Geographic dines in ectotherm species including Drosophila melanogaster have been found throughout the world, with genetically larger body size and shorter development time occurring at high latitudes. Temperature is thought to pray a major role in the evolution of this clinal variation. Laboratory thermal selection has effects similar to those seen in geographical clines. Evolution at low temperatures results in more rapid development to larger adult flies. This study investigated the effects of geographical origin and experimental temperature on larval growth efficiency in D. melanogaster. Larvae from populations that had evolved at high latitudes were found to use limited food more efficiently, so that the overall adult body size achieved was larger. Larvae reared at a lower experimental temperature (18 degreesC) used food more efficiently than those reared at a higher temperature (25 degreesC). The increases in growth efficiency found in populations from high latitudes could explain their increased body size and more rapid development.

AB  - Cuttlefish eggs provide useful material for studies devoted to cephalopod embryology. Live observations of embryogenesis are particularly easy given the large size of the embryo. The egos are readily obtained when aquarium maintenance of field-collected adults or laboratory culture of cuttlefish are possible. Setting up such a culture allows one to obtain egos year round, in contrast to field collection of eggs (by trawling. dredging, diving) which is restricted to certain periods of the year. Beach-collected eggs should be used with caution since they may have been exposed to adverse temperature conditions before collection. A careful study of such adverse effects obtained under controlled experimental conditions, however. may provide important information on developmental mechanisms involved in ecological adaptation and evolutionary change.

AB  - Species extinction rates are many times greater than the direst predictions made two decades ago by environmentalists, largely because of human impact. Major concerns are associated with the predicted higher recurrence and severity of extreme events, such as heat waves. Although tolerance to these extreme events is instrumental to species survival, little is known whether and how it evolves in natural populations, and to what extent it is affected by other environmental stressors. Here, we study physiological and molecular mechanisms of thermal tolerance over evolutionary times in multifarious environments. Using the practice of "resurrection ecology" on the keystone grazer Daphnia magna, we quantified genetic and plastic differences in physiological and molecular traits linked to thermal tolerance in historical and modern genotypes of the same population. This population experienced an increase in average temperature and occurrence of heat waves, in addition to dramatic changes in water chemistry, over five decades. On genotypes resurrected across the five decades, we measured plastic and genetic differences in CTmax, body size, Hb content and differential expression of four heat shock proteins after exposure to temperature as single stress and in combination with food levels and insecticide loads. We observed evolution of the critical thermal maximum and plastic response in body size, HSP expression and Hb content over time in a warming only scenario. Molecular and physiological responses to extreme temperature in multifarious environments were not predictable from the response to warming alone. Underestimating the effect of multiple stressors on thermal tolerance can lead to wrong estimates of species evolvability and persistence.

AB  - Knockdown resistance to high temperature (KRHT) is a genetically variable trait for thermal adaptation in insects. Selection for KRHT may affect a number of fitness components as well as resistance to several forms of environmental stress To test for heritable (co)-variation in KRHT, we examined direct and correlated responses to bi-directional selection on this trait in Drosophila buzzatii Replicated lines were artificially selected for decreased and increased KRHT After 12 generations of artificial selection, lines diverged significantly for high KRHT only. Starvation resistance increased in two lines that strongly responded to selection for high KRHT, and these two lines also showed relatively longer chill-coma recovery time Developmental time and body size showed no correlated responses to KRHT-selection These results suggest that KRHT is a heritable trait that can evolve towards increased thermotolerance with no genetic trade-offs associated to starvation resistance, developmental time and body size.

AB  - The majority of ectotherms grow slower but mature at a larger body size in colder environments. This phenomenon has puzzled biologists because classic theories of life-history evolution predict smaller sizes at maturity in environments that retard growth. During the last decade, intensive theoretical and empirical research has generated some plausible explanations based on nonadaptive or adaptive plasticity. Nonadaptive plasticity of body size is hypothesized to result from thermal constraints on cellular growth that cause smaller cells at higher temperatures, but the generality of this theory is poorly supported. Adaptive plasticity is hypothesized to result from greater benefits or lesser costs of delayed maturation in colder environments. These theories seem to apply well to some species but not others. Thus, no single theory has been able to explain the generality of temperature-size relationships in ectotherms. We recommend a multivariate theory that focuses on the coevolution of thermal reaction norms for growth rate and size at maturity. Such a theory should incorporate functional constraints on thermal reaction norms, as well as the natural covariation between temperature and other environmental variables.

AB  - Tropical ectotherms are thought to be especially vulnerable to climate change because they are adapted to relatively stable temperature regimes, such that even small increases in environmental temperature may lead to large decreases in physiological performance. One way in which tropical organisms may mitigate the detrimental effects of warming is through evolutionary change in thermal physiology. The speed and magnitude of this response depend, in part, on the strength of climate-driven selection. However, many ectotherms use behavioral adjustments to maintain preferred body temperatures in the face of environmental variation. These behaviors may shelter individuals from natural selection, preventing evolutionary adaptation to changing conditions. Here, we mimic the effects of climate change by experimentally transplanting a population of Anolis sagrei lizards to a novel thermal environment. Transplanted lizards experienced warmer and more thermally variable conditions, which resulted in strong directional selection on thermal performance traits. These same traits were not under selection in a reference population studied in a less thermally stressful environment. Our results indicate that climate change can exert strong natural selection on tropical ectotherms, despite their ability to thermoregulate behaviorally. To the extent that thermal performance traits are heritable, populations may be capable of rapid adaptation to anthropogenic warming.

AB  - Habitat selection models can explain spatial patterns in the relative abundance of animals in different habitats based on the assumption that fitness declines as density in a habitat increases. Ectotherms, such as lizards, may not follow predictions of density-dependent habitat selection models because temperature, which is unaffected by density, strongly influences their habitat selection. If competition for limited resources decreases fitness, then crowding should cause a decrease in body size and growth rates. We used skeletochronology and body size data from tree lizards (Urosaurus ornatus) at six sites that each spanned two habitats varying in quality to test the hypothesis that habitat selection is density dependent because growth is limited by competition for resources and by habitat quality. First, we tested that the maximum body size of lizards decreased with higher densities in a habitat by comparing growth between sites. Second, we tested whether body size and growth were higher in the habitat with more resources by controlling for density in a habitat and comparing growth between habitats in different sites. We found evidence of density-dependent growth in females, but not in males. Females in more crowded sites reached a smaller maximum size. Females in the higher quality habitat also grew larger than females in the lower quality habitat after controlling for differences in density between the habitats. Therefore, we found partial support for our hypothesis that competition for resources limits growth and causes density-dependent habitat selection.

AB  - The scaling of body parts is central to the expression of morphology across body sizes and to the generation of morphological diversity within and among species. Although patterns of scaling-relationship evolution have been well documented for over one hundred years, little is known regarding how selection acts to generate these patterns. In part, this is because it is unclear the extent to which the elements of log-linear scaling relationshipsthe intercept or mean trait size and the slopecan evolve independently. Here, using the wing-body size scaling relationship in Drosophila melanogaster as an empirical model, we use artificial selection to demonstrate that the slope of a morphological scaling relationship between an organ (the wing) and body size can evolve independently of mean organ or body size. We discuss our findings in the context of how selection likely operates on morphological scaling relationships in nature, the developmental basis for evolved changes in scaling, and the general approach of using individual-based selection experiments to study the expression and evolution of morphological scaling.

AB  - Body size in Drosophila is known to be closely related to a number of traits with important life history consequences, such as fecundity, dispersal ability and mating success. We examine the quantitative genetic basis of body size in three populations of the cactophilic species Drosophila buzzatii, which inhabit climatically different areas of Australia. Flies were reared individually to eliminate any common environmental component in a full-sib design with families split between two temperatures (18-degrees and 25-degrees-C). The means of several size measures differ significantly among populations while the genetic correlations among these traits generally do not differ, either among populations from different natural environments or between the different laboratory temperatures. This stability of correlation structure is necessary if laboratory estimates of genetic correlations are to have any connection with the expression of genetic variation in the field. The amount of variance due to genotype-by-environment interactions (family x temperature of development) varied among populations, apparently in parallel with the magnitudes of seasonal and diurnal variation in temperature experienced by the different populations. A coastal population, inhabiting a relatively thermally benign environment, showed no interaction, while two inland populations, inhabiting thermally more extreme areas, showed interaction. This interaction term is a measure of the amount of genetic variation in the degree of phenotypic plasticity of body size in response to temperature of development. Thus the inland flies vary in their ability to attain a given body size at a particular temperature while the coastal flies do not. This phenotypic plasticity is shown to be due primarily to differences among genotypes in the amount of response to the change in temperature. A possible selective basis for the maintenance of genetic variation for the levels of phenotypic plasticity is proposed.

AB  - Many species show changes in distribution and phenotypic trait variation in response to climatic warming. Evidence of genetically based trait responses to climate change is, however, less common. Here, we detected evolutionary variation in the landscape-scale distribution of a genetically based chemical polymorphism in Mediterranean wild thyme (Thymus vulgaris) in association with modified extreme winter freezing events. By comparing current data on morph distribution with that observed in the early 1970s, we detected a significant increase in the proportion of morphs that are sensitive to winter freezing. This increase in frequency was observed in 17 of the 24 populations in which, since the 1970s, annual extreme winter freezing temperatures have risen above the thresholds that cause mortality of freezing-sensitive morphs. Our results provide an original example of rapid ongoing evolutionary change associated with relaxed selection (less extreme freezing events) on a local landscape scale. In species whose distribution and genetic variability are shaped by strong selection gradients, there may be little time lag associated with their ecological and evolutionary response to long-term environmental change.

AB  - It is often assumed that ecological interactions happen at rapid rates relative to evolutionary change. In this study we examined the development and physiology of an amphibian (Rand sylvatica) from populations found in forested wetlands, and from wetlands that had been cleared by reinvading beaver (Castor canadensis). Embryos from beaver wetlands hatched at lower rates when raised in a shaded, common garden setting compared with embryos from forested wetlands. Larvae from beaver wetlands had higher critical thermal maxima compared with conspecifics from forested wetlands. These patterns suggest that R. sylvatica populations may have diverged rapidly (in less than 36 years) in response to changes in their environment induced by another species. Other agents of thermal change, such as anthropogenic landscape conversion or alteration of global climate, could have analogous impacts on wetland dependent species such as amphibians.

AB  - Bergmann's rule predicts increasing body sizes at higher elevations. The elevational Rapoport's rule predicts an increase of elevational range size with higher elevations. Both rules have often been related to effects of temperature. Larger bodies allow more efficient heat preservation at lower temperature, explaining Bergmann's rule. Higher temperature variability may select for adaptations that allow increased range sizes, explaining Rapoport's rule. The generality of both rules has been challenged and evidence towards explanatory mechanisms has been equivocal. We investigated temperature and its variability as explanations for Bergmann's and Rapoport's rule in moths along an elevation gradient in Switzerland. In particular, we tested for relationships between elevation, temperature and body size across almost 300 species of Macrolepidoptera along a gradient from 600 to 2400 m a.s.l. The gradient was resampled throughout the vegetation season, which allowed assessing temperature effects independently from elevation. We controlled analyses for covariate traits of moths and their phylogeny. We found a positive relationship between body size and elevation, but no link with temperature. Furthermore, there was no positive link between average elevation and elevational range, but there was between temperature variability and elevational range. We conclude that mechanisms other than temperature can lead to increasing body sizes with elevation (supporting Bergmann's pattern, but not the mechanism). Contrary to that, data support the mechanism for Rapoport's rule: high temperature variability is associated with large ranges. However, because temperature variability is not necessarily increasing with elevation, it may not always lead to the geographic pattern predicted.

AB  - The study of early development in Neotropical Leiuperinae frogs (Anura, Leptodactylidae) has been addressed by several works in recent times. However, a comparative developmental approach under a phylogenetic context was not available. Herein we analyzed the morphological and ontogenetic diversity of embryos belonging to 22 species of the three largest genera in Leiuperinae. We find that in most cases, variations fit with the phylogeny at the inter-and intrageneric levels. Embryo kyphosis and whitish color are synapomorphies for the clade grouping Physalaemus and Engystomops. The presence of a third lower tooth row on the oral disc is plesiomorphic for Leiuperinae, only changing in derived clades. The configurations and developmental trajectories of the lower lip are exceptionally diverse. The developmental sequences optimized on the phylogenetic tree recover an early differentiated first lower tooth row a synapomorphy of Pseudopaludicola and Physalaemus, and an early differentiated second row as synapomorphy of Pleurodema. On the other hand, few features are highly conserved in the subfamily, such as the adhesive glands universally present in a type-C configuration. Our results also suggest that the morphology and ontogeny of embryos is in some cases associated to the environment where they develop. A large body size, poorly developed transient respiratory structures, large yolk provision and delayed development of the digestive tract occur convergently in embryos inhabiting cold, oxygenated environments. Embryos that develop in warmer water bodies in xeric environments show more complex and persistent transient respiratory structures and an early onset of hind limbs development. Our survey highlights that morphology and early development of anurans can be a valuable source of information for phylogenetic studies, and provide fundamental bases to explore and discuss how evolutionary changes can be shaped by environmental conditions.

AB  - Rensch's rule states that males vary more in size than females when body size increases. The main cause of Rensch's rule has been credited to sexual selection. However, different degrees of plasticity between the sexes have also been proven to be useful for describing variations in sexual size dimorphism, particularly within an intraspecific context. For insects, in general, this rule has rarely been tested within species. Here, we tested whether Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer, 1907) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) followed Rensch's rule when individuals emerged from seeds immediately after fruit collection and when they were reared for one generation, by measuring three morphological traits. Rensch's rule was not followed for any of the morphological traits. Variations in body size were similar in males and females for bruchines that first emerged from seeds and for those that were reared for one generation. These findings suggest that environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, and seasonality) are unlikely to drive differential plasticity in males and females of this seed-feeding beetle. It is possible that changes in the body size of A. macrophthalmus have a genetic basis. However, regardless of whether variations in body size have a genetic basis, our findings provide no support for Rensch's rule.

AB  - Aim: Trade-offs allow individuals to optimize their fitness by tailoring the investment into different traits to variable environmental conditions, such as along geographical gradients. Trade-offs thus can help in adjusting to changing thermal and insolation profiles, especially in small ectotherms, whose body temperature typically follows environmental temperatures closely. Two traits usually involved in latitudinal adaptation are body size and melanism. Since both traits are costly, individuals need to optimize investment into each trait. Here, we studied how environmental factors influence this trade-off in the short and long-term.
   Location: Europe.
   MethodsWe raised flies from 15 latitudinal populations at three constant temperatures in a laboratory common garden to differentiate plastic and evolutionary responses to temperature. We further analysed how the different insolation components of the populations' habitats influenced the evolution of the trade-off.
   Results: Male Sepsis thoracica (Diptera: Sepsidae) feature a sigmoid relationship between melanism and body size, defining two strikingly different male morphs: obsidian (small and black) and amber (large and orange). This relationship was altered by the developmental temperature, documenting its plasticity. The relationship further evolved across populations in response to the environmental characteristics of their habitat, notably temperature, insolation and UV radiation, suggesting that plasticity also has an underlying genetic basis. Nevertheless, melanism, but not body size, merely slightly increased with latitude.
   Main conclusions: As the plastic and evolutionary responses of the relationship to temperature differed, plasticity does not necessarily follow the direction of evolution of this trade-off, but rather adds to it. Our study evinces the role of several environmental factors in shaping the evolution of a plastic melanismbody size relationship defining a rare male polymorphism in temperate sepsid flies.

AB  - Body temperature is a key factor in physiological processes, influencing lizard performances; and life history traits are expected to generate variability of thermal preferences in different individuals. Gender, body size and reproductive condition may impose specific requirements on preferred body temperatures. If these three factors have different physiological functions and thermal requirements, then,the preferred temperature may represent a compromise that optimizes these physiological functions. Therefore, the body temperatures that lizards select in a controlled environment may reflect a temperature that maximizes their physiological needs. The tegu lizard Tupinambis merianae is one of the largest lizards in South America and has wide ontogenetic variation in body size and sexual dimorphism. In the present study we evaluate intraspecific variability of thermal preferences of T. merianae. We determined the selected body temperature and the rate at which males and females attain their selected temperature, in relation to body size and reproductive condition. We also compared the behavior in the thermal gradient between males and females and between reproductive condition of individuals. Our study show that T merianae selected body temperature within a narrow range of temperatures variation in the laboratory thermal gradient, with 36.24 +/- 1.49 degrees C being the preferred temperature. We observed no significant differences between sex, body size and reproductive condition in thermal preferences. Accordingly, we suggest that the evaluated categories of 1: merianae have similar thermal requirements. Males showed higher rates to obtain heat than females and reproductive females, higher rates than non-reproductive ones females. Moreover, males and reproductive females showed a more dynamic behavior in the thermal gradient. Therefore, even though they achieve the same selected temperature, they do it differentially.

AB  - In ectotherms, temperature induces similar developmental and evolutionary responses in body size, with larger individuals occurring or evolving in low temperature environments. Based on the occasional occurrence of opposite size clines, showing a decline in body size with increasing latitude, an interaction between generation time and growing season length was suggested to account for the patterns found. Accordingly, multivoltine species with short generation times should gain high compound interest benefits from reproducing early at high temperatures, indicating potential for extra generations, even at the expense of being smaller. This should not apply for obligatorily monovoltine populations. We explicitly test the prediction that monovoltine populations (no compound interest) should be selected for large body size to maximise adult fitness, and therefore size at maturity should respond only weakly to temperature. In two monovoltine populations (an Alpine and a Western German one) of the butterfly Lycaena hippothoe, increasing temperatures had no significant effect on pupal weight and caused a slight decrease in adult weight only. In contrast, two closely related, yet potentially multivoltine Lycaena populations showed a greater weight loss at increasing temperature (in protandrous males, but not in females) and smaller adult sizes throughout. Thus, the results do support our predictions indicating that the compound interest hypothesis may yield causal explanations for the relationship between temperature and insect size at maturity. At all temperatures, the alpine population had higher growth rates and concomitantly shorter development times (not accompanied by a reduction in size) than the other, presumably indicating local adaptations to different climates.

AB  - The largest extant snakes live in the tropics of South America and southeast Asia(1-3) where high temperatures facilitate the evolution of large body sizes among air- breathing animals whose body temperatures are dependant on ambient environmental temperatures ( poikilothermy)(4,5). Very little is known about ancient tropical terrestrial ecosystems, limiting our understanding of the evolution of giant snakes and their relationship to climate in the past. Here we describe a boid snake from the oldest known neotropical rainforest fauna from the Cerrejon Formation ( 58 - 60 Myr ago) in northeastern Colombia. We estimate a body length of 13 and a mass of 1,135 kg, making it the largest known snake(6-9). The maximum size of poikilothermic animals at a given temperature is limited by metabolic rate(4), and a snake of this size would require a minimum mean annual temperature of 30 - 34 degrees C to survive. This estimate is consistent with hypotheses of hot Palaeocene neotropics with high concentrations of atmospheric CO2 based on climate models(10). Comparison of palaeotemperature estimates from the equator to those from South American mid- latitudes indicates a relatively steep temperature gradient during the early Palaeogene greenhouse, similar to that of today. Depositional environments and faunal composition of the Cerrejon Formation indicate an anaconda- like ecology for the giant snake, and an earliest Cenozoic origin of neotropical vertebrate faunas.

AB  - We used highly realistic temperature treatments based on down-scaled global circulation models for 1990-2000 (control) and 2100 (warming treatment) to experimentally assess the impacts of altered temperature regimes on the emerging adults of aquatic insect communities. Experiments were run for 6 weeks and emerging adults of insects were identified and measured for length. There were clear responses to the warming treatment, but responses were taxa- and gender-specific. Males of mayfly Ulmerophlebia pipinna Suter 1986 (Leptophlebiidae) emerged faster under 2100 temperatures. This resulted in a change in the sex ratio that could compromise populations. Mean body size of some insects decreased under warming conditions, which is in agreement with the general hypothesis of reduced body size in response to climate change. However, the degree to which organism size was affected by temperature varied within and between taxa. These changes show the potential for changed temperature regimes to impact ecological systems at individual, population, and community levels. Changes in body size and species composition of emerging insects are likely to impact different levels in both the aquatic and terrestrial communities, for example through disruption of interactions between emerging insects and riparian predators which rely on those resources.

AB  - Our study addresses the role of non-genetic and genetic inheritance in shaping the adaptive potential of populations under a warming ocean scenario. We used a combined experimental approach [transgenerational plasticity (TGP) and quantitative genetics] to partition the relative contribution of maternal vs. paternal (additive genetic) effects to offspring body size (a key component of fitness), and investigated a potential physiological mechanism (mitochondrial respiration capacities) underlying whole-organism growth/size responses. In very early stages of growth (up to 30days), offspring body size of marine sticklebacks benefited from maternal TGP: offspring of mothers acclimated to 17 degrees C were larger when reared at 17 degrees C, and offspring of mothers acclimated to 21 degrees C were larger when reared at 21 degrees C. The benefits of maternal TGP on body size were stronger and persisted longer (up to 60days) for offspring reared in the warmer (21 degrees C) environment, suggesting that maternal effects will be highly relevant for climate change scenarios in this system. Mitochondrial respiration capacities measured on mature offspring (F1 adults) matched the pattern of TGP for juvenile body size, providing an intuitive mechanistic basis for the maternal acclimation persisting into adulthood. Size differences between temperatures seen at early growth stages remained in the F1 adults, linking offspring body size to maternal inheritance of mitochondria. Lower maternal variance components in the warmer environment were mostly driven by mothers acclimated to ambient (colder) conditions, further supporting our tenet that maternal effects were stronger at elevated temperature. Importantly, all parent-offspring temperature combination groups showed genotypexenvironment (GxE) interactions, suggesting that reaction norms have the potential to evolve. To summarize, TGP and GxE interactions work in concert to mediate impacts of ocean warming on metabolic capacity and early growth of marine sticklebacks. TGP can buffer short-term detrimental effects of climate warming and may buy time for genetic adaptation to catch up, therefore markedly contributing to the evolutionary potential and persistence of populations under climate change.

AB  - We united theoretical predictions of the factors responsible for the evolutionary significance of the temperature-size rule (TSR). We assumed that (i) the TSR is a response to temperature-dependent oxic conditions, (ii) body size decrease is a consequence of cell shrinkage in response to hypoxia, (iii) this response enables organisms to maintain a wide scope for aerobic performance, and (iv) it prevents a decrease in fitness. We examined three clones of the rotifer Lecane inermis exposed to three experimental regimes: mild hypoxia, severe hypoxia driven by too high of a temperature, and severe hypoxia driven by an inadequate oxygen concentration. We compared the following traits in normoxia- and hypoxia-exposed rotifers: nuclear size (a proxy for cell size), body size, specific dynamic action (SDA, a proxy of aerobic metabolism) and two fitness measures, the population growth rate and eggs/female ratio. The results showed that (i) under mildly hypoxic conditions, our causative reasoning was correct, except that one of the clones decreased in body size without a decrease in nuclear size, and (ii) in more stressful environments, rotifers exhibited clone- and condition-specific responses, which were equally successful in terms of fitness levels. Our results indicate the importance of the testing conditions. The important conclusions were that (i) a body size decrease at higher temperatures enabled the maintenance of a wide aerobic scope under clone-specific, thermally optimal conditions, and (ii) this response was not the only option to prevent fitness reduction under hypoxia.

AB  - Background: The rhesus macaque (RM, Macaca mulatta) is the most important nonhuman primate model in biomedical research. We present the first genomic survey of wild RMs, sequencing 81 geo-referenced individuals of five subspecies from 17 locations in China, a large fraction of the species' natural distribution. Results: Populations were structured into five genetic lineages on the mainland and Hainan Island, recapitulating current subspecies designations. These subspecies are estimated to have diverged 125.8 to 51.3 thousand years ago, but feature recent gene flow. Consistent with the expectation of a larger body size in colder climates and smaller body size in warmer climates (Bergman's rule), the northernmost RM lineage (M. m. tcheliensis), possessing the largest body size of all Chinese RMs, and the southernmost lineage (M. m. brevicaudus), with the smallest body size of all Chinese RMs, feature positively selected genes responsible for skeletal development. Further, two candidate selected genes (Fbp1, Fbp2) found in M. m. tcheliensis are involved in gluconeogenesis, potentially maintaining stable blood glucose levels during starvation when food resources are scarce in winter. The tropical subspecies M. m. brevicaudus showed positively selected genes related to cardiovascular function and response to temperature stimuli, potentially involved in tropical adaptation. We found 118 single-nucleotide polymorphisms matching human disease-causing variants with 82 being subspecies specific. Conclusions: These data provide a resource for selection of RMs in biomedical experiments. The demographic history of Chinese RMs and their history of local adaption offer new insights into their evolution and provide valuable baseline information for biomedical investigation.

AB  - Feulgen staining revealed significant geographical differences in mean DNA contents of somatic nuclei of adult female Calanus glacialis and Pseudocalanus acuspes from the Canadian arctic and Nova Scotia; the latter exhibited seasonal differences near Halifax in 1987 but not 1989-1990. Female P. elongatus reared for 96 generations in the laboratory had significantly less DNA per nucleus than did first-generation females from the same North Sea wild stock. Nuclei of C. glacialis reared from juvenile stages (copepodid III) in four food-temperature treatments had significantly more DNA at high food and low temperature. There were also significant treatment effects in P. elongatus and P. acuspes reared from egg to adult. There were always significant differences in DNA contents among females within samples and treatments. Increased variance among nuclei within individual C. glacialis may have resulted from suboptimal laboratory conditions. Body lengths in rearing experiments were positively correlated with nuclear DNA contents in C. glacialis and P. elongatus; there was no correlation of lengths with nucleus number in P. acuspes. Development rate of late-stage C. glacialis was negatively related to nuclear DNA contents. The slight, but significant, differences among females within and among samples and treatments suggest that their DNA contents are both inherent and subject to slight environmental effects. Results are also consistent with earlier indications that body sizes and development rates of copepods, because of restricted variation in cell number, are partly under nucleotypic control.

AB  - An abnormally high temperature produces a stress response in turbot causing large economic losses in the turbot aquaculture industry of China. A genetic improvement of the upper thermal tolerance (UTT) of turbot could allow cultured fish to adapt. A genetic evaluation of UTT is required for determining the practicability of including this trait into a breeding program. In this study, data were recorded from a temperature tolerance test conducted on 3 200 individual turbots from 32 full-sib groups. A cross-sectional linear model and a cross-sectional threshold probit model were used to analyze the test-period survival and a cross-sectional threshold logit model was used to analyze the test-day survival. In addition, phenotypic and genetic correlations between body weight and survival data were estimated. The estimated heritability values obtained from the cross-sectional linear model (CSL), the cross-sectional threshold (probit) model (THRp), and the cross-sectional threshold (logit) model (THRl) were 0.247 9 +/- 0.108 3, 0.288 3 +/- 0.161 2, and 0.106 9 +/- 0.045 2, respectively. The correlation coefficients among the full-sib family estimated breeding values (EBVs) obtained from the three models were greater than 0.998 6 and all models produced an almost identical family ranking. The accuracies of selection obtained with the CSL, THRp, and THRl model were 0.773 8, 0.775 4, and 0.784 4, respectively, the greatest from the THRl model. The genetic correlations between body weight and survival data EBVs from the CSL, THRp, and THRl models were 0.020 1, -6.201 1x 10(-4), and -3.115 4x10(-4), respectively, and the phenotypic correlations between the two traits were -0.837 1 and -0.667 1, respectively. The findings of this study provide background information to determine the best strategy of selection for the genetic improvement of UTT in turbot.

AB  - Competing hypotheses: (1) Large body size confers more efficient energy use (relative efficiency hypothesis). (2) Large body size requires more energy to be sustained, a disadvantage when food is limited (absolute energy demand hypothesis).
   Organism: Yellow dung flies, Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera: Scathophagidae), artificially selected for large and small body size in the laboratory for 11 (24) generations.
   Methods: Flies were reared in limited and unlimited larval food conditions and low and stressfully high temperatures, and after adult emergence they were held on water only to study the relationship between energy content (lipids, glucose, glycogen) and (physiological) adult life span under complete starvation (starvation resistance) in the laboratory.
   Conclusions: Limited larval food and high temperature decreased life span. Life span increased markedly with body size due to the greater energy content of larger flies. Small selection line flies had relatively more energy and longer life spans under complete starvation, indicating a compensatory correlated genetic response to body size selection. The larger males suffered most under multiple stresses. Our results support the relative efficiency hypothesis, which more than compensates for the greater absolute energy demand of larger individuals.

AB  - Body size and development time are two critical phenotypic traits that can be highly adaptive in insects. Recent population genetic analyses and crossing experiments with the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) have described substantial levels of neutral molecular genetic differentiation, genetic differences in phenotypic traits, and reproductive isolation. To determine whether genetic differences in adaptive phenotypic traits exist that correspond to reproductive boundaries, we conducted a common garden experiment with seven D. ponderosae populations previously used to identify reproductive incompatibilities. Genetic differences in development time were striking between faster developing, and more synchronized, northern populations and slower developing, and less synchronized, southern populations. Additionally, genetic differences in average body size were found between many populations. Differences in these two traits, however, failed to clearly demarcate populations that exhibit reproductive incompatibilities. Our results suggest that local selection pressures likely drive divergence in these two traits that is largely independent of the evolution of reproductive isolation in D. ponderosae.

AB  - Background: Extreme weather events follow latitudinal patterns and are increasing due to climate change. To persist, natural populations must adapt to the increased occurrence of heat waves.
   Hypothesis: Heat tolerance is higher at lower latitudes and in smaller animals. Animals show evolutionary potential for heat tolerance. Organism: The water flea, Daphnia magna, a common species in bodies of fresh water.
   Methods: Set up a common-garden experiment using six populations spread across three latitudes in Western Europe, thereby creating a latitudinal gradient in local temperatures. Measure CTmax, the temperature above which animals lose motor function.
   Results: Thermal tolerance increased with increasing local temperatures. Body size, which was smaller at the southern latitude, negatively affected heat tolerance. Heat tolerance showed genetic variation within latitudes.
   Conclusions: Daphnia magna possesses the evolutionary potential to increase its heat tolerance if temperatures warm. Its heat tolerance shows latitudinal adaptation to local temperatures. A parallel pattern in body size magnifies the latitudinal pattern in heat tolerance.

AB  - The recent revival of body size relationships in ecology has boosted our understanding of ecosystems. Here, a simple model, based on energy equivalency, integrates rate, age, density and area parameters that are important in ecological modelling. Allometric relationships for quantities as diverse as ingestion, mortality; age at maturity, maximum density territory size of different species groups and trophic levels are derived from production and some ecological transfer efficiencies.
   The theory is supported by a meta-analysis of 230 allometric regressions derived from over 100 publications. The relationships are shown to be mutually consistent and fit into the model. Rate constants generally decrease with organism mass at an exponent of -1/4. Age and density parameters increase in the same direction following a slope of 1/4. Differences between plants, invertebrates, cold-blooded vertebrates and warm-blooded vertebrates are reflected in the intercepts and can be anticipated from temperature, trophic position and evolutionary history. Cold-blooded species have lower rate constants but reach higher ages and densities than equally sized warm-blooded organisms. Intercepts of body size distributions tend to decrease with trophic position, at a level that is predicted by ecological efficiencies.
   Area parameters, such as the territory size and geographic range, tend to decrease with species size, but slopes and intercepts were often different from the expected value. Occasionally, outliers were also noted for rate, time or density parameters. With the model at hand, such deviations can be easily identified and subjected to more extensive empirical and theoretical research. With these restrictions, specific issues can now be addressed by a framework that complies with extensive information on related parameters. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine the effects of season and lines on age at sexual maturity, body weight at sexual maturity and some egg yield traits in 11 generations of selected Japanese quail. The material used in this research was selected from high (HL) or low (LL) body weight Japanese quail lines according to 5-week body weights and their random bred control line and layer line (L) for 120 d egg production. Average egg weight was the lowest in summer and in LL line, Which also had lowest total egg number, total egg weight and hen day egg production. Maximum eggs were produced by L line, while heaviest eggs were produced by HL line. The highest and lowest ages at sexual maturity were determined in winter and summer seasons, respectively. Also, the heaviest first egg weight was found in winter season. It is concluded that lines and seasons generally affected quail egg production.

AB  - Climate is a strong selection agent at high elevations, but experimental examinations of how animals exclusive of highlands cope with its variation are scarce. We analysed temperature-induced variation of early ontogenetic traits in the alpine grasshopper Chorthippus cazurroi, and compared populations from the elevational extremes of the species distribution under laboratory conditions spanning natural temperature ranges. Neither elevation of origin, nor different growing temperatures, had a direct effect on nymph body size, but both factors contributed to size at hatching indirectly, via their effect on the duration of embryo development. Large emerging nymphs had a consistently greater survival, although small and fast-developing nymphs from highlands also performed well at low temperatures. Viability selection favoured fast-developing phenotypes in conditions in which plasticity delayed development, in a typical countergradient pattern. Growth in the successive stage did not compensate for slow development at hatching, thus responses at this early stage have potential long-lasting consequences. Although phenotypic selection during early development certifies the strength of selection imposed by cold temperatures in the laboratory, elevation clines of body size did not emerge in either nymphs or the wild parental generation. Differentiation in the wild may be levelled out by fecundity selection for large sizes, drift and gene flow resulting from the fragmentation and proximity of populations, or by micro-climatic differences that reduce the likelihood of directional selection. There is therefore potential for local adaptation to temperature, but a series of conditions typical of alpine environments and ectotherms may impair, confound or constrain full differentiation along the gradient.

AB  - Mating success not only depends on genetic quality, but also equally on environmental factors, most prominently food availability. We investigated the interactive effects of nutritional state and body size on mating success and copula duration in yellow dung fly males (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae) of three body size selection lines in the laboratory in both non-competitive (single) and competitive (group) situations. Adults require protein and lipids from prey to reproduce, as well as sugars as an energy source for reproductive activity. We expected mating success to decrease with time because of sperm depletion (sugar treatment) and/or energy shortage (water treatment) relative to the control, prey plus sugar treatment. Based on physiological scaling, we also expected large-line males to become depleted either sooner because of their higher energy and sperm demands, or later because of their more efficient energy use. Average mating success indeed declined over a period of 5-7 d (or 5-15 potential copulations per male), but equally for all food treatments and body size classes. Surprisingly, water-fed and small-line males had the highest mating probability in the non-competitive setting, while in the competitive setting large-line males had the highest success. Energy-depleted males showed apparent terminal investment. Small males acquired females more readily but eventually lost them to larger males in the competitive situation. As shown before, copula duration was inversely related to body size and increased with copulation number, independent of food treatment. We conclude that sugar or prey shortage has little effect on mating success in the short term, and does not differentially affect males of different sizes.

AB  - Many selective pressures modulate microhabitat choice of ectotherms, such as temperature, humidity and habitat heterogeneity, and these vary in space and time. Here we analysed: 1) microhabitat selection comparing characteristics of stones (and their surroundings) under which geckos (Tarentola delalandii, mainly nocturnal) were found during the day with that of stones selected randomly; 2) relationship of a measure of body size to microhabitat characteristics (stone and herb covers, etc., and temperature/humidity) and cloacal temperature of males, females and juveniles from two contrasting habitats of Tenerife (northern and southern localities) and in two periods of the year (Spring-Summer and Autumn-Winter). In comparison with randomly selected stones, geckos significantly selected stones with lower temperature in the Spring-Summer and microhabitats with high stone cover. Gecko size was significantly larger in the Northern than in the Southern locality, in spring - summer than in autumn - winter and in males than in females. In both populations and time periods, the largest body sizes were significantly associated with higher environmental and shelter temperatures and with low values of humidity and stone cover. Cloacal and shelter temperatures were positively and significantly related; at higher values of the latter, juveniles attained significantly higher temperatures than adult males but lower than that of females. Larger body size was associated with high shrub and leaf litter covers and high values of shelter dimensions. Therefore, we suggest that in relation to their body sizes, geckos seem to select their shelters considering specific microhabitat characteristics surrounding them that may provide thermoregulatory and/or antipredator profits.

AB  - Large-scale patterns of current species geographic range-size variation reflect historical dynamics of dispersal and provide insights into future consequences under changing environments. Evidence suggests that climate warming exerts major damage on high latitude and elevation organisms, where changes are more severe and available space to disperse tracking historical niches is more limited. Species with longer generations (slower adaptive responses), such as vertebrates, and with restricted distributions (lower genetic diversity, higher inbreeding) in these environments are expected to be particularly threatened by warming crises. However, a well-known macroecological generalization (Rapoport's rule) predicts that species range-sizes increase with increasing latitude-elevation, thus counterbalancing the impact of climate change. Here, I investigate geographic range-size variation across an extreme environmental gradient and as a function of body size, in the prominent Liolaemus lizard adaptive radiation. Conventional and phylogenetic analyses revealed that latitudinal (but not elevational) ranges significantly decrease with increasing latitude-elevation, while body size was unrelated to range-size. Evolutionarily, these results are insightful as they suggest a link between spatial environmental gradients and range-size evolution. However, ecologically, these results suggest that Liolaemus might be increasingly threatened if, as predicted by theory, ranges retract and contract continuously under persisting climate warming, potentially increasing extinction risks at high latitudes and elevations.

AB  - A challenge for improving disease resistance in fish through genetics is to understand specificity of resistance and whether selection for one pathogen alters the response to unrelated pathogenic microorganisms. Adult Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss that had been bred for differential susceptibility to Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the causative agent of bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) and designated ARS-Fp-R (resistant), ARS-Fp-S (susceptible), and ARS-Fp-C (control line), as well as a pool of commercial-stock Rainbow Trout, were intraperitoneally challenged with Weissella sp. NC36. Clinical signs, survival, and innate mechanisms affecting disease resistance were monitored over 9 d. Acute disease signs included exophthalmia associated with retrobulbar inflammation and hemorrhage, cerebral hemorrhage, and mild to moderate granulomatous pericarditis. The ARS-Fp-R line did not demonstrate significant survival differences over a 9-d period compared with the ARS-Fp-C and ARS-Fp-S lines (P 0.09) indicating that during the acute phase of disease, the resistance factors that limit BCWD do not confer cross protection against Weissella sp. NC36. The linear effect of body weight at challenge was statistically significant, as each 10-g increase in body weight increased the hazard of death by 1% (P = 0.02). Bacterial loads on day 3, assessed by splenic and cerebral CFU counts, did not differ between ARS-Fp-R and ARS-Fp-S trout and there was no correlation between CFU counts and body weight. These findings help elucidate the specificity of disease resistance in selectively bred lines and contribute to our understanding of disease caused by Weissella sp., a recently described pathogen found in cultured Rainbow Trout.

AB  - Charnov and Bull suggested that environmentally induced variation in adult body size coupled with sex-specific differences in fitness can select for the evolution of adaptive environmental sex determination (ESD). In this study we determine whether larval density affects sex determination in the copepod Tigriopus californicus (Baker, 1912), as predicted by Charnov and Bull. Individuals reared at low densities developed faster and were significantly larger than siblings reared at high densities. For these laboratory-reared individuals, sexual selection on male body size was stronger than fecundity selection on female body size, but this sex-specific pattern of selection was reversed in the field. Differences in food availability (for females) and the mode of competition (for males) may account for the conflicting results between laboratory and field. We found a weak effect of larval density on sex determination in a pilot experiment but no effect in a second, more powerful experiment. While larval density did not affect the sex ratio of T. californicus, our sex-specific estimates of selection on adult body size will inform future models of adaptive ESD in this species and other copepods.

AB  - Most of the literature about phenotypic effects of chromosomal change has dealt with its effects on chiasma frequency and/or distribution, whereas whether or not they affect the exophenotype has received less attention and has remained controversial. In the present paper morphometrical variables of the species Leptysma argentina were analysed in connection with chromosome polymorphisms for a centric fusion and a supernumerary segment.
   The centric fusion between pairs 3 and 6 (fusion 3/6) and a supernumerary segment in the smallest pair of the complement (s(1)) were consistently proved to have effects on chiasma frequency and position; preliminary analyses had shown, however, that fusion 3/6 could be correlated with some effects on body size (Colombo, 1989). In the present paper the analysis of femur, tibia, prothorax and total length as well as prothorax height on larger samples were consistent in showing that both polymorphisms are positively correlated with increasing total length; in the case of the supernumerary segment, however, this effect is not constant over all the populations sampled.
   An adaptive change in body size may be achieved through selection on: (i) genetic factors that affect this trait; or (ii) chromosome polymorphisms with exophenotypic effects. This latter case would be more effective, because genetic factors are usually polygenic and hence their response to selection would be slow. It is tempting to say that this could be the case for L. argentina, because in grasshoppers increased body size can be related to tolerance to cold or dry environments.

AB  - Extrema in temperature tolerances are a selective factor contributing to variation between populations and species. The climate variability hypothesis (CVH) posits that organisms exposed to a wider range of temperatures are expected to have a wider thermal range. This pattern is common across many taxa. In this study, we investigate how social insects vary in thermal tolerance. We test if social role in termites influences tolerance to temperature maxima, and given ties between social roles and body size, whether it is a primary correlate. Our methods examined upper lethal limit (ULL) and dry weights of five termite species representing two families across four sites in Texas and Costa Rica. With the addition of previously recorded upper heat tolerances in the literature, we conclude that termites follow the CVH and upper heat tolerance is positively correlated with absolute latitude. Our results show a differentiation in heat tolerance by task (collected from foraging site versus from nest) for Nasutitermes corniger soldiers but not workers. In the remaining species, there was no ULL partitioning by caste (soldier versus worker). Body size significantly correlated with ULL with the exception of Cornitermes walkeri, an outlier in both body size and ULL. A better understanding of how termites cope with temperature is important for this essential wood decomposer in a changing climate.

AB  - In Drosophila melanogaster, inversion In(3R)Payne increases in frequency towards low latitudes and has been putatively associated with variation in size and thermal resistance, traits that also vary clinally. To assess the association between size and inversion, we obtained isofemale lines of inverted and standard karyotype of In(3R)Payne from the ends of the Australian D. melanogaster east coast cline. In the northern population, there was a significant association between In(3R)Payne and body size, with standard lines from this population being relatively larger than inverted lines. In contrast, the inversion had no influence on development time or cold resistance. We strengthened our findings further in a separate study with flies from populations from the middle of the cline as well as from the cline ends. These flies were scored for wing size and the presence of In(3R)Payne using a molecular marker. In females, the inversion accounted for around 30% of the size difference between cline ends, while in males the equivalent figure was 60%. Adaptive shifts in size but not in the other traits are therefore likely to have involved genes closely associated with In(3R)Payne. Because the size difference between karyotypes was similar in different populations, there was no evidence for coadaptation within populations.

AB  - Body size is important to most aspects of biology and is also one of the most labile traits. Despite its importance we know remarkably little about the proximate (developmental) factors that determine body size under different circumstances. Here, I review what is known about how cell size and number contribute to phenetic and genetic variation in body size in Drosophila melanogaster, several fish, and fruits and leaves of some angiosperms. Variation in resources influences size primarily through changes in cell number while temperature acts through cell size. The difference in cellular mechanism may also explain the differences in growth trajectories resulting from food and temperature manipulations. There is, however, a poorly recognized interaction between food and temperature effects that needs further study. In addition, flies show a sexual dimorphism in temperature effects with the larger sex responding by changes in cell size and the smaller sex showing changes in both cell size and number. Leaf size is more variable than other organs, but there appears to be a consistent difference between how shade-tolerant and shade-intolerant species respond to light level. The former have larger leaves via cell size under shade, the latter via cell number in light conditions. Genetic differences, primarily from comparisons of D. melanogaster, show similar variation. Direct selection on body size alters cell number only, while temperature selection results in increased cell size and decreased cell number. Population comparisons along latitudinal clines show that larger flies have both larger cells and more cells. Use of these proximate patterns can give clues as to how selection acts in the wild. For example, the latitudinal pattern in D. melanogaster is usually assumed to be due to temperature, but the cellular pattern does not match that seen in laboratory selection at different temperatures.

AB  - Body size is a multi-functional trait related to various fitness components, but the relative importance of different selection pressures is seldom resolved. In Carabus japonicus beetles, of which the larvae exclusively prey on earthworms, adult body size is related to the presence/absence of a larger congener and habitat temperature. In sympatry, C. japonicus consistently exhibits smaller body size which is effective for avoiding interspecific mating, but in allopatry, it shows size variation unrelated to temperature. Here, we show that this predator-size variation is attributed to prey-size variation, associated with high phylogenetic diversity in earthworm communities. In allopatry, the predator size was larger where larger prey occurred. Larger adult size may have been selected because larger females produce larger larvae, which can subdue larger prey. Thus, in the absence of a larger congener, variation in prey body size had a pronounced effect on geographic body size divergence in C. japonicus.

KW  - EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE
AB  - The behavioral responses of adult female and male Drosophila robusta and D. tripunctata to combined temperature and desiccation stress were compared on a temperature gradient [temperature range 14.7 to 27.7 C; vapor pressure deficit range 8 (cool end) to 19 g/m(3) (warm end)]. Drosophila tripunctata preferred significantly lower temperatures than D. robusta Because previous work showed D. tripunctata to have significantly lower adult viability than D. robusta at high temperature, this behavioral response is adaptive. Both species showed an acclimation response and preferred higher temperatures after a two day prior exposure to a high and stressful temperature (26 C). Adults from stocks which had been cultured a longer time in the laboratory preferred significantly different (higher) temperatures. Adults from older stocks also showed a significantly smaller acclimation response than flies from younger stocks. Both of these results are consistent with genetic changes having occurred in the stocks during the years of laboratory culturing.

AB  - Background: The correlations between Phanerozoic atmospheric oxygen fluctuations and insect body size suggest that higher oxygen levels facilitate the evolution of larger size in insects.
   Methods and Principal Findings: Testing this hypothesis we selected Drosophila melanogaster for large size in three oxygen atmospheric partial pressures (aPO(2)). Fly body sizes increased by 15% during 11 generations of size selection in 21 and 40 kPa aPO(2). However, in 10 kPa aPO(2), sizes were strongly reduced. Beginning at the 12(th) generation, flies were returned to normoxia. All flies had similar, enlarged sizes relative to the starting populations, demonstrating that selection for large size had functionally equivalent genetic effects on size that were independent of aPO(2).
   Significance: Hypoxia provided a physical constraint on body size even in a tiny insect strongly selected for larger mass, supporting the hypothesis that Triassic hypoxia may have contributed to a reduction in insect size.

AB  - In Drosophila, both the phenotypic and evolutionary effect of temperature on adult size involves alterations to larval resource processing and affects other life-history traits, that is, development time but most notably, larval survival. Therefore, thermal evolution of adult body size might not be independent of simultaneous adaptation of larval traits to resource availability. Using experimental evolution lines adapted to high and low temperatures at different levels of food, we show that selection pressures interact in shaping larval resource processing. Evolution on poor food invariably leads to lower resource acquisition suggesting a cost to feeding behavior. However, following low temperature selection, lower resource acquisition led to a higher adult body size, probably by more efficient allocation to growth. In contrast, following high temperature selection, low resource acquisition benefited larval survival, possibly by reducing feeding-associated costs. We show that evolved differences to larval resource processing provide a possible proximate mechanism to variation in a suite of correlated life-history traits during adaptation to different climates. The implication for natural populations is that in nature, thermal evolution drives populations to opposite ends of an adult size versus larval survival trade-off by altering resource processing, if resource availability is limited.

AB  - Within-species diversity is often driven by changing selective regimes along environmental gradients. Here, we provide a direct test of the environmental factors underlying phenotypic diversity across the wide native distribution of eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). We investigated life-history and body-shape divergence (including multiple measures of body size) across more than 14 degrees of latitude in North America, and used Akaike's information criterion-based model selection to determine the relative contributions of thermal regime, population densities and habitat productivity as potential drivers of latitudinal phenotypic variation. We found thermal regime to be the most important driver of large-scale latitudinal phenotypic patterns: populations in colder climates with greater seasonality and range in temperature exhibited larger body size, larger reproductive investment coupled with smaller offspring size, and shallower bodies with a smaller head and more anterodorsally positioned pectoral fins. Nonetheless, population density and habitat productivity also influenced trait divergence, but independent of latitudinal patterns, and some variation in body shape was due to apparent covariation with life histories. Our study confirms thermal regime as an important driver of latitudinal phenotypic differentiation even in ectotherms, but also uncovers multiple additional factors that shape phenotypic diversity, emphasizing the importance of the multivariate approach we employed here.

AB  - Spatial and temporal trends and variation in life-history traits, including age and length at maturation, can be influenced by environmental and anthropogenic processes, including size-selective exploitation. Spawning adults in many wild Alaskan sockeye salmon populations have become shorter at a given age over the past half-century, but their age composition has not changed. These fish have been exploited by a gillnet fishery since the late 1800s that has tended to remove the larger fish. Using a rare, long-term dataset, we estimated probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs) for males and females in nine populations in two basins and correlated these changes with fishery size selection and intensity to determine whether such selection contributed to microevolutionary changes in maturation length. PMRN midpoints decreased in six of nine populations for both sexes, consistent with the harvest. These results support the hypothesis that environmental changes in the ocean (likely from competition) combined with adaptive microevolution (decreased PMRNs) have produced the observed life-history patterns. PMRNs did not decrease in all populations, and we documented differences in magnitude and consistency of size selection and exploitation rates among populations. Incorporating evolutionary considerations and tracking further changes in life-history traits can support continued sustainable exploitation and productivity in these and other exploited natural resources.

AB  - Pollution (e.g. by chemicals, noise, light, heat) is an insidious consequence of anthropogenic activity that affects environments worldwide. Exposure of wildlife to pollutants has the capacity to adversely affect animal communication and behaviour across a wide range of sensory modalities-by not only impacting the signalling environment, but also the way in which animals produce, perceive and interpret signals and cues. Such disturbances, particularly when it comes to sex, can drastically alter fitness. Here, we consider how pollutants disrupt communication and behaviour during mate choice, and the ecological and evolutionary changes such disturbances can engender. We explain how the different stages of mate choice can be affected by pollution, from encountering mates to the final choice, and how changes to these stages can influence individual fitness, population dynamics and community structure. We end with discussing how an understanding of these disturbances can help inform better conservation and management practices and highlight important considerations and avenues for future research.

AB  - The evolutionary implications of the Temperature-Size Rule (TSR) in ectotherms is debatable; it is uncertain whether size decrease with temperature increase is an adaptation or a non-adaptive by-product of some temperature-dependent processes. We tested whether (i) the size of the rotifer Lecane inermis affects fecundity in a way that depends on the combination of low or high temperature and oxygen content and (ii) the proximate mechanism underlying TSR in this species is associated with nuclei size adjustment (a proxy of cell size).
   Small-type and large-type rotifers were obtained by culturing at different temperatures prior to the experiment and then exposed to combinations of two temperature and two oxygen conditions. Fecundity was estimated and used as a measure of fitness. Nuclei and body sizes were measured to examine the response to both environmental factors tested.
   The results show the following for L. inermis. (i) Body size affects fecundity in response to both temperature and oxygen, supporting a hypothesis regarding the contribution of oxygen in TSR. (ii) Large individuals are generally more fecund than small ones; however, under a combination of high temperature and poor oxygen conditions, small individuals are more fecund than large ones, in accordance with a hypothesis of the adaptive significance of TSR. (iii) The body size response to temperature is realised by nuclei size adjustment. (iv) Nuclei size changes in response to temperature and oxygen conditions, in agreement with hypotheses on the cellular mechanism underlying TSR and on a contribution of oxygen availability in TSR. These results serve as empirical evidence for the adaptive significance of TSR and validation of the cellular mechanism for the observed response. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. The present study was conducted to compare body weight, daily weight gain, relative growth rate, food intake, food conversion efficiency, abdominal fat weight, thyroid weight, plasma T4 concentration, body temperature, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production and heat production among three Japanese-quail lines selected for body weight: a random bred line (RR) and lines for large (LL) or small (SS) body weight.
   2. T4 concentration increased in the order SS, RR, LL in both sexes and did not vary significantly between sexes; the SS line had a significantly higher value than that of the LL line.
   3. The body temperatures of SS, RR and LL lines were 42.45, 42.03 and 41.25-degrees-C in males, and 42.7, 42.03 and 41-63-degrees-C in females. 4. The oxygen consumptions of SS, RR and LL lines were 63.4, 46.0 and 43.8 ml/kgW0.75 min. in males, and 61.4, 44.8 and 37.2 in females. The value for SS was significantly higher than those of RR and LL lines in both sexes (P < 0.01). The carbon dioxide productions of SS, RR and LL lines were 31.8, 33.8 and 27.3 ml/kgW0.75 min. in males, and 31.2, 31.9 and 27.3 in females. In both sexes, that of the LL line was significantly lower than those of the SS and RR lines (P < 0.01).
   6. The heat productions of SS, RR and LL lines were 1.178, 0.994 and 0.842 kJ/kgW0.75 min. in males, and 1.142, 0.879 and 0.736 in females. In both sexes, the heat production of the SS line was higher than those of the RR and LL lines (P < 0.01).
   7. It was demonstrated that selection for body weight in Japanese quail was accompanied not only by changes in growth rate and conversion efficiency but also by changes in thyroid function and energy metabolism.

AB  - 1. Climate change has been occurring at unprecedented rates and its impacts on biological populations is beginning to be well documented in the literature. For many C, species, however, long-term records are not available, and trends have not been documented.
   2. Using museum specimens from southern USA, we show that the stream-dwelling beetle Gyretes sinuatus has shown an 8% increase in body size and change in body shape (fineness ratio) from 1928 to 1988. Any directional morphological change observed over time could be an indicator of a microevolutionary response.
   3. During these 60 years, there have also been changes in temperature, precipitation, and location of collection sites. Unlike the global trend, mean annual temperature in the , region has decreased, and furthermore, total annual precipitation has increased. By investigating, how these various ecological and geographical variables may affect body size and shape, we can examine which pressures may promote larger and/or thinner beetles.
   4. Results indicate that mean annual temperature was the most predictive variable for the change in size and shape. We suggest there is an adaptive role for temperature on body size and shape of stream dwelling organisms.
   5. We found that museum specimens can be invaluable resources of information when collection date and location information is available. We promote the use of such specimens for future studies of the morphological response to climate change.

AB  - The behaviour of males emerging/maturing/arriving earlier than females is called protandry. Among insects, protandry has been reported only in those that are seasonal. This is probably because discrete generations, a requisite for protandry, are often reported in insects from seasonal environments. In what may be the first evidence for aseasonal multivoltine insects, we report protandry in Opisina arenosella, a tropical moth with discrete generations. The mean emergence time for males of Opisina was significantly earlier than that of females and the proportion of females in the population increased with progress in the flight period, suggesting protandry. Field-activity pattern of moths, monitored using light traps, showed that the peak activity period for males was earlier than that of females, a trend similar to that of the emergence pattern. Further, through laboratory studies on developmental biology, protandry was consistently observed over a range of temperatures (22-34 degrees C) normally prevalent in the study area, suggesting that protandry per se may not be a function of seasonality. We attribute protandry in Opisina to sexual selection for early male emergence. We discuss why protandry among aseasonal insects cannot result from selection for body size in males or females, and suggest that protandry and smaller male body size should not be related to availability of food. The evidences provided in this communication may open opportunities for exploring reproductive asynchrony in general, and protandry in particular, among aseasonal insects.

AB  - A feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of dietary heat-killed Lactobacillus plantarum L-137 (HK L-137) on growth performance, digestive, non-specific immune and phagocytosis of sea cucumber, Apostichopus japonicus. Sea cucumbers (initial body weight 1.35 +/- 0.04g) were fed diets supplemented with five levels of HK L-137 (0, 0.005, 0.025, 0.05 and 0.25g HK L-137kg(-1) diets) for 60days. Results indicated sea cucumbers fed with diets containing 0.05 and 0.25g HK L-137kg(-1) diets showed significantly (P<0.05) higher body weight gain and specific growth rate than other groups. Sea cucumbers fed with diets containing 0.05 and 0.25g HK L-137kg(-1) diets showed significantly (P<0.05) higher protease activity than control group. Higher amylase, lysozyme and phagocytic activities were found in 0.25g HK L-137kg(-1) diet group. Higher superoxide dismutase enzyme and alkaline phosphatase activity was found in 0.05g HK L-137kg(-1). While no significant differences (P>0.05) were found in acid phosphatase activity. These results suggested that dietary supplementation of 0.05g HK L-137 kg(-1) diets would have benefit on growth, digestive enzymes and several non-specific immune parameters of sea cucumber.

AB  - Color polymorphisms in general and melanism in particular have been the focus of many evolutionary adaptation studies. In lizards of the genus Liolaemus Wiegmann, 1834, patterns of melanism have been poorly studied, although they have been used as diagnostic characters for identifying and describing new species. We investigated the relationships between melanism, body size, sex, and time in a population of Rawson Lizard (Liolaemus xanthoviridis Cei and Scolaro, 1980) with extensive ventral melanism. The study took place in Bahia Isla Escondida, Chubut (Argentina), during three summer seasons (2012 to 2014). We tagged each individual, recorded body measurements and sex, and took ventral photographs to estimate the proportion of melanism. Our results showed that ventral melanism increased over time as each individual increased its snout-vent length (SVL). Body size explained 44% of the variation in melanism and males were more melanistic than females. Previous comparative studies of lizards in this species group showed no relationship between melanism and different taxonomic units or with thermal functionality. Here, we present evidence suggesting that melanism might be a character with an ontogenetic origin that is strongly associated with sex and body size. This pattern could be shared among species of this group of lizards, and even more importantly, it may be related to variable selection forces occurring throughout ontogeny.

AB  - Range expansions can be shaped by sex differences in behaviours and other phenotypic traits affecting dispersal and reproduction.
   Here, we investigate sex differences in morphology, behaviour and genomic population differentiation along a climate-mediated range expansion in the common bluetail damselfly (Ischnura elegans) in northern Europe.
   We sampled 65 sites along a 583-km gradient spanning the I. elegans range in Sweden and quantified latitudinal gradients in site relative abundance, sex ratio and sex-specific shifts in body size and mating status (a measure of sexual selection). Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 426 individuals from 25 sites, we further investigated sex-specific landscape and climatic effects on neutral genetic connectivity and migration patterns.
   We found evidence for sex differences associated with the I. elegans range expansion, namely (a) increased male body size with latitude, but no latitudinal effect on female body size, resulting in reduced sexual dimorphism towards the range limit, (b) a steeper decline in male genetic similarity with increasing geographic distance than in females, (c) male-biased genetic migration propensity and (d) a latitudinal cline in migration distance (increasing migratory distances towards the range margin), which was stronger in males. Cooler mean annual temperatures towards the range limit were associated with increased resistance to gene flow in both sexes. Sex ratios became increasingly male biased towards the range limit, and there was evidence for a changed sexual selection regime shifting from favouring larger males in the south to favouring smaller males in the north.
   Our findings suggest sex-specific spatial phenotype sorting at the range limit, where larger males disperse more under higher landscape resistance associated with cooler climates. The combination of latitudinal gradients in sex-biased dispersal, increasing male body size and (reduced) sexual size dimorphism should have emergent consequences for sexual selection dynamics and the mating system at the expanding range front. Our study illustrates the importance of considering sex differences in the study of range expansions driven by ongoing climate change.

To study whether plasticity can evolve under current climate change, we quantified selection and genetic variation in both the elevation (RNE) and slope (RNS) of the breeding time reaction norm in a long-term (1973-2016) study population of great tits (Parus major). The optimal RNE (the caterpillar biomass peak date regressed against the temperature used as cue by great tits) changed over time, whereas the optimal RNS did not. Concordantly, we found strong directional selection on RNE, but not RNS, of egg-laying date in the second third of the study period; this selection subsequently waned, potentially due to increased between-year variability in optimal laying dates. We found individual and additive genetic variation in RNE but, contrary to previous studies on our population, not in RNS. The predicted and observed evolutionary change in RNE was, however, marginal, due to low heritability and the sex limitation of laying date. We conclude that adaptation to climate change can only occur via micro-evolution of RNE, but this will necessarily be slow and potentially hampered by increased variability in phenotypic optima.

AB  - Body size is a quantitative trait that is closely associated to fitness and under the control of both genetic and environmental factors. While developmental plasticity for this and other traits is heritable and under selection, little is known about the genetic basis for variation in plasticity that can provide the raw material for its evolution. We quantified genetic variation for body size plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster by measuring thorax and abdomen length of females reared at two temperatures from a panel representing naturally segregating alleles, the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). We found variation between genotypes for the levels and direction of thermal plasticity in size of both body parts. We then used a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) approach to unravel the genetic basis of inter-genotype variation in body size plasticity, and used different approaches to validate selected QTLs and to explore potential pleiotropic effects. We found mostly "private QTLs", with little overlap between the candidate loci underlying variation in plasticity for thorax versus abdomen size, for different properties of the plastic response, and for size versus size plasticity. We also found that the putative functions of plasticity QTLs were diverse and that alleles for higher plasticity were found at lower frequencies in the target population. Importantly, a number of our plasticity QTLs have been targets of selection in other populations. Our data sheds light onto the genetic basis of inter-genotype variation in size plasticity that is necessary for its evolution.

AB  - Ecological stoichiometry has emerged as a tool for exploring nutrient demand and evolutionary responses to nutrient limitation. Previous studies of insects have found predictable variability in stoichiometry, both in relation to body size and trophic mode, at ordinal levels or higher. Our study further examines the evolutionary and ecological lability in these traits by comparing the effects of body size, trophic mode (larval and adult) and larval habitat on the stoichiometry of insects within one order (Diptera). The study also expands on previous work by analyzing trophic mode both at coarse (detritivore, herbivore, predator) and fine (high- vs low- nutrient quality resources within trophic categories) scales and by comparing nutrient stoichiometry in two geographical regions, Sweden and Arizona. As predicted, adults feeding on nectar or pollen had the lowest body N content in the dataset. Additionally, for Diptera with predatory larvae, species low N diets had lower body N content than those with high N diets. However, body N content was not consistently lower for all species with low N resources, as species feeding on plant material were indistinguishable in stoichiometry from predators with high N diets. We suggest that these results emerge because larval resource exploitation is poorly understood in herbivorous Diptera species. Body P content for Swedish Diptera decreased with body size for all trophic modes, and the only difference among trophic modes was that blood feeders had higher P content than other groups. The regional comparison further showed that the allometry of body P content is a labile trait that may vary at regional scales, as there was no allometric scaling of body P content in the Arizona data set, in contrast to the Swedish data set. These results are not easily explained by existing theoretical frameworks, but instead point to a general context-dependence of P stoichiometry, which should now be a focus for future work.

AB  - Tenebrionidae are one of the largest families of beetles and are known for their adaptations to hot and dry climates. An increase in body size also increases the volume/surface area ratio, which reduces transpiration, and hence water loss. If an increase in body size is an important adaptation in tenebrionids to cope with increasing aridity, we expect a correlation between body size and climatic gradients in the major tenebrionid clades. Alternatively, we can postulate that arid climates do not drive body size evolution, but rather select, from a wider fauna containing species of any size, those that have larger bodies. In this case we expect that drier regions will host faunas that contain, on average, larger species. To test the first hypothesis, we correlated inter-specific body size variation in the main tenebrionid clades with climatic gradients in Europe. We found only weak trends. To test the second hypothesis, we regressed mean body size of European country faunas against climatic characteristics. We found a strong increase in body size in southern faunas experiencing hot and dry climates. Therefore, increase in body size is not a major adaptation in tenebrionid evolution, but climate is an important filtering factor that determines a prevalence of larger species in southern Europe.

AB  - Egg retention (ER) and intrauterine embryonic development (IED) have been considered intermediate steps in the evolution from oviparity to viviparity. Sceloporus aeneus is an oviparous lizard that is closely related to the viviparous species (Sceloporus bicanthalis). The present study addresses the following 2 questions: 1) Are intermediate stages of egg retention (ER and IED) present in populations of Sceloporus aeneus? and 2) Are ER and/or IED explained by elevation, precipitation or phylogenetic effects? Results indicate that in S. aeneus, ER differs among populations. ER was negatively related to altitude and pluvial precipitation, whereas average environmental temperature had no effect on ER or IER. In contrast to previous observations of oviparous species related to viviparous species, populations of S. aeneus with advanced IED are associated with environmental factors such as low elevation and aridity instead of high elevation and cold climate, whereas the comparative analysis shows that there are no significative evolutionary changes throughout the phylogeny, which means that the altitude has no effect on the transition to the evolution of viviparity in S. aeneus-S bicanthalis.

AB  - Environmental characteristics of neighboring locations are generally more similar than those of distant locations. Selection pressures due to parasitism and other environmental conditions shape life history traits of hosts; thus, the probability of parasitism should be associated with the strength of spatial autocorrelation in life history and defensive traits of their hosts. Here we test this hypothesis in three different subpopulations of Magpie (Pica pica) parasitized by the Great Spotted Cuckoo (Clamator glandarius) during three breeding seasons. In some of the years and study plots, we found evidence of positive spatial autocorrelations for clutch size and parasitism rate, but not for laying date. As predicted, brood parasitism was associated with the strength of these spatial autocorrelations. Magpies that bred close to each other in areas of high risk of parasitism responded similarly to experimental parasitic eggs. Moreover, an elevated risk of parasitism eliminated the spatial autocorrelation for clutch size, which became randomly distributed. We discuss possible mechanisms explaining these associations, which may have important consequences for estimating evolutionary responses of hosts to parasitic infections and, therefore, for epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary studies of host-parasite relationships.

AB  - Species' range edges are expanding to both warmer and cooler regions. Yet, no studies directly compared the changes in range-limiting traits within the same species during both types of range expansions. To increase our mechanistic understanding of range expansions, it is crucial to disentangle the contributions of plastic and genetic changes in these traits. The aim of this study was to test for plastic and evolutionary changes in heat tolerance, life history, and behavior, and compare these during range expansions toward warmer and cooler regions. Using laboratory experiments we reconstructed the thermal performance curves (TPCurves) of larval life history (survival, growth, and development rates) and larval heat tolerance (CTmax) across two recent range expansions from the core populations in southern France toward a warmer (southeastern Spain) and a cooler (northwestern Spain) region in Europe by the damselflyIschnura elegans. First-generation larvae from field-collected mothers were reared across a range of temperatures (16 degrees-28 degrees C) in incubators. The range expansion to the warmer region was associated with the evolution of a greater ability to cope with high temperatures (increased mean and thermal plasticity of CTmax), faster development, and, in part, a faster growth, indicating a higher time constraints caused by a shorter time frame available for larval development associated with a transition to a greater voltinism. Our results thereby support the emerging pattern that plasticity in heat tolerance alone is inadequate to adapt to new thermal regimes. The range expansion to the cooler region was associated with faster growth indicating countergradient variation without a change in CTmax. The evolution of a faster growth rate during both range expansions could be explained by a greater digestive efficiency rather than an increased food intake. Our results highlight that range expansions to warmer and cooler regions can result in similar evolutionary changes in the TPCurves for life history, and no opposite changes in heat tolerance.

AB  - Body size often shows adaptive clines in many ectotherms across altitude and latitude, but little is known about the genetic basis of these adaptive clines. Here we identify a polymorphism in the Dca (Drosophila cold acclimation) gene in Drosophila melanogaster that influences wing size, affects wing: thorax allometry and also controls a substantial proportion of the clinal wing-size variation. A polymorphism in the promoter region of Dca had two common alleles showing strong reciprocal clinal variation in frequency with latitude along the east coast of Australia. The Dca-237 allele increased towards the tropics where wing size is smaller. A within-population association study highlighted that an increase in the frequency of this allele decreased wing size but did not influence thorax size. A manipulated increase in the level of expression of Dca achieved through UAS-GAL4 was associated with a decrease in wing size but had no effect on thorax size. This was consistent with higher Dca expression levels in family lines with higher frequency of the Dca-237 allele. Genetic variation in the promoter region of the Dca gene appears to influence adaptive size variation in the eastern Australian cline of Drosophila melanogaster and accounts for more than 10% of the genetic variation in size within and between populations.

AB  - Ectothermic animals like fishes are extremely dependent on temperature, as they are not able to change body temperature physiologically. When populations are found in isolated water bodies such as small lakes they will have to respond to stressful high temperatures by behavioral avoidance, phenotypic plasticity or microevolutionary change. We analyzed threespine sticklebacks from two large and two small lakes, representing different isolated populations. We determined maximum critical thermal limits (CTmax) and the associated gene expression responses in three heat shock (hsp60, hsp70, hsp90) and two key metabolic (idh2, fbp2) genes at ecologically relevant moderate heat stress (26 degrees C) as well as at the critical thermal limit (CTmax). CTmax showed slight variation across populations with no strong indication of local adaptation. Likewise, there was no strong evidence for local adaptation at the level of gene expression. The expression of the metabolic genes indicated a shift from aerobic towards anaerobic energy production with extreme heat stress. We conclude that threespine sticklebacks do not show severe stress during the warmest temperatures they are likely to encounter during current temperature regimes in Denmark, and following this show no sign of local adaptation even in small, isolated water bodies.

AB  - What can living marine bivalves tell us about speciation in the marine environment? Three sets of literature data on Recent marine bivalves are analyzed for insight into the mechanisms behind bivalve speciation processes. (1) A dataset of all marine bivalves described as new to science during the years 2000-2009 (381 species in 135 published papers) reveals that malacologists are still describing undiscovered biodiversity, based largely upon newly collected expedition material. New species include those of both large and small body size (0.86-500 mm, mean 28 mm), from 51 bivalve families, all oceanic basins, and a wide range of water depths (intertidal to 7,333 m, mean 444 m). External shell characters dominate the diagnoses but are increasingly supplemented by anatomical, molecular, and phylogenetic evidence. Endemism is low (2.6%) when stated as such although another 57% of species were described as (thus far) restricted to a particular geographic region, habitat, or both. High percentages of deep-water and otherwise (geographically or ecologically) restricted species, plus several case studies, suggest that physiological specialization, in the form of bathymetric limits, unique dietary adaptations, or host/symbiont associations, plays an important role in setting up barriers to gene flow in marine bivalves. (2) Bivalve species complexes [i.e., closely related, cryptic (possibly sibling) species with obscure morphological boundaries, or highly variable single species] also imply factors involved in ongoing speciation. Seven recently studied marine taxa are presented in which species complexes are either revealed or resolved by molecular data. Apparent barriers to gene flow are in most cases physiological (sympatric), or (in two cases) physical (allopatric), and in one case can be readily broken down by anthropogenic transport. (3) Two recent published phylogenetic analyses are discussed that show (a) disparately sized sister taxa with their synapomorphies (glochidia in Unionoidea; chemosymbiotic bacteria and mucus-tube feeding in Lucinoidea; cruciform muscle and long siphons in Tellinoidea; aortic bulb in Veneroidea) as recognized innovations that facilitated radiation of the more species-rich sister, and (b) polytomies in Lucinoidea that suggest rapid ongoing evolutionary change in several clades. Together these three sets of published data defeat the concept of a Marine Speciation Paradox in bivalves speciation clues are merely subtler in marine bivalves and most often act at the physiological, rather than physical, level.

AB  - The physical and ecological fingerprints' of anthropogenic climate change over the past century are now well documented in many environments and taxa. We reviewed the evidence for phenotypic responses to recent climate change in fish. Changes in the timing of migration and reproduction, age at maturity, age at juvenile migration, growth, survival and fecundity were associated primarily with changes in temperature. Although these traits can evolve rapidly, only two studies attributed phenotypic changes formally to evolutionary mechanisms. The correlation-based methods most frequently employed point largely to fine-grained' population responses to environmental variability (i.e. rapid phenotypic changes relative to generation time), consistent with plastic mechanisms. Ultimately, many species will likely adapt to long-term warming trends overlaid on natural climate oscillations. Considering the strong plasticity in all traits studied, we recommend development and expanded use of methods capable of detecting evolutionary change, such as the long term study of selection coefficients and temporal shifts in reaction norms, and increased attention to forecasting adaptive change in response to the synergistic interactions of the multiple selection pressures likely to be associated with climate change.

AB  - Aim To measure latitude-related body size variation in field-collected Paropsis atomaria Olivier (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) individuals and to conduct common-garden experiments to determine whether such variation is due to phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation.
   Location Four collection sites from the east coast of Australia were selected for our present field collections: Canberra (latitude 35 degrees 19' S), Bangalow (latitude 28 degrees 43' S), Beerburrum (latitude 26 degrees 58' S) and Lowmead (latitude 24 degrees 29' S). Museum specimens collected over the past 100 years and covering the same geographical area as the present field collections came from one state, one national and one private collection.
   Methods Body size (pronotum width) was measured for 118 field-collected beetles and 302 specimens from collections. We then reared larvae from the latitudinal extremes (Canberra and Lowmead) to determine whether the size cline was the result of phenotypic plasticity or evolved differences (= local adaptation) between sites.
   Results Beetles decreased in size with increasing latitude, representing a converse Bergmann cline. A decrease in developmental temperature produced larger adults for both Lowmead (low latitude) and Canberra (high latitude) individuals, and those from Lowmead were larger than those from Canberra when reared under identical conditions.
   Main conclusions The converse Bergmann cline in P. atomaria is likely to be the result of local adaptation to season length.

AB  - Zebra danios (Brachydanio rerio) swim in a burst-and-coast mode. Most swimming bouts consist of a single tail flick and a coasting phase, during which the fish keeps its body straight. When visualising the flow in a horizontal section through the wake, the effects of the flow regime become apparent in the structure of the wake. In a two-dimensional, medio-frontal view of the flow, larvae and adults shed two vortices at the tail during the burst phase. These vortices resemble a cross section through a large-core vortex ring: two vortex cores packed close together with the central flow directed away from the fish. This flow pattern can be observed in larvae (body length approximately 4mm) at Reynolds numbers below 100 as well as in adult fish (body length approximately 35mm) at Reynolds numbers above 1000. Larval vortices differ from those of adult zebra danios mainly in their relatively wider vortex cores (higher ratio of core radius to ring radius) and their lower vortex circulation, Both effects result from the increased importance of viscosity on larval flows. During the coasting phase, larval and adult flows again differ because of the changing importance of viscosity. The high viscosity of the water causes large vortical flows adjacent to the larva's body. These regions of high vorticity represent the huge body of water dragged along by the larva, and they cause the larva to stop almost immediately after thrust generation ceases. No such areas of high vorticity are visible adjacent to adult zebra danios performing a comparable swimming manoeuvre. The rapid decrease in vortex circulation and the severe reduction in the coasting distance due to viscous drag contribute to the high cost that larvae - unlike adult fish face when using a burst-and-coast swimming style.

AB  - Fecundity, egg weight, hatching success of eggs, and adult (offspring) weight were compared between three geographically separated populations (i.e., subspecies) of the butterfly Lycaena hippothoe. All these traits differed substantially between populations. Our data suggest that, on an interpopulational level, egg size is traded off against egg number, egg size varies independent of adult size, and there is (given equal egg size) a positive relationship between adult weight (body size) and fecundity. The significantly heavier eggs of the alpine population Lycaena hippothoe eurydame showed strikingly increased hatchability, especially at high temperatures, as compared to the other populations. However, the ultimate reasons favoring large egg size in the alpine population, whether as a result of direct selection on egg size, as a correlated response based on other selective pressures, or reflecting relaxed selection for maximized fecundity, remain to be discovered.

AB  - The extent to which mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation is involved in adaptive evolutionary change is currently being reevaluated. In particular, emerging evidence suggests that mtDNA genes coevolve with the nuclear genes with which they interact to form the energy producing enzyme complexes in the mitochondria. This suggests that intergenomic epistasis between mitochondrial and nuclear genes may affect whole-organism metabolic phenotypes. Here, we use crossed combinations of mitochondrial and nuclear lineages of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus and assay metabolic rate under two different temperature regimes. Metabolic rate was affected by an interaction between the mitochondrial and nuclear lineages and the temperature regime. Sequence data suggests that mitochondrial genetic variation has a role in determining the outcome of this interaction. Our genetic dissection of metabolic rate reveals a high level of complexity, encompassing genetic interactions over two genomes, and genotype x genotype x environment interactions. The evolutionary implications of these results are twofold. First, because metabolic rate is at the root of life histories, our results provide insights into the complexity of life-history evolution in general, and thermal adaptation in particular. Second, our results suggest a mechanism that could contribute to the maintenance of nonneutral mtDNA polymorphism.

AB  - A Physique index was devised for evaluation of fatness in Japanese macaques. Parameters for a function of the physique index were statistically obtained from body weight and trunk length of immature monkeys of Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University. Index-male is expressed as 1.01 * [Body weight (Kg)]* [Anterior trunk length](-2,3) * 10(7), and Index-female is 1.05 * [Body weight]* [Anterior trunk length](-2,3) * 10(7). The indices show an age change pattern common to the both sexes; an infants index which starts at 100 decreases with age during juvenile period till four years of age, and then rapidly increases to 120 in males and to 110 in females. The index of males keeps gradual increase, but that of females neither increases nor decreases. Application of physique index to various Japanese monkey groups living in different environments, shows that monkeys in the northern and heavy-snow falling area have a larger index (130-140), and those in the warmer area have a smaller index (ca. 90-100). The larger index means that they show adaptability for winter by means of preservation of energy. Influence of food control is so strong as to change the physique index widely.

AB  - Body size is a key life-history trait that influences many aspects of an animal's biology and is shaped by a variety of factors, both genetic and environmental. While we know that locally-adapted populations differ in the extent to which body size responds plastically to environmental conditions like diet, we have a limited understanding of what causes these differences. We hypothesized that populations could differ in the way body size responds to nutrition either by modulating growth rate, development time, feeding rate, or a combination of the above. Using three locally-adapted populations of Drosophila melanogaster from along the east coast of Australia, we investigated body size plasticity across five different diets. We then assessed how these populations differed in feeding behaviour and developmental timing on each of the diets. We observed population-specific plastic responses to nutrition for body size and feeding rate, but not development time. However, differences in feeding rate did not fully explain the differences in the way body size responded to diet. Thus, we conclude that body size variation in locally-adapted populations is shaped by a combination of growth rate and feeding behaviour. This paves the way for further studies that explore how differences in the regulation of the genetic pathways that control feeding behaviour and growth rate contribute to population-specific responses of body size to diet.

AB  - Many aspects of human biology can be reconstructed from skeletal and fossil remains. The endocranial vasculature runs through cerebral, connective, and bone elements, where it is influenced by the functional and structural relationships among these different components of the endocranial system. The imprints and traces of these vessels can be used to analyze the craniovascular features of extinct species or historical samples. These traits can supply information about evolutionary adaptation, the mutual relationships between and within populations, and individual life history. In particular, bioarchaeology considers individual morphological variants as indicators of temporal and spatial relatedness and population structure, whereas paleoanthropology studies functional aspects to consider evolutionary changes and phylogenetic processes. Forensic science can investigate the cause of death associated with craniovascular pathologies by relying on morphological variations for individual identification. In this review, we consider the imprints of middle meningeal vessels, dural venous sinuses, emissary veins, and diploic veins. We summarize the most relevant morphological and functional information about craniovascular features and their applications in retrospective anthropological and medical fields, as well as describing the methodological issues associated with the sampling and quantitative evaluation of these elusive vascular remnants imprinted in the cranial bones.

AB  - Our perspective highlights potentially important links between disparate fieldsbiological oceanography, climate change research, and experimental evolutionary biology. We focus on one important functional groupphotoautotrophic microbes (phytoplankton), which are responsible for approximate to 50% of global primary productivity. Global climate change currently results in the simultaneous change of several conditions such as warming, acidification, and nutrient supply. It thus has the potential to dramatically change phytoplankton physiology, community composition, and may result in adaptive evolution. Although their large population sizes, standing genetic variation, and rapid turnover time should promote swift evolutionary change, oceanographers have focussed on describing patterns of present day physiological differentiation rather than measure potential adaptation in evolution experiments, the only direct way to address whether and at which rate phytoplankton species will adapt to environmental change. Important open questions are (1) is adaptation limited by existing genetic variation or fundamental constraints? (2) Will complex ecological settings such as gradual versus abrupt environmental change influence adaptation processes? (3) How will increasing environmental variability affect the evolution of phenotypic plasticity patterns? Because marine phytoplankton species display rapid acclimation capacity (phenotypic buffering), a systematic study of reaction norms renders them particularly interesting to the evolutionary biology research community.

AB  - Plasticity and evolution are two processes allowing populations to respond to environmental changes, but how both are related and impact each other remains controversial. We studied plastic and evolutionary responses in gene expression ofTribolium castaneumafter exposure of the beetles to new environments that differed from ancestral conditions in temperature, humidity or both. Using experimental evolution with 10 replicated lines per condition, we were able to demonstrate adaptation after 20 generations. We measured whole-transcriptome gene expression with RNA-sequencing to infer evolutionary and plastic changes. We found more evidence for changes in mean expression (shift in the intercept of reaction norms) in adapted lines than for changes in plasticity (shifts in slopes). Plasticity was mainly preserved in selected lines and was responsible for a large part of the phenotypic divergence in expression between ancestral and new conditions. However, we found that genes with the largest evolutionary changes in expression also evolved reduced plasticity and often showed expression levels closer to the ancestral stage. Results obtained in the three different conditions were similar, suggesting that restoration of ancestral expression levels during adaptation is a general evolutionary pattern. With a larger sample in the most stressful condition, we were able to detect a positive correlation between the proportion of genes with reversion of the ancestral plastic response and mean fitness per selection line.

AB  - The involvement of heat-inducible genes, including the heat-shock genes, in the acute response to temperature stress is well established. However, their importance in genetic adaptation to long-term temperature stress is less clear. Here we use high-density arrays to examine changes in expression for 35 heat-inducible genes in three independent lines of Escherichia coli that evolved at high temperature (41.5degreesC) for 2,000 generations. These lines exhibited significant changes in heat-inducible gene expression relative to their ancestor, including parallel changes in fkpA, gapA, and hslT. As a group, the heat-inducible genes were significantly more likely than noncandidate genes to have evolved changes in expression. Genes encoding molecular chaperones and ATP-dependent proteases, key components of the cytoplasmic stress response, exhibit relatively little expression change; whereas genes with periplasmic functions exhibit significant expression changes suggesting a key role for the extracytoplasmic stress response in the adaptation to high temperature. Following acclimation at 41.5degreesC, two of the three lines exhibited significantly improved survival at 50degreesC, indicating changes in inducible thermotolerance. Thus evolution at high temperature led to significant changes at the molecular level in heat-inducible gene expression and at the organismal level in inducible thermotolerance and fitness.

AB  - Background In insect species like Drosophila melanogaster, evolution of increased resistance or evolution of particular traits under specific environmental conditions can lead to energy trade-offs with other crucial life-history traits. Adaptation to cold stress can, in principle, involve modification of reproductive traits and physiological responses. Reproductive traits carry a substantial cost; and therefore, the evolution of reproductive traits in response to cold stress could potentially lead to trade-offs with other life-history traits. We have successfully selected replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster for increased resistance to cold shock for over 33 generations. In these populations, the ability to recover from cold shock, mate, and lay fertile eggs 24 h post cold shock is under selection. These populations have evolved a suite of reproductive traits including increased egg viability, male mating ability, and siring ability post cold shock. These populations also show elevated mating rate both with and without cold shock. In the present study, we quantified a suite of life-history related traits in these populations to assess if evolution of cold shock resistance in these populations comes at a cost of other life-history traits. Results To assess life-history cost, we measured egg viability, mating frequency, longevity, lifetime fecundity, adult mortality, larva to adult development time, larvae to adults survival, and body weight in the cold shock selected populations and their controls under two treatments (a) post cold chock and (b) without cold shock. Twenty-four hours post cold shock, the selected population had significantly higher egg viability and mating frequency compared to control populations indicating that they have higher cold shock resistance. Selected populations had significantly longer pre-adult development time compared to their control populations. Females from the selected populations had higher body weight compared to their control populations. However, we did not find any significant difference between the selected and control populations in longevity, lifetime fecundity, adult mortality, larvae to adults survival, and male body weight under the cold chock or no cold shock treatments. Conclusions These findings suggest that cold shock selected populations have evolved higher mating frequency and egg viability. However, there is no apparent life-history associated cost with the evolution of egg viability and reproductive performances under the cold stress condition.

AB  - Agriculture plays an important role in the development of an agricultural country. Monsoon is irregular, and uneven water is a major problem throughout the year. All of this leads to insufficient production and low productivity. The realization of the agricultural sector?s scientific method will lead to a fundamental change in crop productivity by improving agricultural technology efficiency. The Internet of Things (IoT), the rapid rise of the technology, from statistics to quantitative methods, resulting in the industry?s smart agriculture has re-designed almost all industries. This revolutionary change, to shake the existing methods, has created a series of challenges and new opportunities. The proposed smart agriculture design-based implementation of IoT and Embedded System (ES) development and embedded sensors in the smart agricultural sector monitoring. A built-in sensor temperature, soil moisture, and rain detection sensor. IoT and the embedded system can help farmers? efforts by minimizing hard work to improve crop yields and economic growth. Embedded System (ES) and Internet of Things (IoT), yield, quality of soil temperature, can predict the water level and arrange for proper crop delivery. Therefore, to improve the breeding process, thereby increasing the breeding output, a system is needed to reduce the human effort.

AB  - A 12-week feeding trial was conducted to study the effect of dietary lipid level on growth performance of juvenile Sacramento splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus at 18degreesC. We selected this temperature to simulate their natural habitats, although an earlier study showed that their optimum temperature was 22-26degreesC. Six isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets were formulated to contain 2-12% lipid in 2% increments and dietary lipid was an equal mix of corn oil and Q liver oil. Fish with an average initial body weigh of 9.0+/-0.2 g (mean+/-SE, n=24) were kept in a 24-tank flow-through system with 15 fish per tank, and each die; was randomly assigned to four replicate tanks of fish. Fish were fed 3.0% of their body weight per day by automatic feeders, which dispensed a small amount of feed every few minutes in daylight hours. Body weight and feed efficiency increased significantly with increasing dietary lipid level tip to 8%. Fish fed the diet containing 8% lipid showed significantly higher body weight increase and feed efficiency than those fed the diets containing less than 6% lipid. Dietary lipid level did not affect the hepatosomatic index, condition factor., and intraperitoneal fat ratio. Whole-body moisture was significantly lower but lipid was higher in fish fed the diet containing 8% lipid than in those fed the diets containing less than 6% lipid. Histological analysis revealed a higher prevalence of hepatocellular fatty vacuolation in fish fed the diet containing 12% lipid. Based on a broken-line analysis, a dietary lipid level of 8.4% is recommended for juvenile splittail reared at 18degreesC.

AB  - 1. Invasive species present unique natural experiments through which to study evolutionary processes associated with spatial spread, especially with respect to rapid morphological evolution of dispersal-related traits.
   2. The kudzu bug, Megacopta cribraria (Fabricius), established and expanded radially across the southeastern United States beginning in 2009. Here, M. cribraria is used as a model for studying rapid morphological change across an introduced range.
   3. Kudzu bugs were collected throughout the invasive range to test the hypothesis that body and wing size would increase with greater distance from the invasion source owing to dispersal-related selection. The effects of sex, local temperature, and latitude were also evaluated to investigate how such factors might influence body and wing size across this range expansion.
   4. Females were significantly larger than males across all traits. Distance from the invasion core, temperature, and their interaction significantly influenced body size and wing length, suggesting that M. cribraria were larger near the invasion periphery. This was especially pronounced at cooler sites. Sex and distance were found to both weakly influence wing length after removing the effect of body size, suggesting that wing size may be disproportionally larger along the invasion front.
   5. The combined results indicate that a combination of spatial, environmental, and sexual factors must be considered when examining or predicting invasive species responses to new selective pressures and environments.

AB  - Most ectotherms show increased body size at maturity when reared under colder temperatures. In principle. temperature could produce this outcome by influencing growth, proliferation and/or death of epidermal cells. Here we investigated the effects of rearing temperature on the cell size and cell number in the wing blade, the basitarsus of the leg and the cornea of the eye of Drosophila melanogaster from two populations at opposite ends of a South American latitudinal cline. We found that, in both strains of D. melanogaster and in both sexes, a decrease in rearing temperature increases the size of the wings, legs and eyes through an effect on epidermal cell size, with no significant change in cell number. Our results indicate that temperature has a consistent effect on cell size in the Drosophila epidermis and this may also apply to other cell types. In contrast, the evolutionary effects of temperature on the different organs are not consistent. We discuss our findings in the context of growth control in Drosophila. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Understanding how geographic and environmental heterogeneity drive local patterns of genetic variation is a major goal of ecological genomics and a key question in evolutionary biology. The tropical Andes and inter-Andean valleys are shaped by markedly heterogeneous landscapes, where species experience strong selective processes. We examined genome-wide SNP data together with behavioural and ecological traits (mating calls and body size) known to contribute to genetic isolation in anurans in the banana tree-dwelling frog, Boana platanera, distributed across an environmental gradient in Central Colombia (northern South America). Here, we analysed the relationships between environmentally (temperature and precipitation) associated genetic and phenotypic differentiation and the potential drivers of isolation by environment along an elevation gradient. We identified candidate SNPs associated with temperature and body size, which follow a clinal pattern of genome-wide differentiation tightly coupled with phenotypic variation: as elevation increases, B. platanera exhibits larger body size and longer call duration with more pulses but lower pulse rate and frequency. Thus, the environmental landscape has rendered a scenario where isolation by environment and candidate loci show concordance with phenotypic divergence in this tropical frog along an elevation gradient in the Colombian Andes. Our study sets the basis for evaluating the role of temperature in the genetic structure and local adaptation in tropical treefrogs and its putative effect on life cycle (embryos, tadpoles, adults) along elevation gradients.

AB  - Responses to short-term selection for knockdown resistance to heat (37 degrees C) in Drosophila melanogaster reared under stressful thigh larval density) and nonstressful (low larval density) conditions were compared. No difference in selection response between density treatments was found. A test of heat resistance (39 degrees C) after pretreatment (37 degrees C) did not reveal an increase in survival for selected lines as compared to controls. Flies reared at high density had higher knockdown resistance throughout the experiment. Resistance to heat was not associated with body size.

AB  - Background The deep-sea may be regarded as a hostile living environment, due to low temperature, high hydrostatic pressure, and limited food and light. Isopods, a species-rich group of crustaceans, are widely distributed across different environments including the deep sea and as such are a useful model for studying adaptation, migration, and speciation. Similar to other deep-sea organisms, giant isopods have larger body size than their shallow water relatives and have large stomachs and fat bodies presumably to store organic reserves. In order to shed light on the genetic basis of these large crustaceans adapting to the oligotrophic environment of deep-sea, the high-quality genome of a deep-sea giant isopod Bathynomus jamesi was sequenced and assembled. Results B. jamesi has a large genome of 5.89 Gb, representing the largest sequenced crustacean genome to date. Its large genome size is mainly attributable to the remarkable proliferation of transposable elements (84%), which may enable high genome plasticity for adaptive evolution. Unlike its relatives with small body size, B. jamesi has expanded gene families related to pathways of thyroid and insulin hormone signaling that potentially contribute to its large body size. Transcriptomic analysis showed that some expanded gene families related to glycolysis and vesicular transport were specifically expressed in its digestive organs. In addition, comparative genomics and gene expression analyses in six tissues suggested that B. jamesi has inefficient lipid degradation, low basal metabolic rate, and bulk food storage, suggesting giant isopods adopt a more efficient mechanism of nutrient absorption, storage, and utilization to provide sustained energy supply for their large body size. Conclusions Taken together, the giant isopod genome may provide a valuable resource for understanding body size evolution and adaptation mechanisms of macrobenthic organisms to deep-sea environments.

AB  - We measured the egg size of six geographic populations of the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, from Florida (30 degreesN) to Ontario (49 degreesN). Populations from northern latitudes produced larger eggs than populations from southern latitudes. Egg size increased with increasing latitude more rapidly when larvae were reared under low rather than high density. One southern (30 degreesN) and one northern (49 degreesN) population of W. smithii that persisted through 10 generations of selection for increased persistence under conditions of chronic thermal- and nutrient-limiting stress (conditions similar to southern rather than northern habitats) produced smaller eggs more rapidly than unselected control lines. However, there were no differences in lifetime fecundity or fertility between control and selected lines. Thus, laboratory evolution in an environment representative of extreme southern latitudes caused evolutionary changes consistent with geographic patterns of egg size. These results implicate temperature as a selective factor influencing the geographic variation of egg size in W. smithii, and demonstrate a novel trade-off in reproductive allocation between egg size and egg maturation time.

AB  - Genetic variation of body size along latitudinal clines is found globally in Drosophila melanogaster, with larger individuals encountered at higher latitudes. Temperature has been implicated as a selective agent for these clines, because the body size of laboratory populations allowed to evolve in culture at lower temperatures is larger. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that larger size is favoured at lower temperature through natural selection on adult males. We measured life-span and age-specific fertility of males from lines of flies artificially selected for body size at two different experimental temperatures. There was an interaction between experimental temperature and body size selection for male fitness; large-line males were fitter than controls at both temperatures, but the difference in fitness was greater at the lower experimental temperature. Smaller males did not perform significantly differently from control males at either experimental temperature. The results imply that thermal selection for larger adult males is at least in part responsible for the evolution of larger body size at lower temperatures in this species. The responsible mechanisms require further investigation.

AB  - Trait-based studies are needed to understand the plastic and genetic responses of organisms to warming. A neglected organismal trait is elemental composition, despite its potential to cascade into effects on the ecosystem level. Warming is predicted to shape elemental composition through shifts in storage molecules associated with responses in growth, body size and metabolic rate. Our goals were to quantify thermal response patterns in body composition and to obtain insights into their underlying drivers and their evolution across latitudes. We reconstructed the thermal response curves (TRCs) for body elemental composition [C (carbon), N (nitrogen) and the C:N ratio] of damselfly larvae from high- and low-latitude populations. Additionally, we quantified the TRCs for survival, growth and development rates and body size to assess local thermal adaptation, as well as the TRCs for metabolic rate and key macromolecules (proteins, fat, sugars and cuticular melanin and chitin) as these may underlie the elemental TRCs. All larvae died at 36 degrees C. Up to 32 degrees C, low-latitude larvae increased growth and development rates and did not suffer increased mortality. Instead, growth and development rates of high-latitude larvae were lower and levelled off at 24 degrees C, and mortality increased at 32 degrees C. This latitude-associated thermal adaptation pattern matched the 'hotter-is-better' hypothesis. With increasing temperatures, low-latitude larvae decreased C:N, while high-latitude larvae increased C:N. These patterns were driven by associated changes in N contents, while C contents did not respond to temperature. Consistent with the temperature-size rule and the thermal melanism hypothesis, body size and melanin levels decreased with warming. While all traits and associated macromolecules (except for metabolic rate that showed thermal compensation) assumed to underlie thermal responses in elemental composition showed thermal plasticity, these were largely independent and none could explain the stoichiometric TRCs. Our results highlight that thermal responses in elemental composition cannot be explained by traditionally assumed drivers, asking for a broader perspective including the thermal dependence of elemental fluxes. Another key implication is that thermal evolution can reverse the plastic stoichiometric thermal responses and hence reverse how warming may shape food web dynamics through changes in body composition at different latitudes.

AB  - Genetic parameters and selection responses were obtained for growth, pond survival and cold-water tolerance of Progift blue tilapia (Oreochromis aureus) in China after four generations of multi-trait selection. Blue tilapia from four Chinese hatchery stocks and one from Vietnam were used to compose a synthetic breeding population. About 31,000 tagged fingerlings representing 519 full-sib families in five generations were tested in freshwater earthen ponds in Hainan Province of China. Individual body weights were recorded on 11,000 fish at the expected time of sexual maturation and 22,000 at harvest to estimate genetic parameters for growth rate. An additional 5000 tagged fingerlings representing all families in G(3) and G(4) were challenged to estimate genetic parameters for cold-water tolerance. Heritability (h(2)) estimates for body weight were relatively stable across time of recordings and generations, and was of similar magnitude (0.40 +/- 0.04) when analyzing all harvest data. The h(2) of pond survival was considerably lower (0.05 +/- 0.01 and 0.08 +/- 0.11), while that of cold-water tolerance was intermediate (0.20 +/- 0.04 and 0.30 +/- 0.31) when estimated on the observed and underlying scales. Including all data, effects common to full-sibs other than additive genetic effects (c(2)) accounted for 7% and 1%, respectively, of the total phenotypic variance for body weight at harvest and the two survival traits. Genetic correlation between growth recorded at expected time of sexual maturation and at harvest was very high (0.99 +/- 0.01). The genetic correlation between growth and pond survival was positive (0.15 +/- 0.08), while that between growth and cold-water tolerance was not significantly different from zero (0.02 +/- 0.12). Breeding candidates in the base population (G(0)) were ranked according to their individual breeding values for growth (recorded as body weight at harvest), while those in later generations (G(1)-G(3)) were ranked according to a selection index including individual breeding values for growth and family breeding values for survival traits. A genetic trend analysis based on all grow-out data predicted an accumulated selection response of 168 g (2.16 phenotypic standard deviation units) and an average selection response of 14.0% per generation of selection when using the LS mean of the G(0) as a base line for the comparison. Genetic trend analyses of survival data predicted accumulated selection responses of 8.4 and 1.2%-units higher survival rates in earthen ponds and cold-water challenge tests, respectively. The average inbreeding coefficient (F) was estimated to be 2.1% in the G(4) generation. The results are discussed in a practical context of adapting selective breeding technology to a new aquaculture species and it is concluded that the ongoing selective breeding of blue tilapia in China has resulted in considerable genetic improvements of both growth (about 70% larger body weight at harvest) and pond survival after four generations of multi-trait selection.

AB  - Wolbachia may act as a biological control agent for pest management; in particular, the Wolbachia variant wMelPop (popcorn) shortens host longevity and may be useful for dengue suppression. However, long-term changes in the host and Wolbachia genomes can alter Wolbachia spread and/or host effects that suppress disease. Here, we investigate the phenotypic effects of wMelPop in a non-native host, Drosophila simulans, following artificial transinfection approximately 200 generations ago. Long-term rearing and maintenance of the bacteria were at 19 degrees C in the original I-102 genetic background that was transinfected with the popcorn strain. The bacteria were then introgressed into three massbred backgrounds, and tetracycline was used to create uninfected sublines. The effect of wMelPop on longevity in this species appears to have changed; longevity was no longer reduced at 25 degrees C in some nuclear backgrounds, reflecting different geographical origin, selection or drift, although the reduction was still evident for flies held at 30 degrees C. Wolbachia influenced productivity and viability, and development time in some host backgrounds. These findings suggest that long-term attenuation of Wolbachia effects may compromise the effectiveness of this bacterium in pest control. They also emphasize the importance of host nuclear background on Wolbachia phenotypic effects.

AB  - In ectotherm species like Drosophila, morphometrical quantitative traits exhibit a large amount of phenotypic plasticity as a consequence of developmental temperature. Generally the response curves called reaction norms, are non-linear and exhibit either single max-ma or minima, or a sigmoid shape. Up to now, such complex shapes were mainly considered as non-adaptive, reflecting interactions between internal developmental constraints and the environment. We show that the general, all purpose method of polynomial adjustment provides a convenient way for the description of the norms. From the polynomial parameters, characteristic values with an obvious biological significance (e.g, the temperature of a maximum size), can be calculated and used for comparing populations or species. Experimental data on body pigmentation and body size show that the shapes of the reaction norms are genetically variable and suggest adaptive responses to the environment. The possible occurrence of specific regulatory genes acting on norm shape will be a matter fur further investigations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Morphological differentiation between populations resulting from local adaptations to environmental conditions is likely to be more pronounced in populations with increasing genetic isolation. In a previous study a positive clinal variation in body size was observed in isolated Roesel's bush-cricket, Metrioptera roeselii, populations, but were absent from populations within a continuous distribution at the same latitudinal range. This observational study inferred that there was a phenotypic effect of gene flow on climate-induced selection in this species.
   Methods: To disentangle genetic versus environmental drivers of population differences in morphology, we measured the size of four different body traits in wild-caught individuals from the two most distinct latitudinally-matched pairs of populations occurring at about 60 degrees N latitude in northern Europe, characterised by either restricted or continuous gene flow, and corresponding individuals raised under laboratory conditions.
   Results: Individuals that originated from the genetically isolated populations were always bigger (femur, pronotum and genital appendages) when compared to individuals from latitudinally-matched areas characterised by continuous gene flow between populations. The magnitude of this effect was similar for wild-caught and laboratory-reared individuals. We found that previously observed size cline variation in both male and female crickets was likely to be the result of local genetic adaptation rather than phenotypic plasticity.
   Conclusions: This strongly suggests that restricted gene flow is of major importance for frequencies of alleles that participate in climate-induced selection acting to favour larger phenotypes in isolated populations towards colder latitudes.

AB  - A list of alien ladybird (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) species to Europe was prepared and the history and circumstances of their introductions were determined. Currently there are 12 alien ladybird species in Europe, originating from Australian, Oriental, Nearctic, Palearctic and Afrotropical regions. All of the species were intentionally released as biological control agents and most are coccidophagous species. The aphidophagous Harmonia axyridis is the only ladybird regarded as invasive in Europe. The main factors leading to successful establishment were food relationship, living in different habitats in different geographical regions and geographic origin. We found that successful invaders, in their native areas, showed adaptability to a wide range of conditions compared to non-invasive species. Larger aphidophagous alien ladybirds were found to develop as fast as native species. Characteristics that did not differ between native and alien species are thermal requirements for development, fecundity and body size. However, unlike other alien ladybirds, H. axyridis had higher potential dispersal ability.

AB  - Populations should adapt to the climate at their respective localities. Here, we examined differences in thermal biology between two populations of Podarcis hispanica lizards from areas with different climates. Lizards from the cold, northern mountains attained lower field body temperatures than lizards form the warm, southern plains. However, the larger-body size and darker coloration of northern lizards resulted in slower cooling rates, which may increase efficiency of thermoregulation. Northern populations selected higher temperatures in a thermal gradient, possibly as an adaptation to heat up before conditions changed, as their mountain environment is unpredictable. Finally, lizards from both populations had similar temperature-dependent locomotor performance curves, although southern lizards were relatively faster considering their smaller body size. We suggest that environmental differences may lead to differences in morphology and locally adapted thermal biology in lizards that might allow maximizing thermoregulation in each local climatic conditions.

AB  - We examined the evolutionary response of wing area (a trait highly correlated with other measures of body size) to relative humidity (RH), temperature, and their interaction in Drosophila melanogaster, using replicated lines that had been allowed to evolve at low or high humidity at 18degreesC or at 25degreesC. We found that after 20 weeks of selection (5-10 generations), low RH lines had significantly greater wing areas than high RH lines in both sexes. This evolutionary response may have resulted from selection of larger flies with a smaller surface area for water loss relative to their weight, or as a correlated response to selection on some other unidentified trait. There were no evolutionary effects of temperature on wing area or cell density. This may have been due to the short duration of the selection experiment, and/or counteracting selection pressures on body size at warm temperature.

AB  - Chromosomal inversions often contribute to local adaptation across latitudinal clines, but the underlying selective mechanisms remain poorly understood. We and others have previously shown that a clinal inversion polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster, In(3R)Payne, underpins body size clines along the North American and Australian east coasts. Here, we ask whether this polymorphism also contributes to clinal variation in other fitness-related traits, namely survival traits (lifespan, survival upon starvation and survival upon cold shock). We generated homokaryon lines, either carrying the inverted or standard chromosomal arrangement, isolated from populations approximating the endpoints of the North American cline (Florida, Maine) and phenotyped the flies at two growth temperatures (18 degrees C, 25 degrees C). Across both temperatures, high-latitude flies from Maine lived longer and were more stress resistant than low-latitude flies from Florida, as previously observed. Interestingly, we find that this latitudinal pattern is partly explained by the clinal distribution of the In(3R)P polymorphism, which is at similar to 50% frequency in Florida but absent in Maine: inverted karyotypes tended to be shorter-lived and less stress resistant than uninverted karyotypes. We also detected an interaction between karyotype and temperature on survival traits. As In(3R)P influences body size and multiple survival traits, it can be viewed as a supergene', a cluster of tightly linked loci affecting multiple complex phenotypes. We conjecture that the inversion cline is maintained by fitness trade-offs and balancing selection across geography; elucidating the mechanisms whereby this inversion affects alternative, locally adapted phenotypes across the cline is an important task for future work.

AB  - Replicated lines of Drosophila subobscura originating from a large outbred stock collected at the estimated Chilean epicentre (Puerto Montt) of the original New World invasion were allowed to evolve under controlled conditions of larval crowding for 3.5 years at three temperature levels (13, 18 and 22 degrees C). Several pre-adult life history traits (development time, survival and competitive ability), adult life history related traits (wing size, wing shape and wing-aspect ratio), and wing size and shape asymmetries were measured at the three temperatures. Cold-adapted (13 degrees C) populations evolved longer development times and showed lower survival at the highest developmental temperature. No divergence for wing size was detected following adaptation to temperature extremes (13 and 22 degrees C), in agreement with earlier observations, but wing shape changes were obvious as a result of both thermal adaptation and development at different temperatures. However, the evolutionary trends observed for the wing-aspect ratio were inconsistent with an adaptive hypothesis. There was some indication that wing shape asymmetry has evolutionarily increased in warm-adapted populations, which suggests that there is additive genetic variation for fluctuating asymmetry and that it can evolve under rapid environmental changes caused by thermal stress. Overall, our results cast strong doubts on the hypothesis that body size itself is the target of selection, and suggest that pre-adult life history traits are more closely related to thermal adaptation.

AB  - Contrary to the conventional wisdom 'bigger is better', evolution at high temperature invariably leads to small individuals in Drosophila melanogaster. Natural selection is known to be responsible, meaning that genotypes that are small because of adaptation to high temperature must have some temperature dependent fitness advantage. In this study we consider both preadult and adult fitness components, and show that large adults from a cold adapted population significantly outperform small adults from a warm adapted population only when tested at low temperature and low larval density. In all other conditions 'bigger is not necessarily better', meaning that environmental influences are capable of altering the association between size and fitness. Yet, 'smaller wasn't better either' under any condition, when considering the overall measure of fitness. Examination of individual fitness components revealed population by temperature interaction in preadult survival; this interaction is potentially capable of explaining the temperature specific advantage of small adult body size. At high temperature, the warm adapted population exhibits superior preadult survival while producing small adults. Geographical variation in adult body size seems to be the result of selection on larval growth and competitive strategies, resulting in alterations in the association between fitness components.

AB  - One of the hypotheses of growing interest in studies of responses to thermal environments suggests that trade-offs and other trait associations may be altered by temperature. Here. the commonly observed positive association between body size and longevity was examined at two adult test temperatures, 14degreesC and 25degreesC. in cold-stress-selected lines (S) and their controls (C) in 25degreesC-reared Drosophila melanogaster. Thorax length (TL) and developmental time (DT) were also scored in 25degreesC-reared individuals before and after one generation of truncation selection on longevity. The topography of the selection surface that relates longevity to thorax and wing size was temperature dependent and differed both between lines and between sexes. Longevity increased monotonically with body size (TL) in C and S females at 25degreesC but, surprisingly, longevity decreased with body size in S individuals at 14degreesC, Body size did not diverge between S and C lines and showed no response to longevity selection. However, DT increased by 25degreesC-longevity selection in C individuals and decreased by 14degreesC-longevity selection in S individuals. These results suggest that trait associations (including the commonly observed trade-off between body size and DT) can greatly depend on temperature, as a shift in the sign of the correlation is possible at low temperature. Genotype X temperature interaction is an important source of variation in the relationship between soma size and longevity.

AB  - Body size of animals often increases with increasing latitude. These latitudinal clines in body size have interested biologists for over 150 years. However, the mechanisms that generate these clines in size are still unclear, though latitudinal gradients in temperature appear to play an important role. More importantly, many studies that examine latitudinal clines in body size and the mechanisms responsible for these clines use phenotypic data, confounding genetic (adaptive) and non-genetic (plasticity) sources of variation. Yet, most of these studies make adaptive conclusions based on phenotypic measures of size. Here I show the dangers of making adaptive inferences from phenotypic measures of size. In addition, I use a specific form of plasticity in body size of ectotherms, called the temperature-size rule, to illustrate how confusion about genetic and nongenetic contributions to phenotypic variation has hampered progress in understanding the evolution of latitudinal clines in size. Field-based measurements of body size can no doubt be influenced by plasticity, but demonstrating that latitudinal clines have a genetic basis is necessary to show that these patterns are adaptive.

AB  - Although Dugesia dorotocephala is among the most widely distributed and eurythermal triclads within North America, its thermal relations are poorly known. We compared the upper thermal tolerances and the temperatures selected in a circular gradient of planarians acclimated to 15 degreesC or 22 degreesC. We also compared speeds of planarians tested at 22 degreesC after up to 10 days of starvation or after acclimation to 15 degreesC, 22 degreesC, or 30 degreesC. We compared speeds of 22 degreesC acclimated animals at temperatures ranging from 10 degreesC to 30 degreesC, and we examined the interaction between temperature and water viscosity. The triclads could survive temperatures close to 33 degreesC for up to 12h, but had incipient lethal temperatures around 30.5 degreesC. Warm acclimated animals survived somewhat better at the higher, but not at the lower, temperatures within this range. The triclads selected temperatures between 12 degreesC and 28 degreesC, with the 15 degreesC acclimated animals selecting higher mean temperatures (23.1 degreesC) than the 22 degreesC acclimated animals (20.9 degreesC). The latter group showed a normally distributed selection pattern, whereas that of the former group was skewed to the right. Speeds increased during the first two days of fasting but showed no further changes between days 3 and 10. Speeds increased with body size with a scaling exponent of about 0.25. There was a significant effect of temperature, with a Q(10) of 2.31 between 10 degreesC and 30 degreesC. Thermal acclimation did have a significant effect on locomotion, with 30 degreesC acclimated animals being markedly slower than 15 degreesC or 22 degreesC acclimated individuals. Although there was a slight indication of a viscosity effect., the resulting differences were not statistically significant. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In contrast to the benthos whose taxonomic recovery was lagging way behind that of the nekton, highly diverse Smithian conodont and ammonoid faunas were profoundly decimated during the late Smithian, ca. 2 Myr after the Permian-Triassic boundary mass extinction. As body size reduction is a common evolutionary response to heavy environmental stress, we investigate how the size of the P1 elements of different conodont clades responded during the late Smithian crisis based on three sections from the northern Indian Margin. A major and world-wide positive carbon excursion is also a consistent signature of the late Smithian time interval. Where adequate ammonoid biochronological control is lacking (i.e., Kashmir), a new carbonate carbon isotope record provides an independent age proxy for correlations with southern Tibet and the Salt Range. Assuming a positive correlation between the size of P1 elements and body size, we confirm that segminate conodonts underwent a size decrease during the late Smithian. However, segminiplanate conodonts consistently displayed a substantial size increase during the same time interval, thus highlighting Glade specific, diverging answers and precluding any simplistic generalization of size responses to the same stress event. Additionally, a moderate but consistent size increase during the early Spathian is documented for both clades, thus obscuring any simple general relation between temperature stress and size among conodonts. Comparison of size time series with the oxygen isotopic composition of conodonts (a proxy for sea-water temperature) suggests that only the size of segminate P1 elements may correlate positively with temperature. Although at a slower pace, the size of segminiplanate P1 elements continued to increase during the early Spathian, when temperature rose again after the late Smithian cooling event. Therefore, temperature alone cannot explain the size variations of segminiplanate conodonts. The late Smithian was also a time of increasing burial of organic matter on continental shelves, but lateral variations of this factor also obscure any relation with the documented size changes. Last but not least, the stratigraphically more comprehensive study in Nammal reveals a segminiplanate gap during the middle Smithian thermal high. The biogeographical expansion of this Glade towards the low latitudes during the Griesbachian, the early Smithian, the late Smithian and the early Spathian apparently occurred during the coolest intervals of the Early Triassic, in agreement with their supposed cooler habitat.

AB  - Rock dragons are medium-sized agamid Lizards restricted to arid or semiarid rocky habitats in southern Australia. When eggs from two species (Ctenophorus decresii and Ctenophorus ornatus) were incubated at constant temperatures in the laboratory, temperature affected incubation period, hatchling tail length, and sex determination. At the lowest incubation temperature (25 C), all hatchlings were female; the proportion of males increased at big-her incubation temperatures. Rock dragons are fast growing and short-lived lizards; in the field they reproduce for only one or two seasons, Females lay multiple clutches of eggs from spring through to late summer which, in the climatically temperate part of Australia where these species occur, suggests that the date of hatching may be a good predictor of hatchling sex. Any sex differences in hatching date would, in turn, translate into sex differences in body size at the beginning of the next reproductive season, If the relationship between body size and reproductive success differs between the sexes in adult rock dragons, this would provide a plausible basis for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in these species.

AB  - Guppies have successfully established populations in places with thermal regimes very different from the Tropical conditions in their native range. This indicates a remarkable capacity for thermal adaptation. Given their vulnerability to predation as juveniles, acute changes in temperature, which can alter predator-prey relationships, can impact juvenile survival and have amplified consequences at the population level. To understand how temperature may impact juvenile survival and gain insight into their success as an invasive species, we researched the effect of acute temperature changes on the routine swimming behaviour of juvenile guppies. Using a novel 3-dimensional tracking technique, we calculated 4 routine swimming parameters, speed, depth, and variation in speed or depth, at 6 different test temperatures (17, 20, 23, 26, 29, or 32 degrees C). These temperatures cover their natural thermal range and also extended past it in order to include upper and lower thermal limits. Using model selection, we found that body length and temperature had a significant positive relationship with speed. Variation in speed decreased with rising temperatures and fish swam slightly closer to the bottom at higher temperatures. All juveniles increased variation in depth at higher temperatures, though larger individuals maintained slightly more consistent depths. Our results indicate that guppies have a large thermal range and show substantial plasticity in routine swimming behaviours, which may account for their success as an invasive species.

AB  - Much of life-history theory rests on fundamental assumptions about constraints on the acquisition and allocation of energy to growth and reproduction. In general, the allocation of energy to reproduction depends on maternal size, which in turn depends on environmental factors experienced throughout the life of the mother. Here, we used phylogenetic path analyses to evaluate competing hypotheses about the environmental and maternal drivers of reproductive traits in lizards. In doing so, we discovered that precipitation, rather than temperature, has shaped the evolution of the life history. Specifically, environments with greater rainfall have enabled the evolution of larger maternal size. In turn, these larger mothers produce larger clutches of larger offspring. However, annual precipitation has a negative direct effect on offspring size, despite the positive indirect effect mediated by maternal size. Possibly, the evolution of offspring size was driven by the need to conserve water in dry environments, because small organisms are particularly sensitive to water loss. Since we found that body size variation among lizards is related to a combination of climatic factors, mainly precipitation and perhaps primary production, our study challenges previous generalizations (e.g., temperature-size rule and Bergmann's rule) and suggests alternative mechanisms underlying the evolution of body size.

AB  - Seasonal reproduction in Crustacea is synchronized by environmental cues (e.g., temperature and photoperiod). Two types of responses occur: (1) in reptant decapods, short photoperiods and low temperatures are necessary to induce vitellogenesis; (2) in natant decapods and in most peracarids, both high temperatures and long photoperiods promote the onset of reproduction. In this context studies on the biological clocks involved in photoperiodic time measurement were performed on two crustaceans: the ditch shrimp Palaemonetes varians and the woodlouse Armadillidium vulgare, which is distributed worldwide outside polar and intertropical areas. The most important feature of the photoperiodic response curves was the same mean lag time in response to photophase length less-than-or-equal-to 12 h: short photophases delayed breeding but did not prevent it (i. e., '' short-day effect''). On the contrary, long photophases promoted the onset of reproduction (i.e., 'long-day effect'') differently in P. varians and A. vulgare. In A. vulgare strains the shape of the photoperiodic response curve depended on latitudinal origin. Results of ''resonance'' experiments provided evidence of involvement of an endogenous circadian component in the photoperiodic clocks of the two species according to the internal coincidence model developed for insects. Seeing that relations between reproduction and moulting were different in the two species, we proposed the hypothesis of an evolutionary change in the transition from the sea to the continental environment.

AB  - 1. While there is evidence of genetic and phenotypic responses to climate change, few studies have demonstrated change in functional traits with a known genetic basis.
   2. Here we present evidence for an evolutionary adaptive response to elevated temperatures in freshwater populations of the threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus.
   3. Using a unique set of historical data and museum specimens, in combination with contemporary samples, we fitted a Bayesian spatial model to identify a population-level decline in the number of lateral bony plates, comprising anti-predator armour, in multiple populations of sticklebacks over the last 91 years in Poland.
   4. Armor loss was predicted by elevated temperatures and is proposed to be a correlated response to selection for reduced body size.
   5. This study demonstrates a change in a functional trait of known genetic basis in response to elevated temperature, and illustrates the utility of the threespine stickleback as a model for measuring the evolutionary and ecological impacts of environmental change across the northern hemisphere.

AB  - 1. Accumulating evidence suggests that the average body size of many organisms is declining in response to climate warming. This phenomenon has been suggested to represent a universal response to warming that may impose significant adverse effects on ecosystem functioning and services.
   2. However, we do not have a thorough understanding of why body sizes are commonly declining, and why some organisms show the opposite response. Because ectotherms constitute the vast majority of organism biomass and about 99% of species worldwide, it is particularly important to understand how ectotherms respond to a warming climate.
   3. This review discusses the underlying physiological mechanisms of changes in ectotherm body size and addresses observed responses within a broad ecological context at different levels of organization, from individuals to communities, particularly in aquatic systems.
   4. Warming-induced responses in average body size are not only determined by changes in rates of individual growth and development, but also mediated through size-dependent feed-backs at the population level, as well as competitive and predatory interactions within the community. Emergent properties at higher organizational levels have already been observed in both experimental and natural systems.
   5. Various approaches will be required for enhancing our knowledge about the importance of such processes in natural systems. These include controlled semi-natural experiments and phylogenetic comparisons as well as statistical models of time-series data and theoretical models linking climate effects at the individual, population and community levels.
   6. Understanding causes of observed changes in organism body sizes and how these depend on the ecological context is essential for improving our predictions and the management of ecosystems in the face of a warming climate.

AB  - Body size often strongly covaries with demography across species. Metabolism has long been invoked as the driver of these patterns, but tests of causal links between size, metabolism and demography within a species are exceedingly rare. We used 400 generations of artificial selection to evolve a 2427% size difference in the microalga Dunaliella tertiolecta. We repeatedly measured size, energy fluxes and demography across the evolved lineages. Then, we used standard metabolic theory to generate predictions of how size and demography should covary based on the scaling of energy fluxes that we measured. The size dependency of energy remained relatively consistent in time, but metabolic theory failed to predict demographic rates, which varied unpredictably in strength and even sign across generations. Classic theory holds that size affects demography via metabolism - our results suggest that both metabolism and size act separately to drive demography and that among-species patterns may not predict within-species processes.

AB  - The stocking of hatchery-produced whitefish is a common practice in most countries of the species' natural range. Rigorous monitoring of the effects of stocking is less common, however, and possible negative impacts of stocking on the target population are rarely considered, even though supportive stocking might exert a series of negative effects. The present study discusses these potential impacts, taking Upper Lake Constance whitefish as an example. In 2003, a proportion of the larvae stocked into the lake were labelled with Alizarin Red S. The contribution made by stocking to virtual cohort size was estimated at 83%. Survival rates from egg or larval stages to adulthood for naturally produced fish and those incubated in hatcheries in 2003 were compared with those estimated from records pertaining to the cohorts of 1925-1939. Survival rates for lake-hatched larvae in 2003 fell between 1 and 10% of historic values. Several factors that may have contributed to this decline are discussed, of which the most potent seems to be the massive stocking of the lake with delayed hatchery larvae. Continued successful stocking will increase the contribution to the population of fish with partial or complete hatchery ancestry, and it may compromise the stock's ability to adapt to a changing environment through natural selection.

AB  - Spatial or temporal differences in environmental variables, such as temperature, are ubiquitous in nature and impose stress on organisms. This is especially true for organisms that are isothermal with the environment, such as insects. Understanding the means by which insects respond to temperature and how they will react to novel changes in environmental temperature is important for understanding the adaptive capacity of populations and to predict future trajectories of evolutionary change. The organismal response to heat has been identified as an important environmental variable for insects that can dramatically influence life history characters and geographic range. In the current study we surveyed the amount of variation in heat tolerance among Drosophila melanogaster populations collected at diverse sites along a latitudinal gradient in Argentina (24A degrees-38A degrees S). This is the first study to quantify heat tolerance in South American populations and our work demonstrates that most of the populations surveyed have abundant within-population phenotypic variation, while still exhibiting significant variation among populations. The one exception was the most heat tolerant population that comes from a climate exhibiting the warmest annual mean temperature. All together our results suggest there is abundant genetic variation for heat-tolerance phenotypes within and among natural populations of Drosophila and this variation has likely been shaped by environmental temperature.

AB  - Non-genetic parental effects may largely affect offspring phenotype, and such plasticity is potentially adaptive. Despite its potential importance, little is known about cross-generational effects of temperature, at least partly because parental effects were frequently considered a troublesome nuisance, rather than a target of experimental studies. We here investigate effects of parental, developmental and acclimation temperature on life-history traits in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Higher developmental temperatures reduced development times and egg size, increased egg number, but did not affect pupal mass. Between-generation temperature effects on larval time, pupal time, larval growth rate and egg size were qualitatively very similar to effects of developmental temperature, and additionally affected pupal mass but not egg number. Parental effects are important mediators of phenotypic plasticity in B. anynana, and partly yielded antagonistic effects on different components of fitness, which may constrain the evolution of cross-generational adaptive plasticity.

AB  - Published data on initial chamber (protoconch) diameter in 507 species, and embryonic shell (ammonitella) diameter in 231 species of Ammonoidea, and embryonic shell (nauta) diameters for 132 species of coiled Nautiloidea, were used to examine evolutionary change in ectocochleate cephalopod reproductive strategies. Palaeotemperatures were found to be a key factor influencing historical changes in the evolution of egg size in ammonoids and nautiloids. A negative relationship was found between egg size and warming of the Earth's climate. Factors related to habitat were also important; in general egg size was larger in cold-water cephalopods. Egg size in Lytoceratina and Phylloceratina in the deep waters of the upper continental slope was much larger than in epipelagic Scaphitidae, as in modern fish and squids. Small eggs and high evolutionary rates helped ammonoids to colonise new habitats and develop high biological diversity, but involved them in planktonic food webs making them more vulnerable to abiotic variability (e. g., climatic changes), ultimately leading to their extinction. Large eggs helped nautiloids to persist through geological history, but at the cost of lower biological diversity, lower evolutionary rates and restricted options for colonising new habitats. Large-egged species such as nautiloids are more vulnerable to ecological, biotic disasters such as the appearance of new predators, including modern fishery. Independence from the planktonic food web is likely to be very important for a taxon's long-term survival over evolutionary history, as demonstrated also by Coelacanthiformes and Elasmobranchia.

AB  - Aim: The study assessed the effect of different concentration of dissolved oxygen in Tor putitora, commonly known as Golden mahseer on physiological activities of juveniles regarding their growth performance, behavioural response and stress.
   Methodology: Twenty-seven acclimatized fingerlings of Tor putitora were selected for the experiment, in which nine were exposed to each group of dissolved oxygen treatment (Natural, 6.76 mg l(-1), low 4.81mg l(-1) and high, 10.20 mg ml(-1)) in aquaria (60x30x30) cm. The body weight (g), cortisol concentration (ng g(-1)) and behaviour profile was assessed using the Ethovision XT-13 software (Noldus, Info Tech, Wageningen, The Netherlands).
   Results: The average value of body weight (g), cortisol concentration (ng g(-1)) and all behavioural profiles of Tor putitora showed a significant difference at P<0.05. The average concentration of cortisol was lower in high oxygen dissolved exposed juveniles as compared to other oxygen treatment groups.
   Interpretation: High oxygen content in water bodies reduces the stress level and stereotyped behavioural responses of fishes. These novel data, on cognitive swimming pattern in Tor putitora, is quite important for enhancement of production and maintaining the fish health issues.

AB  - Understanding how organisms adapt to complex environments is a central goal of evolutionary biology and ecology. This issue is of special interest in the current era of rapidly changing climatic conditions. Here, we investigate clinal variation and plastic responses in life history, morphology and physiology in the butterfly Pieris napi along a pan-European gradient by exposing butterflies raised in captivity to different temperatures. We found clinal variation in body size, growth rates and concomitant development time, wing aspect ratio, wing melanization and heat tolerance. Individuals from warmer environments were more heat-tolerant and had less melanised wings and a shorter development, but still they were larger than individuals from cooler environments. These findings suggest selection for rapid growth in the warmth and for wing melanization in the cold, and thus fine-tuned genetic adaptation to local climates. Irrespective of the origin of butterflies, the effects of higher developmental temperature were largely as expected, speeding up development; reducing body size, potential metabolic activity and wing melanization; while increasing heat tolerance. At least in part, these patterns likely reflect adaptive phenotypic plasticity. In summary, our study revealed pronounced plastic and genetic responses, which may indicate high adaptive capacities in our study organism. Whether this may help such species, though, to deal with current climate change needs further investigation, as clinal patterns have typically evolved over long periods.

AB  - Latitudinal geographic variation in Drosophila melanogaster is pervasive. Parallel dines in traits such as body size, egg size, ovariole number, and development time have been found on several continents throughout the world. However, a dine in starvation resistance and fat content in D. melanogaster has so far been found only in India. Here we investigate starvation resistance and fat content in 10 populations from South America, in which dines in body size, egg size, and development time have previously been found. We find no evidence for a dine in starvation resistance or fat content in South America. We therefore suggest that the dine in starvation resistance in India may have evolved in response to specific climatic variation found only in India.

AB  - Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) has evolved independently in at least two lineages of viviparous Australian scincid lizards, but its adaptive significance remains unclear. We studied a montane lizard species (Eulamprus heatwolei) with TSD. Our data suggest that mothers can modify the body sizes of their offspring by selecting specific thermal regimes during pregnancy (mothers with higher and more stable temperatures produced smaller offspring), but cannot influence sons versus daughters differentially in this way. A field mark-recapture study shows that optimal offspring size differs between the sexes: larger body size at birth enhanced the survival of sons but reduced the survival of daughters. Thus, a pregnant female can optimize the fitness of either her sons or her daughters (via yolk allocation and thermoregulation), but cannot simultaneously optimize both. One evolutionary solution to reduce this fitness cost is to modify the sex-determining mechanism so that a single litter consists entirely of either sons or daughters; TSD provides such a mechanism. Previous work has implicated a sex difference in optimal offspring size as a selective force for TSD in turtles. Hence, opposing fitness determinants of sons and daughters may have favored evolutionary transitions from genetic sex determination to TSD in both oviparous turtles and viviparous lizards.

AB  - Substantial genetic variation in development time is known to exist among mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) populations across the western United States. The effect of this variation on geographic patterns in voltinism (generation time) and thermal requirements to produce specific voltinism pathways have not been investigated. The influence of voltinism on fitness traits, body size, and sex ratio is also unclear. We monitored mountain pine beetle voltinism, adult body size, sex ratio, and air temperatures at sites across latitudinal and elevational gradients in the western United States. With the exception of two sites at the coolest and warmest locations, the number of days required to complete a generation was similar. Thermal units required to achieve a generation, however, were significantly less for individuals at the coolest sites. Evolved adaptations explain this pattern, including developmental rates and thresholds that serve to synchronize cohorts and minimize cold-sensitive life stages in winter. These same adaptations reduce the capacity of mountain pine beetle at the warmest sites to take full advantage of increased thermal units, limiting the capacity for bivoltinism within the current realized distribution. Temperature was not correlated with adult size and sex ratio, and size was greatest in host trees other than lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.). Our results provide baseline information for evaluating population responses in a changing climate.

AB  - The evolutionary effects of harvest on wild fish populations have been documented around the world; however, sublethal selective pressures can also cause evolutionary changes in phenotypes. For migratory fishes, passage facilities may represent instances of nonlethal selective pressure. Our analysis of 6years of passage data suggests that certain fish passage facilities on the Penobscot River have been exerting selective pressure against large-bodied, anadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). At the second and third dams in the river, a 91-cm salmon was 21%-27% and 12%-16% less likely to pass than a 45-cm salmon, respectively. Fish size positively influences egg survival and number and is a heritable trait. Therefore, in a wild-reproducing population, exclusion of large fish from spawning areas may have population-level impacts. In the Penobscot River, most returning adults derive from a hatchery program that collects its broodstock after passing the first dam in the river. Analysis of fork lengths of salmon returning to the Penobscot River from 1978 to 2012 provided mixed support for evolution of size at maturity in different age classes in a pattern that may be expected from interactions with conservation hatchery operations. Additionally, slow-maturing and iteroparous individuals that represent the largest salmon size classes were essentially lost from the population during that time, and Penobscot River fish have shorter fork lengths at maturity than Atlantic salmon in undammed systems.

AB  - Differences among individuals are necessary for natural selection to occur. The extent and expression of these differences can limit the power of selection to cause evolutionary change. When individuals inconsistently express a trait, selection is less powerful. Labile traits such as behaviour are most likely to be inconsistent in their expression, because of the substantial role of environmental factors in their immediate expression. Previous work has focused on the consistency, or repeatability, of individual behaviour across different environments or within a single environment; little is known about how repeatability within an environment changes across environments. To address this issue, we examined the consistency of antipredator behaviour in juvenile garter snakes in different thermal environments. A group of 59 laboratory-born garter snakes, Thamnophis ordinoides, was repeatedly assayed for sprint speed, distance crawled, and number of reversals performed during flight and antipredator display. Antipredator display showed very little variation and could not be analysed. Each individual was tested three times at each of three temperatures chosen to span the range of temperatures that snakes encounter in the field (15, 22.5, 30 degrees C). Temperature had substantial effects on the average expression of each behaviour;snakes crawled more slowly, for shorter distances, and performed fewer reversals at cooler temperatures. Individuals showed significant consistency in their behaviour, and this consistency of expression was not affected by temperature. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Climate change is leading to altered temperature regimes which are impacting aquatic life, particularly for ectothermic fish. The impacts of environmental stress can be translated across generations through maternally derived glucocorticoids, leading to altered offspring phenotypes. Although these maternal stress effects are often considered negative, recent studies suggest this maternal stress signal may prepare offspring for a similarly stressful environment (environmental match). We applied the environmental match hypothesis to examine whether a prenatal stress signal can dampen the effects of elevated water temperatures on body size, condition, and survival during early development in Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha from Lake Ontario, Canada. We exposed fertilized eggs to prenatal exogenous egg cortisol (1,000 ng/ml cortisol or 0 ng/ml control) and then reared these dosed groups at temperatures indicative of current (+0 degrees C) and future (+3 degrees C) temperature conditions. Offspring reared in elevated temperatures were smaller and had a lower survival at the hatchling developmental stage. Overall, we found that our exogenous cortisol dose did not dampen effects of elevated rearing temperatures (environmental match) on body size or early survival. Instead, our eyed stage survival indicates that our prenatal cortisol dose may be detrimental, as cortisol-dosed offspring raised in elevated temperatures had lower survival than cortisol-dosed and control reared in current temperatures. Our results suggest that a maternal stress signal may not be able to ameliorate the effects of thermal stress during early development. However, we highlight the importance of interpreting the fitness impacts of maternal stress within an environmentally relevant context.

AB  - A sample of females from the 19th generation of the 'R-' and 'R+' lines divergently selected for the residual feed intake in the laying period was separated at 18 weeks of age in climatic rooms into two groups, one kept at a constant temperature of 21 +/- 1 degrees C (control), the other kept at 31 +/- 1 degrees C ('heated' group). Egg production was recorded until the age of 45 weeks, individual feed consumption was measured between the ages of 31 and 35 weeks, and water consumption was measured at 51 weeks. The usual effects of high ambient temperature compared to moderate temperature were observed in both lines: reduction of food intake (- 16%), egg number and egg mass (- 13%), mean clutch length, more days of pauses, depression of body weight (- 8%) and mean egg weight (- 4%). Similarly, over both treatments, the differences found previously between lines in total feed consumption (25%) and in its residual part (19%), in comb and wattle size, shank length and in water intake (51%) were observed. However, for several variables the line x treatment interaction was significant, especially for residual food intake, water intake, 48-week body weight and adult body weight variation, indicating that the 'overconsuming line' (R+) was better adapted to the high temperature with a reduction in egg number of only 10% versus 22% for the 'underconsuming' line (R-). The better adaptation of the R+ line may be due partly to a reduction of thermogenesis during feeding, and perhaps more probably to a higher capacity for heat dissipation. Finally, breeding for a laying hen with better food efficiency, which has been found to be advantageous in a temperate environment, shows some limits at high temperature.

AB  - Although loss of genetic variation is frequently assumed to be associated with loss of adaptive potential, only few studies have examined adaptation in populations with little genetic variation. On the Swedish west coast, the northern fringe populations of the natterjack toad Bufo calamita inhabit an atypical habitat consisting of offshore rock islands. There are strong among-population differences in the amount of neutral genetic variation, making this system suitable for studies on mechanisms of trait divergence along a gradient of within-population genetic variation. In this study, we examined the mechanisms of population divergence using Q(ST)-F-ST comparisons and correlations between quantitative and neutral genetic variation. Our results suggest drift or weak stabilizing selection across the six populations included in this study, as indicated by low Q(ST)-F-ST values, lack of significant population x temperature interactions and lack of significant differences among the islands in breeding pond size. The six populations included in this study differed in both neutral and quantitative genetic variation. Also, the correlations between neutral and quantitative genetic variation tended to be positive, however, the relatively small number of populations prevents any strong conclusions based on these correlations. Contrary to the majority of Q(ST)-F-ST comparisons, our results suggest drift or weak stabilizing selection across the examined populations. Furthermore, the low heritability of fitness-related traits may limit evolutionary responses in some of the populations.

AB  - Parental investment theory postulates that adults can accurately perceive cues from their surroundings, anticipate the needs of future offspring based on those cues, and selectively allocate nongenetic resources to their progeny. Such context-dependent parental contributions can result in phenotypically variable offspring. Consistent with these predictions, we show that bacterially exposed Manduca sexta mothers oviposited significantly more variable embryos ( as measured by mass, volume, hatching time, and hatching success) relative to naive and control mothers. By using an in vivo "clearance of infection" assay, we also show that challenged larvae born to heat-killed-or live-Serratia-injected mothers, supported lower microbial loads and cleared the infection faster than progeny of control mothers. Our data support the notion that mothers can anticipate the future pathogenic risks and immunological needs of their unborn offspring, providing progeny with enhanced immune protection likely through transgenerational immune priming. Although the inclusion of live Serratia into oocytes does not appear to be the mechanism by which mothers confer protection to their young, other mechanisms, including epigenetic modifications in the progeny due to maternal pathogenic stress, may be at play. The adaptive nature of maternal effects in the face of pathogenic stress provides insights into parental investment, resource allocation, and life-history theories and highlights the significant role that pathogen-induced maternal effects play as generators and modulators of evolutionary change.

AB  - Background: Annual killifishes inhabit temporary ponds and their embryos survive the dry season encased in the mud by entering diapause, a process that arrests embryonic development during hostile conditions. Annual killifishes are present within three clades distributed in Africa (one East and one West of the Dahomey gap) and South America. Within each of these phylogenetic clades, a non-annual clade is sister taxon to a annual clade and therefore represent an example of convergent evolution.
   Early cleavage of teleost embryos is characterized by a very fast cell cycle (15-30 minutes) and lack of G(1) and G(2) phases. Here, we decided to investigate rates of early cleavage in annual killifishes. In addition, we specifically tested whether also annual killifish embryos lack G(1) and G(2) phases.
   Results: We used time lapse brightfield microscopy to investigate cell division kinetics during the first developmental stages of annual- and non-annual species belonging to the three different phylogenetic clades. Annual killifishes of all three clades showed cleavage times significantly longer when compared to their non-annual sister taxa (average 35 min vs. average 75 min). Using FUCCI fluorescent imaging of the cell cycle after microinjection in the annual species Nothobranchius furzeri, we demonstrate that the first 5 division are synchronous and do not show a G(1) phase. Cell cycle synchronization is lost after the 5th cleavage division.
   Conclusions: Our results show, for the first time, that cell cycle rate during cleavage, a trait thought to be rather evolutionary conserved can undergo convergent evolutionary change in response to variations in life-history.

AB  - To assess the energetics of migration in an anadromous fish, adult American shad (Alosa sapidissima) were swum in a large respirometer at a range of speeds (1.0-2.3 body lengths (BL) s(-1), 13-24 degrees C). Metabolic rate (M-O2) was logarithmically related to swimming speed (B1 s(-1); r(2) = 0.41, slope = 0.23 +/- 0.037) and tailbeat frequency (beats x min(-1); r(2) = 0.52, slope = 0.003 +/- 0.0003). Temperature had a significant effect on metabolic rate (r(2) = 0.41) with a Q(10) of 2.2. Standard metabolic rate (SMR), determined directly after immobilization with the neuroblocker gallamine triethiodide, ranged from 2.2-6.2 mmolO(2) kg(-1) h(-1) and scaled with mass (W) such that SMR = 4.0 (+/- 0.03)W0.695(+/-0.15). Comparison of directly determined and extrapolated SMR suggests that swimming respirometry provides a good estimate of SMR in this species, given the differences in basal activity monitored by the two methods. Overall, American shad metabolic rates (M-O2 and SMR) were intermediate between salmonids and fast-swimming perciforms, including tunas, and may be a result of evolutionary adaptation to their active pelagic, schooling life history. This study demonstrates variability in metabolic strategy among anadromous fishes that may be important to understanding the relative success of different migratory species under varying environmental conditions.

AB  - Ectotherms in water experience rates of heat transfer at least two orders of magnitude greater than in air, seriously constraining their thermoregulatory capabilities. Yet, even in water, individuals may exert control over body temperature (T-b) via behaviors such as selecting thermally favorable microhabitats. The interactions among body size, physiology, and behavior on the thermal biology of large, entirely aquatic, ectotherms is poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that alligator snapping turtles (Macroclemmys temminckii) selected microhabitats based on temperature by comparing temperatures at sites used by turtles to temperatures at randomly selected sites. These large turtles selected a narrow range of microhabitats that were significantly warmer and less variable in temperature than random sites. Cooling trials in the laboratory indicated larger turtles equilibrated more slowly to ambient temperature (T-a) than smaller turtles. We recorded T-a and body temperature (T-b) of turtles in the field continuously throughout the year. The T-b generally conformed to T-a but there were periods when T-b - T-a differences were great. These results suggest that while physiology and size of aquatic turtles can affect T-b transiently, microhabitat selection may be the only meaningful mechanism for large, entirely aquatic, turtles to control T-b.

AB  - Global warming is predicted to enhance the development rate and increase the number of generations in multivoltine insects. For secondary forest pests, such as the pine bark beetle Ips sexdentatus, the resulting increase in population level could trigger more frequent outbreaks. However, this positive effect could be outweighed by a temperature-dependent decrease in offspring quality.
   To test these hypotheses, we carried out a laboratory rearing experiment with maritime pine logs at six temperature regimes reproducing hourly fluctuations and averaging 12-25.5 degrees C. We estimated the thermal requirements for a complete development of the beetle and the number of offspring per female. The offspring quality was estimated using three traits: dry body weight, elytra length and lipid content.
   The minimum and maximum developmental threshold were estimated at 10.9 and 36 degrees C, respectively, and the thermal requirements for complete development were estimated at 517 degree-days. We predicted a mean of two generations per year in southwestern France, although an additional generation could occur during warmer years. The number of offspring increased exponentially with temperature, although we observed a curvilinear response of offspring traits to temperature, with optima at 15-18 degrees C.
   This suggests that there are trade-offs between productivity and quality of offspring. Global warming is therefore likely to result in higher number of generations of I. sexdentatus per year, with larger broods but of reduced fitness at high temperatures.

AB  - Meiotic recombination plays a critical evolutionary role in maintaining fitness in response to selective pressures due to changing environments. Variation in recombination rate has been observed amongst and between species and populations and within genomes across numerous taxa. Studies have demonstrated a link between changes in recombination rate and selection, but the extent to which fine-scale recombination rate varies between evolved populations during the evolutionary period in response to selection is under active research. Here, we utilize a set of 3 temperature-evolved Drosophila melanogaster populations that were shown to have diverged in several phenotypes, including recombination rate, based on the temperature regime in which they evolved. Using whole-genome sequencing data from these populations, we generated linkage disequilibrium-based fine-scale recombination maps for each population. With these maps, we compare recombination rates and patterns among the 3 populations and show that they have diverged at fine scales but are conserved at broader scales. We further demonstrate a correlation between recombination rates and genomic variation in the 3 populations. Lastly, we show variation in localized regions of enhanced recombination rates, termed warm spots, between the populations with these warm spots and associated genes overlapping areas previously shown to have diverged in the 3 populations due to selection. These data support the existence of recombination modifiers in these populations which are subject to selection during evolutionary change.

T2  - ACTA BIOTHEORETICA
LA  - English
AB  - On a common view of evolution, natural selection is the major force that produces evolutionary change. Selection is thought to operate on different types (genotypes or phenotypes) in populations so as to generate differential reproductive survival of these types. This should engender changes in population composition. The conception of selection as a "force" should be considered as a convenient shorthand that easily misleads us. Selection is not a factor over and above items such as temperature regimes, predators, and so forth. These items do causal work in evolutionary processes. The term "selection" is merely an abstract placeholder for them. Differential reproductive survival thus appears to depend on particular environmental items that influence different types in different ways. Such items are properly regarded as the selective agents. On the face of it, selection processes must always be due to the operation of such agents. I argue that this is a mistaken assumption. Processes of selection may well occur in the absence of selective agents. That is because environmental factors may contribute to differential reproductive survival even if they do not affect different genotypes or phenotypes in different ways. Considering the role of the environment in selection, we should distinguish between selective agents and contributive agents.

AB  - Climate change is rapidly altering the way current species interact with their environment to satisfy life-history demands. In areas anticipated to experience extreme warming, rising temperatures are expected to diminish population growth, due either to environmental degradation, or the inability to tolerate novel temperature regimes. Determining how at risk ectotherms, and lizards in particular, are to changes in climate traditionally emphasizes the thermal ecology and thermal sensitivity of physiology of adult members of a population. In this study, we reveal ontogenetic differences in thermal physiological and ecological traits that have been used to anticipate how ectotherms will respond to climate change. We show that the thermal biological traits of juvenile Yarrow's Spiny Lizards (Sceloporus jarrovii) differ from the published estimates of the same traits for adult lizards. Juvenile S. jarrovii differ in their optimal performance temperature, field field-active body temperature, and critical thermal temperatures compared to adult S. jarrovii. Within juvenile S. jarrovii, males and females exhibit differences in field-active body temperature and desiccation tolerance. Given the observed age-and sex-related variation in thermal physiology, we argue that not including physiological differences in thermal biology throughout ontogeny may lead to misinterpretation of patterns of ecological or evolutionary change due to climate warming. Further characterizing the potential for ontogenetic changes in thermal biology would be useful for a more precise and accurate estimation of the role of thermal physiology in mediating population persistence in warmer environments.

AB  - The thermal tolerance phenotypes of different strains of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss was investigated in this study. The time at which a fish, acclimated to 17 degrees C, was no longer able to maintain its equilibrium after reaching the test temperature of 28 degrees C was recorded as its effective time (ET) in the zone of thermal resistance and used as a parameter of its thermal tolerance. The ET was compared among two strains of rainbow trout, thermally selected and Nikko, and two types of their hybrid progenies (thermally selected male x normal female and thermally selected female x normal male), using 14-15 individuals of each group in tests. Individuals of the thermally selected strain with smaller bodies had a longer ET than those with lager bodies. Five groups of F2 juveniles produced from a full-sibling cross of F1 progenies (Nikko strain females x thermally selected strain males), each containing 40 or 41 individuals, had an ET of 39.3-46.4 min, which was not significantly correlated with body size. Although its ET was influenced by body size, the thermally selected strain showed good thermal tolerance at all body sizes. Moreover, the coefficient of variation of ET was 32-39%, suggesting there was a wide diversity of ET values. Because samples subjected to ET experiments can recover and survive, ET is a promising, convenient indicator to use when examining thermal tolerance phenotypes of large numbers of individuals, which can subsequently provide live individuals with inherited thermal tolerance for use in selective breeding.

AB  - Microevolutionary studies often find that complex quantitative characters are highly evolvable and adapted to the local environment, while macroevolutionary studies often show evidence of strong phylogenetic effects and stasis. In this contribution, we show how phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to test hypotheses that may help resolve this paradox. As a test case, we studied the interplay between adaptation and phylogenetic inertia on the thermobiology of 32 species of Liolaemus (Squamata: Liolaemidae), a genus of South American lizards living under diverse climatic conditions. Despite a strong phylogenetic effect in the preferred (selected) body temperature, we found clear evidence that this variable is adapted to local temperature and climate. After controlling for adaptation to the thermal environment, little influence of phylogeny was left. This indicates that the phylogenetic effect was not caused by a lag or slowness in adaptation but primarily by the distribution of the thermal environments on the phylogeny. This can be due to thermal niche tracking. In contrast, we found little or no evidence for adaptation to the thermal environment in either cooling or heating rates, critical thermal minimum, or body size.

AB  - The nature of the human fossil record is less than ideal for the generation of precise correlations between environmental variables and patterns of evolution in specific lineages. Nonetheless, a critical look at what can and cannot be said from individual fossil morphology and the correlation of specific environmental proxies with specific hominin fossils may lead to a greater understanding of the degree of certainty with which we should embrace environmental hypotheses for the evolution of Homo. Climate shifts have been implicated in both the origin of the genus and its dispersal from Africa. Here, I consider three areas in which a climatic influence has been posited to explain evolutionary shifts in the genus Homo: the origin and dispersal of the genus from Africa; geography, climate and body size in early Homo, and the influence of climate-induced sea level rise on morphological isolation in H. erectus. Each of the data sets is far from ideal, and interpretations of each of the data sets are fraught with issues of equifinality. Of the three hypotheses discussed, the clearest link is seen between latitudinal variation (and presumably temperature) and body size in H. erectus. Similarly, climate-induced sea level change seems a reasonable isolating mechanism to explain the pattern of cranial variation in later Asian H. erectus, but the distribution could also reflect incompletely sampled clinal variation. Alternatively, only equivocal support is found for the influence of climate on the differentiation of H. erectus from H. habilis (as proxied by body/brain size scaling), and therefore the dispersal of the genus Homo cannot be as clearly linked to changes in body size and shape as it has been in the past. These preliminary data suggest that an emphasis on understanding local adaptation before looking at global (and specific) level change is critical to elucidating the importance of climatic factors on the evolution of the genus Homo.

AB  - Field phenologies of high- (ca. 1500 m) and low- (ca. 500 m) altitude populations of the two most common European species of dung flies, Scathophaga stercoraria and Sepsis cynipsea, differ quite markedly due to differences in climate. To differentiate genetic adaptation due to natural selection and phenotypic plasticity, I compared standard life history characters of pairs of high- and low-altitude populations from three disjunctive sites in Switzerland in a laboratory experiment. The F1 rearing environment did not affect any of the variables of the F2 generation with which all experiments were conducted; hence, there were no carry-over or maternal effects. In Sc. stercoraria, high-altitude individuals were smaller but laid larger eggs; the latter may be advantageous in the more extreme (i.e. more variable and less predictable) high-altitude climate. Higher rearing temperature strongly decreased development time, body size and the size difference between males and females (males are larger), produced female-biased sex ratios and led to suboptimal adult emergence rates. Several of these variables also varied among the three sites, producing some interactions complicating the patterns. In Se. cynip sen, high-altitude females were marginally smaller, less long-lived and laid fewer clutches. Higher rearing temperature strongly decreased development time and body size but tended to increase the size difference between males and females (males are smaller); it also increased clutch size but decreased physiological longevity. Again, interpretation is complicated by variation across sites and some significant interactions. Overall, genetic adaptation to high-altitude conditions appears weak, probably prevented by substantial gene flow, and may be swamped by the effects of other geographic variables among populations. In contrast, phenotypic plasticity is extensive. This may be due to selection of flexible, multi-purpose genotypes. The results suggest that differences in season length between high- and low-altitude locations alone do not explain well the patterns of variation in phenology and body size.

AB  - Long-term multigenerational experimental simulations of climate change on insect pests of economically and socially important crops are crucial to anticipate challenges for feeding humanity in the not-so-far future. Mexican bean weevil Zabrotes subfasciatus, is a worldwide pest that attacks the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris seeds, in crops and storage. We designed a long term (i.e., over 10 generations), experimental simulation of climate change by increasing temperature and CO2 air concentration in controlled conditions according to model predictions for 2100. Higher temperature and CO2 concentrations favored pest's egg-to-adult development survival, even at high female fecundity. It also induced a reduction of fat storage and increase of protein content but did not alter body size. After 10 generations of simulation, genetic adaptation was detected for total lipid content only, however, other traits showed signs of such process. Future experimental designs and methods similar to ours, are key for studying long-term effects of climate change through multigenerational experimental designs.

AB  - Parasites vary widely in the diversity of hosts they infect: some parasite species are specialists-infecting just a single host species, while others are generalists, capable of infecting many. Understanding the factors that drive parasite host-generalism is of basic biological interest, but also directly relevant to predicting disease emergence in new host species, identifying parasites that are likely to have unidentified additional hosts, and assessing transmission risk. Here, we use mathematical models to investigate how variation in host body size and environmental temperature affect the evolution of parasite host-generalism. We predict that parasites are more likely to evolve a generalist strategy when hosts are large-bodied, when variation in host body size is large, and in cooler environments. We then explore these predictions using a newly updated database of over 20 000 fish-macroparasite associations. Within the database we see some evidence supporting these predictions, but also highlight mismatches between theory and data. By combining these two approaches, we establish a theoretical basis for interpreting empirical data on parasites' host specificity and identify key areas for future work that will help untangle the drivers of parasite host-generalism.

AB  - Recent theory predicts that the sizes of cells will evolve according to fluctuations in body temperature. Smaller cells speed metabolism during periods of warming but require more energy to maintain and repair. To evaluate this theory, we studied the evolution of cell size in populations of Drosophila melanogaster held at either a constant temperature (16 degrees C or 25 degrees C) or fluctuating temperatures (16 and 25 degrees C). Populations that evolved at fluctuating temperatures or a constant 25 degrees C developed smaller thoraxes, wings, and cells than did flies exposed to a constant 16 degrees C. The cells of flies from fluctuating environments were intermediate in size to those of flies from constant environments. Most genetic variation in cell size was independent of variation in wing size, suggesting that cell size was a target of selection. These evolutionary patterns accord with patterns of developmental plasticity documented previously. Future studies should focus on the mechanisms that underlie the selective advantage of small cells at high or fluctuating temperatures.

AB  - In many populations of terrestrial snakes, the phenotype of an individual (e.g. body size, sex, colour) affects its habitat use. One cause for that link is gape limitation, which can result in larger snakes eating prey that are found in different habitats. A second factor involves thermoregulatory opportunities, whereby individuals select habitats based upon thermal conditions. These ideas predict minimal intraspecific variation in habitat use in a species that eats small prey and lives in a thermally uniform habitat, such as the sea snake Emydocephalus annulatus, which feeds on tiny fish eggs and lives in inshore coral reefs. To test that prediction, we gathered data on water depths and substrate attributes for 1475 sightings of 128 free-ranging E. annulatus in a bay near Noumea, New Caledonia. Habitat selection varied among individuals, but with a preference for coral-dominated substrates. The body size and reproductive state of a snake affected its detectability in deep water, but overall habitat use was not linked to snake body size, colour morph, sex or pregnancy. A lack of ontogenetic shifts in habitat use allows extreme philopatry in E. annulatus, thereby reducing gene flow among populations and, potentially, delaying recolonization after local extirpation events.

AB  - The empirical study of interpopulation variation in life history and other fitness traits has been an important approach to understanding the ecology and evolution of organisms and gaining insight into possible sources of variation. We report a quantitative analysis for variations of five life history traits (larval developmental time, adult body weight, adult lifespan, age at first reproduction, total fecundity) and flight capacity among populations of Epiphyas postvittana originating from four localities in Australia and one in New Zealand. These populations were compared at two temperatures (15 degrees and 25 degreesC) after being maintained under uniform laboratory conditions for 1.5 generations, so that the relative role of genetic divergence and phenotypic plasticity in determining interpopulation variation could be disentangled. Genetic differentiation between populations was shown in all measured traits, with the greatest divergence occurring in developmental time, fecundity and adult body size. However, these traits were highly sensitive to changes in environmental temperatures; and furthermore, significant interactions between population and temperature occurred in all traits except for flight capacity of female moths. Thus, phenotypic plasticity may be another cause of interpopulation variation. The interpopulation variation for some measured traits was apparently related to climatic differences found where the populations originated. Individuals of the populations from the warmer climates tended to develop more slowly at immature stages, producing smaller and less fecund moths but with stronger flight capacity, in comparison to those from the cooler regions. It seems, therefore, that natural populations off. postvittana have evolved different strategies to cope with local environmental conditions.

AB  - Climate change has been shown to affect fitness-related traits in a wide range of taxa; for instance, warming leads to phenological advancements in many plant and animal species. The influence of climate change on social and secondary sexual traits, which are associated with fitness because of their role as quality signals, is, however, unknown. Here, we use more than 5,800 observations collected on two Mediterranean blue tit subspecies (Cyanistes caeruleus caeruleus and Cyanistes caeruleus ogliastrae) to explore whether blue crown and yellow breast patch colorations have changed over the past 15 years. Our data suggest that coloration has become duller and less chromatic in both sexes. In addition, in the Corsican C.c. ogliastrae, but not in the mainland C.c. caeruleus, the decrease is associated with an increase in temperature at molt. Quantitative genetic analyses do not reveal any microevolutionary change in the color traits over the study period, strongly suggesting that the observed change over time was caused by a plastic response to the environmental conditions. Overall, this study suggests that ornamental colorations could become less conspicuous because of warming, revealing climate change effects on sexual and social ornaments and calling for further research on the proximate mechanisms behind these effects.

AB  - In oviparous species lacking parental care, successful reproduction depends on females selecting nest sites that facilitate embryonic development. Such sites may be limited in the environment, which can lead to multiple females using the same nest site simultaneously. However, there are several alternative explanations for communal nesting, including natal homing, predator satiation, and adaptive benefits to offspring. We used laboratory experiments to evaluate three hypotheses about nest-site selection in velvet geckos (Oedura lesueurii), which often nest communally. We investigated whether the trend to nest communally is influenced by the following: (1) evidence of previous nesting (hatched eggshells); (2) body size; and/or (3) thermal regimes. When given the choice, females laid their eggs in shelters containing hatched eggshells rather than in empty shelters, and this was not influenced by body size. Females selected nest sites that were cooler than their own mean selected body temperatures, suggesting that thermal requirements of their developing embryos could outweigh their own thermoregulatory preferences. Field observations of natal homing and high predation rates on gravid females suggest that imprinting on nest sites and/or predator swamping also play roles in communal nesting. Collectively, our results suggest that female velvet geckos use multiple cues to select appropriate nest sites, and hence that multiple mechanisms result in communal nesting behavior in this species.

AB  - 1. The physical conditions experienced by reptile embryos inside natural nests can influence the size, shape and behaviour of the resultant hatchlings. Although most reptiles are tropical, the effects of incubation temperatures on offspring phenotypes have received little attention in tropical species.
   2. The consequences of differences in thermal variance during incubation on offspring were studied in a tropical natricine snake (the Keelback Tropidonophis mairii), which lays eggs in soil cracks of varying depths. Some 253 eggs from 19 clutches were incubated under two thermal regimes with identical mean temperatures (25.6 degreesC), but temperatures in the 'variable' treatment fluctuated more (21.8-29.6 degreesC) than those in the 'constant' temperature treatment (25.2-26.5 degreesC). These thermal regimes were similar to those of shallow (20 cm deep) and deep (40 cm deep) soil cracks, respectively, and represent thermal conditions inside natural nests and potential nest sites.
   3. Incubation temperatures affected body size, shape and antipredator behaviour of hatchling snakes. Snakes from constant temperature incubation were longer and thinner than snakes from high variance incubation. Clutch effects influenced all offspring traits, with significant interactions between clutch of origin and incubation treatment for body size, but not swimming speed or behaviour.
   4. There was a significant interaction between incubation treatment and offspring sex on neonate swimming speed. Incubation under cycling thermal regimes significantly increased swimming speeds of females, but had little effect on males. Such sex differences in phenotypic responses of hatchling snakes support a major assumption of the Charnov-Bull hypothesis for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination.

AB  - Chile is a country that presents a variety of thermal environments under which diverse species of amphibians reside. For these, the environmental temperature (Ta) is important since it affects their body temperature (Tb). Due to the high phenotypic plasticity of this taxa, the aclimation temperature to which they are exposed in captive conditions can influence their thermal responses. In addition, body size and/or mass may influence such behavior, and therefore, sexual dimorphism may differentiate Tc. Based on the above, Pleurodema thoul is an optimal object of study to evaluate thermal behavior since it presents sexual dimorphism in body size, and a strong influence of acclimation temperature on behavior. To analyze this association, individuals were collected in the commune of Antuco (Biobio Region) and subjected to two acclimation temperatures (10 degrees and 20 degrees C). Their size, mass, Tb and selected temperature (T-sel) were compared. The results show that in thermally homogeneous environments P. thoul is a tigmothermal species with a thermo-conformist behavior. The acclimation temperature did not present a significant effect on its behavior and they selected a wide thermal range with an average over 24 degrees C where there were no significant differences between the sexes.

AB  - Species ranges are shifting in response to climate change, but most predictions disregard food-web interactions and, in particular, if and how such interactions change through time. Predator-prey interactions could speed up species range shifts through enemy release or create lags through biotic resistance. Here, we developed a spatially explicit model of interacting species, each with a thermal niche and embedded in a size-structured food-web across a temperature gradient that was then exposed to warming. We also created counterfactual single species models to contrast and highlight the effect of trophic interactions on range shifts. We found that dynamic trophic interactions hampered species range shifts across 450 simulated food-webs with up to 200 species each over 200 years of warming. All species experiencing dynamic trophic interactions shifted more slowly than single-species models would predict. In addition, the trailing edges of larger bodied species ranges shifted especially slowly because of ecological subsidies from small shifting prey. Trophic interactions also reduced the numbers of locally novel species, novel interactions and productive species, thus maintaining historical community compositions for longer. Current forecasts ignoring dynamic food-web interactions and allometry may overestimate species' tendency to track climate change.

AB  - A challenge facing ecologists trying to predict responses to climate change is the few recent analogous conditions to use for comparison. For example, negative relationships between ectotherm body size and temperature are common both across natural thermal gradients and in small-scale experiments. However, it is unknown if short-term body size responses are representative of long-term responses. Moreover, to understand population responses to warming, we must recognize that individual responses to temperature may vary over ontogeny. To enable predictions of how climate warming may affect natural populations, we therefore ask how body size and growth may shift in response to increased temperature over life history, and whether short-and long-term growth responses differ. We addressed these questions using a unique setup with multidecadal artificial heating of an enclosed coastal bay in the Baltic Sea and an adjacent reference area (both with unexploited populations), using before-after control-impact paired time-series analyses. We assembled individual growth trajectories of similar to 13,000 unique individuals of Eurasian perch and found that body growth increased substantially after warming, but the extent depended on body size: Only among small-bodied perch did growth increase with temperature. Moreover, the strength of this response gradually increased over the 24 year warming period. Our study offers a unique example of how warming can affect fish populations over multiple generations, resulting in gradual changes in body growth, varying as organisms develop. Although increased juvenile growth rates are in line with predictions of the temperature-size rule, the fact that a larger body size at age was maintained over life history contrasts to that same rule. Because the artificially heated area is a contemporary system mimicking a warmer sea, our findings can aid predictions of fish responses to further warming, taking into account that growth responses may vary both over an individual's life history and over time.

AB  - 1. Divergent selection was undertaken in a Rhode Island Red population for residual food intake, measured in males and females, using mass selection.
   2. In the absence of a control line, selection response during 14 generations was estimated by the within-year divergence between lines.
   3. The direct response in residual food intake was found to be significant in both sexes, the divergence reaching almost three phenotypic standard deviations in each sex.
   4. Significant correlated responses were obtained for food efficiency; it was improved in the low residual food intake line. Shank length, wattle length and rectal and comb temperature showed higher values in the high line, suggesting an increased heat production or dissipation. Inconsistent changes were observed for other egg production traits.

AB  - Changes in morphological traits along elevation and latitudinal gradients in ectotherms are often interpreted in terms of the temperature-size rule, which states that the body size of organisms increases under low temperatures, and is therefore expected to increase with elevation and latitude. However other factors like host plant might contribute to spatial patterns in size as well, particularly for polyphagous insects. Here elevation patterns for trait size and shape in two leafminer species are examined, Liriomyza huidobrensis (Blanchard) (Diptera: Agromyzidae) and L. sativae Blanchard, along a tropical elevation gradient in Java, Indonesia. Adult leafminers were trapped from different locations in the mountainous area of Dieng in the province of Central Java. To separate environmental versus genetic effects, L. huidobrensis originating from 1378 m and 2129 m ASL were reared in the laboratory for five generations. Size variation along the elevation gradient was only found in L. huidobrensis and this followed expectations based on the temperature-size rule. There were also complex changes in wing shape along the gradient. Morphological differences were influenced by genetic and environmental effects. Findings are discussed within the context of adaptation to different elevations in the two species.

AB  - For many amphibians, high temperatures and limited precipitation are crucial habitat characteristics that limit species ranges and modulate life-history characteristics. Although knowledge of the ability of amphibians to cope with such environmental harshness is particularly relevant in the light of ongoing environmental change, relatively little is known about natural variation in age, maturation and associated life-history traits across species' ranges. We used the analysis of growth rings in bones to investigate the link between environmental harshness and life-history traits, including age and body size distribution, in specimens from 20 populations of the Australian bleating froglet, Crinia pseudinsignifera. Despite the short lifespan of the species, bone slides revealed geographic variation in average age, body size and reproductive investment linked to variation in temperature and rainfall. We found no difference in age at maturation in different climatic harshness regimes. Frogs from harsher environments invested less in their first reproductive event but grew older than their counterparts in more benign environments, thereby allowing for more reproductive events and buffering them against the increased chance of reproductive failure in the harsher environments. For individual frogs, climatic harshness experienced during an individual's life promoted larger body size. Overall, these results illustrate how bone structure analyses from preserved specimens allow both the testing of ecogeographic hypotheses and the assessment of the adaptive potential of species in the light of environmental change.

AB  - In Drosophila, like most ectotherms, development at low temperature reduces growth rate but increases final adult size. Cultures were shifted from 25 degrees C to low (16.5 degrees C) or to high (29 degrees C) temperature at regular intervals through larval and pupal stages, and the flies of both sexes showed an increase or decrease, respectively, in the size of thorax, wing and abdominal tergite. Size changes in the wing blade resulted from changes in the size of the epidermal cells (with only a small increase in cell number in males reared at low temperature). The temperature-shifts became less effective as they were made at successively later developmental stages, demonstrating a cumulative effect of temperature on adult size. The thorax and wing develop From the same imaginal disc, with most cell division occurring in larval stages, but they differ in timing of temperature sensitivity, which extends only to pupariation or into the late pupal stage, respectively. Growth of the adult abdomen occurs largely after pupariation but its size is temperature-sensitive through both larval and pupal stages. We discuss growth control in Drosophila and the likely effects of temperature on food assimilation, growth efficiency and allocation of nutrients to the production of different tissues.

AB  - Tolerance to thermal extremes is critical for the geographic distributions of ectotherm species, many of which are probably going to be modified by future climatic changes. To predict species distributions it is important to understand the potential of species to adapt to changing thermal conditions. Here, we tested whether the thermal tolerance traits of a common freeze-tolerant potworm were correlated with climatic conditions and if adaptation to extreme cold constrains the evolutionary potential for high temperature tolerance. Further, we tested if evolution of thermal tolerance traits is associated with costs in other fitness traits (body size and reproduction). Lastly, we tested if slopes of temperature-survival curves (i.e., the sensitivity distribution) are related to tolerance itself. Using 24 populations of the potworm, Enchytraeus albidus Henle (Enchytraeidae), collected from a wide range of climatic conditions, we established a common garden experiment in which we determined high and low temperature tolerance (using survival as endpoint), average reproductive output and adult body size. Heat tolerance was not related to environmental temperatures whereas lower lethal temperature was about 10 degrees C lower in Arctic populations than in populations from temperate regions. Reproduction was not related to environmental temperature, but was negatively correlated with cold tolerance. One explanation for the trade-off between cold tolerance and reproduction could be that the more cold-hardy populations need to channel energy to large glycogen reserves at the expense of less energy expenditure for reproduction. Adult body size was negatively related to environmental temperature. Finally, the slopes of temperature-survival curves were significantly correlated with critical temperature limits for heat and cold tolerance; i.e., slopes increased with thermal tolerance. Our results suggest that relatively heat-sensitive populations possess genetic variation, leaving room for improved heat tolerance through evolutionary processes, which may alleviate the effects of a warmer future climate in the Arctic. On the other hand, we observed relatively narrow sensitivity distributions (i.e., less variation) in the most heat tolerant populations. Taken together, our results suggest that both cold and heat tolerance can only be selected for (and improved) until a certain limit has been reached.

AB  - Understanding how organisms adapt to complex environments lies at the very heart of evolutionary biology and ecology, and is of particular concern in the current era of anthropogenic global change. Variation in ecologically important traits associated with environmental gradients is considered to be strong evidence for adaptive responses. Here, we study phenotypic variation along a latitudinal and an altitudinal cline in 968 field-collected males of the widespread European butterfly Pieris napi. In contrast to our expectations, body size decreased with increasing latitude and altitude, suggesting that warmer rather than cooler conditions may be more beneficial for individual development in this species. Higher altitudes but not latitudes seemed to be associated with increased flight performance, suggesting stronger challenges for flight activity in high-altitude environments (e.g. due to strong wind). Moreover, wing melanization increased while yellow reflectance decreased towards colder environments in both clines. Thus, increased melanization under thermally challenging conditions seems to compromise investment into a sexually selected trait, resulting in a trade-off. Our study, although exclusively based on field-collected males, revealed indications of adaptive patterns along geographical clines. It documents the usefulness of field-collected specimens, and the strength of comparing latitudinal and altitudinal clines to identify traits being potentially under thermal selection.

AB  - Metabolic theory predicts that maintenance rate increases faster with animal body size than food intake rate, such that the critical resource density R* at which ingested energy exactly covers maintenance requirements increases with body size. Small-sized (low R*) juveniles may thus exclude their larger-sized (high R*) parents in resource competition, resulting in apparent semelparous life histories and non-overlapping generations. However, empirical support for such a competition-driven semelparity (CDS) remains scarce. Here, we report a high consistency of cohort dynamics with CDS in wild medaka (Oryzias latipes). As predicted by the theory, there was a strong juvenile-adult diet overlap, and all individuals died after reproduction as semelparous age-1 adults, synchronous with a rapid somatic growth of age-0 juveniles into the adult stage and with dropping abundances of zooplankton food resources. In addition to the theory, we found evidence for increased reproductive allocation under food stress, translating into immune depression and elevated parasite prevalence. Therefore, CDS in medaka emerges both from intercohort competitive exclusion and from food-dependent energy reallocation from maintenance to reproduction, the later presumably representing an adaptive response to the former. The literature data show that the strengths of both intercohort competition and reproductive allocation increase at higher temperatures in many ectotherms, pointing to climate warming as a potentially powerful magnifier of CDS in the wild.

AB  - Body size dines in Drosophila melanogaster have been documented in both Australia and South America, and may exist in Southern Africa. We crossed flies from the northern and southern ends of each of these dines to produce F-1, F-2, and first backcross generations. Our analysis of generation means for wing area and wing length produced estimates of the additive, dominance, epistatic, and maternal effects underlying divergence within each dine. For both females and males of all three dines, the generation means were adequately described by these parameters, indicating that linkage and higher order interactions did not contribute significantly to wing size divergence. Marked differences were apparent between the dines in the occurrence and magnitude of the significant genetic parameters. No dine was adequately described by a simple additive-dominance model, and significant epistatic and maternal effects occurred in most, but not all, of the dines. Generation variances were also analyzed. Only one dine was described sufficiently by a simple additive variance model, indicating significant epistatic, maternal, or linkage effects in the remaining two dines. The diversity in genetic architecture of the dines suggests that natural selection has produced similar phenotypic divergence by different combinations of gene action and interaction.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity and adaptive evolution enable population persistence in response to global change. However, there are few experiments that test how these processes interact within and across generations, especially in marine species with broad distributions experiencing spatially and temporally variable temperature and pCO(2). We employed a quantitative genetics experiment with the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, to decompose family-level variation in transgenerational and developmental plastic responses to ecologically relevant temperature and pCO(2). Adults were conditioned to controlled non-upwelling (high temperature, low pCO(2)) or upwelling (low temperature, high pCO(2)) conditions. Embryos were reared in either the same conditions as their parents or the crossed environment, and morphological aspects of larval body size were quantified. We find evidence of family-level phenotypic plasticity in response to different developmental environments. Among developmental environments, there was substantial additive genetic variance for one body size metric when larvae developed under upwelling conditions, although this differed based on parental environment. Furthermore, cross-environment correlations indicate significant variance for genotype-by-environment interactive effects. Therefore, genetic variation for plasticity is evident in early stages of S. purpuratus, emphasizing the importance of adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity in organismal responses to global change.

AB  - 1. Accumulating evidence suggests that the phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) locus is under thermal selection. In the Copper butterfly Lycaena tityrus PGI allele frequencies show altitudinal variation, with a single genotype occurring in c. 90% of high-altitude animals. In low-altitude populations variation at this locus is much higher.
   2. Here, we investigate variation in life-history traits and temperature stress resistance across PGI genotypes in L. tityrus from different lowland populations reared at two temperatures (19 and 24 degrees C).
   3. PGI genotype significantly affected larval and pupal development time, growth rate, pupal mass and chill-coma recovery time, but had no effect on heat knock-down resistance. The latter suggests that heat and cold stress resistance are based on differential mechanisms.
   4. As expected temperature also influenced all traits under investigation, its effect being more pronounced compared to that of PGI genotype (except for pupal mass).
   5. Patterns found for the PGI genotype dominating in high-altitude populations were consistent with those found for high-altitude animals. Therefore, and because of the direct link between PGI genotype and cold stress resistance, we conclude that PGI is likely to contribute to thermal adaptation in L. tityrus.
   6. Genotypes promoting rapid development and largest body size were rather rare, suggesting weak selection on both traits and/or rather high associated costs.

AB  - In previous studies, the relationship between developmental temperature and phenotypic or genetic variability has been mainly investigated using different constant temperatures. Natural conditions, however, are characterized by daily thermal cycles, sometimes resulting in a periodic daily stress. Using the isofemale line technique, we examined the effects of daily cycles on body size in two French populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We used either cold stress (daily cycle 8-25 degreesC, average 16.5 degreesC) or heat stress (cycle 18-33 degreesC, average 25.5 degreesC), and the results were compared to those obtained at two constant temperatures, 17 and 25 degreesC. In all cases, stressful regimes produced specific effects, the mean trait values being smaller than those observed under constant conditions. Significant differences were also found for the variance parameters. For the within-line variance, which mostly expresses an environmental component, the two cycling regimes produced similar outcomes - that is, a significant increase in individual variability. For the between-line, genetic variance, however, contrasting results were obtained: an increase with cold stress but a decrease with heat stress. With respect to constant-temperature conditions, evolvability (genetic CV) was increased by daily cold stress, but decreased by daily heat stress. Within-line correlations, between wing and thorax length, were stable and not affected by stress, whereas the between-line, genetic correlation was maximum under cold stress and minimum under heat stress. These results demonstrate that a periodic stress may induce specific effects with respect to permanent stress, and that heat and cold are not equivalent. A possible adaptive interpretation, related to the fact that temperate populations are certainly submitted to cold stress but not to heat stress, is discussed.

AB  - Studying relative investment of resources towards early and delayed reproduction is central to understand life history evolution since these traits are generally negatively correlated and traded-off against several other fitness components. For this purpose, ovigeny index (OI), which is calculated as the fraction of the maximum potential lifetime egg complement that is mature upon female emergence, has been developed in insects. Despite the central role of temperature on life history evolution in ectotherms, its influence on ovigeny index has never been tested. Adaptive models imply that OI should increase with temperature because of changes in body size, but the same influence may be expected considering physiological effects of temperature on egg maturation rate or amount of energy available. We investigated in the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi the influence of temperature experienced by the immature and/or the adult (from 12 degrees C to 28 degrees C) on ovigeny index and oviposition behaviour. As predicted, OI increased between 16 and 28 degrees C, i.e. females were able to reproduce earlier as temperature increased but this was traded off against a lower delayed reproduction. The highest OI was however observed at 12 degrees, probably because this temperature was too low for females to mature eggs. Females that developed at 20 degrees C and were transferred as adult at 24 degrees C and 28 degrees C had the highest ovigeny index and laid more eggs during the early oviposition period while those transferred at 16 degrees C laid more eggs at the end of their life. Our results suggest that ovigeny index is not only influenced by body size - i.e. the adaptive explanation - but also by adult egg maturation rate, lifespan or amount of energy available - i.e. a physiological and adaptive explanation.

AB  - Is sex a product of genes, the environment, or both? In this review, we describe the diversity of sex-determining mechanisms in reptiles, with a focus on systems that display gene-environment interactions. We summarise the field and laboratory-based evidence for the occurrence of environmental sex reversal in reptiles and ask whether this is a widespread evolutionary mechanism affecting the evolution of sex chromosomes and speciation in vertebrates. Sex determination systems exist across a continuum of genetic and environmental influences, blurring the lines between what was once considered a strict dichotomy between genetic sex determination and temperature-dependent sex determination. Across this spectrum, we identify the potential for sex reversal in species with clearly differentiated heteromorphic sex chromosomes (Pogona vitticeps, Bassiana duperreyi, Eremias multiocellata, Gekko japonicus), weakly differentiated homomorphic sex chromosomes (Niveoscincus ocellatus), and species with only a weak heritable predisposition for sex (Emys orbicularis, Trachemys scripta). We argue that sex reversal is widespread in reptiles (Testudines, Lacertidae, Agamidae, Scincidae, Gekkonidae) and has the potential to have an impact on individual fitness, resulting in reproductively, morphologically, and behaviourally unique phenotypes. Sex reversal is likely to be a powerful evolutionary force responsible for generating and maintaining lability and diversity in reptile sex-determining modes. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Correlated responses to artificial selection on body size in Drosophila melanogaster were investigated, to determine how the changes in size were produced during development. Selection for increased thorax length was associated with an increase in larval development time, an extended growth period, no change in growth rate, and an increased critical larval weight for pupariation. Selection for reduced thorax length was associated with reduced growth rate, no change in duration of larval development and a reduced critical larval weight for pupariation. In both lines selected for thorax length and lines selected for wing area, total body size changed in the same direction as the artificially selected trait. In large selection lines of both types, the increase in size was achieved almost entirely by an increase in cell number, while in the small lines the decrease in size was achieved predominantly by reduced cell size, and also by a reduction in cell number. The implications of the results for evolutionary-genetic change in body size in nature are discussed.

AB  - The rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis Walker, overwinters as larvae that undergo facultative diapause in response to short day lengths. This study tested the hypothesis that exposure to warm temperature reduces the survivorship of overwintering larvae, thereby eventually decreasing the outbreak in the following year. We exposed overwintering larvae to various temperature treatments of 1, 5 and 10 A degrees C and natural conditions with a daily mean temperature of 9.3 A degrees C for 5-6 months. As C. suppressalis undergoes three complete generations and a partial fourth generation each year, we systematically compared the survival rates and the body weights of overwintering larvae, the dynamics of diapause termination (i.e., pupation rate), and the post-diapause reproductive potential, as indicated by pupal weight and female fecundity among the treatments. In all treatments, we observed a gradual decline in the survival rate of overwintering larvae, starting in October for the third generation and in November for the fourth generation and continuing until the following May. Temperature treatments significantly affected the body weights of overwintering larvae. Simulated warmer winter temperatures also resulted in similar declines in pupation rate, pupal weight and post-diapause reproductive potential. It was the relatively lower temperatures of 1 and 5 A degrees C, rather than the warm temperature of 10 A degrees C, that was propitious to the survival of overwintering larvae and increased post-diapause reproduction potential in the following year. Therefore, exposure to warm temperatures is detrimental to overwintering populations of C.suppressalis, which provides useful information for monitoring their population dynamics in practice.
   Warmer temperatures are generally considered favorable for increasing the overwintering survival of insects in some climatic areas; however, this is unlikely to be a universal effect. The influence of temperatures during overwintering upon survival and post-diapause reproductive potential in C. suppressalis was tested; the survivorship was actually lower at the higher temperature. The results suggest that mild warm temperatures near the threshold temperature for post-diapause development decreased the survival of overwintering larvae and the post-diapause reproductive potential in the rice stem borer C. suppressalis.

AB  - Cities are often hotter and drier compared with nearby undeveloped areas, but how organisms respond to these multifarious stressors associated with urban heat islands is largely unknown. Terrestrial isopods are especially susceptible to temperature and aridity stress as they have retained highly permeable gills from their aquatic ancestors. We performed a two temperature common garden experiment with urban and rural populations of the terrestrial isopod,Oniscus asellus, to uncover evidence for plastic and evolutionary responses to urban heat islands. We focused on physiological tolerance traits including tolerance of heat, cold, and desiccation. We also examined body size responses to urban heat islands, as size can modulate physiological tolerances. We found that different mechanisms underlie responses to urban heat islands. While evidence suggests urban isopods may have evolved higher heat tolerance, urban and rural isopods had statistically indistinguishable cold and desiccation tolerances. In both populations, plasticity to warmer rearing temperature diminished cold tolerance. Although field-collected urban and rural isopods were the same size, rearing temperature positively affected body size. Finally, larger size improved desiccation tolerance, which itself was influenced by rearing temperature. Our study demonstrates how multifarious changes associated with urban heat islands will not necessarily contribute to contemporary evolution in each of the corresponding physiological traits.

AB  - Changes in body size inversely related to ambient temperatures have been described in woodrats (Neotoma) over time scales ranging from decades to millennia. However, climate-mediated variation in other traits has not been evaluated, and the effects of precipitation have been overlooked. We assessed variation in skull morphology among bushy-tailed woodrats (Neotoma cinerea) over two sampling transects spanning coastal rainforest and interior desert environments to determine whether skull morphology varied with climate. We also tested whether previously described size-temperature relationships could be generalized to our study populations. In both transects, linear measurements of functionally significant traits differed between coastal and interior populations. Geometric morphometric analyses of shape confirmed some of those differences and revealed additional patterns of skull variation. Variation in some linear measurements, including body size, was predicted by climate. However, body and skull size, as well as measurements of skull components, displayed varying responses. Although longitudinal patterns of body size variation supported Bergmann's rule, skull size variation was only weakly associated with climate. The strongest phenotypic responses to climate were those of auditory, dental, and palatal skull traits. Altogether, our findings suggest that geographic variation in temperature and precipitation mediated selective heterogeneity and plasticity in skull traits associated with food processing and sensory organs in N. cinerea. This was consistent with our expectation of resource-dependent phenotypic variation among populations in environments with highly contrasting climatic regimes.

AB  - Ocean warming and acidification are concomitant global drivers that are currently threatening the survival of marine organisms. How species will respond to these changes depends on their capacity for plastic and adaptive responses. Little is known about the mechanisms that govern plasticity and adaptability or how global changes will influence these relationships across multiple generations. Here, we exposed the emerging model marine polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica to conditions simulating ocean warming and acidification, in isolation and in combination over five generations to identify: (i) how multiple versus single global change drivers alter both juvenile and adult life-history traits; (ii) the mechanistic link between adult physiological and fitness-related life-history traits; and (iii) whether the phenotypic changes observed over multiple generations are of plastic and/or adaptive origin. Two juvenile (developmental rate; survival to sexual maturity) and two adult (average reproductive body size; fecundity) life-history traits were measured in each generation, in addition to three physiological (cellular reactive oxygen species content, mitochondrial density, mitochondrial capacity) traits. We found that multi-generational exposure to warming alone caused an increase in juvenile developmental rate, reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial density, decreases in average reproductive body size and fecundity, and fluctuations in mitochondrial capacity, relative to control conditions. Exposure to ocean acidification alone had only minor effects on juvenile developmental rate. Remarkably, when both drivers of global change were present, only mitochondrial capacity was significantly affected, suggesting that ocean warming and acidification act as opposing vectors of stress across multiple generations.

AB  - Environmental stress reduces the fitness of organisms, and in this manner may shape species distribution and evolutionary change. Ecologists have long been interested in physiological mechanisms that reduce the effects of stress and result in improved fitness. It has previously been suggested (1) that selection for stress resistance will bring about the evolution of lower standard metabolic rates and (2) that organisms with increased stress resistance will have a lower metabolic rate during stressful conditions, compared to stress-sensitive organisms. We have tested these hypotheses using replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Desiccation and starvation-selected populations and their controls, as well as populations selected for postponed senescence and their short-generation controls were examined. The metabolic rate of each selected and control population was measured under three different environmental conditions: (1) desiccation (no food or water), (2) starvation (water present, no food), and (3) food condition (food and water present). The carbohydrate and lipid content of each population were also measured. All selected and control populations lowered their metabolic rates when measured under starving conditions compared to food conditions. The metabolic rates of flies under desiccating conditions did not differ from food conditions regardless of selection treatment. When comparing the mass-specific metabolic rates of stress-selected populations to their controls, stress-selected populations had a significantly lower mass-specific metabolic rate in all cases, regardless of the environmental conditions under which the measurements were made. However, once the mass of nonmetabolizing lipid and carbohydrate was accounted for and metabolic rate was expressed in carbohydrate-lipid free mass, selected populations did not differ significantly in metabolic rate from control populations, regardless of the environmental condition under which the measurements were made. We conclude that in the case of D. melanogaster, resistance to stress does not require the evolution of a lower metabolic rate. Instead, the accumulation of metabolic resources such as carbohydrate and lipid may be important for resistance to specific forms of stress.

AB  - Plant species and functional trait diversity have each been shown to improve green roof services. Species and trait differences that contribute to ecosystem services are the product of past evolutionary change and phylogenetic diversity (PD), which quantifies the relatedness among species within a community. In this study, we present an experimental framework to assess the contribution of plant community PD for green roof ecosystem service delivery, and data from one season that support our hypotheses that PD would be positively correlated with two services: building cooling and rainwater management. Using 28 plant species in 12 families, we created six community combinations with different levels of PD. Each of these communities was replicated at eight green roofs along an elevation gradient, as well as a ground level control. We found that the minimum and mean roof temperature decreased with increasing PD in the plant community. Increasing PD also led to an increase in the volume of rainwater captured, but not the proportion of water lost via evapotranspiration 48 hr following the rain event. Our findings suggest that considering these evolutionary relationships could improve functioning of green infrastructure and we recommend that understanding how to make PD (and other measures of diversity) serviceable for plant selection by practitioners will improve the effectiveness of design and ecosystem service delivery. Lastly, since no two green roof sites are the same and can vary tremendously in microclimate conditions, our study illustrates the importance of including multiple independent sites in studies of green roof performance.

AB  - There is a scientific debate whether oxygen concentration may be a factor driving the pattern of size decrease at higher temperature. Central to this debate is the fact that oxygen availability relative to demand for living organisms decreases with increasing temperature. We examined whether rotifers Lecane inermis exposed to hypoxic conditions would evolve smaller sizes than rotifers exposed to normoxic conditions, using experimental evolution with the same fluctuating temperature but differentiated by three regimes of oxygen availability: normoxia, hypoxia throughout the whole thermal range, and hypoxia only at the highest temperature. Immediately after the six-month experiment (more than 90 generations), we tested the plasticity of size responses to temperature in three post-evolution groups, and we related these responses to fitness. The results show that normoxic rotifers had evolved significantly larger sizes than two hypoxic rotifer groups, which were similar in size. All three groups displayed similar plastic body size reductions in response to warming over the range of temperatures they were exposed to during the period of experimental evolution, but they showed different and complex responses at two temperatures below this range. Any type of plastic response to different temperatures resulted in a similar fitness pattern across post-evolution groups. We conclude that (i) these rotifers showed a genetic basis for the pattern of size decrease following evolution under both temperature-dependent and temperature-independent hypoxia; and (ii) plastic body size responds consistently to temperatures that are within the thermal range that the rotifers experienced during their evolutionary history, but responses become more noisy at novel temperatures, suggesting the importance of evolutionary responses to reliable environmental cues.

AB  - Many species are expanding their range polewards, and this has been associated with rapid phenotypic change. Yet, it is unclear to what extent this reflects rapid genetic adaptation or neutral processes associated with range expansion, or selection linked to the new thermal conditions encountered. To disentangle these alternatives, we studied the genomic signature of range expansion in the damselfly Coenagrion scitulum using 4950 newly developed genomic SNPs and linked this to the rapidly evolved phenotypic differences between core and (newly established) edge populations. Most edge populations were genetically clearly differentiated from the core populations and all were differentiated from each other indicating independent range expansion events. In addition, evidence for genetic drift in the edge populations, and strong evidence for adaptive genetic variation in association with the range expansion was detected. We identified one SNP under consistent selection in four of the five edge populations and showed that the allele increasing in frequency is associated with increased flight performance. This indicates collateral, non-neutral evolutionary changes in independent edge populations driven by the range expansion process. We also detected a genomic signature of adaptation to the newly encountered thermal regimes, reflecting a pattern of countergradient variation. The latter signature was identified at a single SNP as well as in a set of covarying SNPs using a polygenic multilocus approach to detect selection. Overall, this study highlights how a strategic geographic sampling design and the integration of genomic, phenotypic and environmental data can identify and disentangle the neutral and adaptive processes that are simultaneously operating during range expansions.

AB  - We describe differences in senescence among populations of grasshoppers that occur along an altitudinal gradient in the Sierra Nevada, California. Experimental males from five populations of the Melanoplus sanguinipes/devastator sibling species complex were reared in each of two thermal culture conditions from eggs of field-caught females. In both culture conditions, we measured the survival of adult cohorts from each population. Differences in the physiological capacity to survive in a sheltered, common environment reveal genetic differences in underlying rates of senescence, providing maternal effects do not affect the rate of aging in offspring. At each temperature, mortality rates increased as a function of age, which indicates that senescence occurs under laboratory conditions. Within each culture condition, cohorts originating from low-elevation populations had greater survival than did cohorts from high elevations. Variation in body size along the altitudinal gradient did not account for the differences in survival. We suggest that high-elevation populations have evolved accelerated senescence as a direct or an indirect result of selection on reproductive schedules, which are potentially truncated by severe winter conditions at the elevated sites.

AB  - Widespread species often show geographic variation in thermally-sensitive traits, providing insight into how species respond to shifts in temperature through time. Such patterns may arise from phenotypic plasticity, genetic adaptation, or their interaction. In some cases, the effects of genotype and temperature may act together to reduce, or to exacerbate, phenotypic variation in fitness-related traits across varying thermal environments. We find evidence for such interactions in life-history traits of Heteronympha merope, a butterfly distributed across a broad latitudinal gradient in south-eastern Australia. We show that body size in this butterfly is negatively related to developmental temperature in the laboratory, in accordance with the temperature-size rule, but not in the field, despite very strong temperature gradients. A common garden experiment on larval thermal responses, spanning the environmental extremes of H. merope's distribution, revealed that butterflies from low latitude (warmer climate) populations have relatively fast intrinsic growth and development rates compared to those from cooler climates. These synergistic effects of genotype and temperature across the landscape (co-gradient variation) are likely to accentuate phenotypic variation in these traits, and this interaction must be accounted for when predicting how H. merope will respond to temperature change through time. These results highlight the importance of understanding how variation in life-history traits may arise in response to environmental change. Without this knowledge, we may fail to detect whether organisms are tracking environmental change, and if they are, whether it is by plasticity, adaptation or both.

AB  - Evolutionary adaptation affects demographic resilience to climate change but few studies have attempted to project changes in selective pressures or quantify impacts of trait responses on population dynamics and extinction risk. We used a novel individual-based model to explore potential evolutionary changes in migration timing and the consequences for population persistence in sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in the Fraser River, Canada, under scenarios of future climate warming. Adult sockeye salmon are highly sensitive to increases in water temperature during their arduous upriver migration, raising concerns about the fate of these ecologically, culturally, and commercially important fish in a warmer future. Our results suggest that evolution of upriver migration timing could allow these salmon to avoid increasingly frequent stressful temperatures, with the odds of population persistence increasing in proportion to the trait heritability and phenotypic variance. With a simulated 2 degrees C increase in average summer river temperatures by 2100, adult migration timing from the ocean to the river advanced by similar to 10 days when the heritability was 0.5, while the risk of quasi-extinction was only 17% of that faced by populations with zero evolutionary potential (i.e., heritability fixed at zero). The rates of evolution required to maintain persistence under simulated scenarios of moderate to rapid warming are plausible based on estimated heritabilities and rates of microevolution of timing traits in salmon and related species, although further empirical work is required to assess potential genetic and ecophysiological constraints on phenological adaptation. These results highlight the benefits to salmon management of maintaining evolutionary potential within populations, in addition to conserving key habitats and minimizing additional stressors where possible, as a means to build resilience to ongoing climate change. More generally, they demonstrate the importance and feasibility of considering evolutionary processes, in addition to ecology and demography, when projecting population responses to environmental change.

AB  - The courtship song of male Drosophila melanogaster is generated by wing vibration and contains an interpulse interval (IPI) which is species-specific and usually falls in the mean range of 30-40 ms. The IPI is extremely temperature-sensitive, so we wondered whether flies collected along the eastern coast of Australia between latitudes 16.9 degrees S and 42.9 degrees S might have adapted to the different thermal conditions and show differences in mean IPI. We observe a significant correlation between IPI and latitude in addition to the well-known association between latitude and body size (Bergmannn's Rule). However, somewhat surprisingly we could not detect a significant association between body size and IPI. We also examined flies collected from the North and South-facing slopes of 'Evolution Canyon' in Israel and observed differences in IPI that support the view that thermal adaptation can shape this important song character. We also examined the songs of flies from Kenya and observed no correlation between altitude of collection and IPI. In all three experiments, body size did not correlate with IPI. A global analysis of all three sets of populations on three continents revealed a strong association between IPI and latitude. We speculate that IPI is shaped by thermal and sexual selection whereas body size is also shaped by natural selection.

AB  - Ectothermal vertebrates regulate their body temperature within definite limits to maintain physiological processes at their optimal levels. Among others, food processing and absorption are strongly temperature-dependent. Deficiency of adequate temperatures limits ectotherms in growth and maintenance. On the other hand, thermoregulatory behavior is costly and should be constrained by many factors. Using artificial thermal gradients (26-44 degrees C), we measured temperature preferences of 10 spiny-tailed agamas (Uromastyx acanthinura) in controlled indoor experiment. Each lizard could choose place in the terrarium before and after feeding. Then, temperature preferences during pre-feeding and post-feeding periods were compared. We found significant increase of preferred temperature after feeding. Detailed view revealed that there is consistent influence of body size: bigger lizards maintained higher temperature during the whole experiment. We hypothesize that bigger potential predation risk on smaller lizards due to their size would force them to choose less optimal conditions.

AB  - Intralocus sexual conflict occurs when opposing selection pressures operate on loci expressed in both sexes, constraining the evolution of sexual dimorphism and displacing one or both sexes from their optimum. We eliminated intralocus conflict in Drosophila melanogaster by limiting transmission of all major chromosomes to males, thereby allowing them to win the intersexual tug-of-war. Here, we show that this male-limited (ML) evolution treatment led to the evolution (in both sexes) of masculinized wing morphology, body size, growth rate, wing loading, and allometry. In addition to more male-like size and shape, ML evolution resulted in an increase in developmental stability for males. However, females expressing ML chromosomes were less developmentally stable, suggesting that being ontogenetically more male-like was disruptive to development. We suggest that sexual selection over size and shape of the imago may therefore explain the persistence of substantial genetic variation in these characters and the ontogenetic processes underlying them.

AB  - Life-history models for marine invertebrate larvae generally predict a dichotomy in egg size in different species: eggs should be either minimal in size or large enough to support development fully without larval feeding. This prediction is contradicted, however, by the empirical observation of wide, continuous variation in egg size between these extremes. The prediction of dichotomy rests on the assumption of a negative linear relationship between egg size and development time. Here, I present a simple model in which development time is inversely proportional to egg size. Incorporating this relationship into an optimality model produces predictions of intermediate rather than extreme egg size. Modeled variations in mortality, food availability, fertilization rates, and temperature all produce continuous shifts in the value of the intermediate optimal size, in direct contrast to those produced by previous models, which predict shifts between two extreme optima. Empirical data on echinoid egg size and development time strongly support the model's assumption of an inverse proportional relationship between egg size and development time. A composite phylogeny is constructed of the 37 species for which egg size, development time, water temperature, and phylogenetic relatedness are known. Independent contrasts are made of the evolutionary changes in egg size and development time. This analysis indicates that evolutionary shifts in development time are correlated with the inversely proportional shifts in egg size assumed in the model. The assumption of a negative linear relationship used in previous models is rejected. This model provides a potential explanation for intraspecific variation in egg size along environmental gradients, sympatric differences in egg size among species, and biogeographic trends in egg size and development mode across taxa.

AB  - For ectotherms, environmental temperature affects the optimal size and number of offspring via multiple mechanisms. First, temperature influences the performance of offspring, which directly affects the optimal size of offspring. Second, temperature influences maternal body size, which indirectly affects the optimal size and/or number of offspring when larger females acquire more energetic resources or provide better parental care. Although traditional statistical approaches might distinguish the relative importance of these effects, an information-theoretic approach enables one to estimate effects more accurately by identifying the best evolutionary model in a set of candidate models. Here, we use the Akaike Information Criterion to calculate the likelihoods of seven path models, each derived from one or more optimality models of reproduction. Variation in reproductive traits among populations of lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) was used to quantify support for the models. Our results overwhelmingly supported a model based on an indirect effect of temperature that is mediated by maternal size. Path coefficients of this model were consistent with the hypotheses that, first, larger females can acquire more energy for reproduction and, second, the survival of offspring depends on both their size and their density. Our analyses exemplify how information theory can identify evolutionary hypotheses that merit experimental testing.

AB  - What limits a species' distribution in the absence of physical barriers? Genetic load due to asymmetric gene flow and the absence of genetic variation due to lack of gene flow are hypothesized to constrain adaptation to novel environments in marginal populations, preventing range expansion. Here, we examined the genetic structure and geographic variation in morphological traits in two damselflies (Ischnura asiatica and I. senegalensis) along a latitudinal gradient in Japan, which is the distribution centre of I. asiatica and the northern limit of I. senegalensis. Genomewide genetic analyses found a loss of genetic diversity at the edge of distribution in I. senegalensis but consistently high diversity in I. asiatica. Gene flow was asymmetric in a south-north direction in both species. Although body size and wing loading showed decreasing latitudinal clines (smaller in north) in I. asiatica in Japan, increasing latitudinal clines (larger in north) in these phenotypic markers were observed in I. senegalensis, particularly near the northern boundary, which coincided well with the location where genetic diversity began a sharp decline. In ectothermic animals, increasing latitudinal cline in these traits was suggested to be established when they failed to adapt to thermal gradient. Therefore, our findings support the possibility that a lack of genetic variation rather than geneflow swamping is responsible for the constraint of adaptation at the margin of geographic distribution.

AB  - Aim Climatic variation has long been regarded as a primary source of morphological variation. However, there is mixed support for the adherence of reptiles to ecogeographical hypotheses, such as Bergmann's rule (body size decreases with temperature) and Allen's rule (limb length increases with temperature). We quantified body and limb morphology among the diverse Australian gecko fauna (4 families, 30 genera, 226 of the 231 described species) to investigate environmental correlates of morphological variation in this radiation.
   Location Australia.
   Major taxa studied Geckos (Squamata: Gekkota; the families Gekkonidae, Carphodactylidae, Diplodactylidae and Pygopodidae).
   Methods We measured 20 external features of ethanol-preserved museum specimens. We investigated whether principal component axes of morphology were correlated with three key environmental variables, and the microhabitat occupied by each species.
   Results Morphology varied greatly among Australian gecko families and genera, although there was a strong phylogenetic signal in morphology. After accounting for phylogeny, morphology was correlated with a species' microhabitat use. Saxicolous species and species with variable microhabitat requirements (i.e., generalists) had larger body dimensions than terrestrial species. Saxicolous species also had longer proportional forelimbs and hindlimbs than terrestrial species.
   Main conclusions Our results highlight the importance of phylogeny and microhabitat use in shaping the morphology of Australian geckos. We find little evidence that Australian geckos adhere to Bergmann's rule or Allen's rule, suggesting that these ecogeographical hypotheses provide limited insight into the adaptive potential of lizard species to altered environmental conditions.

AB  - Body size has been shown to decrease with increasing temperature in many species, prompting the suggestion that it is a universal ecological response. However, species with complex life cycles, such as holometabolous insects, may have correspondingly complicated temperature-size responses. Recent research suggests that life history and ecological traits may be important for determining the direction and strength of temperature-size responses. Yet, these factors are rarely included in analyses. Here, we aim to determine whether the size of the bivoltine butterfly, Polyommatus bellargus, and the univoltine butterflies, Plebejus argus and Polyommatus coridon, change in response to temperature and whether these responses differ between the sexes, and for P. bellargus, between generations. Forewing length was measured using digital specimens from the Natural History Museum, London (NHM), from one locality in the UK per species. The data were initially compared to annual and seasonal temperature values, without consideration of life history factors. Sex and generation of the individuals and mean monthly temperatures, which cover the growing period for each species, were then included in analyses. When compared to annual or seasonal temperatures only, size was not related to temperature for P. bellargus and P. argus, but there was a negative relationship between size and temperature for P. coridon. When sex, generation, and monthly temperatures were included, male adult size decreased as temperature increased in the early larval stages, and increased as temperature increased during the late larval stages. Results were similar but less consistent for females, while second generation P. bellargus showed no temperature-size response. In P. coridon, size decreased as temperature increased during the pupal stage. These results highlight the importance of including life history factors, sex, and monthly temperature data when studying temperature-size responses for species with complex life cycles.

AB  - Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, were obtained as eggs from two North American sources, an eastern (Fraser River, Canada) and a western (Bristol Bay, Alaska, USA) stock. Fish were pit tagged (eastern (X) over bar +/- SE = 247 +/- 13 g, western (X) over bar +/- SE = 220 +/- 4 g) and stocked communally into three replicated 7-m(3) tanks at a density of 7.6+/-1.2 kg/m(3). Each tank was supplied with 2 ppt salinity water from a recirculating biological filtration system. Fish were fed a commercial diet (48% P, 20% F) from automatic feeders. Fish were harvested approximately 24mo after hatching at a final tank density of 56.2+/-1.3 kg/m3. Mean daily water temperature was 10.4 C with a range of 5.9-12.6 C and mean dissolved oxygen was 12.6mg/L with a range of 9.7 (91% of saturation) to 17.8mg/L (149% of saturation). Individual fish were evaluated for total, carcass, and fillet weight, sex, stage of sexual maturity, fillet fat, fillet color, and gonad weight. The western stock fish grew faster and were significantly larger ((X) over bar +/- SE = 1.89 +/- 0.03 kg) (P < 0.0001) than the eastern stock (<(X)over bar> +/- SE = 1.19 +/- 0.04 kg). Heritabilities were low for all traits and ranged from 0.08+/-0.06 to 0.28+/-0.09. Genetic correlations for body size traits were highly positive and significant (0.99-1.00). Genetic correlations of fillet color and body size traits were positive, but not significant. Genetic correlations of fillet fat with body size traits were negative, but not significant. Genetic correlation of fillet fat and fillet color was positive and significant (0.55+/-0.27). Random genetic variation was assessed from microsatellite variability on 30 fish from each stock (eastern and western) and 32 fish from a third commercial source of unknown origin for comparison. The amount of variation detected in the western stock was higher than the eastern and commercial stocks. The eastern stock was composed of an admixture of two sources, the commercial stock was composed by three different sources, and the western stock was composed by three to four source populations. Data will be used to calculate breeding values on a separate group of captive sibling adult broodfish and a line selected for carcass weight and maturity at 3 yr will be developed.

AB  - Estimating the production of marine copepods depends on measuring two key variables: biomass and growth rate. The major difficulty in estimating production of marine copepods and other zooplankton has been the inability to obtain precise, rapid measurements. In practice the variability in measurement of biomass greatly exceeds that in growth rate. It is shown here that individual growth rates of copepods can be accurately estimated from data on generation times and the weights of eggs and adults. Analysis of 181 separately published estimates of generation time for 33 species of copepods at environmental temperatures ranging from -1.7-degrees to 30.7-degrees-C shows that temperature alone explains more than 90% of the variance in growth rate. Temperature dependence of growth rate transcends species differences. Weight-specific growth rate appears to be independent of body size. We hypothesize that food may not be limiting to growth in nature; the impression that food is limiting may be due to sampling at the wrong scales. Another possible cause of the apparent maximum growth rates of copepods in nature is predation mortality, which could selectively remove slower-growing individuals from the population. The temperature-dependent model developed here predicts the phenomenon of decreasing body size with increasing environmental temperature, often observed for single species of copepods. A method is suggested for making more accurate estimates of secondary production by using modern instrumentation to make quasi-synoptic measurements of biomass and temperature and using the temperature-dependent model to estimate individual growth rates.

AB  - Body size is a key determinant of fitness in Daphnia. Bigger size means higher feeding efficiency and reproduction. However, filamentous cyanobacteria have a more detrimental effect on larger daphnids. Predicted global warming is expected to reduce size of Daphnia and facilitate frequent occurrence of cyanobacteria. Therefore, we asked two questions: (i) does elevated temperature cause reduced size of daphnids, and (ii) is temperature-dependent size reduction adaptive in an environment dominated by filamentous cyanobacteria? To address these issues, we obtained 8 clones of the Daphnia longispina complex from artificially heated lakes and 8 clones from control lakes, and exposed them to a favorable food Scenedesmus obliquus and a mixture of S. obliquus and the filamentous cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in life table experiments at 16, 20, and 24A degrees C. Individuals from heated lakes attained larger body size than those from control lakes. Moreover, exposure to the filamentous cyanobacterium led to reduced fecundity of Daphnia from the non-heated lakes and did not affect reproduction of Daphnia from the heated lakes. We conclude that Daphnia display some evolutionary adaptations to cope with filamentous cyanobacteria, linked to long-term exposition to elevated temperature. Our results violate broadly accepted assumptions that ectotherms are smaller in warmer environments.

AB  - Life history traits may vary within and among species. Rarely, however, are both variations examined concurrently to identify the life history adaptation. We found that female body size, offspring number and size, and incubation period showed convergent evolution in two lacertid lizards (Takydromus wolteri and Eremias argus) that occur sympatrically in high-latitude and low-latitude localities. Females from the high-latitude population were larger and produced larger clutches than those from the low-latitude population. In both species, the incubation period was shorter for the high-latitude population than for the low-latitude population. However, the physiological mechanism underlying the shorter incubation period differed between the species. These results suggest that: (1) sympatric lizards may adopt similar reproductive strategies in response to their common environments, and (2) embryonic development of the two species follows different pathways for adaptation to low temperatures. This study highlights the importance of understanding the adaptive evolution of life history in response to environmental changes at the embryonic life stages.

AB  - In dipterans, the wing-beat frequency, and, hence, the lift generated, increases linearly with ambient temperature. If flight performance is an important target of natural selection, higher wing:thorax size ratio and wing-aspect ratio should be favored at low temperatures because they increase the lift for a given body weight. We investigated this hypothesis by examining wing:thorax size ratio and wing-aspect ratio in Drosophila melanogaster collected from wild populations along a latitudinal gradient and in their descendants reared under standard laboratory conditions. In a subset of lines, we also studied the phenotypic plasticity of these traits in response to temperature. To examine whether the latitudinal trends in wing:thorax size ratio and wing-aspect ratio could have resulted from a correlated response to latitudinal selection on wing area, we investigated the correlated responses of these characters in lines artificially selected for wing area. In both the geographic and the artificially selected lines, wing:thorax size ratio and wing-aspect ratio decreased in response to increasing temperature during development. Phenotypic plasticity for either trait did not vary among latitudinal lines or selective regimes. Wing:thorax size ratio and wing-aspect ratio increased significantly with latitude in field-collected flies. The dine in wing:thorax size ratio had a genetic component, but the dine in wing-aspect ratio did not. Artificial selection for increased wing area led to a statistically insignificant correlated increase in wing:thorax size ratio and a decrease in wing-aspect ratio. Our observations are consistent with the hypotheses that high wing-thorax size ratio and wing aspect ratio are per se selectively advantageous at low temperatures.

AB  - The male competition for fertilization that results from female multiple mating promotes the evolution of increased sperm numbers and can impact sperm morphology, with theory predicting that longer sperm can at times be advantageous during sperm competition. If so, males with longer sperm should sire more offspring than competitors with shorter sperm. Few studies have directly tested this prediction, and findings are inconsistent. Here we assessed whether longer sperm provide a competitive advantage in the yellow dung fly (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae). Initially, we let brothers with different temperature-mediated mean sperm lengths compete - thus minimizing confounding effects of genetic background - and found no clear advantage of longer sperm. We then used flies from lines subjected to bidirectional selection on phenoloxidase activity that had shown correlated evolutionary responses in sperm and female spermathecal duct lengths. This experiment also yielded no main effect of sperm size on siring success. Instead, there was a trend for a shorter-sperm advantage, but only when competing in females with longer spermathecal ducts. Our data corroborated many previously reported findings (last-male precedence, effects of copula duration and body size), suggesting our failure to find sperm size effects is not inherently due to our experimental protocols. We conclude that longer sperm are not competitively superior in yellow dung flies under most circumstances, and that, consistent with previous work, in this species competitive fertilization success is primarily determined by the relative numbers of sperm competing.

AB  - Geographic variation in phenotypic traits is commonly correlated with spatial variation in the environment, e.g. seasonality and mean temperature, providing evidence that natural selection generates such patterns. In particular, both body size and egg size of ectothermic animals are commonly larger in northern climates, and temperature induces plastic responses in both traits. Size-independent egg quality can also vary with latitude, though this is rarely investigated. For the widespread yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera: Scathophagidae) we investigated whether there are latitudinal clines in reproductive traits (clutch size, egg size and egg composition), whether these clines are due to variation in body and/or egg size, and whether such clines replicate across independent experiments performed on different continents (North America and Europe). Egg size generally increased with latitude (especially in Europe), an effect largely explained by body size of the mother, while clutch size did not; overall reproductive effort thus increased with latitude. Both the absolute and relative (correcting for egg size) amount of egg protein increased with latitude, egg glycogen decreased with latitude, while latitudinal trends for egg lipids and total egg energy content were complex and non-linear. Altitude sometimes showed relationships analogous to those of latitude (egg proteins and glycogen) but occasionally opposite (egg size), possibly because latitude and altitude are negatively related among populations of this cold-adapted species. There was no evidence of a tradeoff between egg size and number across latitudinal populations; if anything, the relationship was positive. All traits, including body and egg size, varied with rearing temperature (12 degrees C, 18 degrees C, 24 degrees C), generally following the temperature-size rule. Clines based on common garden rearing, thus reflecting genetic differentiation, were qualitatively but not always quantitatively consistent between continents, and were similar across rearing temperatures, suggesting they evolved due to natural selection, although the concrete selective mechanisms involved require further study.

AB  - Field-collected Drosophila melanogaster from 19 populations in Eastern Australia were measured for body size traits, and the measurements were compared with similar ones on flies from the same populations reared under standard laboratory conditions. Wild caught flies were smaller, and latitudinal trends in size were greater. Reduced size was caused by fewer cells in the wing, and the steeper dine by greater variation in cell area. The reduction in size in field-collected flies may therefore have been caused by reduced nutrition, and the steeper dine may have been caused by an environmental response to latitudinal variation in temperature. No evidence was found for evolution of size traits in response to laboratory culture. The magnitude of phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature of development time, body size, cell size and cell number was examined for six of the populations, to test for latitudinal variation in plasticity. All characters were plastic in response to temperature. Total development time showed no significant latitudinal variation in plasticity, although larval development time showed a marginally significant effect, with most latitudinal variation at intermediate rearing temperatures. Neither thorax length nor wing size and its cellular components showed significant latitudinal variation in plasticity.

AB  - Fecundity selection, acting on traits enhancing reproductive output, is an important determinant of organismal body size. Due to a unique mode of reproduction, mating success and fecundity are positively correlated with body size in both sexes of male-pregnant Syngnathus pipefish. As male pipefish brood eggs on their tail and egg production in females occurs in their ovaries (located in the trunk region), fecundity selection is expected to affect both sexes in this species, and is predicted to act differently on body proportions of males and females during their development. Based on this hypothesis, we investigated sexual size dimorphism in body size allometry and vertebral numbers across populations of the widespread European pipefish Syngnathus typhle. Despite the absence of sex-specific differences in overall and region-specific vertebral counts, male and female pipefish differ significantly in the relative lengths of their trunk and tail regions, consistent with region-specific selection pressures in the two sexes. Male pipefish show significant growth allometry, with disproportionate growth in the brooding tail region relative to the trunk, resulting in increasingly skewed region-specific sexual size dimorphism with increasing body size, a pattern consistent across five study populations. Sex-specific differences in patterns of growth in S. typhle support the hypothesis that fecundity selection can contribute to the evolution of sexual size dimorphism.

AB  - Ecological and evolutionary consequences of host-parasite interactions have attracted considerable attention from evolutionary biologists. Previous studies have suggested that immune responsiveness may be genetically or developmentally linked with colour pattern, such that the evolution of animal colour patterns may be influenced by correlated responses to selection for parasite resistance. We studied interactions between the endoparasitic fly Leiophora innoxia (Meigen) (Diptera: Tachinidae) and its colour polymorphic pygmy grasshopper host Tetrix undulata (Sow.) (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae) to test for morph-specific differences in parasitization and immune defence, and host-induced variation in parasite phenotypes. Our results revealed that c. 2 and 30% of adult grasshoppers collected from the same natural population in two subsequent years, respectively were parasitized. Parasite prevalence was independent of host sex and colour morph. Pupae were larger if the parasite had developed in a female than in a male host, possibly reflecting host resource value or a physical constraint on larval growth imposed by host body size. Pupal size was also associated with host colour morph, with individuals that had developed in dark morphs being smaller at pupation compared to those that developed in paler morphs. However, immune defence, measured as the encapsulation response to a novel antigen, did not differ among individuals belonging to alternative colour morphs or sexes. Darker morphs warm up more quickly and prefer higher body temperatures than paler ones. Encapsulation was not influenced by maintenance temperature (15 vs. 30 degrees C), however, suggesting that indirect effects of coloration on parasite resistance mediated via differential body temperature are unlikely. The dependence of parasite body size on host colour morph may thus reflect plasticity of growth and development of the larvae in response to differential host body temperature, rather than variable host immune defence.

AB  - Tests of hypotheses for the evolution of thermal physiology often rely on mean temperatures, but mounting evidence suggests geographic variation in temperature extremes is also an important predictor of species' thermal tolerances. Although the tropics are less thermally variable than higher latitude regions, rain shadows on the leeward sides of mountains can experience greater diel and seasonal variation in temperature than windward sites. Rain shadows provide opportunities to test predictions about the relationships of extreme temperatures with thermal physiology while controlling for latitude. We tested the hypothesis that populations of leaf-cutting ants (Atta cephalotes) in leeward, montane, and windward sites in Costa Rica would differ in upper thermal tolerances (CTmax) of workers. As predicted from rain shadow effects via extreme high temperatures, the leeward rain shadow site yielded the highest mean CTmax (rain shadow site 42.1 +/- 0.3 degrees C, Montane site 38.2 +/- 0.5 degrees C, and windward site 38.2 +/- 0.3 degrees C). This suggests that high-temperature extremes in tropical rain shadow forests can select for higher thermal tolerances. CTmax increased with worker body size within sites, but CTmax increased with body size more gradually at the two lowland sites, as predicted if local high temperatures selected more strongly on the most thermally vulnerable society members (small workers). This suggests that warmer lowland climates selected for colonies with less variation in heat tolerance than cooler high elevation climates. in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - Morphological traits can be highly variable over time in a particular geographical area. Different selective pressures shape those traits, which is crucial in evolutionary biology. Among these traits, insect wing morphometry has already been widely used to describe phenotypic variability at the inter-specific level. On the contrary, fewer studies have focused on intraspecific wing morphometric variability. Yet, such investigations are relevant to study potential convergences of variation that could highlight micro-evolutionary processes. The recent sampling and sequencing of three solitary bees of the genus Melitta across their entire species range provides an excellent opportunity to jointly analyse genetic and morphometric variability. In the present study, we first aim to analyse the spatial distribution of the wing shape and centroid size (used as a proxy for body size) variability. Secondly, we aim to test different potential predictors of this variability at both the intra- and inter-population levels, which includes genetic variability, but also geographic locations and distances, elevation, annual mean temperature and precipitation. The comparison of spatial distribution of intrapopulation morphometric diversity does not reveal any convergent pattern between species, thus undermining the assumption of a potential local and selective adaptation at the population level. Regarding intra-specific wing shape differentiation, our results reveal that some tested predictors, such as geographic and genetic distances, are associated with a significant correlation for some species. However, none of these predictors are systematically identified for the three species as an important factor that could explain the intra-specific morphometric variability. As a conclusion, for the three solitary bee species and at the scale of this study, our results clearly tend to discard the assumption of the existence of a common pattern of intra-specific signal/structure within the intra-specific wing shape and body size variability.

AB  - Crustal deformation patterns are affected by multiscale granulation and healing processes associated with phase transitions between continuum and discrete states of rocks. The ongoing continuum-discrete transitions are accompanied by progressive evolution of disordered fault networks to dominant localized fault zones, development of bimaterial interfaces, and increasing dynamic weakening of fault surfaces. Results on individual fault zones point to three general dynamic regimes. The first is associated with broad range of heterogeneities, little dynamic weakening, power law frequency-size statistics, temporal clustering of intermediate and large events, and accelerated seismic release before large earthquakes. The second is associated with relatively uniform localized structures, significant dynamic weakening, characteristic earthquake statistics, and quasi-periodic temporal occurrence of large events without precursory accelerated release. For a range of conditions, the fault zone response can switch back and forth between the foregoing two dynamic regimes. Higher temperature, fluid content, and thickness of sedimentary cover reduce the seismic coupling in a region and change the properties of local earthquake sequences. Brittle regions with high seismic coupling have few foreshocks and long-duration aftershock sequences with high event productivity, whereas more viscous regions with low seismic coupling have increased foreshocks activity and low-productivity aftershock sequences or swarms. The results provide criteria for organizing data in classes associated with different evolutionary stages and different regional conditions. An ability to recognize the dynamic regime of a given fault zone or a region can increase the information content of the data and lead to improved strategies for seismic hazard assessment.

AB  - A fundamental aim of adaptation genomics is to identify polymorphisms that underpin variation in fitness traits. In Drosophila melanogaster, latitudinal life-history clines exist on multiple continents and make an excellent system for dissecting the genetics of adaptation. We have previously identified numerous clinal single-nucleotide polymorphism in insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS), a pathway known from mutant studies to affect life history. However, the effects of natural variants in this pathway remain poorly understood. Here we investigate how two clinal alternative alleles at foxo, a transcriptional effector of IIS, affect fitness components (viability, size, starvation resistance, fat content). We assessed this polymorphism from the North American cline by reconstituting outbred populations, fixed for either the low- or high-latitude allele, from inbred DGRP lines. Because diet and temperature modulate IIS, we phenotyped alleles across two temperatures (18 degrees C, 25 degrees C) and two diets differing in sugar source and content. Consistent with clinal expectations, the high-latitude allele conferred larger body size and reduced wing loading. Alleles also differed in starvation resistance and expression of insulin-like receptor, a transcriptional target of FOXO. Allelic reaction norms were mostly parallel, with few GxE interactions. Together, our results suggest that variation in IIS makes a major contribution to clinal life-history adaptation.

AB  - Reproduction in less favourable conditions requires genetic adaptation and/or behavioural plasticity of the organism. In order to determine the effects of these mechanisms on environment-associated variability in polyandry, a phenomenon related to reproductive success, we explored the frequency of copulations in females of nuptial gift-giving bush-cricket Pholidoptera griseoaptera (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) using a laboratory experiment. In a factorial design, we reared two populations originating from contrasting altitudes in two temperature treatment conditions. After 3 weeks for possible copulations in established mating groups, females (n = 108) contained between 0 and 15 spermatodoses (a proxy for the number of copulations) in their spermatheca. The mean number of spermatodoses per female did not differ either between lowland and highland populations or between warm and cold treatments. Thus, we did not observe main effects of these two factors on adaptation or plasticity. In contrast, the frequency of copulations was significantly affected by female size as log(number of spermatodoses) increased by 0.41 +/- A 0.27 per each 0.1 mm of pronotum length. However, interactions between the body size (the trait that predicts females' quality for reproduction) with environmental factors revealed that larger females originating from the highland population and larger females reared in cold treatment copulated more often than smaller ones, whereas females' size did not affect copulation frequency in the lowland population or in warm treatment. It suggests stronger competition among females in harsher environmental conditions, whereas effect sizes of interaction terms showed that observed mating behaviour expressed a similar extent of genetic and plastic responses to female size. This first observation of environment-associated body size-dependent mating behaviour suggests the interplay of sexual and natural selection in a nuptial gift-giving species.

AB  - The thermal melanin hypothesis posits that ectothermic individuals of larger size or from colder environments exhibit darker cuticles due to melanin's efficacy in absorbing solar radiation. However, melanin is also a crucial component of arthropod immunity. Thus, thermal selection for increased cuticle darkness may profoundly influence melanin-based immune function. In this study, we address the relationships between the thermal environment (season length), cuticular melanism and two aspects of melanin-based immunity across nine thermally distinct populations of the cricket Allonemobius socius. We found that season length (i.e. degree days) and body size had a positive association with cuticle melanism in both sexes across populations, supporting the thermal melanism hypothesis. Despite their smaller size, males were found to have darker cuticles and superior melanin-based immunity. This pattern may be the result of additional selection on males due to sex-specific temperature-dependent activities, such as male calling song. Perhaps most interestingly, we found that short season length populations (i.e. colder) exhibited a greater phenoloxidase activity (aspect of the melanin-based immune system) in addition to darker cuticles in both sexes. This pattern is consistent with direct thermal selection on cuticular color, coupled with indirect selection on melanin-based immunity due to pleiotropy. Thus, thermal selection on cuticle darkness appears to indirectly shape the evolution of pathogen resistance in this system, and potentially for other terrestrial arthropod systems whose ranges encompass a significant thermal gradient.

AB  - Body size has thermal repercussions that impact physiology. Large-bodied dinosaurs potentially retained heat to the point of reaching dangerous levels, whereas small dinosaurs shed heat relatively easily. Elevated body temperatures are known to have an adverse influence on neurosensory tissues and require physiological mechanisms for selective brain and eye temperature regulation. Vascular osteological correlates in fossil dinosaur skulls from multiple clades representing different body-size classes were identified and compared. Neurovascular canals were identified that differentiate thermoregulatory strategies involving three sites of evaporative cooling that are known in extant diapsids to function in selective brain temperature regulation. Small dinosaurs showed similarly sized canals, reflecting a plesiomorphic balanced pattern of blood supply and a distributed thermoregulatory strategy with little evidence of enhancement of any sites of thermal exchange. Large dinosaurs, however, showed a more unbalanced vascular pattern whereby certain sites of thermal exchange were emphasized for enhanced blood flow, reflecting a more focused thermal strategy. A quantitative, statistical analysis of canal cross-sectional area was conducted to test these anatomical results, confirming that large-bodied, and often large-headed, species showed focused thermal strategies with enhanced collateral blood flow to certain sites of heat exchange. Large theropods showed evidence for a plesiomorphic balanced blood flow pattern, yet evidence for vascularization of the large antorbital paranasal air sinus indicates theropods may have had a fourth site of heat exchange as part of a novel focused thermoregulatory strategy. Evidence presented here for differing thermoregulatory strategies based on size and phylogeny helps refine our knowledge of dinosaur physiology. Anat Rec, 303:1075-1103, 2020.

AB  - Although reports have documented loss of species diversity and ecological services caused by stressful temperature changes that result from climate change, some species cope through behavioral compensation. As temperatures and magnitudes of temperature extremes increase, animals should compensate to maintain fitness (such as through temporary behavioral shifts in activity times). Appropriate timing of activity helps avoid competition across species. Although coprophagic dung beetles exhibit species-specific temporal activity times, it is unknown whether temperature drives evolution of these species-specific temporal activity times. Using nine dung beetle species (three each of diurnal, crepuscular, and nocturnal species), we explored differences in heat stress tolerance measured as critical thermal maxima (CTmax; the highest temperature allowing activity) and heat knockdown time (HKDT; survival time under acute heat stress) across these species, and examined the results using a phylogenetically informed approach. Our results showed that day-active species had significantly higher CTmax(diurnal > crepuscular = nocturnal species), whereas crepuscular species had higher HKDT (crepuscular > nocturnal > diurnal species). There was no correlation between heat tolerance and body size across species with distinct temporal activity, and no significant phylogenetic constraint for activity. Species with higher CT(max)did not necessarily have higher HKDT, which indicates that species may respond differently to diverse heat tolerance metrics. Acute heat tolerance for diurnal beetles indicates that this trait may constrain activity time and, under high acute temperatures with climate change, species may shift activity times in more benign environments. These results contribute to elucidate the evolution of foraging behavior and management of coprophagic beetle ecosystem services under changing environments.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of temperature (20 and 25 degrees C) on reproduction, oxidative stress, and copper (Cu) toxicity in Daphnia magna across three generations (F0, F1, and F2). Exposing D. magna to elevated temperature significantly decreased the number of offspring per female per day, the time to first brood, and body length compared to exposure to the optimal temperature (p < 0.05). In addition, elevated temperature induced a significantly higher production of reactive oxygen species and lipid per oxidation (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that D. magna likely responded to thermal stress by investing more energy into defense mechanisms, rather than growth and reproduction. In addition, oxidative stress at the elevated temperature gradually increased with each generation, possibly owing to the reduced fitness of the offspring. Exposing D. magna to 25 degrees C (EC50=34 +/- 3 mu g L-1) substantially increased the median effective concentration of Cu in all generations compared to exposure to 20 degrees C (EC50=25 +/- 3 mu g L-1), indicating a decrease in acute toxicity at elevated temperature. However, elevated temperature significantly increased the oxidative stress induced by a sublethal concentration of Cu (10 mu g L-1). The interaction between elevated temperature and Cu exposure appears to be synergistic; however, this needs to be confirmed using multiple generations in a long-term experiment (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives The global distribution of human body proportions has long been attributed to thermoregulatory adaptation to climate. However, latitude has been the most common proxy for climate across ecogeographic studies. If thermoregulation was driving post-cranial evolution, temperature should provide a better explanation for the morphological patterns observed than latitude, which encompasses temperature and other variables, as well as major events in human migration history. We investigate relationships between latitude, temperature, and postcranial form by distinguishing the strength of these potential selective factors from population structure. Materials & Methods Quantitative genetic multivariate mixed models were used to estimate morphological effects associated with latitude, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature using osteometric data from 31 globally distributed groups, geographically matched genetic data from 54 groups, and geographically matched temperature data. Results Dimensions reflecting body size (bi-iliac breadth/femoral head size) show independent evolutionary responses from limb lengths. In models including population history, only dimensions reflecting body size show evidence of response to directional selection. Model results indicate that selection in response to minimum temperature has shaped evolution in body breadth and femoral head size. Models for limb length evolution accounting for population history match results of prior studies, but do not indicate responses to temperature-driven directional selection. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of considering multiple potential sources of selection within a multivariate evolutionary model, demonstrating the possible synergistic effects of selective pressures. These results complicate the classic thermoregulatory model of human postcranial evolution and show that factors other than temperature may have shaped post-cranial evolution in humans.

AB  - Adaptation to new environments is a well-documented phenomenon. Individuals from populations maintained in a particular environment for multiple generations tend to be better able to survive and/or reproduce in that environment than their ancestors or other individuals adapted to alternative environments. A third major component of fitness, mating success, has not been well studied in replicated populations under selection in divergent environments. In this study, we used mating trials to compare the mating success of male Drosophila melanogaster adapted for 10 years to two different temperatures, 18 and 25 degrees C. In competition for female partners, males had significantly higher mating success at their adapted temperature compared with males adapted to a different temperature. These results are consistent with the notion that those mutations favoured by natural selection also tend to be favoured by sexual selection.

AB  - One of the longest-lived, noncolonial animals on the planet today is a bivalve that attains life spans in excess of 500 years and lives in a cold, seasonally food-limited setting. Separating the influence of temperature and food availability on life span in modern settings is difficult, as these two conditions covary. The life spans of fossil animals can provide insights into the role of environment in the evolution of extreme longevity that are not available from studies of modern taxa. We examine bivalves from the unique, nonanalogue, warm and high-latitude setting of Seymour Island, Antarctica, during the greenhouse intervals of the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene. Despite significant sampling limitations, we find that all 11 species examined are both slow growing and long-lived, especially when compared with modern bivalves living in similar temperature settings. While cool temperatures have long been thought to be a key factor in promoting longevity, our findings suggest an important role for caloric restriction brought about by the low and seasonal light regime of the high latitudes. Our life-history data, spanning three different families, emphasize that longevity is in part governed by environmental rather than solely phylogenetic or ecologic factors. Such findings have implications for both modern and ancient latitudinal diversity gradients, as a common correlate of slow growth and long life is delayed reproduction, which limits the potential for evolutionary change. While life spans of modern bivalves are well studied, data on life spans of fossil bivalves are sparse and largely anecdotal. Life histories of organisms from deep time can not only elucidate the controls on life span but also add a new dimension to our understanding of macroevolutionary patterns.

AB  - Spirulina powder is used as a functional supplement in animal feeds for enhanced growth and reduced mortality. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Spirulina powder-supplemented feeds on abalone growth after 93 days and 125 days of culture. Spirulina particles were attached to the surfaces of abalone feed granules by mixing to prepare Spirulina powder-supplemented abalone feeds. The morphology, components, and thermal stability of the granules were analyzed. Abalone body weight and shell characteristics (size, pigmentation, morphology, and components) were also assessed for evaluating abalone growth. Protein expression patterns in abalones were monitored. Spirulina particles were detected on the surfaces of Spirulina powder-supplemented abalone feed granules, which were not modified in size and shape after attachment. The Spirulina powder-supplemented feed granules included organic materials and minerals based on C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, and Ca. They were thermally stable up to 20 degrees C. Abalones fed Spirulina powder-supplement at 0.7 % showed significantly increased body weight and shell size after 125-day culture. Shell pigmentation and morphology were also improved. The shell contained C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, and Fe. Abalone proteins were clearly expressed at 75-100 kD and 150-250 kD. These results suggest that Spirulina powder has a promising potential as a feed supplement to be used in next-generation animal feeds for enhanced growth. The study protocol applied in the present work can be extended to the development of other animal feeds.

AB  - To test whether stressful conditions altered levels of heritable variation in fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster, parent-offspring comparisons were undertaken across three generations for flies reared in a combined stress (ethanol, cold shock, low nutrition) environment or a control environment. The stressful conditions did not directly influence fecundity but did lead to a reduced fecundity in the offspring generations, perhaps reflecting cross-generation maternal effects. Both the heritability and evolvability estimates were higher in the combined stress treatment, reflecting an apparent increase in the additive genetic variance under stress. In contrast, there were no consistent changes in the environmental variance across environments.

AB  - Changes in temperature have occurred throughout Earth's history. However, current warming trends exacerbated by human activities impose severe and rapid loss of biodiversity. Although understanding the mechanisms orchestrating organismal response to climate change is important, remarkably few studies document their role in nature. This is because only few systems enable the combined analysis of genetic and plastic responses to environmental change over long time spans. Here, we characterize genetic and plastic responses to temperature increase in the aquatic keystone grazer Daphnia magna combining a candidate gene and an outlier analysis approach. We capitalize on the short generation time of our species, facilitating experimental evolution, and the production of dormant eggs enabling the analysis of long-term response to environmental change through a resurrection ecology approach. We quantify plasticity in the expression of 35 candidate genes in D. magna populations resurrected from a lake that experienced changes in average temperature over the past century and from experimental populations differing in thermal tolerance isolated from a selection experiment. By measuring expression in multiple genotypes from each of these populations in control and heat treatments, we assess plastic responses to extreme temperature events. By measuring evolutionary changes in gene expression between warm-and cold-adapted populations, we assess evolutionary response to temperature changes. Evolutionary response to temperature increase is also assessed via an outlier analysis using EST-linked microsatellite loci. This study provides the first insights into the role of plasticity and genetic adaptation in orchestrating adaptive responses to environmental change in D. magna.

AB  - Freshwater gammarids are known to colonise occasionally sinking-cave streams, providing contrasting morphological, life-history and ecophysiological adaptations compared to their surface conspecifics. In this study, a subterranean and a surface population of the species Gammarus balcanicus was surveyed for one year in a sinking-cave stream from the Western Carpathians (Romania). The results showed that the cave-dwelling population comprised individuals that were significantly larger compared to their surface conspecifics, had larger body-size at sexual maturity and that the females produced fewer, but larger eggs, compared to the population situated outside the cave. The trophic position and the omnivory were significantly higher for the cave-dwelling compared to surface population and the elemental imbalance for C:P molar ratios lower, but similar for C:N. However, the subterranean population did not present troglomorphic characters or longer lifespan as known for other cave-surface paired crustaceans. This, together with the rather extensive hydrological connection of the habitats, suggests active gene-flow between populations and similar response to seasonality for body-size distributions, indicating that the observed ecophysiological and life-history differences are rather the consequence of phenotypic plasticity than the result of genetic adaptation.

AB  - The hypothesis that the balance of trade-offs between survivorship, growth and reproductive allocation in the terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare will change when resource input is increased has been investigated experimentally. When the quality of food available was increased, by adding a mixture of litter from herbaceous dicotyledonous plants to a background low-quality food of dead grasses, survivorship was found to be the most phenotypically plastic trait, increasing by 168%. Growth rates increased by 99% but reproductive allocation by only 21%. In the field, members of a population from a site with more high-quality food grew more than twice as fast as those from a site where less high-quality food was available. The population from the site with higher food availability, contrary to predictions from the laboratory study, did not survive as well as that from the site with less available high-quality food. This may be because the site that is more favourable for growth has a more stressful physical environment due to much bigger temperature fluctuations, which are known to be an important cause of mortality in this species. When individuals from both populations were reared under controlled laboratory conditions, both the parental and F1 generations from the poor growth environment survived better than those from the good growth habitat. However, even when given an excess of high-quality food those from the poor growth environment continued to grow more slowly and had a lower reproductive allocation than those from the site with higher food availability. We conclude that microevolutionary changes may have occurred in the balance of resource allocation between survivorship, growth and reproductive allocation, to favour higher survivorship during the longer prereproductive period at the site where growth to the threshold size for reproduction takes longer.

AB  - Aims. We investigate how properties of the ensemble of superclusters in the cosmic web evolve with time.
   Methods. We performed numerical simulations of the evolution of the cosmic web using the Lambda cold dark matter model in box sizes L-0 = 1024; 512; 256 h(-1) Mpc. We found supercluster ensembles of models for four evolutionary stages, corresponding to the present epoch z = 0, and to redshifts z = 1, z = 3, and z = 10. We calculated fitness diameters of superclusters defined from volumes of superclusters divided by filling factors of over-density regions. Geometrical and fitness diameters of largest superclusters, and the number of superclusters as functions of the threshold density were used as percolation functions to describe geometrical properties of the ensemble of superclusters in the cosmic web. We calculated the distributions of geometrical and fitness diameters and luminosities of superclusters, and followed the time evolution of percolation functions and supercluster distributions. We compared percolation functions and supercluster distributions of models and samples of galaxies of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
   Results. Our analysis shows that fitness diameters of superclusters have a minimum at a certain threshold density. Fitness diameters around minima almost do not change with time in co-moving coordinates. Numbers of superclusters have maxima which are approximately constant for all evolutionary epochs. The geometrical diameters of superclusters decrease during the evolution of the cosmic web, and the luminosities of superclusters increase during this evolution.
   Conclusions. Our study suggests that evolutionary changes occur inside supercluster cells of dynamical influence. The stability of fitness diameters and numbers of superclusters during the evolution is an important property of the cosmic web.

AB  - If fitness optima for a given trait differ between males and females in a population, sexual dimorphism may evolve. Sex-biased trait variation may affect patterns of habitat use, and if the microhabitats used by each sex have dissimilar microclimates, this can drive sex-specific selection on thermal physiology. Nevertheless, tests of differences between the sexes in thermal physiology are uncommon, and studies linking these differences to microhabitat use or behavior are even rarer. We examined microhabitat use and thermal physiology in two ectothermic congeners that are ecologically similar but differ in their degree of sexual size dimorphism. Brown anoles (Anolis sagrei) exhibit male-biased sexual size dimorphism and live in thermally heterogeneous habitats, whereas slender anoles (Anolis apletophallus) are sexually monomorphic in body size and live in thermally homogeneous habitats. We hypothesized that differences in habitat use between the sexes would drive sexual divergence in thermal physiology in brown anoles, but not slender anoles, because male and female brown anoles may be exposed to divergent microclimates. We found that male and female brown anoles, but not slender anoles, used perches with different thermal characteristics and were sexually dimorphic in thermal tolerance traits. However, field-active body temperatures and behavior in a laboratory thermal arena did not differ between females and males in either species. Our results suggest that sexual dimorphism in thermal physiology can arise from phenotypic plasticity or sex-specific selection on traits that are linked to thermal tolerance, rather than from direct effects of thermal environments experienced by males and females.

AB  - Predicting the effects of global increase in temperatures on disease virulence is challenging, especially for environmental opportunistic bacteria, because pathogen fitness may be differentially affected by temperature within and outside host environment. So far, there is very little empirical evidence on the connections between optimal temperature range and virulence in environmentally growing pathogens. Here, we explored whether the virulence of an environmentally growing opportunistic fish pathogen, Flavobacterium columnare, is malleable to evolutionary changes via correlated selection on thermal tolerance. To this end, we experimentally quantified the thermal performance curves (TPCs) for maximum biomass yield of 49 F. columnare isolates from eight different geographic locations in Finland over ten years (2003-2012). We also characterized virulence profiles of these strains in a zebra fish (Danio rerio) infection model. We show that virulence among the strains increased over the years, but thermal generalism, and in particular tolerance to higher temperatures, was negatively associated with virulence. Our data suggest that temperature has a strong effect on the pathogen genetic diversity and therefore presumably also on disease dynamics. However, the observed increase in frequency and severity of F. columnare epidemics over the last decade cannot be directly linked to bacterial evolution due to increased mean temperature, but is most likely associated with factors related to increased length of growing season, or other time-dependent change in environment. Our study demonstrates that complex interactions between the host, the pathogen and the environment influence disease virulence of an environmentally growing opportunistic pathogen.

AB  - Traits do not evolve independently. To understand how trait changes under selection might constrain adaptive changes, phenotypic and genetic correlations are typically considered within species, but these capture constraints across a few generations rather than evolutionary time. For longer-term constraints, comparisons are needed across species but associations may arise because of correlated selection pressures rather than genetic interactions. Implementing a unique approach, we use known patterns of selection to separate likely trait correlations arising due to correlated selection from those reflecting genetic constraints. We examined the evolution of stress resistance in >90 Drosophila species adapted to a range of environments, while controlling for phylogeny. Initially we examined the role of climate and phylogeny in shaping the evolution of starvation and body size, two traits previously not examined in this context. Following correction for phylogeny only a weak relationship between climate and starvation resistance was detected, while all of the variation in the relationship between body size and climate could be attributed to phylogeny. Species were divided into three environmental groups (hot and dry, hot and wet, cold) with the expectation that, if genetic correlations underpin trait correlations, these would persist irrespective of the environment, whereas selection-driven evolution should produce correlations dependent on the environment. We found positive associations between most traits in hot and dry environments coupled with high trait means. In contrast few trait correlations were observed in hot/wet and cold environments. These results suggest trait associations are primarily driven by correlated selection rather than genetic interactions, highlighting that such interactions are unlikely to limit evolution of stress resistance.

AB  - Extreme temperature has been used as an alternative to chemical treatments for stored product pests for years. Resistance to heat or cold treatments has not been documented in stored product insects, but repeated use of ineffective treatments could lead to adaptive tolerance. Trogoderma variabile (Dermestidae) is a common pest of stored products, and the larval stage is highly resistant to cold and destructive. We artificially selected populations by inducing chill coma at four different cold temperature treatments: 3 and 5 h at -10 degrees C and 3 and 5 h at 0 degrees C. Recovery time was highly heritable after selection for seven generations for decreased recovery time (cold tolerance) and increased recovery time (cold susceptibility) at all time and temperature combinations. Three replicate populations for each time and temperature combination varied substantially, suggesting different mutations in each population were probably responsible for selected phenotypes. Body size decreased in populations selected for cold susceptibility compared with those selected for cold tolerance and survivorship to long-term cold stress increased in the cold-tolerant populations compared with the susceptible populations. After the cessation of the selection experiment, cold tolerance dissipated within four generations from the populations at -10 degrees C, but was maintained in populations exposed to 0 degrees C. Our results suggest that warehouse beetles can adapt to cold stress quickly, but in the absence of cold stress, the proportion of cold-tolerant/susceptible individuals is quickly reduced, suggesting that some of the mutations responsible for these phenotypes may be associated with fitness costs under normal conditions.

AB  - Environmental temperatures can significantly influence the behavior and physiology of terrestrial ectotherms. Small-bodied terrestrial ectotherms can moderate their body temperatures behaviorally via thermoregulation; however, favorable thermal refuges may be limited across heterogeneous landscapes. In such cases, differences in the thermal environment may generate variation in preferred body temperatures among disparate populations. We tested whether geographic variation in preferred body temperatures existed for the Arizona bark scorpion Centruroides sculpturatus, an arachnid widely distributed across the Sonoran Desert. We predicted that geographic variation in thermal preference would exist between populations from a xeric, low-elevation site in western Arizona (Quartzsite) and a cooler, high-elevation site in eastern Arizona (Pinaleno Mountains). We found that scorpions from the Pinaleno Mountains were smaller in body size and exhibited significantly warmer diurnal body temperatures compared to scorpions from Quartzsite. However, no significant difference was detected in the preferred nocturnal temperatures of scorpions from either locality. Scorpions from the Pinaleno Mountains may have shifted their thermoregulatory patterns and selected warmer temperatures during the day as a way to maximize their exposure to favorable temperatures. Less time with mean temperatures within the preferred range of body temperatures may have also lowered metabolic rates of C sculpturatus in the Pinaleno Mountains, resulting in their smaller female body sizes. The ability of C sculpturatus to adapt to different thermal regimes may reflect variation in a life history trait which has allowed them to thrive and expand their distribution across the American Southwest.

AB  - Global warming, acidification, and oxygen stress at the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) are associated with severe extinction in the deep sea and major biogeographic and ecologic changes in planktonic and terrestrial ecosystems, yet impacts on shallow marine macrofaunas are obscured by the incompleteness of shelf sections. We analyze mollusk assemblages bracketing (but not including) the PETM and find few notable lasting impacts on diversity, turnover, functional ecology, body size, or life history of important clades. Infaunal and chemosymbiotic taxa become more common, and body size and abundance drop in one clade, consistent with hypoxia-driven selection, but within-clade changes are not generalizable across taxa. While an unrecorded transient response is still possible, the long-term evolutionary impact is minimal. Adaptation to already-warm conditions and slow release of CO2 relative to the time scale of ocean mixing likely buffered the impact of PETM climate change on shelf faunas.

AB  - An analysis of intraspecific variation in the fossorial skink Microacontias litoralis revealed that orange-coloured and melanistic individuals co-occur at several localities. Body colour was found to be independent of sex and body size, Both orange-coloured and melanistic in situ embryos were present in pregnant females, showing that colour polymorphism is not the result of ontogenetic changes induced by environmental conditions, but rather has a genetic basis. The presence of orange-coloured embryos in melanistic females and vice-versa shows that breeding in these two colour morphs is not isolated. The functional significance of colour polymorphism in M. litoralis remains unclear, but intraspecific communication or background colour matching as possible selective advantages of melanism are ruled out. Microacontias litoralis is endemic to the west coast of South Africa where there is in general a high incidence of melanistic lizard species and populations associated with zones of upwelling of cold water in the Atlantic Ocean. That the melanistic morph may represent past or present selection for thermal melanism can not be ruled out and further investigation is required.

AB  - Individuals at the expansion front during a climate-driven range expansion are expected to differ phenotypically from those individuals in core populations. Little information is known about the joint, potentially opposing, effects of stressful conditions at the range edge versus evolutionary changes that take place during range expansion in shaping the phenotypes at the range front. We investigated the effect of range expansion on immune function, body condition and flight-related morphology (flight muscle ratio, wing loading, and wing aspect ratio) of field-collected females of the poleward-moving damselfly Coenagrion scitulum. Individuals at the expansion front had a lower body condition, which indicated more stressful conditions at the range edge. Despite the counteracting effect of the shorter growth season, the higher flight muscle ratios at the expansion front indicated a strong selection for dispersal ability during range expansion. The current study suggests that models need to incorporate the interplay of stressful conditions and evolutionary processes at the expansion front to arrive at robust predictions of future species distributions under global warming.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 112, 556-568.

AB  - Ecological changes affect pathogen epidemiology and evolution and may trigger the emergence of novel diseases. Aquaculture radically alters the ecology of fish and their pathogens. Here we show an increase in the occurrence of the bacterial fish disease Flavobacterium columnare in salmon fingerlings at a fish farm in northern Finland over 23 years. We hypothesize that this emergence was owing to evolutionary changes in bacterial virulence. We base this argument on several observations. First, the emergence was associated with increased severity of symptoms. Second, F. columnare strains vary in virulence, with more lethal strains inducing more severe symptoms prior to death. Third, more virulent strains have greater infectivity, higher tissue-degrading capacity and higher growth rates. Fourth, pathogen strains co-occur, so that strains compete. Fifth, F. columnare can transmit efficiently from dead fish, and maintain infectivity in sterilized water for months, strongly reducing the fitness cost of host death likely experienced by the pathogen in nature. Moreover, this saprophytic infectiousness means that chemotherapy strongly select for strains that rapidly kill their hosts: dead fish remain infectious; treated fish do not. Finally, high stocking densities of homogeneous subsets of fish greatly enhance transmission opportunities. We suggest that fish farms provide an environment that promotes the circulation of more virulent strains of F. columnare. This effect is intensified by the recent increases in summer water temperature. More generally, we predict that intensive fish farming will lead to the evolution of more virulent pathogens.

AB  - Genetic diversity may play an important role in allowing individual species to resist climate change, by permitting evolutionary responses. Our understanding of the potential for such responses to climate change remains limited, and very few experimental tests have been carried out within intact ecosystems. Here, we use amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data to assess genetic divergence and test for signatures of evolutionary change driven by long-term simulated climate change applied to natural grassland at Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory (BCCIL). Experimental climate treatments were applied to grassland plots for 15 years using a replicated and spatially blocked design and included warming, drought and precipitation treatments. We detected significant genetic differentiation between climate change treatments and control plots in two coexisting perennial plant study species (Festuca ovina and Plantago lanceolata). Outlier analyses revealed a consistent signature of selection associated with experimental climate treatments at individual AFLP loci in P. lanceolata, but not in F. ovina. Average background differentiation at putatively neutral AFLP loci was close to zero, and genomewide genetic structure was associated neither with species abundance changes (demography) nor with plant community-level responses to long-term climate treatments. Our results demonstrate genetic divergence in response to a suite of climatic environments in reproductively mature populations of two perennial plant species and are consistent with an evolutionary response to climatic selection in P. lanceolata. These genetic changes have occurred in parallel with impacts on plant community structure and may have contributed to the persistence of individual species through 15 years of simulated climate change at BCCIL.

AB  - P>Mutations or environmental factors that result in reversal of conspicuous left-right asymmetries provide an opportunity to study developmental mechanisms. They may also provide insight into evolutionary changes in asymmetry states within and between species. King crabs (family Lithodidae) have a larger right claw and females typically exhibit a dextrally offset abdomen. Nevertheless, I observed a high incidence of left handedness in laboratory reared box crabs (Lopholithodes foraminatus) and captured the first known egg-bearing female lithodid to exhibit reversed asymmetry. This provided a unique opportunity to characterize the reversed phenotype and to compare the incidence of reversed asymmetry in the offspring of normal and reversed females. Asymmetry of the chelae became apparent in the first postzoeal stage (glaucothoe) and handedness was maintained through subsequent instars. Females with larger left claws developed reversed abdominal asymmetry by the fourth crab stage. No reversed asymmetry was observed in the mandibles of zoea larvae or juveniles of either handedness. The incidence of reversed asymmetry in glaucothoe reared from one reversed and three normal females was high (between 20% and 30%), and independent of maternity (P=0.67). Removal of the right cheliped of fourth stage zoeae, and the major cheliped of glaucothoe, did not reverse the direction of asymmetry. Elevated larval rearing temperature also did not affect the frequency of reversed individuals. This lack of evidence for either heritability or induction of handedness is enigmatic. Further investigation of reversed asymmetry in lithodid crabs may provide valuable insights into the development and evolution of bilateral asymmetries.

AB  - Genotype-by-temperature interaction is a necessary condition for adaptive evolution of fitness traits as a response to temperature. Several fitness-related traits (developmental time, pre-adult survival, thorax and wing lengths, and wing loading) were measured in laboratory-reared D. buzzatii from four populations sampled at different altitudes in north-western Argentina: a lowland population (407 m a.s.l.), two populations from intermediate altitude (780 to 950 in a.s.l.), and a highland population (2380 in a.s.l.). Temperature is the main climatic difference between the collection sites: lowland but not highland populations are exposed to physiologically high temperatures during both spring and summer in nature. Three growth temperatures (20, 25 and 30degreesC) were used to test for population-by-temperature interactions. Both developmental time and pre-adult survival exhibit highly significant population-by-temperature interaction. Preadult Survival at 30degreesC is significantly higher in lowland than in highland populations, but not so at lower growth temperatures (20 and 25degreesC). Both wing length and wing loading show no population-by-temperature interaction, indicating that these traits are not the direct targets of thermal adaptation in nature. Wing loading is higher in highland than in lowland populations, suggesting that flight performance is subject to stronger selection in the highland population. This hypothesis is consistent with ecological observations in both types of populations. There is no obvious among-population relationship between developmental time and body size, even though both traits are related within populations in a well-known trade-off. Overall, thermal adaptation is evident for developmental time and pre-adult survival but not for size-related traits.

AB  - A fountain mechanism of quantitative regulation of gene expression level during development is proposed. The mechanism is based on postulated ability of a special class of RNA molecules, so called fountain RNAs (fRNAs), to induce passive and selective ionic channels in the internal nuclear membrane. ions diffuse via channel from the nuclear lumen into the chromatin compartment. An RNA-dependent battery of ion channels is assumed to produce cca fountain,, of ions in close vicinity to the corresponding genes. An ion atmosphere, in its turn, locally changes the chromatin configuration and effectiveness of transcription and processing of transcripts. Hence this mechanism can be used to change genes productivity. It is a basic mechanism of quantitative traits regulation. A passive selective ion flux periodically stops after a threshold ion concentration induces local chromatin compactization and arrests the activity of ion channels in a given chromatin compartment. This process serves as a basis for many cellular biorhythms that are relatively temperature-independent because of the passive nature of ion channel. It is postulated that eukaryotes became eukaryotes just to obtain this fountain mechanism that allows them to perform gradual quantitative modulation of corresponding genes expression levels. The fountain mechanism is partly responsible for dominance and heterosis, X-chromosome inactivation, gene position effects, and some other epigenetic events. It plays an important role in embryonic and postembryonic development. A significant portion of the former <<junk>> DNA can be referred to as fDNA involved in the proposed mechanism functioning. Genomic rearrangements of fDNA could lead to micro-and macroevolutionary changes in the animal and plant kingdoms. The pivotal evolutionary function of transposons could reside in their ability to contain and relocate fDNA along the chromosomes.

AB  - Streamflow is a main driver of fish population dynamics and is projected to decrease in much of the northern hemisphere, especially in the Mediterranean region, due to climate change. However, predictions of future climate effects on cold-water freshwater fish populations have typically focused only on the ecological consequences of increasing temperatures, overlooking the concurrent and interacting effects of climate-driven changes in streamflow regimes. Here, we present simulations that contrasted the consequences of changes in thermal regime alone versus the combined effects of changes in thermal regime and streamflow for resident trout populations in distinct river types with different sensitivities to climatic change (low-altitude main river vs. high-altitude headwaters). We additionally assessed the buffering effect of increased food production that may be linked to warming. We used an eco-genetic individual-based model that integrates the behavioural and physiological effects of extrinsic environmental drivers -temperature and flow- with intrinsic dynamics density-dependence, phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary responses - across the entire trout life cycle, with Mediterranean brown trout Salmo trutta as the model species. Our simulations indicated that: (1) Hydrological change is a critical dimension of climate change for the persistence of trout populations, in that neither river type supported viable populations under strong rates of flow change, even under scenarios of increased food production. (2) Climate-change-related environmental change most affects the largest, oldest trout via increased metabolic costs and decreased energy inputs. In both river types, populations persisted under extreme warming alone but became dominated by younger, smaller fish. (3) Density-dependent, plastic and evolutionary changes in phenology and life-history traits provide trout populations with important resilience to warming, but strong concurrent shifts in streamflow could exceed the buffering conferred by such intrinsic dynamics.

AB  - Larvae of three latitudinally different populations of Drosophila jambulina belonging to the montium subgroup were tested for pupation site preference in relation to temperature. At 30 degrees C, larvae preferred to pupate on food whereas at 21 degrees C pupation occurred on the cotton. Genetic basis of larval pupation behavior was studied by conducting reciprocal crosses for 30 generations on food-selected and on cotton-selected pupae. Results from genetic analysis between food-selected and cotton-selected strains indicated a single gene responsible for the pupation site preference, with F-1 progeny pupated on cotton and F-2 (F-1 x F-1) larvae pupated on both food as well as on cotton. Although we found no change in morphological traits in food vs cotton selected populations, significantly different growth rate (body weight) between the two strains was observed. These results suggest that pupation site preferences can affect life-history traits in D. jambulina.

AB  - We re-examine what controls the deep ocean N:P ratio in the light of recent findings that the C:N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton varies with growth rate, nutrient and light limitation, species and phylum, and that N-2-fixation may be limited by Fe, temperature and/or light in large parts of the world ocean. In particular, we assess whether a systematic change in phytoplankton stoichiometry can alter the deep ocean N:P ratio. To do this we adapt recent models to include non-Redfieldian stoichiometry of phytoplankton and restriction of N-2-fixers to a fraction of the surface ocean. We show that a systematic change in phytoplankton C:N:P can alter the concentrations of NO3 and PO4 in the deep ocean but cannot greatly alter their ratio, unless it also alters the N: P threshold for N-2-fixation. This occurs if competitive dynamics set the N:P threshold for N-2-fixation, in which case it remains close to the N: P requirement of non-fixers (rather than that of N-2-fixers) and consequently so does the deep ocean N:P ratio. Then, even if N-2-fixers are restricted to a fraction of the surface ocean, they reach higher densities there, minimising variations in deep ocean N: P. Theoretical limits on the N:P requirements of phytoplankton suggest that whilst the deep ocean has been well oxygenated (i.e. since the Neoproterozoic, with the possible exception of Oceanic Anoxic Events), its N:P ratio is unlikely to have varied by more than a factor of two in either direction. Within these bounds, evolutionary changes in phytoplankton composition, and increased phosphorus weathering due to the biological colonisation of the land surface, are predicted to have driven long-term changes in ocean composition.

AB  - Reduction of body size is a common response of organisms to environmental stress. Studying the early Toarcian succession in the Lusitanian Basin of Portugal, we tested whether the shell size of benthic marine communities of bivalves and brachiopods changed at and before the global, warming-related Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (T-OAE). Statistical analyses of shell size over time show that the mean shell size of communities decreased significantly before the T-OAE. This trend is distinct in brachiopods and is caused by larger-sized species becoming less abundant over time, whereas it is not significant in bivalves, suggesting a decoupled response to environmental stress. Reductions in shell size precede the decline in standardized sample-level species richness associated with the early Toarcian extinction event. Such decreases in the shell size of marine invertebrates, well before the onset of biodiversity change, suggest that reductions in body size more generally may be a precursor of a subsequent loss of species and turnover at the community level caused by climate change. Sedimentological evidence is against hypoxia as a driver of extinction and the preceding size decrease in the brachiopod fauna in the studied succession, although low oxygen levels are widely held responsible for elevated early Toarcian extinction rates globally. Reduction of mean shell size in brachiopods but stasis in bivalves is difficult to explain with ocean acidification, because experimental work shows that brachiopods can be resilient to lowered pH, albeit long-term metabolic costs and potential evolutionary adaptations are unknown. Rising early Toarcian temperatures in the Lusitanian Basin seem to be a plausible factor in both diversity decline associated with the T-OAE and the preceding reductions in mean shell size, because thermal tolerances in modern bivalves are among the highest within marine invertebrates.

AB  - Context. Understanding how organismal attributes influence sensitivity to environmental perturbations is a central theme in ecology and conservation. Certain traits, such as body size, habitat use, dietary preference and reproductive output are considered important determinants of animal species' responses to the impacts of ecological disturbances. However, the general relationships between functional traits and post-disturbance responses by animals are not fully understood.
   Aims. Our primary aim was to use a meta-analysis to evaluate the influence of species traits on variation in population abundances of squamate reptiles (i.e. lizards and snakes).
   Methods. We extracted data from 107 original published studies, from which 1027 mean effect sizes of post-disturbance responses by 298 species were estimated. We examined short-term responses only (i.e. within 3 years since the most recent disturbance). A comprehensive range of disturbances was examined, such as habitat destruction, fragmentation, fire, and exotic-species invasions. We used Bayesian linear mixed-effect modelling (BLMM), utilising the Markovchain Monte Carlo algorithm (MCMC) for the meta-regression. Specifically, we tested the influence of eight species traits (body size, diet, temporal activity pattern, sociality, reproductive mode, clutch size, habitat selection, and mean body temperature), along with disturbance type, in explaining variation in species-specific abundance responses of squamate reptiles post-disturbance.
   Key results. Post-disturbance abundance responses of squamate species were significantly influenced by two parameters, namely, mean body temperature and clutch size. In general, significant positive responses post-disturbance were observed for species with higher mean body temperatures and a greater clutch size. The type of disturbance had no detectable influence on squamate abundances. The influence of random effects (heterogeneity among studies and species, and broad taxonomic identity) accounted for more of the model variation than did the fixed effects (species traits and disturbance type).
   Conclusions. Certain species traits exerted some influence on the sensitivities of lizards and snakes to ecological disturbances, although the influence of random effects was very strong. Our findings are likely to be a result of the complexity and idiosyncratic nature of natural abundance patterns among animal species, in addition to the potential confounding effect of methodological differences among studies.
   Implications. The present study is the first major quantitative synthesis of how species traits influence population-level responses of squamate reptiles to ecological disturbances. The findings can be used to guide conservation efforts and ecological management, such as by prioritising the efforts of mitigation on species that reproduce more slowly, and those with lower body temperatures.

AB  - Aim We investigate how susceptibility to mass bleaching varies between closely related coral species, and the validity of applying these susceptibility data (at the appropriate taxonomic level) across geographical regions. We also conduct a preliminary analysis of factors likely to affect geographical variability and examine which data are required for adequate assessment of the risk to species and regional populations from repeated mass bleaching events. Location Twenty-two sites in the central Great Barrier Reef, Australia (GBR) and 30 sites in the central Maldives Archipelago (MA). Time period 2002 for the GBR and 2016 for the MA. Major taxa studied Corals (order Scleractinia). Methods After marine heat-wave conditions, timed in situ surveys recorded bleaching responses of 7,368 coral colonies exposed to similar levels of temperature stress at a similar depth of occurrence and with similar subsequent mortality. In each region, a separate phylogenetic mixed model was used to estimate deep-time phylogenetic-, contemporary- (indicative of recent adaptation/acclimatization) and local-scale effects. The results were compared between regions in relative terms as a hierarchy of species susceptibilities. Results Susceptibility varied widely between regions: 27 of 106 species analysed were in the same quartile for relative susceptibility in both regions. Closely related species varied widely in their individual susceptibilities. Phylogenetic effects were moderate in both regions, but greater contemporary effects in the MA suggested recent evolution and acclimatization, consistent with a stronger history of recent bleaching events. Main conclusions The high regional and intrageneric variation in susceptibility to bleaching described here suggests that there might be important differences in the extent to which these Indian and Pacific Ocean coral populations are exhibiting responses to deep-time evolutionary changes, on the one hand, versus recent adaptation, on the other. We reveal a concerning lack of regional-scale data identifying species most at risk from this, the greatest current threat to coral reefs.

AB  - Clines in life history traits, presumably driven by spatially varying selection, are widespread. Major latitudinal clines have been observed, for example, in Drosophila melanogaster, an ancestrally tropical insect from Africa that has colonized temperate habitats on multiple continents. Yet, how geographic factors other than latitude, such as altitude or longitude, affect life history in this species remains poorly understood. Moreover, most previous work has been performed on derived European, American and Australian populations, but whether life history also varies predictably with geography in the ancestral Afro-tropical range has not been investigated systematically. Here, we have examined life history variation among populations of D.melanogaster from sub-Saharan Africa. Viability and reproductive diapause did not vary with geography, but body size increased with altitude, latitude and longitude. Early fecundity covaried positively with altitude and latitude, whereas lifespan showed the opposite trend. Examination of genetic variance-covariance matrices revealed geographic differentiation also in trade-off structure, and Q(ST)-F-ST analysis showed that life history differentiation among populations is likely shaped by selection. Together, our results suggest that geographic and/or climatic factors drive adaptive phenotypic differentiation among ancestral African populations and confirm the widely held notion that latitude and altitude represent parallel gradients.

AB  - Clinal analysis for fitness-related traits provides a well-known approach to investigate adaptive evolution. Several fitness-related traits (developmental time, thorax length, wing length and wing loading) were measured at two laboratory generations (G7 and G33) of D. buzzatii from an altitudinal gradient from northwestern Argentina, where significant thermal differences persist. Developmental time (DT) was positively correlated with altitude of origin of population. Further, DT was negatively correlated with maximal mean temperature at the site of origin of population, and this thermal variable decreases with altitude. Wing loading tended to be larger in highland than in lowland populations, suggesting that flight performance is subject to stronger selection pressure in highland populations. Developmental time showed a significant increase with laboratory generation number. There was no significant correlation between developmental time and body size across populations along the altitudinal cline of DT. This result illustrates that developmental time and body size do not always evolve in the same direction, even though both traits are often positively and genetically correlated in a well-known tradeoff in Drosophila.

AB  - Widespread species that exhibit both high gene flow and the capacity to occupy heterogeneous environments make excellent models for examining local selection processes along environmental gradients. Here we evaluate the influence of temperature and landscape variables on genetic connectivity and signatures of local adaptation in Phaulacridium vittatum, a widespread agricultural pest grasshopper, endemic to Australia. With sampling across a 900-km latitudinal gradient, we genotyped 185 P. vittatum from 19 sites at 11,408 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using ddRAD sequencing. Despite high gene flow across sites (pairwise F-ST = 0.0003-0.08), landscape genetic resistance modelling identified a positive nonlinear effect of mean annual temperature on genetic connectivity. Urban areas and water bodies had a greater influence on genetic distance among sites than pasture, agricultural areas and forest. Together, F-ST outlier tests and environmental association analysis (EAA) detected 242 unique SNPs under putative selection, with the highest numbers associated with latitude, mean annual temperature and body size. A combination of landscape genetic connectivity analysis together with EAA identified mean annual temperature as a key driver of both neutral gene flow and environmental selection processes. Gene annotation of putatively adaptive SNPs matched with gene functions for olfaction, metabolic detoxification and ultraviolet light shielding. Our results imply that this widespread agricultural pest has the potential to spread and adapt under shifting temperature regimes and land cover change.

AB  - We examined the genetic basis of clinal adaptation by determining the evolutionary response of life-history traits to laboratory natural selection along a gradient of thermal stress in Drosophila serrata. A gradient of heat stress was created by exposing larvae to a heat stress of 36degrees for 4 hr for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days of larval development, with the remainder of development taking place at 25degrees. Replicated lines were exposed to each level of this stress every second generation for 30 generations. At the end of selection, we conducted a complete reciprocal transfer experiment where all populations were raised in all environments, to estimate the realized additive genetic covariance matrix among clinal environments in three life-history traits. Visualization of the genetic covariance functions of the life-history traits revealed that the genetic correlation between environments generally declined as environments became more different and even became negative between the most different environments in some cases. One exception to this general pattern was a life-history trait representing the classic trade-off between development time and body size, which responded to selection in a similar genetic fashion across all environments. Adaptation to clinal environments may involve a number of distinct genetic effects along the length of the cline, the complexity of which may not be fully revealed by focusing primarily on populations at the ends of the cline.

AB  - Background: The Southern Ocean is the coldest ocean on Earth but a hot spot of evolution. The bottom-dwelling Eocene ancestor of Antarctic notothenioid fishes survived polar marine glaciation and underwent adaptive radiation, forming >120 species that fill all water column niches today. Genome-wide changes enabling physiological adaptations and the rapid expansion of the Antarctic notothenioids remain poorly understood.
   Results: We sequenced and compared 2 notothenioid genomes-the cold-adapted and neutrally buoyant Antarctic toothfish Dissostichus mawsoni and the basal Patagonian robalo Eleginops maclovinus, representing the temperate ancestor. We detected >200 protein gene families that had expanded and thousands of genes that had evolved faster in the toothfish, with diverse cold-relevant functions including stress response, lipid metabolism, protein homeostasis, and freeze resistance. Besides antifreeze glycoprotein, an eggshell protein had functionally diversified to aid in cellular freezing resistance. Genomic and transcriptomic comparisons revealed proliferation of selcys-transfer RNA genes and broad transcriptional upregulation across anti-oxidative selenoproteins, signifying their prominent role in mitigating oxidative stress in the oxygen-rich Southern Ocean. We found expansion of transposable elements, temporally correlated to Antarctic notothenioid diversification. Additionally, the toothfish exhibited remarkable shifts in genetic programs towards enhanced fat cell differentiation and lipid storage, and promotion of chondrogenesis while inhibiting osteogenesis in bone development, collectively contributing to the achievement of neutral buoyancy and pelagicism.
   Conclusions: Our study revealed a comprehensive landscape of evolutionary changes essential for Antarctic notothenioid cold adaptation and ecological expansion. The 2 genomes are valuable resources for further exploration of mechanisms underlying the spectacular notothenioid radiation in the coldest marine environment.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of combining the naked neck gene with a genetic background that has been optimized for feed efficiency of laying hens at moderate temperature. In 1997, the naked neck gene was introduced into a line selected for low residual feed intake. In 2003, after 6 generations of introgression, 8 males and 56 females heterozygous for the NA*NA mutation were used to generate all 3 genotypes ( NA*N/NA*N, NA*NA/NA*N, NA*NA/NA*NA), in 2 hatches, for rearing in Taiwan and France, respectively, at 3-wk intervals. Growth performance, anatomical traits, laying traits, and feed efficiency were recorded in each country. In addition, comb and rectal temperatures were measured in Taiwan. Performance was generally lower and mortality of laying hens was higher in Taiwan ( 11%) than in France ( 1%). Genotype x environment interactions were rare: genotype x environment was observed only for body weight at 10 wk of age and was close to significance for egg weight. The laying performance was significantly decreased in Taiwan by about 25%. The naked neck genotype had a negative effect on body weight and a positive effect of clutch length and egg weight. It also affected heat dissipation traits such as wattle length and rectal and surface temperature measurements. There was a clear additive and negative effect of the NA*NA mutation on rectal temperature. Feed intake and residual feed intake were increased in the homozygous carriers of the NA*NA mutation, which may improve heat tolerance of the low residual feed consumption (R-) line. Feed efficiency tended to be better in NA*NA/NA*NA hens in both environments. Thus, the introduction of the NA*NA mutation in the R- background appeared to be favorable from the viewpoint of feed efficiency, but it did not improve laying performance in a subtropical environment. Other factors than temperature, such as diet composition and lighting regimen, may be involved.

AB  - Aim Invasive species are ideal system, for testing geographical differences in performance traits and measuring evolutionary responses as a species spreads across divergent climates and habitats. The European gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is a generalist forest defoliator introduced to Medford, Massachusetts, USA in 1869. The invasion front extends from Minnesota to North Carolina and the ability of this species to adapt to local climate may contribute to its continuing spread. We evaluated the performance of populations along the climatic gradient of the invasion front to test for a relationship between climate and ecologically important performance traits.
   Location Eastern United States of America
   Taxon Lymantria dispar dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Erebidae)
   Methods Insects from 14 populations across the US invasion front and interior of the invasive range were reared from hatch to adult emergence in six constant temperature treatments. The responses of survival, pupal mass and larval development time were analysed as a function of source climate (annual mean normal temperature), rearing temperature and their interaction using multiple polynomial regression.
   Results With the exception of female development time, there were no significant interactions between source climate and rearing temperature, indicating little divergence in the shape of thermal reaction norms among populations. Source population and rearing temperature were significant predictors of survival and pupal mass. Independent of rearing temperature, populations from warmer climates had lower survival than those from colder climates, but attained larger body size despite similar development times. Larval development time was dependent on rearing temperature, but there were not consistent relationships with source climate.
   Main Conclusions Thermal adaptation can be an important factor shaping the spread of invasive species, particularly in the context of climate change. Our results suggest that L. d. dispar is highly plastic, but has undergone climate-related adaptation in thermal performance and life-history traits as it spread across North America.

AB  - This study examined intrasexual size variation in the sexually dimorphic mountain stone weta Hemideina maori. We were unable to determine the proportion of weta maturing at different instars, because linear variation in adult head sizes was continuous and not discrete. However, by measuring the growth increment from subadult to adult of weta raised in the laboratory, we estimated that 11% of the males in our main study site were maturing two instars earlier than the largest male. Similar variation in size at maturation has been observed in male Wellington tree weta Hemideina crassidens, which are known to mature at three different instars, but is unusual for insects in general. The variation in head and femur sizes of H. maori was greater between sites (= isolated populations) than within sites, corresponding to an altitude gradient. Females showed a similar altitude gradient, although they showed less variation in body size than males. These data suggest that at any given local environmental temperature, there may be selection for an optimum body size. Whether there is further selection on the smallest males within each site to exhibit alternative mating tactics, as part of a conditional reproductive strategy, remains to be determined.

AB  - The F-1 progeny of Culex tarsalis Coquillett females from the Coachella (CV) and San Joaquin (SJV) valleys collected during April 1991, and April, July, and October 1993 were reared and maintained as adults at 5 constant temperatures ranging from 14 to 38 degrees C. CV F-1 progeny exhibited smaller body size, enhanced survival during spring, and higher autogeny rates than SJV F-1 progeny; however upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, immature developmental rates and survivorship, and adult life table parameters were relatively similar for both strains. Mosquitoes from both sites exhibited midsummer changes in immature developmental rates and survivorship, adult wing length, life expectancy at emergence, and generation time. These data indicated that temperature may select for both spatial and temporal changes in mosquito biology.

AB  - This study evaluated whether indicators of metabolic capacity of cod white muscle differ along the length of the body, whether this variation persists over a large range of body sizes, and whether the allometry of metabolic capacities is similar along the length of the body. We examined the maximal activities of two glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase (PFK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a mitochondrial enzyme, cytochrome C oxidase (CCO), and the biosynthetic enzyme nucleotide diphosphate kinase (NDPK). All enzymes examined showed significant size dependence, which was generally apparent in all regions. The activity of glycolytic enzymes increased with size, whereas that of CCO and NDPK decreased with size. For PFK and LDH, the size dependence decreased caudally, whereas for CCO and NDPK it was strongest in the caudal sample. For each size range, the activities of PFK, LDH, and CCO were higher in the last third of the body than in the middle or just behind the head. In contrast, NDPK activity was higher just behind the head than at the middle or in the last third of the body, suggesting that nuclear proliferation is more rapid in this zone. The high capacity for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation in the caudal region suggests that increases in mass-specific ATP output are advantageous in this relatively thin section of the body.

AB  - Evolutionary change is a product of selection. Selection operates on the phenotype, and its consequences are manifest in representation of the genotype in successive generations. Of particular interest to both evolutionary and behavioral biologists is the newly emerging field of epigenetics and behavior. Two broad categories of epigenetic modifications must be distinguished. Context-dependent epigenetic change can be observed if the environmental factors that bring about the epigenetic modification persists (e.g., the frequency and quality of maternal care modifying the brain and future tehavior of the offspring each generation). Because the environment induces epiallelic change, removing the causative factor can reverse a context-dependent epigenetic state. Germline-dependent epigenetic change occurs when the epigenetic imprint is mediated through the germline. Such effects are independent of the causative agent and there is no evidence at present that a germline-dependent epigenetic state can be reversed. Finally, only germline-dependent epigenetic modifications can be truly transgenerational. Although an individual's life history is progressive and continuous, it might usefully be viewed as the cumulation of divisions: each period emerging from what has gone before and, at the same time, setting the stage for what follows. These life history stages are somewhat arbitrary, with many traits spanning conventional divisions, but each period tends to have its own characteristic ethologies and particular contribution to neural and behavioral phenotypes. To understand how these episodes 'fit' together, it is necessary to deconstruct early life events and study each period both in its' own right and how it interacts with the preceding and subsequent stages. Lastly, it seems intuitive that germline- and context-dependent epigenetic modifications interact, resulting in the individual variation observed in behaviors, but until now this hypothesis has never been tested experimentally.

AB  - Plastic and evolutionary changes in traits related to biotic interactions are crucial for the local persistence of populations under global warming. Yet, how acute and developmental thermal plasticity evolve and shape predation rates has been poorly studied, especially in the context of latitude-driven thermal evolution. A powerful predictive framework is given by the climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) stating that thermal plasticity and acclimation capacity evolve to be higher in high-latitude populations because these are exposed to higher thermal seasonal variability. We tested the CVH for predation rates and evaluated if the support for the CVH depended on the type of plasticity and acclimation metric. We examined effects of developmental temperature (20 and 24 degrees C) and acute changes in mean and extreme temperatures (20, 24 and 32 degrees C) on the predation rates of high- and low-latitude populations of a predatory aquatic insect, the damselflyIschnura elegans. We documented opposing and interactive effects between developmental and acute temperatures, which urges caution when using thermal performance curves to forecast the impact of global warming on biotic interactions. Predation rates were higher in low-latitude than high-latitude predators, especially at the warmer developmental and test temperatures, suggesting thermal adaptation to the higher low-latitude temperatures. The latitudinal patterns in acute and developmental plasticities differed, providing mixed support for the CVH. Moreover, there was no latitudinal pattern in post-acclimation thermal sensitivity, indicative of perfect thermal compensation in predators from both latitudes. Strikingly, the acclimation capacity leading to perfect thermal compensation was ~6 times higher in high-latitude than in low-latitude predators. Our study provides new insights into the climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) by documenting that its support is critically dependent on the type of plasticity and acclimation metric used.

AB  - Most studies of evolutionary responses to climate change have focused on phenological responses to warming, and provide only weak evidence for evolutionary adaptation. This could be because phenological changes are more weakly linked to fitness than more direct mechanisms of climate change impacts, such as selective mortality during extreme weather events which have immediate fitness consequences for the individuals involved. Studies examining these other mechanisms may be more likely to show evidence for evolutionary adaptation. To test this, we quantify regional population responses of a small resident passerine (winter wren Troglodytes troglodytes) to a measure of winter severity (number of frost days). Annual population growth rate was consistently negatively correlated with this measure, but the point at which different populations achieved stability (lambda = 1) varied across regions and was closely correlated with the historic average number of frost days, providing strong evidence for local adaptation. Despite this, regional variation in abundance remained negatively related to the regional mean number of winter frost days, potentially as a result of a time-lag in the rate of evolutionary response to climate change. As expected from Bergmann's rule, individual wrens were heavier in colder regions, suggesting that local adaptation may be mediated through body size. However, there was no evidence for selective mortality of small individuals in cold years, with annual variation in mean body size uncorrelated with the number of winter frost days, so the extent to which local adaptation occurs through changes in body size, or another mechanism remains uncertain.

AB  - As the data rate of high performance internet router systems continues to increase, meeting the challenges for high speed electrical performance drives ASIC packaging technology to higher silicon integration, higher I/O density, and enhanced thermal power dissipation. The requirement of high Si integration with the increasing needs for embedded SRAM and DRAM drives for the increase in Si die size and the demand for 90nm technology. Die size up to 20x20mm is pushing advanced packaging substrate technology. High I/O density also drives the needs for finer bump pitch and larger package body size, which present challenges for package and card level assembly. Moreover, high availability telecommunication products demand excellent reliability not only at the ASIC package and card assembly level, but also at the final product system level.

AB  - The local temperature in the Harbin region of northeast China has been rising, with temperatures above 27 degrees C often being recorded. The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines (Matsumura) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and foxglove aphid, Aulacorthum solani (Kaltenbach) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), are important pests in soybeans in the region, which face great survival pressure due to rising temperatures. In this study, A. glycines and A. solani were reared at thermoperiods with diurnal temperatures of 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, and 37 degrees C, nocturnal temperature of 20 degrees C, 70% +/- 5% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 14:10 (L: D) hr. Diurnal thermoperiod 25 degrees C was used as control. Some life characteristics of the aphids were assessed. The adaptation of A. solani to high diurnal temperatures was found to be worse than that of A. glycines. Aphis glycines could develop and reproduce successfully at diurnal temperatures of 27-35 degrees C, whereas A. solani could only develop and reproduce at 27-29 degrees C. At diurnal thermoperiods at 25 degrees C, adult lifespan of A. solani was as long as that of A. glycines. When diurnal temperatures increased from 27 to 31 degrees C, adult lifespan of A. solani were shorter than those of A. glycines. At diurnal thermoperiods at 25 and 27 degrees C, the body sizes of A. solani adults were larger than those of A. glycines. At diurnal thermoperiods at 29 and 31 degrees C, the body size of A. solani adults were as large as those of A. glycines. Our results provide important information on the survival, development, and reproduction of A. glycines and A. solani exposed to temperatures above 27 degrees C, which is important for evaluating the adaptability of aphids to high temperatures and predicting their dynamics in soybeans in northeast China, where the local environmental temperature continues to rise.

AB  - Ectotherms compensate for variation in thermal environments in diverse behavioural ways. Despite widely occurring sex differences in morphology and physiology, the sex-specific thermal sensitivity of behavioural traits has received little attention. We tested the interactive influence of sex and environmental temperature on predator-induced responses in the Alpine newt, Ichthyosaura alpestris. Escape decisions and the duration of flight were less thermally sensitive in females than in males. Males ran more slowly than females. Both sexes required more stimuli at intermediate temperatures than at other temperatures. We conclude that temperature and sex are important determinants of a newt's defensive repertoire. The sex-specific thermal sensitivity of defensive responses suggests both asymmetric selection regimes and an impact of environmental change in newt populations.

AB  - Background: Life diversifies via adaptive radiation when natural selection drives the evolution of ecologically distinct species mediated by their access to novel niche space, or via non-adaptive radiation when new species diversify while retaining ancestral niches. However, while cases of adaptive radiation are widely documented, examples of non-adaptively radiating lineages remain rarely observed. A prolific cold-climate lizard radiation from South America (Phymaturus), sister to a hyper-diverse adaptive radiation (Liolaemus), has extensively diversified phylogenetically and geographically, but with exceptionally minimal ecological and life-history diversification. This lineage, therefore, may offer unique opportunities to investigate the non-adaptive basis of diversification, and in combination with Liolaemus, to cover the whole spectrum of modes of diversification predicted by theory, from adaptive to non-adaptive. Using phylogenetic macroevolutionary modelling performed on a newly created 58-species molecular tree, we establish the tempo and mode of diversification in the Phymaturus radiation.
   Results: Lineage accumulation in Phymaturus opposes a density-dependent (or 'niche-filling') process of diversification. Concurrently, we found that body size diversification is better described by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck evolutionary model, suggesting stabilizing selection as the mechanism underlying niche conservatism (i.e., maintaining two fundamental size peaks), and which has predominantly evolved around two major adaptive peaks on a 'Simpsonian' adaptive landscape.
   Conclusions: Lineage diversification of the Phymaturus genus does not conform to an adaptive radiation, as it is characterised by a constant rate of species accumulation during the clade's history. Their strict habitat requirements (rocky outcrops), predominantly invariant herbivory, and especially the constant viviparous reproduction across species have likely limited their opportunities for adaptive diversifications throughout novel environments. This mode of diversification contrasts dramatically with its sister lineage Liolaemus, which geographically overlaps with Phymaturus, but exploits all possible microhabitats in these and other bioclimatic areas. Our study contributes importantly to consolidate these lizards (liolaemids) as promising model systems to investigate the entire spectrum of modes of species formations, from the adaptive to the non-adaptive extremes of the continuum.

AB  - In ectotherms, adult body size commonly declines with increasing environmental temperature, a pattern known as the temperature-size rule. One influential hypothesis explaining this observation is that the challenge of obtaining sufficient oxygen to support metabolism becomes greater with increasing body size, and more so at high temperatures. Yet, previous models based on this hypothesis do not account for phenotypic plasticity in the physiology of organisms that counteracts oxygen limitation at high temperature. Here, we model the predicted strength of the temperature-size response using estimates of how both the oxygen supply and demand is affected by temperature when allowing for phenotypic plasticity in the aquatic ectotherm Daphnia magna. Our predictions remain highly inconsistent with empirical temperature-size responses, with the prior being close to one order of magnitude stronger than the latter. These results fail to provide quantitative support for the hypothesis that oxygen limitation drives temperature-size clines in aquatic ectotherms. Future studies into the role of oxygen limitation should address how the strength of the temperature-size response may be shaped by evolution under fluctuating temperature regimes. Finally, our results caution against applying deterministic models based on the oxygen limitation hypothesis when predicting future changes in ectotherm size distributions under climate change.

AB  - Altitudinal changes in traits and genetic markers can complement the studies on latitudinal patterns and provide evidence of natural selection because of climatic factors. In Drosophila melanogaster, latitudinal variation is well known but altitudinal patterns have rarely been investigated. Here, we examine five traits and five genetic markers on chromosome 3R in D. melanogaster collected at high and low altitudes from five latitudes along the eastern coast of Australia. Significant altitudinal differentiation was observed for cold tolerance, development time, ovariole number in unmated females, and the microsatellite marker DMU25686. Differences tended to match latitudinal patterns, in that trait values at high altitudes were also found at high latitudes, suggesting that factors linked to temperature are likely selective agents. Cold tolerance was closely associated with average temperature and other climatic factors, but no significant associations were detected for the other traits. Genes around DMU25686 represent good candidates for climatic adaptation.

AB  - Understanding the interplay between genetic differentiation, ancestral plasticity, and the evolution of plasticity during adaptation to environmental variation is critical to predict populations' responses to environmental change. However, the role of plasticity in rapid adaptation in nature remains poorly understood. We here use the invasion of the horned beetleOnthophagus taurusin the United States during the last half century to study the contribution of ancestral plasticity and post-invasion evolution of plastic responses in rapid population differentiation. We document latitudinal variation in life history and morphology, including genetic compensation in development time and body size, likely adaptive responses to seasonal constraints in the North. However, clinal variation in development time and size was strongly dependent on rearing temperature, suggesting that population differentiation in plasticity played a critical role in successful adaptation on ecological timescales. Clinal variation in wing shape was independent of ancestral plasticity, but correlated with derived plasticity, consistent with evolutionary interdependence. In contrast, clinal variation in tibia shape aligned poorly with thermal plasticity. Overall, this study suggests that post-invasion evolution of plasticity contributed to range expansions and concurrent adaptation to novel climatic conditions.

AB  - How will organisms cope when forced into warmer-than-preferred thermal environments? This is a key question facing our ability to monitor and manage biota as average annual temperatures increase, and is of particular concern for range-limited terrestrial species unable to track their preferred climatic envelope. Being ectothermic, desiccation prone, and often spatially restricted, island-inhabiting tropical amphibians exemplify this scenario. Pre-Anthropocene case studies of how insular amphibian populations responded to the enforced occupation of warmer-than-ancestral habitats may add a valuable, but currently lacking, perspective. We studied a population of frogs from the Seychelles endemic family Sooglossidae which, due to historic sea-level rise, have been forced to occupy a significantly warmer island (Praslin) than their ancestors and close living relatives. Evidence from thermal activity patterns, bioacoustics, body size distributions, and ancestral state estimations suggest that this population shifted its thermal niche in response to restricted opportunities for elevational dispersal. Relative to conspecifics, Praslin sooglossids also have divergent nuclear genotypes and call characters, a finding consistent with adaptation causing speciation in a novel thermal environment. Using an evolutionary perspective, our study reveals that some tropical amphibians have survived episodes of historic warming without the aid of dispersal and therefore may have the capacity to adapt to the currently warming climate. However, two otherwise co-distributed sooglossid species are absent from Praslin, and the deep evolutionary divergence between the frogs on Praslin and their closest extant relatives (similar to 8 million years) may have allowed for gradual thermal adaptation and speciation. Thus, local extinction is still a likely outcome for tropical frogs experiencing warming climates in the absence of dispersal corridors to thermal refugia.

AB  - Background: In order to study the dynamics of evolutionary change, 12 populations of E. coli B were serially propagated for 20,000 generations in minimal glucose medium at constant 37 degrees C. Correlated changes in various other traits have been previously associated with the improvement in competitive fitness in the selective environment. This study examines whether these evolved lines changed in their ability to tolerate the stresses of prolonged freezing and repeated freeze-thaw cycles during adaptation to a benign environment.
   Results: All 12 lines that evolved in the benign environment for 20,000 generations are more sensitive to freeze-thaw cycles than their ancestor. The evolved lines have an average mortality rate of 54% per daily cycle, compared to the ancestral rate of 34%. By contrast, there was no significant difference between the evolved lines and their ancestor in mortality during prolonged freezing. There was also some variability among the evolved lines in susceptibility to repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Those lines that had evolved higher competitive fitness in the minimal glucose medium at 37 degrees C also had higher mortality during freeze-thaw cycles. This variability was not associated, however, with differences among lines in DNA repair functionality and mutability.
   Conclusion: The consistency of the evolutionary declines in freeze-thaw tolerance, the correlation between fitness in glucose medium at 37 degrees C and mortality during freeze-thaw cycles, and the absence of greater declines in freeze-thaw survival among the hypermutable lines all indicate a trade-off between performance in minimal glucose medium at 37 degrees C and the capacity to tolerate this stress. Analyses of the mutations that enhance fitness at 37 degrees C may shed light on the physiological basis of this trade-off.

AB  - Temperature is an important environmental factor for life-history traits in poikilothermic animals. Many of experiments on evolution have been conducted using Drosophila species, and effects on life-history traits vary depending on the study. On the other hand, few studies have been conducted on the effects of temperature on life-history traits in the other insect species. In the present study, we reared adzuki bean beetles under two different temperatures, high and low, for 2 years (20 generations), and compared life-history traits including body size of females, fecundity, egg size, rate of egg hatching, emergence rate, development time, and wing length. No differences in responses were found in these traits between selection strains, except the rate of egg hatching. That is, the rates of egg hatching in high-temperature (32 degrees C) selection strains were significantly higher than those in low-temperature (24 degrees C) selection strains. We discuss the cause of change in egg hatchability during successive generations under different temperature treatments from the following viewpoints including evolutionary adaptation to high temperature and the experimental protocol.

AB  - It is of fundamental importance for the field of evolutionary biology to understand when and why major evolutionary transitions occur. Live-bearing young (viviparity) is a major evolutionary change and has evolved from egg-laying (oviparity) independently in many vertebrate lineages and most abundantly in lizards and snakes. Although contemporary viviparous squamate species generally occupy cold climatic regions across the globe, it is not known whether viviparity evolved as a response to cold climate in the first place. Here, we used available published time-calibrated squamate phylogenies and parity data on 3,498 taxa. We compared the accumulation of transitions from oviparity to viviparity relative to background diversification and a simulated binary trait. Extracting the date of each transition in the phylogenies and informed by 65 my of global palaeoclimatic data, we tested the nonexclusive hypotheses that viviparity evolved under the following: (a) cold, (b) long-term stable climatic conditions and (c) with background diversification rate. We show that stable and long-lasting cold climatic conditions are correlated with transitions to viviparity across squamates. This correlation of parity mode and palaeoclimate is mirrored by background diversification in squamates, and simulations of a binary trait also showed a similar association with palaeoclimate, meaning that trait evolution cannot be separated from squamate lineage diversification. We suggest that parity mode transitions depend on environmental and intrinsic effects and that background diversification rate may be a factor in trait diversification more generally.

AB  - Environmental effects on body size are of widespread ecological and economic importance but our understanding of these effects has been obscured by an apparent paradox. Life history analysis suggests that it is adaptive for adults to emerge smaller if reared in conditions that slow down juvenile growth. However, whereas smaller adults emerge if growth is limited by food availability, the reverse is usually observed if growth is limited by temperature. The resolution of this apparent paradox may be that the response of adult size to temperature is adaptive, but is constrained by a trade-off that can be understood in terms of von Bertalanffy's classic theory of growth. Alternatively, the response may be the unavoidable consequence of a fundamental relationship between cell size and temperature.

AB  - Climate change can have diverse effects on natural enemies of pest species. Here we review these effects and their likely impacts on pest control. The fitness of natural enemies can be altered in response to changes in herbivore quality and size induced by temperature and CO2 effects on plants. The susceptibility of herbivores to predation and parasitism could be decreased through the production of additional plant foliage or altered timing of herbivore life cycles in response to plant phenological changes. The effectiveness of natural enemies in controlling pests will decrease if pest distributions shift into regions outside the distribution of their natural enemies, although a new community of enemies might then provide some level of control. As well as being affected by climate through host plants and associated herbivores, the abundance and activity of natural enemies will be altered through adaptive management strategies adopted by farmers to cope with climate change. These strategies may lead to a mismatch between pests and enemies in space and time, decreasing their effectiveness for biocontrol. Because of the diverse and often indirect effects of climate change on natural enemies, predictions will be difficult unless there is a good understanding of the way environmental effects impact on tritrophic interactions. In addition, evolutionary changes in both hosts and natural enemies might have unexpected consequences on levels of biocontrol exerted by enemies. We consider interactions between the pest light brown apple moth and its natural enemies to illustrate the type of data that needs to be collected to make useful predictions.

AB  - Populations of Drosophila melanogaster, as well as of other Drosophila species, show body size differences according to their geographic origin. Thermal selection is considered to be the most likely cause explaining these differences. We investigated wing size, wing shape and their relationship in 3 different geographic populations of D. melanogaster, 1 population of D. simulans, and their interspecific hybrids grown at 18, 21, 25 and 28 degrees C. The aim was to explore how the past adaptive history of 2 related species, or populations of the same species, modulates the plastic response to the environment. The wing size plasticity of hybrids between the temperate D. simulans (Bologna) and the 2 tropical D. melanogaster populations (Belem and Rio de Janeiro) was higher than that of parental species, probably as a side effect of a decanalized and compromised development at higher temperatures. The wing size plasticity of Bologna hybrids was the same as the parents, suggesting that the 2 species are subjected to the same plasticity selection. Wing shape was typical of each species, population and temperature. Shape differences increased in hybrids at higher temperatures as a consequence of developmental perturbation. The allometric relationship between size and shape changed among temperatures and among species, suggesting that the wing development is differently regulated in the 2 species and can be altered by natural selection. The allometry changed between populations of different geographic origin of D. melanogaster, but was similar in the 2 species that shared the same selective environment. Two species would have been subjected to the same plasticity selection, so the breakdown of the plastic response is avoided in hybrids. As a whole, these data suggest that thermal plasticity is a trait under selection and that similar mechanisms are at work in different species.

AB  - Background: The polychaete annelid Platynereis dumerilii is an emerging model organism for the study of molecular developmental processes, evolution, neurobiology and marine biology. Annelids belong to the Lophotrochozoa, the so far understudied third major branch of bilaterian animals besides deuterostomes and ecdysozoans. P. dumerilii has proven highly relevant to explore ancient bilaterian conditions via comparison to the deuterostomes, because it has accumulated less evolutionary change than conventional ecdysozoan models. Previous staging was mainly referring to hours post fertilization but did not allow matching stages between studies performed at (even slightly) different temperatures. To overcome this, and to provide a first comprehensive description of P. dumerilii normal development, a temperature-independent staging system is needed.
   Results: Platynereis dumerilii normal development is subdivided into 16 stages, starting with the zygote and ending with the death of the mature worms after delivering their gametes. The stages described can be easily identified by conventional light microscopy or even by dissecting scope. Developmental landmarks such as the beginning of phototaxis, the visibility of the stomodeal opening and of the chaetae, the first occurrence of the ciliary bands, the formation of the parapodia, the extension of antennae and cirri, the onset of feeding and other characteristics are used to define different developmental stages. The morphology of all larval stages as well as of juveniles and adults is documented by light microscopy. We also provide an overview of important steps in the development of the nervous system and of the musculature, using fluorescent labeling techniques and confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Timing of each developmental stage refers to hours post fertilization at 18 +/- 0.1 degrees C. For comparison, we determined the pace of development of larvae raised at 14 degrees C, 16 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 28 degrees C and 30 degrees C. A staging ontology representing the comprehensive list of developmental stages of P. dumerilii is available online.
   Conclusions: Our atlas of Platynereis dumerilii normal development represents an important resource for the growing Platynereis community and can also be applied to other nereidid annelids.

AB  - Local adaptation of populations requires some degree of spatio-temporal isolation. Previous studies of the two dung fly species Scathophaga stercoraria and Sepsis cynipsea have revealed low levels of geographic and altitudinal genetic differentiation in quantitative life history and morphological traits, but instead high degrees of phenotypic plasticity. These patterns suggest that gene flow is extensive despite considerable geographic barriers and large spatio-temporal variation in selection on body size and related traits. In this study we addressed this hypothesis by investigating genetic differentiation of dung fly populations throughout Switzerland based on the same 10 electrophoretic loci in each species. Overall, we found no significant geographic differentiation of populations for either species. This is inconsistent with the higher rates of gene flow expected due to better flying capacity of the larger S. stercoraria. However, heterozygote deficiencies within populations indicated structuring on a finer scale, seen for several loci in S. cynipsea, and for the locus PGM (Phosphoglucomutase) in S. stercoraria. Additionally, S. cynipsea showed a tendency towards a greater gene diversity at higher altitudes, mediated primarily by the locus MDH (malate dehydrogenase), at which a second allele was only present in populations above 1000 m. This may be caused by increased environmental stress at higher altitudes in this warm-adapted species. MDH might thus be a candidate locus subject to thermal selection in this species, but this remains to be corroborated by direct evidence. In S. stercoraria, no altitudinal variation was found.

AB  - Nonnative species have been widely introduced, and once established, often exhibit secondary spread to new areas. For instance, after its initial introduction in the John Day River, Oregon, smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) has expanded upstream into headwater habitats. Recruitment is a key component of successful range expansion and has been highlighted as a potential bottleneck to continued expansion by small mouth bass. We explored growth, body lengths, and survival of young-of-the-year (YOY) smallmouth bass in the North Fork John Day River to better understand the recruitment dynamics near its invasion boundary. In 2014-2015, we collected YOY across the upstream 63 km of smallmouth bass distribution at the end of the first growth season and after a winter starvation period. We found that growth, body length, and survival showed varied correspondence with patterns in water temperature. Specifically, body lengths matched temperature predictions in upstream sites (after accounting for spawning delays) where smallmouth bass density is low. By contrast, individuals achieved smaller than predicted body lengths in downstream sites where density is relatively high. Model selection revealed that temperature and age >= 1 density were the most important predictors of body length. Additionally, individuals predicted to be too small to survive a winter starvation period were present. Our findings reveal nuanced recruitment dynamics at the invasion boundary, where departures from temperature-based predictions point to multiple mechanisms affecting growth and survival. Understanding mechanisms operating at invasion boundaries may help develop management strategies to prevent future spread of smallmouth bass into headwater salmon habitat.

AB  - Drying of single porous bodies by convection was investigated in order to determine if the moisture is only partially miscible. 2-Propanol, water, and 1-butanol and mixtures of these solvents were used as model solvents. Drying experiments were performed at various air temperatures, air velocities, body sizes, initial compositions, and porosity of the sample material. Large bodies do not dry selectively until most of the moisture is removed. Porosity, air velocity and air temperature influences the selectivity if the moisture separates into two liquid phases.

AB  - Local selective regimes and limited dispersal may contribute to genetic differentiation of life history traits among local populations of the marine amphipod Jassa marmorata Holmes. Reciprocal transplant experiments were used to explore growth rate variation and to determine the effects of environment versus source population (genotype) on the observed variation. Gravid females were collected at two sites in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. Hatchlings were measured and reared in field enclosures following a split brood design. Measurements of total body size (length in mm) were made initially and at two additional time intervals. Experiments were conducted in spring and summer of 1994 and again in the spring of 1995. Growth curve analysis was used to test the effects of two independent variables, source population and environment, on growth rate.
   Results of the spring 1994 experiment revealed both source population (genetic) and environmental effects on growth rate. Individuals collected from and grown at Point Judith attained the highest body size. In the summer of 1994, there were no significant effects of environment or source population on growth rates. In the spring of 1995 only environmental effects were detected; animals grew faster at Point Judith. These results suggest that divergence between populations may occur with respect to growth rate but this divergence is not consistent interannually. An alternative mechanism, phenotypic plasticity, may also be employed by these amphipods to cope with environmental heterogeneity. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Within any given clade, male size and female size typically covary, but male size often varies more than female size. This generates a pattern of allometry for sexual size dimorphism (SSD) known as Rensch's rule. I use allometry for SSD among populations of the water strider Aquarius remigis (Hemiptera, Gerridae) to test the hypothesis that Rensch's rule evolves in response to sexual selection on male secondary sexual traits and all alternative hypothesis that it is caused by greater phenotypic plasticity of body size in males. Comparisons of three populations reared under two temperature regimes are combined with an analysis of allometry for genital and somatic components of body size among 25 field populations. Contrary to the sexual-selection hypothesis, genital length, the target of sexual selection, shows the lowest allometric slope of all the assayed traits. Instead, the results support a novel interpretation of the differential-plasticity hypothesis: that the traits most closely associated with reproductive fitness (abdomen length in females and genital length in males) are "adaptively canalized." While this hypothesis is unlikely to explain Rensch's rule among species or higher clades, it may explain widespread patterns of intraspecific variation in SSD recently documented for many insect species.

AB  - Ectothermic species face problems of water balance under colder and drier climatic conditions in montane localities. We investigated five ecophysiological traits (body melanization, desiccation resistance, rate of water loss or gain and body size) in eight populations of Drosophila immigrans from an altitudinal gradient (600-2226 m) in the Western Himalayas. The traits showed bell-shaped variability patterns characteristic of quantitative traits. For body melanization, we observed high heritability (0.65) on the basis of parent-offspring regression. A comparison of highland versus foothill populations showed significant divergence for all the traits except body size. Darker flies from the highlands exhibited higher desiccation resistance but reduced rate of water loss or gain as compared with lighter flies from the foothills, which showed lower desiccation resistance and higher rates of water loss as well as gain. Lack of differences in the amount of epicuticular lipids cannot account for differential reduction in cuticular water loss in altitudinal populations. However, within- as well as between-population differences in body melanization can account for changes in desiccation resistance and reduction in cuticular water loss. Analyses of highland versus lowland populations as well as in assorted darker and lighter flies from a highland population have shown differences in haemolymph and dehydration tolerance. For the mechanistic basis of desiccation resistance, our results on wild populations of Drosophila immigrans are not in agreement with those reported for laboratory-selected desiccation-resistant strains in Drosophila melanogaster. Thus, ecophysiological mechanisms could be different under laboratory versus field selection.

AB  - Offspring phenotypic variation can be substantially influenced by non-genetic factors such as maternal effects, which ultimately can influence organismal fitness. For oviparous organisms that lack parental care, oviposition-site choice and egg size are maternal effects that can greatly affect offspring traits. Yet, few studies examine the consequences of these traits in the wild.
   We manipulated the contents of natural painted turtle nests such that offspring spent two life stages (incubation and hibernation) in either maternally selected nest sites or randomly selected nest sites and quantified treatment differences in environmental parameters and offspring phenotypes. Additionally, we tracked the fates of individual eggs and hatchlings, which allowed us to quantify the strength and form of selection acting on egg size during incubation and, for the first time, body size during hibernation.
   Maternally selected nest sites were warmer and produced offspring that were longer and hatched earlier than their siblings emerging from cooler, randomly selected nests. Treatments did not affect any measured traits during hibernation.
   We detected no selection on egg size during the incubation stage, but significant linear selection favouring larger hatchlings during hibernation.
   Our results suggest that nest-site choice allows mothers to partially control the environment of their incubating eggs, but is less effective at controlling hatchling environments during hibernation. Additionally, we provide novel support for the bigger-is-better' hypothesis in turtles by showing a positive relationship between size and survival during the hibernation stage.

AB  - In ectothermic organisms, it is hypothesized that metabolic rates mediate influences of temperature on the ecological and evolutionary processes governing biodiversity. However, it is unclear how and to what extent the influence of temperature on metabolism scales up to shape large-scale diversity patterns. In order to clarify the roles of temperature and metabolism, new theory is needed. Here, we establish such theory and model eco-evolutionary dynamics of trophic networks along a broad temperature gradient. In the model temperature can influence, via metabolism, resource supply, consumers' vital rates and mutation rate. Mutation causes heritable variation in consumer body size, which diversifies and governs consumer function in the ecological network. The model predicts diversity to increase with temperature if resource supply is temperature-dependent, whereas temperature-dependent consumer vital rates cause diversity to decrease with increasing temperature. When combining both thermal dependencies, a unimodal temperature-diversity pattern evolves, which is reinforced by temperature-dependent mutation rate. Studying coexistence criteria for two consumers showed that these outcomes are owing to temperature effects on mutual invasibility and facilitation. Our theory shows how and why metabolism can influence diversity, generates predictions useful for understanding biodiversity gradients and represents an extendable framework that could include factors such as colonization history and niche conservatism.

AB  - Dividing sister pairs of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana (reared in a common environment) between high and low temperature shows that oviposition temperature induces a plastic response in egg size. Females at a lower temperature laid significantly larger (but fewer) eggs than their sisters kept at a higher temperature, whereas total reproductive investment increased with temperature. Cross-transfer experiments demonstrated that this plastic response in egg size is reversible. Interestingly, this pattern parallels an almost universal temperature-induced developmental response in ectotherm body size. In both cases, however, we do not yet understand the underlying mechanisms or the potential adaptive significance.
   By cross-transferring the experimentally manipulated eggs between temperatures, we showed that the larger eggs produced at a lower temperature had a higher hatching success, and yielded larger hatchlings with a slightly higher probability of reaching maturity and shorter larval development time (at the lower temperature) compared to the smaller eggs produced at a higher temperature. Overall, the lower temperature was slightly more detrimental for smaller than for larger eggs. The slight differences in survival across temperatures, together with more substantial differences in fecundity, indicate that it could pay off to produce fewer but larger offspring (with increased fitness) at a lower temperature, but more and smaller offspring at a higher temperature where offspring survival was generally high. Our data present for the first time evidence that selection may favor larger eggs at a lower temperature, and thus that a. plastic response. of egg size to temperature in ectotherms could be adaptive.

AB  - The impact of environmental stress factors on genetic variation in animal populations is considered. It is tentatively concluded that genetical variability of populations generally increases in stressful environments. The exposure to stressful factors result in an increase of recombination and mutation rates. In quantitative traits, on which the review is focused, stress often leads to an increase in the genetic component of variation. Experiments on Drosophila demonstrated that the effect of stress on genetic variation is trait-specific. The possible role of stress factors in adaptation and evolution of populations is discussed.

AB  - Geographical variation in Drosophila melanogaster body size is a long-standing problem of life-history evolution. Adaptation to a cold climate invariably produces large individuals, whereas evolution in tropical regions result in small individuals. The proximate mechanism was suggested to involve thermal evolution of resource processing by the developing larvae. In this study an attempt is made to merge proximate explanations, featuring temperature sensitivity of larval resource processing, and ultimate approaches focusing on adult and pre-adult life-history traits. To address the issue of temperature dependent resource allocation to adult size vs. larval survival, feeding was stopped at several stages during the larval development. Under these conditions of food deprivation, two temperate and two tropical populations reared at high and low temperatures produced different adult body sizes coinciding with different probabilities to reach the adult stage. In all cases a phenotypic trade-off between larval survival and adult size was observed. However, the underlying pattern of larval resource allocation differed between the geographical populations. In the temperate populations larval age but not weight predicted survival. Temperate larvae did not invest accumulated resources in survival, instead they preserved larval biomass to benefit adult weight. In other words, larvae from temperate populations failed to re-allocate accumulated resources to facilitate their survival. A low percentage of the larvae survived to adulthood but produced relatively large flies. Conversely, in tropical populations larval weight but not age determined the probability to reach adulthood. Tropical larvae did not invest in adult size, but facilitated their own survival. Most larvae succeeded in pupating but then produced small adults. The underlying physiological mechanism seemed to be an evolved difference in the accessibility of glycogen reserves as a result of thermal adaptation. At low rearing temperatures and in the temperate populations, glycogen levels tended to correlate positively with adult size but negatively with pupation probability. The data presented here offer an explanation of geographical variation in body size by showing that thermal evolution of resource allocation, specifically the ability to access glycogen storage, is the proximate mechanism responsible for the life-history trade-off between larval survival and adult size.

AB  - Previous work on lizards has shown that many sexually dimorphic traits depend on testosterone (T), but the details of this control can vary among species. Here, we tested the role of T on the expression of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits in Lichtenfelder's gecko (Goniurosaurus lichtenfelderi), from the lizard family Eublepharidae notable for interspecific variation in sexually dimorphic traits and the mode of sex determination. Experiments included three groups of males (intact control, surgically castrated, castrated with T replacement) and two groups of females (intact control, T supplemented). In males, castration caused reductions in 1) the size of hemipenes, 2) offensive aggression, 3) male sexual behavior in a neutral arena, 4) activity of predoacal glands, and 5) loss of male chemical cues for sex recognition. These reductions were not observed in castrated males with T replacement. Interestingly, castrated males performed sexual behavior in their home cages, which shows that the effect of T depends on the environmental context. Notably, tail vibration, previously reported as a courtship behavior in other eublepharids, is displayed by males of G. lichtenfelderi during interactions with conspecifics of both sexes, suggesting an evolutionary shift in the meaning of this signal. In females, T induced growth of hemipenes and male-typical courtship but did not induce precloacal pore activity, aggression, or mounting. In comparison to previous reports on Eublepharis macularius, our results indicate that effects of T do not depend on the mode of sex determination. Further, our results extend our understanding of the complexity of control of male traits and illustrate how lability in the effects of T can be a general mechanism causing evolutionary changes in the components of suites of functionally correlated traits.

AB  - Global temperatures are increasing rapidly affecting species globally. Understanding if and how different species can adapt fast enough to keep up with increasing temperatures is of vital importance. One mechanism that can accelerate adaptation and promote evolutionary rescue is sexual selection. Two different mechanisms by which sexual selection can facilitate adaptation are pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection. However, the relative effects of these different forms of sexual selection in promoting adaptation are unknown. Here, we present the results from an experimental study in which we exposed fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster to either no mate choice or 1 of 2 different sexual selection regimes (pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection) for 6 generations, under different thermal regimes. Populations showed evidence of thermal adaptation under precopulatory sexual selection, but this effect was not detected in the postcopulatory sexual selection and the no choice mating regime. We further demonstrate that sexual dimorphism decreased when flies evolved under increasing temperatures, consistent with recent theory predicting more sexually concordant selection under environmental stress. Our results suggest an important role for precopulatory sexual selection in promoting thermal adaptation and evolutionary rescue.

AB  - In insects including Drosophila melanogaster, females can overwinter at the adult stage by adopting a shallow reproductive diapause, but almost nothing is known about male reproductive diapause. In this study, we test for the maintenance of fertility in overwintering males from the eastern Australian D. melanogaster cline. Males from southern temperate populations maintained in field cages in temperate Melbourne had a higher fertility in spring compared with males from tropical locations. Temperate males successfully inseminated more females, and there were also more offspring produced per inseminated female. The resulting linear post-winter fertility clines were unrelated to male body size. In contrast, there was no clinal variation for fertility in nonoverwintering males held in the laboratory. The cline in overwintering male fertility is likely to have evolved as an adaptive response to latitudinal climatic variation over the last 100 years.

AB  - There is ongoing debate as to whether fish body size will decrease with global warming and how these changes may impact dispersal ability and speciation rate. Theory predicts that, under warmer temperatures, fish grow to a smaller size, undergo a reduction in dispersal ability and increase speciation rates. However, evaluations of such predictions are hampered owing to the lack of empirical data spanning both wide temporal and geographical scales. Here, using phylogenetic methods, we show that smaller clupeiform fish (anchovies and herrings) occurred historically in warmer waters, moved the shortest distances at low speed and displayed the lowest speciation rates. Furthermore, fish moved faster and evolved rapidly under higher rates of temperature change but these historical rates are far lower than current warming rates. Our results predict a future where smaller clupeiform fish that have reduced ability to move will be more prevalent; this, in turn, may reduce future speciation.
   Phylogenetic data over the past similar to 150 million years show smaller fish occurred in warmer waters, moved shorter distances at low speed and had low speciation rates. Fish moved faster and evolved quicker under periods of rapid change, with implications for movement and survival under climate change.

AB  - Understanding biodiversity gradients is a long-standing challenge, and progress requires theory unifying ecology and evolution. Here, we unify concepts related to the speed of evolution, the influence of species richness on diversification, and niche-based coexistence. We focus on the dynamics, through evolutionary time, of community invasibility and species richness across a broad thermal gradient. In our framework, the evolution of body size influences the ecological structure and dynamics of a trophic network, and organismal metabolism ties temperature to eco-evolutionary processes. The framework distinguishes ecological invasibility (governed by ecological interactions) from evolutionary invasibility (governed by local ecology and constraints imposed by small phenotypic effects of mutation). The model yields four primary predictions: (1) ecological invasibility declines through time and with increasing temperature; (2) average evolutionary invasibility across communities increases and then decreases through time as the richness-temperature gradient flattens; (3) in the early stages of diversification, richness and evolutionary invasibility both increase with increasing temperature; and (4) at equilibrium, richness does not vary with temperature, yet evolutionary invasibility decreases with increasing temperature. These predictions emerge from the "evolutionary-speed" hypothesis, which attempts to account for latitudinal species richness gradients by invoking faster biological rates in warmer, tropical regions. The model contrasts with predictions from other richness-gradient hypotheses, such as "niche conservatism" and "species energy." Empirically testing our model's predictions should help distinguish among these hypotheses.

AB  - We review recent works on different life history variables of cladoceran taxa in tropical and temperate freshwater bodies, comparing the strategies that cladocerans have evolved to adapt to contrasting environmental conditions in the two geographical regions. These life-history parameters relate to age and size at maturity, survival, fecundity, life-expectancy at birth, lifespan, gross, and net reproductive rates, generation time, the rate of population increase, peak population density and day of peak abundance. We also discuss the role of photoperiod and temperature on some of these life history parameters. We found a general paucity of experimental work and field data in tropics on cladocerans. There is very limited information on the few Daphnia species found in the tropics. The misconception of low species diversity of cladocerans in the tropics arose due to several reasons including lack of extensive and intensive field collections. Higher water temperatures apparently promote permanent infestation of tropical waters with toxic cyanobacteria, which reduce the zooplankton diversity. In addition to higher temperatures in the tropics, the year-round high predation pressure of planktivorous fish probably causes the tropical species, particularly in pelagic habitats, to reach maturity earlier (< 3 days) than in temperate regions. Species of Daphnia in temperate regions are particularly adapted to living at food concentrations that are much lower and seasonably more variable than those for tropical genera such as Diaphanosoma. This is further corroborated by the more than an order of magnitude higher threshold food concentration (TFC for tropical Cladocera than for their temperate counterparts. Fecundity patterns differ between tropical and temperate cladoceran taxa: cultured under optimal temperature regimes, tropical taxa have fewer eggs than temperate species of a comparable body size. Predation pressure may act differently depending on the size of the cladoceran neonates and thus on their population size structure. Global warming and climate changes seem to affect the behaviour (migration), distribution, and abundance of cladocerans. Apparently, in direct response to these changes, the possibility of encountering the tropical cladocerans in the northern, temperate hemisphere (bioinvasions) is on the rise.

AB  - In temperate climates, pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) produce a single sexual generation each year in response to declining photoperiod and temperature. Mating occurs in the fall and the eggs have an obligatory winter diapause. Genetic recombination during the sexual phase is thought to be an important source of genetic variability within cyclically parthenogenetic aphid populations. Methods for reliably producing sexual forms and hatching the eggs of aphids are therefore central not only to the study of evolutionary change in aphid populations, but also for a general understanding of the origin of agriculturally important variation in destructiveness within pest species.
   Here, sexual forms of six pea aphid clones were induced in the laboratory and eggs were successfully hatched by creating conditions that closely mimicked those found in field situations. A declining photoperiod was produced by controlling artificial lighting using a timer with variable cycle length. Using these conditions, sexual forms were successfully produced for all six clones tested, which were then mated in all combinations. Eggs were exposed to a daily cycle of freezing and thawing in an incubator under a short-day photoperiod. Egg hatch averaged 60%, but was as high as 89% for some crosses. These methods will permit testing of evolutionary hypotheses and execution of detailed genetic studies of sources of variability within pea aphid populations. They are thus important tools for both evolutionary and agricultural studies.

AB  - Background: On-going global climate change poses a serious threat for natural populations unless they are able to evolutionarily adapt to changing environmental conditions (e.g. increasing average temperatures, occurrence of extreme weather events). A prerequisite for evolutionary change is within-population heritable genetic variation in traits subject to selection. In relation to climate change, mainly phenological traits as well as heat and desiccation resistance have been examined for such variation. Therefore, it is important to investigate adaptive potential under climate change conditions across a broader range of traits. This is especially true for life-history traits and defences against natural enemies (e.g. parasites) since they influence organisms' fitness both directly and through species interactions. We examined the adaptive potential of fitness-related traits and their responses to heat waves in a population of a freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. We estimated family-level variation and covariation in life history (size, reproduction) and constitutive immune defence traits [haemocyte concentration, phenoloxidase (PO)-like activity, antibacterial activity of haemolymph] in snails experimentally exposed to typical (15 degrees C) and heat wave (25 degrees C) temperatures. We also assessed variation in the reaction norms of these traits between the treatments.
   Results: We found that at the heat wave temperature, snails were larger and reproduced more, while their immune defence was reduced. Snails showed high family-level variation in all examined traits within both temperature treatments. The only negative genetic correlation (between reproduction and antibacterial activity) appeared at the high temperature. However, we found no family-level variation in the responses of most examined traits to the experimental heat wave (i.e. largely parallel reaction norms between the treatments). Only the reduction of PO-like activity when exposed to the high temperature showed family-level variation, suggesting that the cost of heat waves may be lower for some families and could evolve under selection.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that there is genetic potential for adaptation within both thermal environments and that trait evolution may not be strongly affected by trade-offs between them. However, rare differences in thermal reaction norms across families indicate limited evolutionary potential in the responses of snails to changing temperatures during extreme weather events.

AB  - Tetranychus ludeni Zacher is a spider mite that has invaded all continents except Antarctica and become an economically important pest around the world. Understanding the plasticity of its life history traits as a response to temperatures provides critical information for its risk analysis and management. Here we tested its response to temperatures ranging from 15 to 30 degrees C over two generations. We found that there was no difference in the egg hatch rate and immature survival rate across temperatures in the first generation. However, the egg hatch rate was lower and immature survival rate was higher at 30 degrees C in the second generation. The sex ratio (proportion of females) of resultant adults was consistent under all test temperatures in both generations except for 30 degrees C in the second generation which was lower. Higher temperature accelerated development in both generations but the development at the lower temperatures was faster in the second generation. Adult body size in both generations generally decreased with the increase of temperature, with females being more likely than males to adjust body size in response to temperature changes they first experienced. Temperature-dependent body size was not translated into fecundity, but larger adults lived longer. The thermal threshold was lower and degree days (DD) were greater in the second generation than in the first generation. Our findings indicate that life history traits of T. ludeni are highly flexible and adaptive to dynamic thermal environment in successive generations. Furthermore, increasing temperature elevated the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) but shortened the generation time (T) and the time to double the population size (Dt). The net population growth rate (R0) was higher at 20 and 25 degrees C as compared to lower and higher temperatures.

AB  - Temperature is a key environmental factor affecting almost all aspects of life history in ectotherms. Theory predicts that they grow faster, reach smaller sizes and produce smaller offspring when temperature increases. In addition, temperature changes, through their effects on metabolism, may also influence the expression of alternative reproductive phenotypes (ARPs) in ectotherms. Although many studies have investigated the phenotypic plasticity of life history traits in relation to temperature change, little is known about how those traits and phenotypic plasticity may evolve together. In our study we subjected bulb mites (non-model, soil organisms that normally experience rather stable thermal conditions) to experimental evolution in two temperature treatments: control (24 degrees C) and elevated (28 degrees C). After 18 generations, we measured adult body size, egg size and development time of both treatments at control as well as at elevated temperatures (test temperatures). Thus, we were able to detect genetic changes (the effects of selection temperature) and environmental effects (the effects of test temperature). We also observed the ARP expression throughout the experimental evolution. Our results revealed quite complex patterns of life history in traits response to temperature. Mites developed faster and reached smaller sizes at increased temperature, but evolutionary responses to increased temperature were not always parallel to the observed phenotypic plasticity. Additionally, despite smaller body sizes, females laid larger eggs at higher temperature. This effect was more pronounced in animals evolving at elevated temperature. Evolution at increased temperature also affected ARP expression, with the proportion of armored fighters decreasing from generation to generation. We propose that this could be the consequence of temperature sensitivity of the cost-to-benefits ratio of expressing ARPs.

AB  - there is very little doubt among the scientific community that human induced greenhouse gas emission has contributed significantly to the climate change. Most significant changes in the earth's temperature have been noticed since the advent of the industrial era in the late 1800s. Over the past 100 years, the earth's surface has warmed by approximately 0.6 degrees C. Human activities such as the large-scale burning of fossil fuels to operate power plants and automobiles are releasing greenhouse gases like CO2 into the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate.
   The anthropogenic climate change and its impact on a wide variety of life-forms in various ecosystems. The pole ward and altitudinal shifts in the distribution of various organisms (especially butterflies), the spread of pathogen-driven diseases, the bleaching of coral reefs, and the changes in community and tropic dynamics in various marine and terrestrial ecosystems. The Earth's climate is changing and the impacts are already being felt by biodiversity and wildlife habitats across the planet. Individual sessions of Global Climate Change and Biodiversity covered a cross-section of the planet's major biomes: forests, marine, high latitudes and montane, managed landscapes and coasts. The impact of climate change on natural systems was shown to vary in different ecosystems in different parts of the world. But climate change is all-pervading and will have an increasing influence on the life systems of the Earth.
   The rich variety of life on Earth has always had to deal with a changing climate. The need to adapt to new patterns of temperature and rainfall has been a major influence on evolutionary changes that produced the plant and animal species we see today. Variation in the climate is perfectly compatible with the survival of ecosystems and their functions, on which we each depend for the essentials of life.
   There are several reasons why plants and animals are less able to adapt to the current phase of global warming. One is the very rapid pace of change: it is anticipated that over the next century. Many species will simply be unable to adapt quickly enough to the new conditions, or to move to regions more suited to their survival.

AB  - The mysid Limnomysis benedeni, one of the most important ponto-caspian invaders, was found in Lake Constance (southern Germany) in 2006. As part of larger studies to evaluate the effects of L. benedeni on the ecosystem, we studied its life-cycle strategies over an entire seasonal cycle in intervals of 3-5 weeks, addressing factors (predation, temperature) which we expected to be most important triggers of the observed changes. The size class distribution and the reproductive pattern indicated that the life cycle of L. benedeni changes seasonally. During winter (November to March), the mysid invested energy in growth and delayed reproduction until April, when the population was dominated by adults. In summer (June to September), the adults reproduced at a smaller body size and the population was disproportionately dominated by juveniles. In a mesocosm experiment that excluded fish predators, the mysids followed the same seasonal patterns of growth and energy investment as in the field population, but the size class distribution differed. Even in summer, the population in the mesocosm was dominated by adults. Stomach analyses of fish showed that L. benedeni is preyed upon by juvenile Perca fluviatilis, which fed size selectively on larger mysids. In conclusion, our results suggest predation was the reason for the dominance of juveniles and the observed size class distribution in summer. In contrast, the smaller adults in summer were most likely a physiological adaptation, perhaps evolved to avoid predation or as a reaction on metabolic losses at higher temperatures.

AB  - For ectothermic species with broad geographical distributions, latitudinal/altitudinal variation in environmental temperatures (averages and extremes) is expected to shape the evolution of physiological tolerances and the acclimation capacity (i.e., degree of phenotypic plasticity) of natural populations. This can create geographical gradients of selection in which environments with greater thermal variability (e.g., seasonality) tend to favor individuals that maximize performance across a broader range of temperatures compared to more stable environments. Although thermal acclimation capacity plays a fundamental role in this context, it is unknown whether natural selection targets this trait in natural populations. Additionally, understanding whether and how selection acts on thermal physiological plasticity is also highly relevant to climate change and biological conservation. Here, we addressed such an important gap in our knowledge in the northernmost population of the four-eyed frog, Pleurodema thaul. We measured plastic responses of critical thermal limits for activity, behavioral thermal preference, and thermal sensitivity of metabolism to acclimation at 10 and 20 degrees C. We monitored survival during three separate recapture efforts and used mark-recapture integrated into an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the relationship between survivals as a function of the plasticity of thermal traits. Overall, we found no evidence that thermal acclimation in this population is being targeted by directional selection, although there might be signals of selection on individual traits. According to the most supported models, survival increased in individuals with higher tolerance to cold when cold-acclimated, probably because daily low extremes are frequent during the cooler periods of the year. Furthermore, survival increased with body size. However, in both cases, the directional selection estimates were nonsignificant, and the constraints of our experimental design prevented us from evaluating more complex models (i.e., nonlinear selection).

AB  - 1. We describe a new technique for rapidly measuring the heat or cold resistance of many small insects. We heat (or cool) insects in a temperature-controlled column and measure the temperature at which they are knocked down.
   2. An artificial selection experiment on heat resistance demonstrates that knock-down temperatures respond rapidly to selection. After only four generations of selection, the experimental and control lines differed significantly in both knock-down temperature and physiological heat tolerance, as measured by per cent survival of a heat shock.
   3. Potential applications (acclimation, ageing, selection) and technical problems (body size, humidity, statistical considerations) are evaluated.

AB  - Many techniques commonly used by herpetologists for monitoring amphibian populations and communities yield censuses of the total adult population size (N). However, for many studies, e.g., of reproductive output, development of populations and potential for evolutionary changes, the effective population size (N-a) must be known. While modern molecular techniques make it possible to measure N-e, they are expensive, work-intensive and may not be possible or necessary for many questions on amphibian reproduction. For females of two species of water frog (Rana lessonae and R. esculenta), we investigate the effectiveness of several techniques to determine the presence or absence of eggs. The direct methods are (1) dissection of dead frogs and (2) a small skin incision into the abdominal side of live females. The indirect methods, all applied to live frogs, include (3) visual inspection of body shape, (4) tactile inspection of the epidermis, (5) transillumination with a strong cold light source, (6) ultrasound, (7) electromagnetic measurement of total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC), (8) calculation of body condition index and (9) analysis of blood plasma testosterone titers. Only two indirect methods were somewhat successful at predicting whether females were gravid. Testosterone titers (9) yielded the best results (ca. 80-90% effective). Body condition (8) was also significantly related to egg presence or absence, but predicted gravidity only weakly. We suggest that a combination of skin incision and hormone analysis provides a fairly good estimate of gravidity. When complemented by mark-recapture techniques and performed on the same individuals at different times of the season, this combination yields estimates not only of the reproductive output of the study population but also of the relative contribution of different females.

AB  - Ectothermic organisms rely on behavioral thermoregulation to modulate their body temperature and the final thermal preferendum (FTP) paradigm (FTPP) postulates that a given species holds a species-specific FTP. The FTPP, however, has been challenged by a considerable amount of recent findings on vertebrate ectotherms, indicating that the FTP is not as static as originally postulated but can be modulated by various factors. In contrast to vertebrates, evidence from invertebrate ectotherms is far more limited. To test for the validity of the FTPP and to study whether behavioral thermoregulation in a marine invertebrate varies seasonally, thermal preferenda of the common brown shrimp (Crangon crangon, L.) were determined through a 14 month period. Thermal preferenda of males and females of different size groups were measured in an annular chamber system (4-25 degrees C) using the gravitational method for thermal preference testing. The results revealed that brown shrimp behaviorally selected a wide range of temperatures and did not show a single or constant thermal preferendum. Thermal preference was modulated following a seasonal pattern suggesting the existence of distinct seasonal preference zones rather than a species-specific preference temperature. Brown shrimp selected low temperatures during winter, however, a difference of 5 degrees C in preferred temperature was observed between a cold and a relatively mild one. Highest thermal preferenda did not coincide with field water temperatures but were observed after field water temperatures exceeded the annual temperature peak. Besides season, body size of brown shrimp significantly affected thermal selection and small individuals selected higher temperatures compared to large ones. A significant interaction of body size and water temperature at which the shrimp were caught was detected. The study further provides evidence that cohort identity as well as female reproductive state may affect thermal preference as well. The results of the study reveal that thermal selection in brown shrimp is complex, not static and that preference temperature can be modulated by various factors, representing the first evidence for a marine invertebrate ectotherm.

AB  - Aim It is still debated whether allometry, the relationship between body size and body parts, entails merely an evolutionary constraint or can itself evolve. Recently, a hypothesis has been proposed that states that static allometry (allometry measured across individuals at the same developmental stage) can evolve from differences in the developmental pathways between pairs of traits under different nutritional environments. A macroecological prediction stemming from this hypothesis is that allometric coefficients (scaling and allometric factors) should covary with ecosystem productivity. Here, we tested this prediction using a worldwide database of mass-length allometric equations. Location Worldwide, data distributed across the entire globe. Time period 1967-2017. Major taxa studied Soil arthropods. Methods We fitted general linear models with the allometric coefficients (the scaling a and allometric b factors) as the dependent variables. The target independent variable was the normalized difference vegetation index, as a proxy of ecosystem productivity. Longitude, absolute latitude and altitude, as well as mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation were included as both covariates and additional variables of interest. We also included body bauplan (obtained from geometric morphometrics), taxonomic affiliation (a proxy of phylogenetic relationships) and the reciprocal allometric coefficient as covariates in the model. Results We found a strong negative association between both allometric factors and the productivity of the ecosystems, and the effect for the allometric factor b was stronger at lower trophic levels. We also detected strikingly similar effects of geographic and climatic predictors on both allometric factors, suggesting the occurrence of similar selective regimes. Main conclusions The fact that productivity, geography and climate affect the value of mass-length allometric coefficients has important consequences not only to understand the evolution of allometries, but also for how energy is processed in soil ecosystems across the globe.

AB  - In in aquatic thermal gradient of 15-30 C, 3-, 6-, and 12-month-old juvenile wood turtles (Glyptemys insculpta) acclimated to 20 C selected the warmest temperature available (30 C) and avoided the coldest temperatures available (15 and 18 C). Mean selection of chambers differed between control and gradient tests across all temperatures except 27 C. Turtles of all age classes relocated between chambers less often when the gradient was present than during control tests. Six- and 12-month-old turtles selected 30 C more frequently, and selected colder temperatures less frequently, than 3-month-old turtles, suggesting that the ability to select preferred temperatures is better developed in older hatchlings.

AB  - Temperature profoundly affects growth and life history traits in ectothermic animals through selection (i.e., genetic) and through direct effects on the phenotype (i.e., nongenetic/plasticity). We examined the effects of rearing temperature (24 degrees, 30 degrees, and 36 degrees C) on adult body size and development time and the interactive effects of temperature experienced during rearing and oviposition on several life history traits (age-at-first-reproduction, fecundity, egg size, egg development, and egg hatching) in two populations of the seed beetle, Stator limbatus, collected at different elevations. The higher elevation population was larger and matured sooner than the low-elevation population when raised at the lower temperature, but the reverse was true at the higher temperature suggesting that these populations have adapted to local temperature. There were interactions between the effects of rearing temperature and oviposition temperature for age-at-first-reproduction, fecundity, egg development, egg hatching, and two composite measures of fitness, generating complex reaction norms. The most dramatic example of this was a large maternal effect on egg hatching; females raised at low temperature produced eggs that had substantially reduced hatching when laid at hi h temperature. Our experimental design also allowed us to explore 0 9 the adaptive significance of acclimation. Beetles reared at intermediate or low temperature had the highest fitness at Multiple oviposition temperatures. There was little support for the "beneficial acclimation hypothesis," which predicts that beetles should have higher fitness at the temperature at which they were reared; acclimation had only a small effect on fitness. This study shows that temperature-mediated plasticity can be complex, but these complex patterns can yield new insights into the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - The integration of genetic information with ecological and phenotypic data constitutes an effective approach to gain insight into the mechanisms determining interpopulation variability and the evolutionary processes underlying local adaptation and incipient speciation. Here, we use the Pyrenean Morales grasshopper (Chorthippus saulcyi moralesi) as study system to (i) analyse the relative role of genetic drift and selection in range-wide patterns of phenotypic differentiation and (ii) identify the potential selective agents (environment, elevation) responsible for variation. We also test the hypothesis that (iii) the development of dispersal-related traits is associated with different parameters related to population persistence/turnover, including habitat suitability stability over the last 120 000 years, distance to the species distribution core and population genetic variability. Our results indicate that selection shaped phenotypic differentiation across all the studied morphological traits (body size, forewing length and shape). Subsequent analyses revealed that among-population differentiation in forewing length was significantly explained by a temperature gradient, suggesting an adaptive response to thermoregulation or flight performance under contrasting temperature regimes. We found support for our hypothesis predicting a positive association between the distance to the species distribution core and the development of dispersal-related morphology, which suggests an increased dispersal capability in populations located at range edges that, in turn, exhibit lower levels of genetic variability. Overall, our results indicate that range-wide patterns of phenotypic variation are partially explained by adaptation in response to local environmental conditions and differences in habitat persistence between core and peripheral populations.

AB  - A natural population of Drosophila melanogaster was sampled twice over a 5-year interval from the same French locality in the same season. Reaction norms of wing and thorax length and wing/thorax ratio, according to growth temperature (12-31 degrees C) were analysed in tell isofemale lines for each sample. Reaction norms were very similar between years, showing not only a remarkable stability of the average size but also of the reactivity to temperature. Wing and thorax length reaction norms were characterized by the co-ordinates of their maxima (MV = maximum value of character; TMV = temperature of maximum value). The wing/thorax ratio, which exhibited a decreasing sigmoid norm, was characterized by the co-ordinates of the inflexion point. Again, these characteristic values were found to be very similar for samples between years. The results were further analysed by pooling the 20 lines into a single data set. Heritability was significantly variable according to temperature, but in a fairly irregular way with lowest values at extreme temperatures. Genetic variance of the three traits exhibited more regular variation with a minimum at intermediate temperatures and maxima at extreme high or low temperatures. Such was also the case of evolvability, i.e. the genetic coefficient of variation. Heritability and evolvability were found to be slightly but negatively correlated, showing that they provide independent biological information. The temporal stability of a natural population over the years suggests some stabilizing selection for both mean body size and plasticity. For laboratory evolution experiments, the natural origin population might be useful as a genetic control over time. (C) Inra/Elsevier, Paris.

AB  - We measured the feeding rate of individual (0.6-12.2 g) young-of-the-year ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) on the live eggs of lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) at 3, 5, and 9 degrees C in the laboratory. These temperatures were selected because they covered the range of lake temperatures over which eggs of most Great Lakes coregonines would be most vulnerable to predation by ruffe. Ruffe readily consumed lake whitefish eggs, and regression analysis showed consumption increased with ruffe size and water temperature. Mean daily egg consumption as a percent of mean ruffe body weight was 0.25% at 3 degrees C, 0.59% at 5 degrees C, and 1.00% at 9 degrees C.

AB  - Three packaging technologies are evaluated for application to next-generation RF products, particularly the Radio and MAC/Baseband components for WLAN-cards. The trends for WLAN card packaging point to a need for ever-increasing pin counts in smaller form factors. at an affordable cost. The three technologies considered are leadframe, patternable leadframe and ball grid array (BGA). These technologies are evaluated based upon performance (thermal, mechanical and electrical), manufacturability and design attributes. Data from modeling and assembly builds are presented. The key point of the paper is that increasing on-die integration for functional-rich, multiple-input / multiple output (MIMO)/multi-mode RF products is driving a need to investigate emerging package technologies.. This paper presents a data based evaluation of three front-runner technologies: leadframe body-size extensions, patternable leadframe technologies and BGA. The key unique contributions of this paper are a demonstration of the manufacturability of higher pin count (150+), larger leadframe and patternable leadframe packages than have been previously been demonstrated and a test-vehicle, design-of-experiments comparison of the three leading technologies considered for next-generation RF product packaging.

AB  - In the present study, various body size scaling relationships describing the physiological performance of plaice Pleuronectes platessa (L) were derived using a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model and compared with allometric relationships derived from a static energy budget (SEB) model. Results indicated that DEB models can correctly predict the physiological performance of plaice within variable environments. Dynamic energy budgets are preferred over static energy budgets because they are not descriptive but based on first principles, they are not species-specific, and they can be used for extrapolations beyond the range of experimental data. Nevertheless, some aspects of the DEB model can still be improved. These include: I I I processes underlying the temperature tolerance range, temperature acclimation and the relationship between optimal temperature and body size; [21 the contribution of various processes to metabolism; and [3] the incorporation and quantification of Fry's scheme of the environment, especially of masking factors (e.g., sub-optimal salinity conditions which load the minimum metabolism) and limiting factors (e.g., low oxygen conditions that constrain the maximum metabolic rate). These improvements would offer a wide range of opportunities for further application. such as the reconstruction of food and growth conditions; the validation of age determination by means of otolith readings: the analysis of intraspecific genetic variability versus non-genetic phenotypic adaptations: and the interspecific comparison of energy flows by means of variability in the various DEB model parameters.

AB  - Geographical patterns of morphological variation have been useful in addressing hypotheses about environmental adaptation. In particular, latitudinal clines in phenotypes have been studied in a number of Drosophila species. Some environmental conditions along latitudinal clinesfor example, temperaturealso vary along altitudinal clines, but these have been studied infrequently and it remains unclear whether these environmental factors are similar enough for convergence or parallel evolution. Most clinal studies in Drosophila have dealt exclusively with univariate phenotypes, allowing for the detection of clinal relationships, but not for estimating the directions of covariation between them. We measured variation in wing shape and size in D. melanogaster derived from populations at varying altitudes and latitudes across sub-Saharan Africa. Geometric morphometrics allows us to compare shape changes associated with latitude and altitude, and manipulating rearing temperature allows us to quantify the extent to which thermal plasticity recapitulates clinal effects. Comparing effect vectors demonstrates that altitude, latitude, and temperature are only partly associated, and that the altitudinal shape effect may differ between Eastern and Western Africa. Our results suggest that selection responsible for these phenotypic clines may be more complex than just thermal adaptation.

AB  - The contrasting habitats providing a heterogenous environment are considered to affect morphological traits of Lepidoptera due to their adaptability to various selection pressures under such conditions. The morphological and genetic variability of the butterfly Argynnis paphia (Nymphalidae) were studied with a focus on populations across different environments of the Western Carpathians. Male individuals were collected from five sites differing in elevation, type of bedrock, vegetation and climatic region. Morphometric analyses indicated significant variability in reproductive (genitalia width) and non-reproductive (forewing shape and size) traits. The most significant differences were recorded between the locality Bacova, representing the highest elevation, and other localities. The statistical analyses revealed the correlation of wing morphology with elevation, bedrock type and annual average temperature, while morphological differences of valvae structures were correlated with altitude. We concluded that size and shape of wings but also male genitalia vary among populations of A. paphia from different regions in response to environmental conditions.

AB  - Integration of multiple approaches is key to understand the evolutionary processes of local adaptation and speciation. Reptiles have successfully colonized desert environments, that is, extreme and arid conditions that constitute a strong selective pressure on organisms. Here, we studied genomic, physiological and morphological variations of the lizard Liolaemus fuscus to detect adaptations to the Atacama Desert.
   By comparing populations of L. fuscus inhabiting the Atacama Desert with populations from the Mediterranean forests from central Chile, we aimed at characterizing features related to desert adaptation.
   We combined ddRAD sequencing with physiological (evaporative water loss, metabolic rate and selected temperature) and morphological (linear and geometric morphometrics) measurements. We integrated the genomic and phenotypic data using redundancy analyses.
   Results showed strong genetic divergence, along with a high number of fixed loci between desert and forest populations. Analyses detected 110 fixed and 30 outlier loci located within genes, from which 43 were in coding regions, and 12 presented non-synonymous mutations. The candidate genes were associated with cellular membrane and development. Desert lizards presented lower evaporative water loss than those from the forest. Morphological data showed that desert lizards had smaller body size, different allometry, larger eyeballs and more dorsoventrally compressed heads.
   Our results suggest incipient speciation between desert and forest populations. The adaptive signal must be cautiously interpreted since genetic drift could also contribute to the divergence pattern. Nonetheless, we propose water and resource availability, and changes in habitat structure, as the most relevant challenges for desert reptiles. This study provides insights of the mechanisms that allow speciation as well as desert adaptation in reptiles at multiple levels, and highlights the benefit of integrating independent evidence.

AB  - Effective thermoregulation and the ability to select preferred temperature is an important factor influencing fitness in hatchling and juvenile turtles. Six-month-old Glyptemys insculpta acclimated to 20 degrees C selected the warmest temperature available and avoided the coldest temperature available in a gradient of 12-27 degrees C. Turtles visited fewer chambers and switched chambers in the gradient tank less frequently when the gradient was present than during control tests. Mean selection of chambers differed between control and gradient tests across all temperatures except at 21 degrees C, the temperature closest to the acclimation and control temperature (20 degrees C).

AB  - Global rising of average temperatures and increase in extreme climatic events may largely impact animal survival and reproduction. Yet, how variation in temperature may affect male fertility, in particular ejaculate traits, and whether this can in turn affect offspring fitness, is seldom addressed. Paternal effects may be of key importance as they could impact the rate and direction of evolutionary change in response to climate change.
   We tested the effects of temperature experienced by males on sperm traits, and asked whether the paternal environmental temperature affected offspring phenotype. We further explored the potential for paternal effects to be adaptive, which would occur when offspring fitness increased under the same environmental conditions experienced by the fathers. We exposed male field crickets to high or low temperatures at two life stages, either throughout development or as adults, and tested sperm traits (number and quality) and offspring fitness (hatching success and survival). We further assessed sperm traits in offspring, after they had also been exposed to the same or different temperature experienced by their father.
   We found that temperature affected sperm traits depending on the life-stage of individuals. When the exposure was given during adulthood, males exposed to high temperature produced less sperm and of lower quality compared to males exposed to lower temperature, while if exposure was given during development, males exposed to high temperature produced more sperm and of better quality compared to males exposed to low temperatures. Offspring fitness was significantly affected by paternal temperature, evidence for anticipatory paternal effects on sperm traits was not found.
   Our study indicates that temperature can mediate cross-generational effects, and that paternal effects may be mediated by changes in temperature and therefore much more widespread in nature than previously assumed.

AB  - Predicting the impacts of climate change requires knowledge of the potential to adapt to rising temperatures, which is unknown for most species. Adaptive potential may be especially important in tropical species that have narrow thermal ranges and live close to their thermal optimum. We used the animal model to estimate heritability, genotype by environment interactions and nongenetic maternal components of phenotypic variation in fitness-related traits in the coral reef damselfish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus. Offspring of wild-caught breeding pairs were reared for two generations at current-day and two elevated temperature treatments (+1.5 and +3.0 degrees C) consistent with climate change projections. Length, weight, body condition and metabolic traits (resting and maximum metabolic rate and net aerobic scope) were measured at four stages of juvenile development. Additive genetic variation was low for length and weight at 0 and 15 days posthatching (dph), but increased significantly at 30 dph. By contrast, nongenetic maternal effects on length, weight and body condition were high at 0 and 15 dph and became weaker at 30 dph. Metabolic traits, including net aerobic scope, exhibited high heritability at 90 dph. Furthermore, significant genotype x environment interactions indicated potential for adaptation of maximum metabolic rate and net aerobic scope at higher temperatures. Net aerobic scope was negatively correlated with weight, indicating that any adaptation of metabolic traits at higher temperatures could be accompanied by a reduction in body size. Finally, estimated breeding values for metabolic traits in F2 offspring were significantly affected by the parental rearing environment. Breeding values at higher temperatures were highest for transgenerationally acclimated fish, suggesting a possible role for epigenetic mechanisms in adaptive responses of metabolic traits. These results indicate a high potential for adaptation of aerobic scope to higher temperatures, which could enable reef fish populations to maintain their performance as ocean temperatures rise.

AB  - Examining the phenotypic and genetic underpinnings of life-history variation in long-lived organisms is central to the study of life-history evolution. Juvenile growth and survival are often density dependent in reptiles, and theory predicts the evolution of slow growth in response to low resources (resource-limiting hypothesis), such as under densely populated conditions. However, rapid growth is predicted when exceeding some critical body size reduces the risk of mortality ( mortality hypothesis). Here we present results of paired, large-scale, five-year field experiments to identify causes of variation in individual growth and survival rates of an Australian turtle (Emydura macquarii) prior to maturity. To distinguish between these competing hypotheses, we reduced nest predators in two populations and retained a control population to create variation in juvenile density by altering recruitment levels. We also conducted a complementary split-clutch field-transplant experiment to explore the impact of incubation temperature (25 degrees C or 30 degrees C), nest predator level ( low or high), and clutch size on juvenile growth and survival. Juveniles in high-recruitment ( predator removal) populations were not resource limited, growing more rapidly than young turtles in the control populations. Our experiments also revealed a remarkably long-term impact of the thermal conditions experienced during embryonic development on growth of turtles prior to maturity. Moreover, this thermal effect was manifested in turtles approaching maturity, rather than in turtles closer to hatching, and was dependent on population density in the post-hatching rearing environment. This apparent phenotypic plasticity in growth complements our observation of a strong, positive genetic correlation between individual body size in the experimental and control populations over the first five years of life (r(G) similar to +0.77). Thus, these Australian pleurodiran turtles have the impressive capacity to acclimate plastically to major demographic perturbations and enjoy the longer-term potential to evolve adaptively to maintain viability.

AB  - Simple Summary Heat waves can have fatal effects on arthropods such as insects and mites since their heat tolerance is often lower than the diurnal maximum temperatures during heat waves. Plastic modifications by the parents, however, can rapidly result in favorable adaptations in offspring traits. This question was investigated by using a prominent natural enemy/pest couple in biological control, the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis and its prey, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae. We exposed both species separately to extreme or mild heat waves during their juvenile development, a vital phase of arthropod life, for two generations and assessed various fitness-relevant parameters of the offspring generation. Under extreme heat waves, adult body sizes of predator and prey males and prey females were insensitive, when they derived from parents also reared under extreme heat waves. Irrespective of their origin, offspring reached earlier adulthood under extreme heat waves. In general, prey benefitted more from parental modifications compared to the predator. However, further investigations are needed to verify whether these changes affect the interactions between the predators and their prey to an extent that it may jeopardize biological control during extreme heat waves. Theoretically, parents can adjust vital offspring traits to the irregular and rapid occurrence of heat waves via developmental plasticity. However, the direction and strength of such trait modifications are often species-specific. Here, we investigated within-generational plasticity (WGP) and trans-generational plasticity (TGP) effects induced by heat waves during the offspring development of the predator Phytoseiulus persimilis and its herbivorous prey, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, to assess plastic developmental modifications. Single offspring individuals with different parental thermal origin (reared under mild or extreme heat waves) of both species were exposed to mild or extreme heat waves until adulthood, and food consumption, age and size at maturity were recorded. The offspring traits were influenced by within-generational plasticity (WGP), trans-generational plasticity (TGP), non-plastic trans-generational effects (TGE) and/or their interactions. When exposed to extreme heat waves, both species speeded up development (exclusively WGP), consumed more (due to the fact of WGP but also to TGP in prey females and to non-plastic TGE in predator males), and predator females got smaller (non-plastic TGE and WGP), whereas prey males and females were equally sized irrespective of their origin, because TGE, WGP and TGP acted in opposite directions. The body sizes of predator males were insensitive to parental and offspring heat wave conditions. Species comparisons indicated stronger reductions in the developmental time and reduced female predator-prey body size ratios in favor of the prey under extreme heat waves. Further investigations are needed to evaluate, whether trait modifications result in lowered suppression success of the predator on its prey under heat waves or not.

AB  - Organisms experience variation in the thermal environment on several different temporal scales, with seasonality being particularly prominent in temperate regions. For organisms with short generation times, seasonal variation is experienced across, rather than within, generations. How this affects the seasonal evolution of thermal tolerance and phenotypic plasticity is understudied, but has direct implications for the thermal ecology of these organisms. Here we document intra-annual patterns of thermal tolerance in two species ofAcartiacopepods (Crustacea) from a highly seasonal estuary, showing strong variation across the annual temperature cycle. Common garden, split-brood experiments indicate that this seasonal variation in thermal tolerance, along with seasonal variation in body size and phenotypic plasticity, is likely affected by genetic polymorphism. Our results show that adaptation to seasonal variation is important to consider when predicting how populations may respond to ongoing climate change.

AB  - Cohorts of willow sawfly (Nematus oligospilus) were reared in the laboratory on crack willow (Salix fragilis) at seven constant temperatures between 11.3 and 28.8 degrees C. Larvae developed through 5-7 instars. Body size (length) of adult females was influenced by temperature and was strongly correlated with fecundity (R-2 = 0.8973). The developmental threshold (t(o)), determined through linear regression, was calculated to be 8.1 degrees C, and the thermal accumulation above t(o) required to complete one generation was 321 degree-days. The number of degree-days available for seasonal development of the sawfly at 10 sites throughout New Zealand was calculated. Allowing for the period of diapause, it was estimated that N. oligospilus might potentially develop through up to seven generations per year in the North Island and three generations per year in the south of the South Island.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Hundreds of Sepia officinalis were hatched and cultured through the life cycle in each of 13 populations. Two genetic lines were maintained: one for an unprecedented seven generations and another presently in its fourth. All generations-save one-produced animals in excess of 1.0 kg body weight. Seven of eight generations with adequate data records had mean weights of 1-2 kg, and the largest cuttlefish reared were a male 2.6 kg and a Female 2.9 kg. Fecundity levels were high, but there was a trend towards decreased fertility in later generations, with fertilization rates dropping below 10%. In the 7th generation, most mature animals failed to engage in agonistic courtship and mating behaviour. Almost no normal eggs were laid and none was fertile, thus ending the lineage. Most culture took place at 20-24 degrees C and temperature generally explained variations in life span duration: being of shorter length at higher temperatures. Life spans were consistently longer at 20 degrees C and sizes were greater than predicted from previously published literature. In both lines there was a trend towards larger individuals and longer life spans in subsequent generations. Survival of hatchlings typically exceeded 90% for two months posthatching, and survival averaged 50% or higher to sexual maturity when corrected for animals removed from the populations for experimental use.

AB  - Social interactions are ubiquitous across the animal kingdom. A variety of ecological and evolutionary processes are dependent on social interactions, such as movement, disease spread, information transmission, and density-dependent reproduction and survival. Social interactions, like any behaviour, are context dependent, varying with environmental conditions. Currently, environments are changing rapidly across multiple dimensions, becoming warmer and more variable, while habitats are increasingly fragmented and contaminated with pollutants. Social interactions are expected to change in response to these stressors and to continue to change into the future. However, a comprehensive understanding of the form and magnitude of the effects of these environmental changes on social interactions is currently lacking. Focusing on four major forms of rapid environmental change currently occurring, we review how these changing environmental gradients are expected to have immediate effects on social interactions such as communication, agonistic behaviours, and group formation, which will thereby induce changes in social organisation including mating systems, dominance hierarchies, and collective behaviour. Our review covers intraspecific variation in social interactions across environments, including studies in both the wild and in laboratory settings, and across a range of taxa. The expected responses of social behaviour to environmental change are diverse, but we identify several general themes. First, very dry, variable, fragmented, or polluted environments are likely to destabilise existing social systems. This occurs as these conditions limit the energy available for complex social interactions and affect dissimilar phenotypes differently. Second, a given environmental change can lead to opposite responses in social behaviour, and the direction of the response often hinges on the natural history of the organism in question. Third, our review highlights the fact that changes in environmental factors are not occurring in isolation: multiple factors are changing simultaneously, which may have antagonistic or synergistic effects, and more work should be done to understand these combined effects. We close by identifying methodological and analytical techniques that might help to study the response of social interactions to changing environments, highlight consistent patterns among taxa, and predict subsequent evolutionary change. We expect that the changes in social interactions that we document here will have consequences for individuals, groups, and for the ecology and evolution of populations, and therefore warrant a central place in the study of animal populations, particularly in an era of rapid environmental change.

AB  - Changes in the environment are expected to induce changes in the quantitative genetic variation, which influences the ability of a population to adapt to environmental change. Furthermore, environmental changes are not constant in time, but fluctuate. Here, we investigate the effect of rapid, continuous and/or fluctuating temperature changes in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, using an evolution experiment followed by a split-brood experiment. In line with expectations, individuals responded in a plastic way and had an overall higher potential to respond to selection after a rapid change in the environment. After selection in an environment with increasing temperature, plasticity remained unchanged (or decreased) and environmental variation decreased, especially when fluctuations were added; these results were unexpected. As expected, the genetic variation decreased after fluctuating selection. Our results suggest that fluctuations in the environment have major impact on the response of a population to environmental change; in a highly variable environment with low predictability, a plastic response might not be beneficial and the response is genetically and environmentally canalized resulting in a low potential to respond to selection and low environmental sensitivity. Interestingly, we found greater variation for phenotypic plasticity after selection, suggesting that the potential for plasticity to evolve is facilitated after exposure to environmental fluctuations. Our study highlights that environmental fluctuations should be considered when investigating the response of a population to environmental change.

AB  - Drosophila melanogaster invaded Australia around 100 years ago, most likely through a northern invasion. The wide range of climatic conditions in eastern Australia across which D. melanogaster is now found provides an opportunity for researchers to identify traits and genes that are associated with climatic adaptation. Allozyme studies indicate clinal patterns for at least four loci including a strong linear cline in Adh and a non-linear cline in alpha-Gpdh. Inversion clines were initially established from cytological studies but have now been validated with larger sample sizes using molecular markers for breakpoints. Recent collections indicate that some genetic markers (Adh and In(3R)Payne) have changed over the last 20 years reflecting continuing evolution. Heritable clines have been established for quantitative traits including wing length/area, thorax length and cold and heat resistance. A cline in egg size independent of body size and a weak cline in competitive ability have also been established. Postulated clinal patterns for resistance to desiccation and starvation have not been supported by extensive sampling. Experiments under laboratory and semi-natural conditions have suggested selective factors generating clinal patterns, particularly for reproductive patterns over winter. Attempts are being made to link clinal variation in traits to specific genes using QTL analysis and the candidate locus approach, and to identify the genetic architecture of trait variation along the cline. This is proving difficult because of inversion polymorphisms that generate disequilibrium among genes. Substantial gaps still remain in linking clines to field selection and understanding the genetic and physiological basis of the adaptive shifts. However D. melanogaster populations in eastern Australia remain an excellent resource for understanding past and future evolutionary responses to climate change.

AB  - Extreme weather events such as heat waves are becoming more frequent and intense. Populations can cope with elevated heat stress by evolving higher basal heat tolerance (evolutionary response) and/or stronger induced heat tolerance (plastic response). However, there is ongoing debate about whether basal and induced heat tolerance are negatively correlated and whether adaptive potential in heat tolerance is sufficient under ongoing climate warming. To evaluate the evolutionary potential of basal and induced heat tolerance, we performed experimental evolution on a temperate source population of the dung fly Sepsis punctum. Offspring of flies adapted to three thermal selection regimes (Hot, Cold and Reference) were subjected to acute heat stress after having been exposed to either a hot-acclimation or non-acclimation pretreatment. As different traits may respond differently to temperature stress, several physiological and life history traits were assessed. Condition dependence of the response was evaluated by exposing juveniles to different levels of developmental (food restriction/rearing density) stress. Heat knockdown times were highest, whereas acclimation effects were lowest in the Hot selection regime, indicating a negative association between basal and induced heat tolerance. However, survival, adult longevity, fecundity and fertility did not show such a pattern. Acclimation had positive effects in heat-shocked flies, but in the absence of heat stress hot-acclimated flies had reduced life spans relative to non-acclimated ones, thereby revealing a potential cost of acclimation. Moreover, body size positively affected heat tolerance and unstressed individuals were less prone to heat stress than stressed flies, offering support for energetic costs associated with heat tolerance. Overall, our results indicate that heat tolerance of temperate insects can evolve under rising temperatures, but this response could be limited by a negative relationship between basal and induced thermotolerance, and may involve some but not other fitness-related traits.

AB  - 1. Phenotypic plasticity and/or genetic adaptation may allow species to live in a variable environment. It has been shown that eggs of the dark bush-cricket, Pholidoptera griseoaptera, which experienced an insufficient warm treatment (shorter and/or colder), had a longer development time and hatched predominantly after the second diapause.
   2. Given the broad distribution of this species from sea level to the timber line, we expected variation in voltinism along a climatic gradient. To reveal the role of natural selection in egg-hatching patterns, we compared different and unrelated populations sampled along a 1000 m elevational gradient in a common laboratory experiment.
   3. In the same rearing microclimate, we found that populations from mountains had mostly a shorter life cycle, whereas semivoltinism prevailed in lowland populations.
   4. This demonstrated the genetically underpinned local adaptation of this insect to harsh mountain environments with a shorter growing season determined by elevation.

AB  - Spiders are small arthropods that have colonized terrestrial environments. These impose three main problems: (i) terrestrial habitats have large fluctuations in temperature and humidity; (ii) the internal concentration of water is higher than the external environment in spiders, which exposes them continually to water loss; and (iii) their small body size determines a large surface/volume ratio, affecting energy exchange and influencing the life strategy. In this review we focus on body design, energetic, thermal selection, and water balance characteristics of some spider species present in Chile and correlate our results with ecological and behavioral information. Preferred temperatures and critical temperatures of Chilean spiders vary among species and individuals and may be adjusted by phenotypic plasticity. For example in the mygalomorph high-altitude spider Paraphysa parvula the preferred temperature is similar to that of the lowland spider Grammostola rosea; but while P parvula shows phenotypic plasticity, G. rosea does not. The araneomorph spiders Loxosceles laeta and Scytodes globula have greater daily variations in preferred temperatures at twilight and during the night, which are set to the nocturnal activity rhythms of these species. They also present acclimation of the minimum critical temperatures. Dysdera crocata has a low preferred temperature adjusted to its favorite prey, the woodlouse. Spider metabolic rate is low compared to other arthropods, which may be associated with its sit and wait predatory strategy particularly in primitive hunter and weavers. In mygalomorph spiders the respiratory system is highly optimized with high oxygen conductance, for example G. rosea needs only a difference of 0.12-0.16 kPa in the oxygen partial pressure across the air-hemolymph barrier to satisfy its resting oxygen consumption demands. Water loss is a significant stress for spiders. Paraphysa parvula shows an evaporative water loss 10 times more than usual when the temperature approaches 40 degrees C and the participation of book lungs in this loss is about 60%. This species and others show seasonal changes in water loss accounted for by changes in cuticle permeability. The case of Chilean spiders shows how the ecophysiology in spiders is associated to their design and body size and how is affected by fluctuating Mediterranean environments, suggesting that the adaptive process can be seen as a route of optimizing the use of energy to cope with environmental restrictions imposed by the interaction with the terrestrial environment and lifestyle.

AB  - We present a simple nutrient-phytoplankton model that incorporates adaptive evolution and allometric relations. This model allows us to examine the patterns and consequences of adaptive changes in the cell size of phytoplankton under the effect of changes in water temperature. A theoretical study reveals that the ecological reproductive index can be used to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of the nutrient-phytoplankton model. Numerical analysis suggests that phytoplankton should evolve toward the small sizes typical of picophytoplankton as the water temperature increases. This study provides a framework for studying the adaptive evolution of phytoplankton cell size in water ecosystem.

AB  - Changes in the number of generations per year (voltinism) have been among the most common phenological responses to climate warming in insects inhabiting seasonal environments. Nevertheless, numerous species have maintained univoltine (one generation per year) phenology with increasing temperatures, indicating the involvement of phylogenetic, ecological or some other constraints on phenological change. I examined geographic variation in voltinism in moths and butterflies of northern Europe to identify species traits that might predispose species to univoltine/multivoltine phenology. I focused on species with a wide latitudinal distribution range (15 degrees as a minimum) which makes it unlikely that constraints imposed by season length could preclude multivoltinism across their distribution. Almost half of the 731 moth and butterfly species considered appear to have a single generation throughout their entire European range. A univoltine life-cycle across a wide latitudinal gradient suggests the presence of some constraint that makes additional generations either impossible or at least strongly disadvantageous, which will unlikely change with future climate warming. The scattered distribution of univoltine and multivoltine species across the lepidopteran phylogeny indicates that phylogenetic constraints do not strongly limit changes in voltinism, and the trait is open to ecologically-driven adaptive evolution. My data show that species with one generation per year are generally larger than multivoltine species, but size forms no absolute constraint to having multiple generations per year. Obligately univoltine species dominate among egg and adult overwinterers (life-histories typical of so-called spring-feeders), whereas species with capacity for multiple generations prevail among pupal overwinterers. Multivoltinism is also infrequent among species feeding on grasses, particularly in endophagous grass-feeders. Larval diet breadth has no discernible effect on voltinism. Given the diverse ecological consequences of voltinism and its changes, accounting for the species' capacity for multivoltinism may be a key to address future challenges in biodiversity conservation and pest management.

AB  - Rising and more variable global temperatures pose a challenge for biodiversity, with reproduction and fertility being especially sensitive to heat. Here, we assessed the potential for thermal adaptation in sperm and egg function using Tribolium flour beetles, a warm-temperate-tropical insect model. Following temperature increases through adult development, we found opposing gamete responses, with males producing shorter sperm and females laying larger eggs. Importantly, this gamete phenotypic plasticity was adaptive: thermal translocation experiments showed that both sperm and eggs produced in warmer conditions had superior reproductive performance in warmer environments, and vice versa for cooler production conditions and reproductive environments. In warmer environments, gamete plasticity enabled males to double their reproductive success, and females could increase offspring production by one-third. Our results reveal exciting potential for sensitive but vital traits within reproduction to handle increasing and more variable thermal regimes in the natural environment.

AB  - Topshell Tectus pyramis is a coral reef snail of economic and ecological value. This study assessed temperature and salinity tolerance in T. pyramis and the interaction between temperature and salinity on metabolism. The adaptability of T. pyramis was assessed with mortality, respiration, and nitrogen excretion. This study found that snail (T. pyramis) with body sizes of width 60.30 +/- 3.46, 40.12 +/- 2.34, and 20.02 +/- 1.15 mm tolerated temperatures of 15-35, 15-35, and 20-30 degrees C and salinity of 13-38, 18-38, and 23-33 parts per thousand, respectively. It demonstrates that larger snails can adapt better to variations in temperature and salinity. Temperature and salinity have a significant effect on the metabolism of snails. Smaller snails have a higher metabolism and are more sensitive to changes in temperature and salinity. Overall, results suggest that seawater with 30 degrees C temperature and 33 parts per thousand salinity was suitable for T. pyramis.

AB  - A pressing challenge is to determine whether and how global-change drivers influence species physiology and survival. Recently, researchers have proposed the metabolic theory of ecology, defending the hypothesis of a universal thermal dependence of metabolic rate or, alternatively, the metabolic cold adaptation theory, stating that local adaptation can influence the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate. However, the long-term (i.e. multigenerational) consequences of warming for the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate remain largely unexplored although it determines energy use and is crucial for species response to climate change. In this study, we used an evolutionary experiment with medaka fishes Oryzias latipes maintained for more than 12 generations at warm and cold temperatures (30 and 20 degrees C, respectively) to address this issue. Our objective was to investigate whether thermal adaptation influences the relationship between temperature and mass-corrected metabolic rate and how this may occur. In agreement with the universal thermal dependence hypothesis, we found that warming did not significantly influence the thermal sensitivity of mass-corrected metabolic rate: neither the intercept nor the slope of the temperature-metabolic rate relationship differed among fish lineages. Our small-scale laboratory experiment thus indicated that there is limited potential for evolutionary change in medaka fish metabolic rate in response to warmer temperatures. Overall, we provide evidence that 9 years of experimental warming did not influence the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rate. Our results highlight the invariability of the thermal dependence of metabolic rate, which has important implications for adaptation to climate warming. This finding suggests a limited potential for metabolic adaptations in response to long-term temperature changes, which may have negative consequences for the persistence of fish populations under climate change.

AB  - Sexual dimorphism in size or shape is common in many reptile species. Amphisbaenians are morphologically specialized for a fossorial life, which might constrain the evolution of sexual dimorphism. This might explain why some amphisbaenian species, but not others, show some type of sexual dimorphism. To understand the differential occurrence of sexual dimorphism in amphisbaenians, studies on a wide number of species belonging to different families and inhabiting different ecological conditions are needed. We measured several morphological variables in a population of the amphisbaenian Trogonophis wiegmanni, a representative of the little-studied family Trogonophidae from North Africa. Results show that males and females have similar body size; but for individuals of similar size, males are heavier, have longer tails, and have larger heads than do females. These differences might be explained by sexual selection, if males with larger heads had advantages in intrasexual contests, or by sexual diet differences. However, most ecological and behavioral aspects of this and other amphisbaenian species remain poorly known, thereby leaving unresolved which selective pressures are responsible for the sexual dimorphism that was evident in this species.

AB  - Polar bears are susceptible to climate warming because of their dependence on sea ice, which is declining rapidly. We present the first evidence for a genetically distinct and functionally isolated group of polar bears in Southeast Greenland. These bears occupy sea-ice conditions resembling those projected for the High Arctic in the late 21st century, with an annual ice-free period that is >100 days longer than the estimated fasting threshold for the species. Whereas polar bears in most of the Arctic depend on annual sea ice to catch seals, Southeast Greenland bears have a year-round hunting platform in the form of freshwater glacial melange. This suggests that marine-terminating glaciers, although of limited availability, may serve as previously unrecognized climate refugia. Conservation of Southeast Greenland polar bears, which meet criteria for recognition as the world's 20th polar bear subpopulation, is necessary to preserve the genetic diversity and evolutionary potential of the species.

AB  - Previous studies of the phenologies and the different microclimatic patterns of the distribution of the scorpionflies Panorpa communis L. and Panorpa vulgaris Imhoff and Labram 1836 showed different phenological strategies. In P. communis, a species foraging at shadowy and cool places only, a majority of 90% of the individuals are univoltine; however, approximately 10% of the offspring of the first annual generation are bivoltine. This proportion remained unchanged in the Freiburg population over 8 years. Differently, all individuals of P. vulgaris foraging equally frequent at sunny and warm as at shadowy and cool places are bivoltine. The proximate cause of bivoltinism in both species is a heritable variation of different 'day length thresholds' triggering diapause-free development if natural day length exceeds these thresholds. As selection favours maximal temporal exploitation of food availability it remains obscure why in P. communis the number of diapause-free developing individuals does not increase continuously from year to year although this phenotype reproduces twice a year. Therefore, in the present paper, we focus on the following main questions. Does the competitive inferiority of P. communis in the presence of P. vulgaris at the temperature regime of the late summer function as a mechanism maintaining the majority of individuals of P. communis univoltine, by dramatically reducing the fitness of the bivoltine ones? As a long-term evolutionary change in the frequency of bivoltine individuals in P. communis solely depends on the lifetime reproductive success of the females, we here consider the influence of interspecific competition and temperature conditions on the reproductive success of the females of P. communis only. Five lines of evidence suggest that the mechanism of maintaining univoltinism in P. communis is primarily because of differences in the ability of each species to exploit dead arthropod resources: (1) these species show complete diet overlap; (2) dead arthropods are limiting resources for both species of scorpionflies as indicated by positive demographic effects with increased food availability; (3) in competition with P. vulgaris at high temperatures, P. communis is competitively inferior in the ability to detect and exploit dead arthropods; (4) this reduced resource acquisition of female P. communis translates into significant reductions in the survivorship, body condition, fecundity and lifetime reproductive success; (5) exploitation competition does account for these negative demographic effects on second-generation females of P. communis more than interference competition.

AB  - Polistes paper wasps have striking and variable colour patterns. Although these colour patterns are known to function in communication, little is known about how they affect fitness in relation to the abiotic environment. In the present study, we used dried-preserved museum specimens, comprising male and female Polistes from all over the world, aiming to test for a correlation between the body luminance (assessed by digital photography) and environmental temperature (assessed by the available online environmental databases). We found that the female thorax and abdomen are darker (low luminance) in colder compared to warmer environments. In males, however, body luminance is not associated with environmental temperature. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that darker insects have an advantage in colder environments because they can heat faster than lighter ones (thermal melanism hypothesis). By showing that melanic Polistes inhabit cooler areas more than the brighter species, we presume that selection for effective heating may provide an adaptive explanation for the evolution of Polistes colour diversity.

AB  - The 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm) viruses have evolved to contain an E47K substitution in the HA2 subunit of the stalk region of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. The biological significance of this single amino acid change was investigated by comparing A/California/7/2009 (HA2-E47) with a later strain, A/Brisbane/10/2010 (HA2-K47). The E47K change was found to reduce the threshold pH for membrane fusion from 5.4 to 5.0. An inter-monomer salt bridge between K47 in HA2 and E21 in HA1, a neighboring highly conserved residue, which stabilized the trimer structure, was found to be responsible for the reduced threshold pH for fusion. The higher structural and acid stability of the HA trimer caused by the E47K change also conferred higher viral thermal stability and infectivity in ferrets, suggesting a fitness advantage for the E47K evolutionary change in humans. Our study indicated that the pH of HA fusion activation is an important factor for influenza virus replication and host adaptation. The identification of this genetic signature in the HA stalk region that influences vaccine virus thermal stability also has significant implications for influenza vaccine production.
   Author Summary Influenza viruses cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics, representing a threat to public health. The trimeric hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein mediates viral entry and plays important roles in viral host restriction, transmission and pathogenesis. The HA protein binds to the receptor on the cell via the head region, and mediates the low pH-triggered viral and cellular membrane fusion via the stalk region. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pm) viruses have been circulating in humans since 2009. A single amino acid change was found in the stalk region of recent H1N1pdm strains. In this study, we revealed that this amino acid change, by stabilizing the trimer structure, lowered the pH for fusion and exhibited a higher acid stability. Accordingly, the H1N1pdm with this change showed higher thermal stability after high temperature treatment. Furthermore, the H1N1pdm with this change had higher infectivity in ferrets, suggesting that recent H1N1pdm viruses have evolved to be more adapted in humans. Our data not only indicate the importance of the fusion activation pH to viral replication and host adaptation, but also provide solutions to improve the shelf-life of live vaccines in vaccine manufacture.

AB  - Daily consumption was estimated from the stomach contents of walleyes Sander vitreus collected weekly from Oneida Lake, New York, during June-October 1975, 1992, 1993, and 1994 for one to four age-groups per year. Field rations were highly variable between weeks, and trends in ration size varied both seasonally and annually. The coefficient of variation for weekly field rations within years and ages ranged from 45% to 97%. Field estimates were compared with simulated consumption from a bioenergetics model. The simulation averages of daily ration deviated from those of the field estimates by -20.1% to +70.3%, with a mean across all simulations of +14.3%. The deviations for each time step were much greater than those for the simulation averages, ranging from -92.8% to +363.6%. A systematic trend in the deviations was observed, the model producing overpredictions at rations less than 3.7% of body weight. Analysis of variance indicated that the deviations were affected by sample year and week but not age. Multiple linear regression using backwards selection procedures and Akaike's information criterion indicated that walleye weight, walleye growth, lake temperature, prey energy density, and the proportion of gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum in the diet significantly affected the deviations between simulated and field rations and explained 32% of the variance.

AB  - Introduction Organisms use environmental cues to match their phenotype with the future availability of resources and environmental conditions. Changes in the magnitude and frequency of environmental cues such as photoperiod and temperature along latitudes can be used by organisms to predict seasonal changes. While the role of temperature variation on the induction of plastic and seasonal responses is well established, the importance of photoperiod for predicting seasonal changes is less explored. Materials and methods Here we studied changes in life-history and thermal stress resistance traits in Drosophila subobscura in response to variation in photoperiod (6:18, 12:12 and 18:6 light:dark cycles) mimicking seasonal variations in day length. The populations of D. subobscura were collected from five locations along a latitudinal gradient (from North Africa and Europe). These populations were exposed to different photoperiods for two generations, whereafter egg-to-adult viability, productivity, dry body weight, thermal tolerance, and starvation resistance were assessed. Results We found strong effects of photoperiod, origin of populations, and their interactions on life-history and stress resistance traits. Thermal resistance varied between the populations and the effect of photoperiod depended on the trait and the method applied for the assessment of thermal resistance. Perspectives Our results show a strong effect of the origin of population and photoperiod on a range of fitness-related traits and provide evidence for local adaptation to environmental cues (photoperiod by population interaction). The findings emphasize an important and often neglected role of photoperiod in studies on thermal resistance and suggest that cues induced by photoperiod may provide some buffer enabling populations to cope with a more variable and unpredictable future climate.

AB  - Understanding the effects of temperature on ecological and evolutionary processes is crucial for generating future climate adaptation scenarios. Using experimental evolution, we evolved the model ciliateTetrahymena thermophilain an initially novel high temperature environment for more than 35 generations, closely monitoring population dynamics and morphological changes. We observed initially long lag phases in the high temperature environment that over about 26 generations reduced to no lag phase, a strong reduction in cell size and modifications in cell shape at high temperature. When exposing the adapted populations to their original temperature, most phenotypic traits returned to the observed levels in the ancestral populations, indicating phenotypic plasticity is an important component of this species thermal stress response. However, persistent changes in cell size were detected, indicating possible costs related to the adaptation process. Exploring the molecular basis of thermal adaptation will help clarify the mechanisms driving these phenotypic responses.

AB  - Sex-specific plasticity can profoundly affect sexual size dimorphism (SSD), but its influence in female-larger-SSD vertebrates remains obscure. Theory predicts that sex-specific plasticity may drive SSD evolution if the larger sex benefits from optimal-growth conditions when available (condition-dependent hypothesis), or if attaining a suboptimal size is penalized by selection (adaptive canalization hypothesis). Sex-specific plasticity enhances the size of the larger sex in male-larger-SSD turtles but whether the same occurs in female-larger species is unknown. Sexual shape dimorphism (SShD) is also widespread in nature but is understudied, and whether SShD derives from sex-specific responses to identical selective pressures or from sex-specific selection remains unclear. Here we tested whether sex-specific growth plasticity underlies the development of sexual size and shape dimorphism in the female-larger-SSD turtle, Podocnemis expansa. Individuals hatched from several incubation temperatures and were raised under common-garden conditions with varying temperature and resources. Body size and shape were plastic and sexually dimorphic, but plasticity did not differ between the sexes, opposite to the male-larger turtle Chelydra serpentina. Maternal effects (egg size) were significant on size and shape, suggesting that females increase their fitness by allocating greater energy to enhance offspring growth. Results ruled out the sex-specific plasticity hypotheses in P. expansa, indicating that SSD and SShD do not derive form differential responses to identical drivers but from sex-specific selective pressures. Our results indicate that differential plasticity does not favor males inherently, nor the larger sex, as would be expected if it was a pervasive driver of macroevolutionary patterns of sexual dimorphism across turtle lineages.

AB  - Due to its small body size, which in the case of prematurity is associated with increased skin permeability and incomplete brown fat development, the human neonate is highly prone to heat loss. Hence, thermal protection is mandatory to prevent neonatal hypothermia with its adverse metabolic and hemodynamic effects. This is usually attempted by the selection of "thermoneutral" ambient temperatures to maintain core temperature constant without regulatory metabolic increase. Since, however, core temperature decreases only after metabolic increase has failed to counteract heat loss, and metabolic increase in its turn is preceded by peripheral vasoconstriction, recording of thermal gradients between core and peripheral temperatures has now proven superior in early detection of thermal stress and maintenance of thermal comfort in the neonate. The longlasting thermal lability of preterm babies partly results from the fact that an elevated basal metabolic rate, which in term neonates compensates for the small body size, is only achieved with delay. As this is correlated to the growth retardation typical of prematurity, the postnatal metabolic increase is usually considered to be a precondition for growth. However, a comparative calorimetric investigation has revealed thar in a marsupial species normally born in a very immature state, a rapid weight increase occurs at a low metabolic rate. Obviously, these animals retain a growth efficiency which in humans is confined to intrauterine life and interrupted by preterm birth. Moreover, their low O-2 consumption rate is adaptive to restricted respiratory surface area and incomplete tissue vascularization and contributes to hypoxia tolerance. Therefore, although postnatal metabolic increase promotes thermal stability and weight increase in term and slightly preterm human neonates, metabolic reduction may be the more appropriate strategy in cases where O-2 and substrate supply are limited by extreme immaturity. As long as the factors mediating natural metabolic suppression are unknown, careful thermal protection seems to be one of the most promising ways to prevent uneconomic metabolic activation in highly preterm human neonates.

AB  - Previous research on developmentally plastic responses by reptile embryos has paid relatively little attention to tropical species, or to possible interactions between the effects of thermal and hydric regimes. In the present study, eggs of keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii), from a tropical area with strong temporal and spatial variation in soil temperatures and moisture levels, were incubated. The phenotypic traits of hatchling snakes (body size, shape, muscular strength) were affected by moisture content of the incubation medium (vermiculite plus 100% vs. 50% water by mass), by mean incubation temperatures (25.7 vs. 27.9 degrees C) and by diel thermal variation (diel range 6.0 vs. 8.4 degrees C). Interactions between these factors were negligible. Cooler, more thermostable, moister conditions resulted in larger offspring, a trait under strong selection in this population. Thermal and hydric conditions covary in potential nest-sites (e.g. deeper nests are more thermostable as well as moister). This covariation may influence the evolution of reaction norms for embryogenesis. For example, if moister nests enhance offspring fitness and are cooler, then selection will favour the ability to develop in cool as well as moist conditions. Thus, the evolution of optimal incubation conditions with respect to one variable (e.g. temperature) may be driven by patterns of association with another variable (e.g. soil moisture) among natural nest-sites. Perhaps for this reason, the thermal optimum for incubation is surprisingly low in this tropical species.

AB  - We tested for variation in longevity, senescence rate and early fecundity of Drosophila buzzatii along an elevational transect in Argentina, using laboratory-reared flies in laboratory tests performed to avoid extrinsic mortality. At 25 degrees C, females from lowland populations lived longer and had a lower demographic rate of senescence than females from highland populations. Minimal instead of maximal temperature at the sites of origin of population best predicted this cline. A very different pattern was found at higher test temperature. At 29.5 degrees C, longevity of males increased with altitude of origin of population. No clinal trend was apparent for longevity of females at 29.5 degrees C. There was evidence for a trade-off between early fecundity and longevity at non-stressful temperature (25 degrees C) along the altitudinal gradient. This trait association is consistent with evolutionary theories of aging. Population-by-temperature and sex-by-temperature interactions indicate that senescence patterns are expressed in environment specific ways.

AB  - AimThe evolutionary speed hypothesis is a mechanistic explanation for the latitudinal biodiversity gradient. The recently extended integrated evolutionary speed hypothesis (IESH) proposes that temperature, water availability, population size and spatial heterogeneity influence the rate of molecular evolution which, in turn, affects diversification. However, the evidence for some of the associations predicted by the IESH is not conclusive, and in some cases is contradictory.
   LocationThe Neotropics.
   MethodsUsing a comparative Bayesian method we tested the following predictions of the IESH: the association between the rate of molecular evolution and temperature (and elevation and latitude, as proxies), water availability (using precipitation and relative humidity as proxies), productivity and rate of diversification. We also accounted for the potential confounding effects of body size and UVB radiation. We tested these predictions separately in mitochondrial and nuclear genes.
   ResultsSubstitution rates of mitochondrial and nuclear genes were positively associated with temperature and negatively with elevation, while only the mitochondrial coding gene rate was associated with UVB radiation. However, when controlling for temperature, the association between substitution rate and elevation and UVB radiation disappeared, while a negative association with precipitation emerged. Moreover, diversification events were positively correlated with the rate of molecular evolution but only in mitochondrial genes.
   Main conclusionsOur results support two key predictions of the IESH. They highlight the important association between rate of molecular evolution and temperature within a recently diverged group and also confirm the positive association between molecular evolution and diversification rate, although only in mitochondrial genes. However, the lack of association between diversification and temperature and the low effect size of the relationship between substitution rates and diversification in mitochondrial genes emphasize the important role other factors, such as time, spatial heterogeneity and population size might have in the origin and maintenance of the latitudinal biodiversity gradient.

AB  - The Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus species complex has been shown to be exceptionally vulnerable to rapid abiotic and biotic changes. Salvelinus alpinus, however, inhabit environmental extremes ranging from lakes and rivers in the High Arctic to deep multi-fish species lakes far outside the polar region. Long-term responses to post-glacial environmental variations and successively increased interspecific interactions reveal an essential degree of natural ecological resilience and phenotypic flexibility. Case studies in Scandinavia and Newfoundland illustrate the alternate trophic roles of S. alpinus, and its flexible niche use and life-history changes in order to regain or maintain body size in gradients of lakes with increasing fish species diversity. While allopatric in northern low-productive upland lakes, landlocked populations are commonly structured by cannibalism. In sympatry with other fish species, S. alpinus mostly serve as prey, with their decreasing growth and body size reflecting the successive diet shift from littoral macro-benthos to zooplankton and profundal microbenthos as interspecific competition for food and habitat intensifies. Interactions with natural and introduced superior zooplankton feeders and ultimate predators finally become detrimental. Consequently, the niche of S. alpinus is increasingly compressed in lakes along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, although certain natural key conditions offer S. alpinus temporary asylum in the inescapable process towards local and regional extinction. The water temperature drop during winter allows S. alpinus to temporarily resume the richer littoral dietary and spatial niche use in low diversity lakes. In southern lowland and coastal lakes with more complex fish communities, access to key prey species such as profundal macro-crustaceans and smelt Osmerus spp. allow S. alpinus to regain its original niche space and characteristics as a large piscivore. In conclusion, S. alpinus along its evolutionary landscape demonstrates associated alterations of life-history characteristics, such as body size and longevity, and thus reproductive traits demonstrating similarities between northern cannibals and southern piscivores. Although including a high degree of natural resilience, obviously differing among S. alpinus populations along its range, differences seen in extreme marginal populations may have been adaptive and the product of an evolutionary response with optimized growth resulting from natural selection due to ultimate intra or inter-specific competition and predation.

AB  - Diversity patterns of ammonoids are analyzed and compared with the timing of anoxic deposits around the Cenomanian/Turonian (C/T) boundary in the Vocontian, Anglo-Paris, and Monster basins of Western Europe. Differing from most previous studies, which concentrate on a narrow time span bracketing the C/T boundary, the present analysis covers the latest Albian to Early Turonian interval for which a high resolution, ammonoid-based biochronology, including 34 Unitary Associations zones, is now available. During the latest Albian-Middle Cenomanian interval, species richness of ammonoids reveals a dynamical equilibrium oscillating around an average of 20 species, whereas the Late Cenomanian-Early Turonian interval displays an equilibrium centered on an average value of 6 species. The abrupt transition between these two successive equilibria lasted no longer than two Unitary Associations. The onset of the decline of species richness thus largely predates the spread of oxygen-poor water masses onto the shelves, while minimal values of species richness coincide with the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary only. The decline of species richness during the entire Late Cenomanian seems to result from lower origination percentages rather than from higher extinction percentages. This result is also supported by the absence of statistically significant changes in the extinction probabilities of the poly-cohorts. Separate analyses of species richness for acanthoceratids and heteromorphs, the two essential components of the Cenomanian ammonoid community, reveal that heteromorphs declined sooner than acanthoceratids. Moreover, acanthoceratids showed a later decline at the genus level than at the species level. Such a decoupling is accompanied by a significant increase in morphological disparity of acanthoceratids, which is expressed by the appearance of new genera. Last, during the Late Cenomanian, paedomorphic processes, juvenile innovations and reductions of adult size dominated the evolutionary radiation of acanthoceratids. Hence, the decrease in ammonoid species richness and their major evolutionary changes significantly predates the spread of anoxic deposits. Other environmental constraints such as global flooding of platforms, warmer and more equable climate, as well as productivity changes better correlate with the timing of diversity changes and evolutionary patterns of ammonoids and therefore, provide more likely causative mechanisms than anoxia alone.

AB  - Locomotor performance of spontaneously foraging tent caterpillars (Malacosoma americanum) was videotaped under various thermal conditions as growing colonies progressed from the third through the sixth larval instars. Stride length and, therefore, speed increased with increasing body size. Speed and stride frequency were strongly temperature-dependent (Q10 of 2.2 and 1.9), whereas stride length was less affected by temperature (R10 of 1.2). Tent caterpillars showed little convergence between temperature preferences and thermal physiology; most of their foraging activity occurs at temperatures that greatly reduce locomotor performance. The absolute slowness of caterpillar locomotion appears to have favored an activity pattern in M. americanum that is based on temporal avoidance of predators. The absence of predators during nocturnal foraging bas apparently resulted in little selective pressure for a thermal physiology, which promotes relatively rapid locomotion at low body temperatures.

AB  - The warmer regions harbour more species, attributable to accelerated speciation and increased ecological opportunities for coexistence. While correlations between temperature and energy availability and habitat area have been suggested as major drivers of these biodiversity patterns, temperature can theoretically also have direct effects on the evolution of diversity. Here, we experimentally studied the evolution of diversity in a model adaptive radiation of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens across a temperature gradient. Diversification increased at higher temperatures, driven by both faster generation of genetic variation and stronger diversifying selection. Specifically, low temperatures could limit the generation of diversity, suggested by the observation that supply of genetic variation through immigration increased diversity at low, but not high temperatures. The two major determinants of mutation supply, population size and mutation rate, both showed a positive temperature dependence. Stronger diversifying selection in warmer environments was suggested by promoted coexistence, and further explicitly inferred by the ability of evolved phenotypes to invade the ancestral type from rare. We discuss possible physiological and environmental mechanisms underlying the findings, most of which are likely to be general.

AB  - We measured temperature preferences of 12 species of hylid frogs (Litoria and Cyclorana) from northern Australia in a laboratory thermal gradient. These species represented a range of ecological habitat use (aquatic, terrestrial, arboreal), adult body size (0.5-60 g), and cutaneous resistance to water loss (R-c = 0.6-63.1 s cm(-1)). We found significant differences among species in selected skin temperature and gradient temperature but not in the variances of these measures ( an index of precision of temperature selection). The species' differences correlated significantly with cutaneous resistance to water loss, with more-resistant frogs selecting higher skin and substrate temperatures in the thermal gradient, even after phylogenetic relationships are taken into account. Because cutaneous resistance to water loss also correlates with ecological habit ( arboreal > terrestrial > aquatic), we suggest that their higher resistance to water loss allows arboreal and terrestrial species better ability to tolerate high temperatures, where growth or locomotory speed may be higher, without the associated risk of desiccation.

AB  - The behavioral responses of fishes to temperature variation have received less attention than physiological responses, despite their direct implications for predator-prey dynamics in aquatic ecosystems. In this paper, we describe the temperature dependence of swimming performance and behavioral characteristics of juvenile Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus; 75-125 mm total length). Maximum swimming speeds increased with temperature and body size. Routine swimming speeds of Pacific cod in small groups of similarly sized fish (N = 6) increased with body size and were 34 % faster at 9 A degrees C than at 2 A degrees C. The response to temperature was opposite that previously described for juvenile walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), reflecting species-specific differences in behavioral responses. In a separate experiment, we demonstrated the effect of temperature on habitat selection of juvenile Pacific cod: Use of an artificial eelgrass patch in a 5-m-long laboratory tank was significantly greater at 9 A degrees C than at 2 A degrees C. These results illustrate that temperature affects a range of behavioral traits that play important roles in determining the frequency and outcomes of predator-prey interactions.

However, the morphological variations of spiders living in the same habitats across different seasons have not been reported. In this study, we used the wolf spider, Pardosa astrigera, as a model to determine seasonal differences in adult body size, melanism, fecundity, and egg diameter both in the overwintering and the first generation for 2010 and 2016. The results showed that in 2010, both females and males of the overwintering generation were significantly darker than the first generation. Moreover, the overwintering females were markedly larger and produced more and bigger eggs than the first generation in both 2010 and 2016. Considering the overwintering P.astrigera experiencing low temperature and/or desiccation stress, these results suggest that substantially darker and larger body of the overwintering generation is adaptive to adverse conditions.

AB  - Mutation is the source of genetic variation and the fundament of evolution. Temperature has long been suggested to have a direct impact on realized spontaneous mutation rates. If mutation rates vary in response to environmental conditions, such as the variation of the ambient temperature through space and time, they should no longer be described as species-specific constants. By combining mutation accumulation with whole-genome sequencing in a multicellular organism, we provide empirical support to reject the null hypothesis of a constant, temperature-independent mutation rate. Instead, mutation rates depended on temperature in a U-shaped manner with increasing rates toward both temperature extremes. This relation has important implications for mutation-dependent processes in molecular evolution, processes shaping the evolution of mutation rates, and even the evolution of biodiversity as such.

AB  - We compared the reproductive phenology and tadpole thermal physiology of two populations of Buergeria japonica in Taiwan. The population in Jentse breeds in a geothermal hot spring whose water is a warm, over 35 degreesC year-round, whereas the population in Chukou breeds in a stream whose water temperature is closely correlated with fluctuations in air temperature and averages 23 degreesC. The B. japonica population in Jentse breeds year-round, but the Chukou population breeds only from March to October. Tadpoles from Jentse that reared at 32 degreesC attained larger sizes than tadpoles from Chukou that reared at 32 degreesC, whereas tadpoles from both sites attained similar body size when reared at 22 degreesC. Chukou tadpoles reared at 40 degreesC died within 1-2 d, whereas Jentse tadpoles survived for 9 d at 40 degreesC. All tadpoles tolerated heat well, but Jentse tadpoles had higher critical thermal maxima (CTMax) than Chukou tadpoles. Tadpoles from Jentse showed no metabolic compensation but those from Chukou showed an "inverse" metabolic compensation. Results suggest that B. japonica that breed in the geothermal hot spring has a prolonged breeding season, high growth rates and the reduction or absence of intra- and inter-specific competition. Evolution of a high level of heat tolerance and, possibly, behavioral temperature selection, enable tadpoles in the hotsprings to offset the thermal stress imposed by warm water.

AB  - Thermal performance curves (TPCs) provide a powerful framework for studying the evolution of continuous reaction norms and for testing hypotheses of thermal adaptation. Although featured heavily in comparative studies, the framework has been comparatively underutilized for quantitative genetic tests of thermal adaptation. We assayed the distribution of genetic (co)variance for TPC (locomotor activity) within and among three natural populations of Drosophila serrata and performed replicated tests of two hypotheses of thermal adaptation - that 'hotter is better' and that a generalist-specialist trade-off underpins the evolution of thermal sensitivity. We detected significant genetic variance within, and divergence among, populations. The 'hotter is better' hypothesis was not supported as the genetic correlations between optimal temperature (T-opt) and maximum performance (z(max)) were consistently negative. A pattern of variation consistent with a generalist-specialist trade-off was detected within populations and divergence among populations indicated that performance curves were narrower and had higher optimal temperatures in the warmer, but less variable tropical population.

AB  - Large portions of anadromous salmonid habitat in the western United States has been lost because of dams and other blockages. This loss has the potential to affect salmonid evolution through natural selection if the loss is biased, affecting certain types of habitat differentially, and if phenotypic traits correlated with those habitat types are heritable. Habitat loss can also affect salmonid evolution indirectly, by reducing genetic variation and changing its distribution within and among populations. In this paper, we compare the characteristics of lost habitats with currently accessible habitats and review the heritability of traits which show correlations with habitat/environmental gradients. We find that although there is some regional variation, inaccessible habitats tend to be higher in elevation, wetter and both warmer in the summer and colder in the winter than habitats currently available to anadromous salmonids. We present several case studies that demonstrate either a change in phenotypic or life history expression or an apparent reduction in genetic variation associated with habitat blockages. These results suggest that loss of habitat will alter evolutionary trajectories in salmonid populations and Evolutionarily Significant Units. Changes in both selective regime and standing genetic diversity might affect the ability of these taxa to respond to subsequent environmental perturbations. Both natural and anthropogenic and should be considered seriously in developing management and conservation strategies.

AB  - The annual cycles of Euterpina acutifrons Dana (Copepoda: Harpacticoida) are compared in two temperate regions: the Gulf of San Matias (Argentina) and the Gulf of Marseilles (France). The analysis of the generations was determined on the basis of two main criteria: the peaks of relative abundance of copepods I and V, and changes in the modal size-class of the adults. Fluctuations in abundance of the developmental stages with time, the sex ratio and the percentage of ovigerous females were also examined to distinguish between the generations with greater precision. In the two areas, seven generations were identified over the course of the year, with a duration between 23 and 85 days at San Matias, and between 31 and 72 days at Marseilles, depending on the season. The occurrence of naupliar peaks appears to be mainly associated with seasonal phytoplankton blooms in both populations. At San Matias, the species disappears from the plankton in winter. whereas at Marseilles it is permanently present. The influence of temperature on size seems to be more significant at San Matias than at Marseilles where other factors, food supply in particular, might also play a role. The differences of seasonal cycle between the two populations might result from the fact that the annual temperature range is smaller at San Matias, with minima below the threshold of tolerance of the species.

AB  - Median timing of reproduction in salmonid populations is generally consistent among years, reflecting long-term patterns of natural selection from characteristics of the local environment. However, altered selection from factors related to climate change or human intervention might shift timing over generations, with implications for the population's persistence. To study these processes, we modeled median timing of redd (nest) counts as an index of spawning timing by natural-origin Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Skagit River system in Washington State, USA. Over the last 2-6 decades, natural-origin salmon have been spawning later by 0.03-0.52 days.year(-1), while a naturally spawning group that is influenced by strays from a hatchery has been spawning earlier by 0.19 days.year(-1). Trends in the spawning timing of hatchery-origin strays may reflect opposing selection from the hatchery, where egg take for propagation has become earlier by 0.58 days.year(-1). As mean August river temperatures have risen over the period of record, hatchery timing trends may be moving in the opposite direction from the plastic or adaptive patterns expressed by natural-origin fish.

AB  - Geographic dines offer insights about putative targets and agents of natural selection as well as tempo and mode of adaptation. However, demographic processes can lead to dines that are indistinguishable from adaptive divergence. Using the widespread yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera: Scathophagidae), we examine quantitative genetic differentiation (Q(ST)) of wing shape across North America, Europe, and Japan, and compare this differentiation with that of ten microsatellites (F-ST). Morphometric analyses of 28 populations reared at three temperatures revealed significant thermal plasticity, sexual dimorphism, and geographic differentiation in wing shape. In North America morphological differentiation followed the decline in microsatellite variability along the presumed route of recent colonization from the southeast to the northwest. Across Europe, where S. stercoraria presumably existed for much longer time and where no molecular pattern of isolation by distance was evident, clinal variation was less pronounced despite significant morphological differentiation (Q(ST) >F-ST). Shape vector comparisons further indicate that thermal plasticity (hot-to-cold) does not mirror patterns of latitudinal divergence (south-to-north), as might have been expected under a scenario with temperature as the major agent of selection. Our findings illustrate the importance of detailed phylogeographic information when interpreting geographic dines of dispersal traits in an adaptive evolutionary framework.

AB  - Background: Organisms may respond to environmental change by means of genetic adaptation, phenotypic plasticity or both, which may result in genotype-environment interactions (G x E) if genotypes differ in their phenotypic response. We here specifically target the latter source of variation (i.e. G x E) by comparing plastic responses among lines of the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana that had been selected for increased cold tolerance and according controls. Our main aim here was to test the hypothesis that directional selection on cold tolerance will interfere with plastic capacities.
   Results: Plastic responses to temperature and feeding treatments were strong, with e. g. higher compared to lower temperatures reducing cold tolerance, longevity, pupal mass, and development time. We report a number of statistically significant genotype-environment interactions (i.e. interactions between selection regime and environmental variables), but most of these were not consistent across treatment groups. We found some evidence though for larger plastic responses to different rearing temperatures in the selection compared to the control lines, while plastic responses to different adult temperatures and feeding treatments were overall very similar across selection regimes.
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that plastic capacities are not always constrained by directional selection (on cold tolerance) and therefore genetic changes in trait means, but may operate independently.

AB  - Marine planktonic diatoms export carbon to the deep ocean, playing a key role in the global carbon cycle. Although commonly thought to have diversified over the Cenozoic as global oceans cooled, only two conflicting quantitative reconstructions exist, both from the Neptune deep-sea microfossil occurrences database. Total diversity shows Cenozoic increase but is sample size biased; conventional subsampling shows little net change. We calculate diversity from a separately compiled new diatom species range catalog, and recalculate Neptune subsampled-in-bin diversity using new methods to correct for increasing Cenozoic geographic endemism and decreasing Cenozoic evenness. We find coherent, substantial Cenozoic diversification in both datasets. Many living cold water species, including species important for export productivity, originate only in the latest Miocene or younger. We make a first quantitative comparison of diatom diversity to the global Cenozoic benthic delta O-18 (climate) and carbon cycle records (delta C-13, and 20-0 Ma pCO(2)). Warmer climates are strongly correlated with lower diatom diversity (raw: rho=.92, p<.001; detrended, r=.6, p=.01). Diatoms were 20% less diverse in the early late Miocene, when temperatures and pCO(2) were only moderately higher than today. Diversity is strongly correlated to both delta C-13 and pCO(2) over the last 15 my (for both: r>.9, detrended r>.6, all p<.001), but only weakly over the earlier Cenozoic, suggesting increasingly strong linkage of diatom and climate evolution in the Neogene. Our results suggest that many living marine planktonic diatom species may be at risk of extinction in future warm oceans, with an unknown but potentially substantial negative impact on the ocean biologic pump and oceanic carbon sequestration. We cannot however extrapolate our my-scale correlations with generic climate proxies to anthropogenic time-scales of warming without additional species-specific information on proximate ecologic controls.

AB  - In the presence of a vertical thermal gradient, juvenile three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus and minnows Phoxinus phoxinus positioned themselves higher in the water column compared with adult conspecifics. This result was consistent regardless of whether age cohorts were tested separately or together. Furthermore, juveniles but not adult fishes positioned themselves higher in water column in the presence of a thermal gradient compared with those in the absence of a thermal gradient. Juvenile G. aculeatus and adult fish of both species did opt to position themselves higher in the water column in the hours immediately following a feeding event relative to their positions in the same gradient when they had not fed.

AB  - Air conditioning is widely applied for the improvement of standard of living in human life. This present investigation focused on the prediction of indoor air quality characteristics of air conditioned car using fuzzy logic algorithm. The conditioned space was selected and the experiments were planned as per design of experiments to study the effect of human load, fresh air supply and air velocity on the human comfort conditions. The mathematical models were developed to predict the comfort conditions, namely temperature, CO2 level and relative humidity over a specified range of input conditions. Carbon dioxide exhalation rate differs person to person based on their body weight and burning rate of calories, etc. Fuzzy logic predicted the intermediate response of IAQ parameters for varying input conditions in this present investigation. The proposed multi response fuzzy model predicted better results comparing with nonlinear regression models. The absolute error percentage of fuzzy model for carbon dioxide level, temperature and relative humidity is 2.05%, 3.81 % & 2.24 % respectively.

AB  - Climate change will alter the distribution and abundance of many species, including those of concern to human health. Accurate predictions of these impacts must be based on an understanding of the mechanistic links between climate and organisms, and a consideration of evolutionary responses.
   Here we use biophysical models of energy and mass transfer to predict climatic impacts on the potential range of the dengue fever vector, Aedes aegypti, in Australia. We develop a first-principles approach to calculate water depth and daily temperature cycles in containers differing in size, catchment and degree of shading to assess habitat suitability for the aquatic life cycle phase. We also develop a method to predict potential climatic impacts on the evolutionary response of traits limiting distribution.
   Our predictions show strong correspondence with the current and historical distribution and abundance of Ae. aegypti in Australia, suggesting that inland and northern limits are set by water availability and egg desiccation resistance, and southern limits by adult and larval cold tolerance.
   While we predict that climate change will directly increase habitat suitability throughout much of Australia, the potential indirect impact of changed water storage practices by humans in response to drought may have a greater effect.
   In northern Australia, we show that evolutionary changes in egg desiccation resistance could potentially increase the chances of establishment in a major centre (Darwin) under climate change.
   Our study demonstrates how biophysical models of climate-animal interactions can be applied to make decisions about managing biotic responses to climate change. Mechanistic models of the kind we apply here can provide more robust and general predictions than correlative analyses. They can also explicitly incorporate evolutionary responses, the outcomes of which may significantly alter management decisions.

AB  - The relative influences of extrinsic compared to intrinsic drivers of evolutionary change have long been theorized and debated in the fossil record. Ecological recoveries from mass extinction events present records in which to examine these contrasts. Competition in a low diversity world, reproductive strategy, reconstruction of trophic systems and ecological specialization represent possible intrinsic controls on diversification. Feedback between diversity and abundance shifts of marine organisms with biogeochemical cycling and environmental conditions act as extrinsic controls on recovery process and rate. Disentangling these evolutionary pressures is a major challenge for understanding evolutionary recovery from mass extinction.
   The end-Permian mass extinction (251.88 Ma) represents the largest mass extinction in Earth history and led to an extended recovery interval which lasted the duration of the Early Triassic (similar to 4.8 Myr) and beyond. Recent analyses suggest that the survivors of the mass extinction were biased toward organisms with higher metabolic rates that were more resilient against the volatile environmental changes that pervaded the Early Triassic including extreme temperature events, low pH, and low oxygen conditions. We use the Early Triassic recovery of gastropods, echinoids, and ammonoids to examine the processes of taxonomic and ecological evolution in response to, or in spite of, extrinsic environmental perturbations.
   The case studies of benthic gastropods and echinoids, when compared to pelagic ammonoids reflect similarities and differences in recovery following the end-Permian mass extinction. Gastropods and echinoids exhibit evidence of strong extrinsic environmental limitations which implicate the availability of refugia as a control on recovery. Low initial taxonomic diversity of survivors may have also limited the evolutionary recovery of both clades. Abundant and diverse microgastropod assemblages are interpreted as an adaptation to extreme environmental conditions. The morphological diversity of disarticulated echinoid spines and plates described in the southwestern United States, and examination of phylogenetic ghost lineages hints at a significant "hidden diversity" of Early Triassic echinoids. Ammonoids experienced taxonomic resets but are shown to be resilient to repeated environmental perturbations in the Boreal Ocean over the duration of the Early Triassic. Ammonoids may have adapted to persistent latitudinal temperature gradients and oxygen minimum zones that developed in the Early Triassic ocean basins.

AB  - Females of Dawson's burrowing bee (Amegilla dawsoni) are receptive to the males as they emerge but have become unreceptive by the time they begin to nest. in addition, there is a single emergence period per year lasting about a month. These factors are predicted to lead to protandry and males of Dawson's burrowing bee do tend to emerge earlier in the annual flight season than females. Moreover, even during a single day, emerging males tend to precede females. The degree of protandry, however, is size-dependent, with smaller males tending to precede larger ones, both over the course of the flight season and on any given day. Because small males are at a disadvantage in the fights that occur for females, the earlier emergence of minor males may be a sexually selected response that reduces the likelihood that they will be displaced from potential mates by larger rivals.

AB  - Genetic parameters of growth, reproductive efficiency and survival are important for designing successful genetic improvement programmes. In this study, a database was assembled and a meta-analysis was conducted using 87 peer-reviewed published studies on genetic parameters of 63 economically important traits reported across nine major farmed shrimp species. A total of 641 estimates of heritability, 978 estimates of genetic correlations and 658 estimates of phenotypic correlations were included in this study. Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) was the most widely reported species followed by giant freshwater prawn (Marcobrachium rosenbergii) and black tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon). Published studies demonstrate large variability across heritability and correlation estimates. Consensus estimates were based on both unweighted and weighted averages. The traits were broadly classed into weight, morphology, growth rate, body composition, feeding efficiency, reproductive efficiency and survival. This meta-analysis revealed moderate-to-high heritability estimates for weight (0.30 +/- 0.002), morphological (0.26 +/- 0.003), growth rate (0.27 +/- 0.01) and feeding efficiency (0.58 +/- 0.07) traits, but low for body composition (0.06 +/- 0.009), reproductive efficiency (0.11 +/- 0.006) and survival traits (0.15 +/- 0.003). Strong responses to selection were found among the shrimp species studied. We have developed a ShinyApp () for visualization of the individual heritability estimates. In addition to the meta-analysis of genetic parameters, we have calculated the correlated responses among economically important traits and highlighted response to selection, realized heritability, social interaction and common environmental effects in shrimp breeding programmes in terms of industry implications. Consensus estimates suggest that there is sufficient additive genetic variation to carry out effective genetic improvement programmes in these species.

AB  - Since predation is a strong selection pressure on prey, the later have evolved a variety of anti-predator behavior. Death-feigning is thought as one of anti-predator behaviors to escape from predation by temporarily stopping movement and appearing to be dead. Previous studies have shown that the duration and frequency of death-feigning varies with temperature. Body color may also affect those parameters through thermal adaptation, as body color would have a significant relationship with temperature adaptation. A ladybug, Harmonia axyridis, shows a polymorphism in elytral color, which is controlled by 12 alleles on a single locus. The elytral color can be divided into 1) red with black spots (Red type; R) and 2) black with red spots (Black type; B). Here, we show that the duration of death-feigning in B was correlated positively with temperature whereas that in R was correlated negatively with temperature. The evolutionary reasons for this difference require further study in terms of the trade-off between the opportunity cost associated with death-feigning and the benefit of the duration of death-feigning.

AB  - Biology of Ischyrocerus anguipes amphipods associated with the red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) was studied in Dalnezelenetskii Bay (the southern Barents Sea) in summer periods of 2004-2007 High levels of both prevalence (15 0%) and mean intensity (6 9 +/- 1 1 ind) of amphipods on the hosts were found The absence of negative impacts indicates the commensal relationships between amphipods and crabs The sex ratio (females males) in the I anguipes population was 2 1 The average body size of females was higher than that of males The size at 50% morphometric maturity for females of summer generations was calculated at 3 4 mm Some differences in biological features of associated amphipods and free-living individuals (data obtained in the 1940s-1950s) were found and may be explained both by changes in hydrological conditions of the Barents Sea (increase in water temperature) and advantages of dwelling on the crab (protection from predators and distribution)

AB  - The common endemic Australian freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium australiense is recognised as having potential as a culture species. Across the species' natural range high variation exists for external morphological traits of relevance to culture. Previous studies have demonstrated that morphological variation can often be correlated with environmental factors. The current study demonstrated that when exposed to a controlled environment, offspring of two morphologically divergent wild stocks retain little of their parental morphological characteristics. When crossed and grown under identical conditions, 'hybrids' and pure offspring were morphologically uniform. A breeding and growth trial of offspring within a single stock were exposed to a variety of environmental temperatures that resulted in high variability of morphological traits in the offspring. These results suggest that environmental parameters rather than genotype may strongly influence the phenotypic expression of the morphological traits investigated. Morphological traits of interest to culture, such as abdomen length and width show low additive genetic variance and hence may not respond well to traditional selective breeding approaches designed to improve their attributes.

AB  - Many lineages of parthenogenetic organisms have persisted through significant environmental change despite the constraints imposed by their fixed genotype and limited evolutionary potential. The ability of parthenogens to occur sympatrically with sexual relatives may in part be due to phenotypic plasticity in their responses to their environment, especially with respect to incubation temperature-a maternally selected trait. Here we measured the incubation temperatures selected by two lineages of triploid parthenogenic geckos in the Heteronotia binoei complex by allowing them to deposit clutches along a thermal gradient. The average nest temperature selected was 28.4 degrees C, with no significant differences between parthenogenic races or individual clones. To investigate the effect of nest-temperature variability on physiological and morphological traits, we incubated eggs from different races at one of four incubation regimes (32 degrees +/- 0 degrees, +/-3 degrees, +/-5 degrees, or +/-9 degrees C). Embryos incubated at constant 32 degrees C developed faster than embryos reared under increasing extremes of diel temperature fluctuation (+/-3 degrees, +/-5 degrees C), and incubation at 32 degrees +/- 9 degrees C was unsuccessful. Incubation regime had no effect on the body size, preferred substrate temperature, or mass-specific (V) over dotO(2) of hatchlings.. However, parthenogenic race had a significant effect on egg mass, tail length, snout-to-vent length, total length, and (V) over dotO(2) We conclude that developmental traits are strongly influenced by clonal genotypes in this parthenogenic complex but are well buffered against fluctuations in incubation temperature.

AB  - I examined the influence of temperature on food intake in 4 captive macaques in a room with controlled temperature. I gave then? two types of artificial food pellets which were different in energy content per weighs in 6 conditions of air temperature. Total energy intake of macaques increased as temperature decreased Intake of low quality pellets increased significantly with decreasing temperature in 3 of 4 subjects. The other macaque, whose food intake was almost constant, decreased his body weight as ambient temperature decreased. These results suggest that energy requirements of macaques change with temperature as a result of changes in energy required for ther thermoregulation. Moreover temperature influenced the selectivity of lower quality food. I discuss the pattern of food selection found in this experiment from the view-point of optimal foraging strategy.

AB  - Spawning time in salmonids is a sex-limited quantitative trait that can be modified by selection. In rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), various quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect the expression of this trait have been discovered. In this study, we describe four microsatellite loci associated with two possible spawning time QTL regions in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). The four loci were identified in females from two populations (early and late spawners) produced by divergent selection from the same base population. Three of the loci (OmyFGT34TUF, One2ASC and One19ASC) that were strongly associated with spawning time in coho salmon (p < 0.0002) were previously associated with QTL for the same trait in rainbow trout; a fourth loci (Oki10) with a suggestive association (p = 0.00035) mapped 10 cM from locus OmyFGT34TUF in rainbow trout. The changes in allelic frequency observed after three generations of selection were greater than expected because of genetic drift. This work shows that comparing information from closely-related species is a valid strategy for identifying QTLs for marker-assisted selection in species whose genomes are poorly characterized or lack a saturated genetic map.

AB  - Adding a causal, mechanistic dimension to the study of character evolution will increase the strength of inferences regarding the evolutionary history of characters and their adaptive consequences. This approach has the advantage of illuminating mechanism and testing evolutionary hypotheses rigorously. We consider the advantages of combining mechanistic and historical biology in the study of behavior, physiology, and development. we present six examples to illustrate the advantages: (1) preexisting biases in sound perception in frogs; (2) preexisting biases in visual cues in swordtail fishes (3) exploitation of prey location behavior for attraction of mates in water mates; (4) heterospecific mating in asexual molly fishes: (5) developmental foundation of morphological diversification in amphibian digits; and (6) locomotor performance at low temperature and the evolution of nocturnadity in geckos. In each of these examples, the dominant role of history, combined with organasmal integration, makes ignoring history a risky proposition.

AB  - Selective fish breeding programs for disease resistance comprise an increasingly important role in aquaculture production and offer an additional management tool for reducing bacterial-caused disease losses. Bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) is one of the most frequent causes of elevated mortality in juvenile salmonids, and we have selectively bred three genetic lines of rainbow trout for varying resistance to BCWD. These lines, designated ARS-Fp-R (resistant), ARS-Fp-C (control) and ARS-Fp-S (susceptible), differ in survival following standardized laboratory challenges with the causative agent of BCWD, Flavobacterium psychrophilum. This study evaluated survival of the genetic lines in laboratory challenges and in a production environment. Evaluations of disease resistance demonstrated a reproducible, 30% or greater, survival difference between ARS-Fp-R and ARS-Fp-S lines at body weights ranging from 0.7 to 13 g. Farm trials were performed to evaluate survival over an 80-day growth period starting after the trout began feeding. After a BCWD epizootic, the ARS-Fp-R line displayed significantly greater risk-adjusted survival (95.7%) than the ARS-Fp-S line (91.2%, P < 0.0001) and the ARS-Fp-C line (92.4%, P < 0.0001). Phenotype stability in farm-trial fish was also evaluated using laboratory challenges. The ARS-Fp-R line consistently displayed a higher, but not always statistically significant, survival percentage compared to the other lines and the data suggest that the magnitude of the survival phenotype difference is sensitive to environmental influence. In summary, the overall greater survival of the ARS-Fp-R line provides evidence of genetic improvement under production conditions. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Melanin is a widespread pigment causing variation in skin darkness, with darker phenotypes typically reaching higher equilibrium temperatures than lighter ones. Therefore, selection is expected to favour darker phenotypes in colder environments. In the present study, we show intraspecific variation in pupal (and wing) melanization along an altitudinal gradient in two species of copper butterflies. Both, pupal and wing melanization increased with increasing altitude. Consistent with the thermal melanism hypothesis, darker (high-altitude) pupae reached higher equilibrium temperatures than paler (low-altitude) ones. However, as temperature differences were rather small despite pronounced differences in melanization, we cannot rule out that factors (e.g. ultraviolet protection, disease resistance) other than temperature comprise the principal selective agents. Mechanistically, variation in melanization might be related to variation in hormone titres, as demonstrated by low-altitude pupae showing higher ecdysteroid and juvenile hormone titres compared to high-altitude ones. Furthermore, we report sex differences in wing melanization, with males being darker than females, which is potentially related to a higher flight activity of males.

AB  - The preparation of a water dispersible and pH responsive gelatin-F127 nanocomposite using a thermal relaxation approach is reported. The results indicated that physical properties (size and surface charge) of the gelatin-F127 nanoparticle can be tuned by varying the F127 to gelatin weight ratio. The heating (60 degrees C) of a saline solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% (w/v) of gelatin and 20% (w/w of gelatin) of F127 followed by gradual cooling at room temperature yielded nanoparticles of desired size (160 +/- 40 nm), viscosity (1.36 +/- cP) and surface charge (-6.47 +/- 0.7 mV). The drug delivery application of nanocarriers was investigated using doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox) as a model drug. These nanocarriers showed high encapsulation efficiency of Dox (85%), a sustained release profile, and substantial cellular internalization. Additionally, Dox loaded nanocarriers (G-Dox) exhibited prolonged residence in blood as evidenced by their longer circulation time as compared to plain Dox. Moreover, G-Dox exhibited a higher availability of the drug in plasma as compared to nonspecific organs such as the heart, liver and kidneys, highlighting its significance in reducing drug associated side effects. Finally, the enhanced toxicity of G-Dox to a WEHI-164 (fibrosarcoma) tumor model as compared to that of plain Dox under an identical dosage of 6 mg per kg body weight (IP) confirmed its potential for chemotherapy application.

AB  - The effects of water flow and water temperature on the growth of smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu and largemouth bass M. salmoides were examined during 14-day replicate trials in artificial ponds between July and September 2001. No significant difference was observed in the specific growth rate in body weight of both smallmouth bass and largemouth bass between the ponds with water flowing and those without water flowing when prey fish were given. The ratio of growth rate of smallmouth bass to largemouth bass was significantly larger in the experimental periods when the water temperature in the ponds was relatively low (21.5-24.0degreesC). When no prey fish was given, largemouth bass showed a significantly larger reduction in the growth rate in ponds with water flowing, although no significant difference was observed in the growth rate of smallmouth bass between the ponds with water flowing and those without water flowing. The results show that smallmouth bass has a relatively higher adaptability to water flow and low water temperature than largemouth bass.

AB  - Many organisms show latitudinal variation for quantitative traits that is assumed to be due to climatic adaptation. These clines provide an opportunity to study the genetics of the adaptive process both at the phenotypic and the underlying molecular levels. Yet researchers rarely try to link variation in quantitative traits to their underlying molecular genetic basis. We describe a novel approach for exploring the genetic basis for clinal variation in size and stress traits in Drosophila melanogaster. We look for associations between genetic markers and traits that exhibit clinal patterns on the east coast of Australia using a single, geographically central population. There are strong associations between markers found within In( 3R) Payne and variation in size, suggesting that this inversion explains much of the clinal variation in this trait. We also find that development time is associated with the Adh allozyme locus, cold resistance is negatively associated with the In(3L) Payne inversion and a genetic marker for Hsp70, a heat-shock protein, is associated with heat resistance. Finally we discuss the importance of inversions in clinal variation for quantitative traits and for identifying quantitative trait loci.

AB  - Canalization denotes the robustness of a trait against genetic or environmental perturbation. Plasticity, in contrast, indicates the environmental sensitivity of a trait. Stabilizing selection is often thought to increase the canalization of a trait, whereas directional selection is often thought to lead to decanalization. However, the relationship between selection, canalization, and plasticity remains largely unclear. Using experimental evolution, here, we ask whether long-term directional selection for reduced pre-adult development time in Drosophila melanogaster results in the evolution of increased canalization for development time, the trait under primary selection. We additionally investigate whether pre-adult survivorship, a trait only secondarily under selection in this experimental regime, also evolves to become canalized. We examine canalization both in terms of stability of population means and of within population variability across two environmental axes, reflecting macro- and microenvironmental canalization, respectively. We used four large outbred populations of D. melanogaster selected for rapid pre-adult development and early reproduction for 295 generations, and four corresponding ancestral control populations that were not under conscious selection for development time or early reproduction. The selected populations had evolved similar to 25% reduction in both development time and pre-adult survivorship at the time of this study. We studied development time and pre-adult survivorship of the selected populations and controls across various combinations of rearing temperature and larval density. Development time in the selected populations had become more canalized than controls against both macro- and microenvironmental variation, but only with regard to density, and not temperature. Canalization of development time across density appears to have evolved due to evolutionary changes in the life-history and physiology of the selected populations. Pre-adult survivorship, only a secondary correlate of fitness in the selected populations, did not show any clear trend in terms of canalization with regard to either density or temperature, and overall variation in the trait was greater compared to development time within and across environments. Whether long-term directional selection canalizes or not, therefore, appears to be dependent in a complex way on specific interactions of trait, selection regime, and environmental factor in the context of the ecology and physiology of the populations under study.

AB  - Reference intervals for diagnostic tests are vitally important for clinical decision making. Despite the popularity of pet goldfish (Carassius auratus), reference intervals have not been generated for routine biochemistry panel analytes in this species. This study establishes de novo reference intervals for packed cell volume and total solids, using 47 apparently healthy immature goldfish, and for 11 common chemistry panel analytes (albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, calcium, creatine kinase, globulin, blood glucose, sodium, potassium, phosphorous, total protein, and uric acid) using 39 immature goldfish. Robust reference intervals were generated following recommendations of the American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology. Linear regression was used to demonstrate a statistically significant relationship between body weight and calcium, albumin, total protein, potassium, packed cell volume, and total solids. The results of this study serve as a useful baseline for future reference interval generation in goldfish.

AB  - Thermal stress is a pervasive selective agent in natural populations that impacts organismal growth, survival, and reproduction. Drosophila melanogaster exhibits a variety of putatively adaptive phenotypic responses to thermal stress in natural and experimental settings; however, accompanying assessments of fitness are typically lacking. Here, we quantify changes in fitness and known thermal tolerance traits in replicated experimental D. melanogaster populations following more than 40 generations of evolution to either cyclic cold or hot temperatures. By evaluating fitness for both evolved populations alongside a reconstituted starting population, we show that the evolved populations were the best adapted within their respective thermal environments. More strikingly, the evolved populations exhibited increased fitness in both environments and improved resistance to both acute heat and cold stress. This unexpected parallel response appeared to be an adaptation to the rapid temperature changes that drove the cycling thermal regimes, as parallel fitness changes were not observed when tested in a constant thermal environment. Our results add to a small, but growing group of studies that demonstrate the importance of fluctuating temperature changes for thermal adaptation and highlight the need for additional work in this area.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity may allow species to cope with environmental variation. The study of thermal plasticity and its evolution helps understanding how populations respond to variation in temperature. In the context of climate change, it is essential to realize the impact of historical differences in the ability of populations to exhibit a plastic response to thermal variation and how it evolves during colonization of new environments. We have analyzed the real-time evolution of thermal reaction norms of adult and juvenile traits in Drosophila subobscura populations from three locations of Europe in the laboratory. These populations were kept at a constant temperature of 18 degrees C, and were periodically assayed at three experimental temperatures (13 degrees C, 18 degrees C, and 23 degrees C). We found initial differentiation between populations in thermal plasticity as well as evolutionary convergence in the shape of reaction norms for some adult traits, but not for any of the juvenile traits. Contrary to theoretical expectations, an overall better performance of high latitude populations across temperatures in early generations was observed. Our study shows that the evolution of thermal plasticity is trait specific, and that a new stable environment did not limit the ability of populations to cope with environmental challenges.

AB  - For most ectotherms, increasing the rearing temperature reduces the final (adult) body size, producing a negative slope for the thermal reaction norm. Recent studies show that this relationship may be reversed under conditions of low resource quality, producing a positive slope for the thermal reaction norm. If populations or species differ in the degree of evolutionary adaptation to a resource, how does this differential adaptation alter their thermal reaction norms? We used a common garden experiment with the tobacco hornworm, , to address this question. We examined the thermal reaction norms for body size of two populations of that differ in their evolutionary exposures to an atypical, low-quality resource (devil's claw; ), but have comparable exposures to a typical, high-quality resource (tobacco; ). Both populations had increased mean larval mortalities and development times when reared on devil's claw compared with tobacco, but the magnitudes of these increases differed between populations. Both populations had similar, negatively sloped thermal reaction norms on the typical, high-quality resource (tobacco), but had divergent, non-negative thermal reaction norms on the atypical, low-quality resource (devil's claw): the population with the longer evolutionary history of exposure to the atypical resource exhibited a flat (rather than positive) reaction norm. These results suggest that population differences in host plant adaptation can predictably influence the slopes of thermal reaction norms.

AB  - Mutation rate often increases with environmental temperature, but establishing causality is complicated. Asymmetry between physiological stress and deviation from the optimal temperature means that temperature and stress are often confounded. We allowed mutations to accumulate in two species of Caenorhabditis for approximately 100 generations at 18 degrees and for approximately 165 generations at 26 degrees; 26 degrees is stressful for Caenorhabditis elegans but not for Caenorhabditis briggsae. We report mutation rates at a set of microsatellite loci and estimates of the per-generation decay of fitness (Delta M-w), the genomic mutation rate for fitness (U) and the average effect of a new mutation (E[a]), assayed at both temperatures. In C. elegans, the microsatellite mutation rate is significantly greater at 26 degrees than at 18 degrees whereas in C. briggsae there is only a slight, non-significant increase in mutation rate at 268, consistent with stress-dependent mutation in C. elegans. The fitness data from both species qualitatively reinforce the microsatellite results. The fitness results of C. elegans are potentially complicated by selection, but also suggest temperature-dependent mutation; the difference between the two species suggests that physiological stress plays a significant role in the mutational process.

AB  - Background: Previously, we have shown there is clinal variation for egg-to-adult developmental time along geographic gradients in Drosophila melanogaster. Further, we also have identified mutations in genes involved in metabolic and neurogenic pathways that affect development time (heterochronic genes). However, we do not know whether these loci affect variation in developmental time in natural populations.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we constructed second chromosome substitution lines from natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster from an altitudinal cline, and measured egg-adult development time for each line. We found not only a large amount of genetic variation for developmental time, but also positive associations of the development time with thermal amplitude and altitude. We performed genetic complementation tests using substitution lines with the longest and shortest developmental times and heterochronic mutations. We identified segregating variation for neurogenic and metabolic genes that largely affected the duration of the larval stages but had no impact on the timing of metamorphosis.
   Conclusions/Significance: Altitudinal clinal variation in developmental time for natural chromosome substitution lines provides a unique opportunity to dissect the response of heterochronic genes to environmental gradients. Ontogenetic stage-specific variation in invected, mastermind, cricklet and CG14591 may affect natural variation in development time and thermal evolution.

AB  - Attempts to explain size variation in Drosophila and other small insects often focus on the larval stage and association between development time and size, but patterns are also influenced by direct selection on size-related traits in the adults. Here we use multiple field releases of Drosophila melanogaster to test the association between size and one component of field fitness, the ability of Drosophila to locate resources for feeding and breeding. We find antagonistic selection between wing length and thorax length in both males and females, such that capture at baits is higher for flies with relatively larger thorax lengths and smaller wings. However flies with large wings relative to thoraces disperse further as reflected in the longer distances moved to baits. These patterns did not depend strongly on weather conditions, suggesting that selection on adult size is at least partly independent of temperature. Antagonistic selection between size traits can generate changes in size along gradients if the distribution of resources in the environment varies and selects for different dispersal patterns, particularly as dispersal is relatively higher under warmer conditions.

AB  - Locomotor performance is a fundamental link between an animal and its environment. Considerable evidence has accumulated about the biomechanical, physiological and morphological causes of variation in sprint speed and endurance in animals. Yet little information is available about the ecological role of locomotion and its relationship to fitness. This is largely due to the difficulty of acquiring survivorship data in known demographic populations. To address the selective significance of locomotor performance, I estimated the covariation between sprint speed and survivorship of juveniles in a population of the lizard., Urosaurus ornatus. Selection analyses based on mark-recapture data revealed significant directional selection for burst velocity and stride length. Faster lizards with longer stride lengths realized a survival advantage over slower lizards regardless of size. Significant non-linear selection was detected on initial velocity and mean velocity. The selection surface for initial velocity was concave up, hence juveniles with intermediate values for initial velocity had lower fitness. Conversely, the selection surface for mean velocity was concave down, thus juveniles with intermediate values for mean velocity had higher survivorship. I hypothesize that the differences in sprint performance influence prey capture and predator escape. Faster lizards may also select warmer microhabitats during favourable conditions, which may enhance growth rates but entail higher risks of predation.

AB  - The selective and environmental effects of captivity on several fitness-correlated traits were assessed in smolts of endangered Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., from the inner Bay of Fundy, produced via artificial spawning and released into the wild as juveniles. Smolts were sampled as they migrated downstream and identified through microsatellite-based parentage analysis as offspring of either wild-spawning adults or adults that were spawned in captivity. Overall, captive-origin smolts exhibited a significantly later run timing and smaller body size than wild smolts. Significant differences in run timing and body size were also found between captive-origin smolts that had experienced rearing environments that differed in duration of captivity and thermal regime. Significant differences in run timing, fork length and weight were found between first and second generation captive-origin smolts, although the expression of these differences depended on the rearing environment experienced, suggesting a possible genotype by environment effect. The ratio of effective-to-census number of breeders that produced the captive-origin smolts was higher than that of the wild-origin smolts due to successful captive breeding management practices. These results have direct implications for captive breeding and rearing programmes for salmonids and wider implications for understanding the rates of evolutionary and environmentally induced change that can occur in captivity.

AB  - Thermal stress is a major driver of population declines and extinctions. Shifts in thermal regimes create new environmental conditions, leading to trait adaptation, population migration, and/or species extinction. Extensive research has examined thermal adaptations in terrestrial arthropods. However, little is known about social insects, despite their major role in ecosystems. It is only within the last few years that the adaptations of social insects to thermal stress have received attention. Herein, we discuss what is currently known about thermal tolerance and thermal adaptation in social insects - namely ants, termites, social bees, and social wasps. We describe the behavioural, morphological, physiological, and molecular adaptations that social insects have evolved to cope with thermal stress. We examine individual and collective responses to both temporary and persistent changes in thermal conditions and explore the extent to which individuals can exploit genetic variability to acclimatise. Finally, we consider the costs and benefits of sociality in the face of thermal stress, and we propose some future research directions that should advance our knowledge of individual and collective thermal adaptations in social insects.

AB  - The expression of fitness-related traits, such as egg and gonad size, often varies among habitats and exhibits clinal variation along climatic and latitudinal gradients. However, the mechanisms allowing such variations are obscure and have been ascribed to both phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation. We experimentally tested whether variation in egg and gonad size of a poikilotherm vertebrate is influenced by the temperature individuals experienced during embryogenesis, possibly as an epigenetic effect. Atlantic salmon Salmo salar eggs were incubated under 3 embryonic thermal regimes: cold, mixed and warm treatments. The cold group received ambient river water (mean +/- SD: 2.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C) and the warm group received water at 4.6 degrees C above ambient temperature, the expected temperature in the river towards the end of this century, from fertilization until exogenous feeding commenced. The mixed group received ambient river water until hatching, whereupon the larvae received heated water until exogenous feeding commenced. When exogenous feeding was initiated, all fish were reared under identical, natural thermal conditions. At adulthood, fish that developed from warm-incubated eggs were largest, had the highest mass-length relationship and developed larger eggs and higher gonad mass relative to their own body size. There was no similar effect of thermal environment during larval development. The treatment did not affect age of maturity or fecundity. Thus, thermal conditions during embryo genesis affected the expression of adult life-history traits, a mechanism by which fish may rapidly change the size of their propagules to the anticipated thermal offspring environment. This is a novel result explaining variation in these core life-history traits.

AB  - Specific dynamic action (SDA) is the term used to refer to the increased metabolic expenditure that occurs in postprandial animals. Postprandial increases in metabolism were first documented in animals over two hundred years ago, and have since been observed in every species thus far examined. Ironically, the ubiquity of this physiological response to feeding understates its complex nature. This review is designed to summarize both classical and modem hypotheses regarding the causality of SDA as well as to review important findings from the past century of scientific research into SDA. A secondary aim of this work is to emphasize the importance of carefully designed experiments and systematic hypothesis testing to make more rapid progress in understanding the physiological processes that contribute to SDA. I also identify three areas in SDA research that deserve more detailed investigation. The first area is identification of the causality of SDA in 'model' organisms. The second area is characterization of SDA responses in novel species. The third area is exploration of the ecological and potential evolutionary significance of SDA in energy budgets of animals.

AB  - In 2016, global temperatures were the highest on record, and mass coral bleaching occurred world-wide. However, around Sesoko Island, Okinawa, southwestern Japan, the heat stress assessed by degree heating week (DHW) based on local temperature measurements was moderate in 2016; in 1998, DHW was three times higher than in 2016 (10.6 vs. 3.3 in September in respective years). On a reef flat of Sesoko Island where the effect of severe coral bleaching on coral assemblage was monitored in 1998, significant coral bleaching occurred in 2016. Bleaching of the heat stress sensitive Acropora corals began in July 2016 on the reef flat as seawater temperature rose. We observed the bleaching and post-bleaching mortality status of individual colonies of Acropora spp. in 2016 in fixed plots on the reef flat. In total, 123 Acropora colonies were followed for six months after seawater temperature became normal by multiple surveys. At the beginning of September 2016, 99.2% of colonies, were either completely (92.7%) or partially (6.5%) bleached. Of those, the dominant species or species groups were A. gemmifera (Ag), A. digitifera (Ad), and tabular Acropora (tA). For all Acropora colonies, the overall whole and partial mortality was 41.5% and 11.4%, respectively. Whole mortality rate differed significantly among species; 72.5%, 17.9%, and 27.8% in Ag, Ad, and tA, respectively. Mortality rates at the end of the surveys were similar in smaller (<= 10 cm in diameter) and larger Ag, but the former suffered mortality earlier than the latter. Higher survival of smaller colonies was observed only in tA (100%), which may be associated with large morphological differences between smaller and larger colonies. Some of the dominant Acropora colonies had survived without partial mortality including 15.0% survival of the most vulnerable Ag at the end of the surveys. These results suggest that moderate heat stress may have a potential for selecting heat-tolerant genotypes. A longer period of mortality lasting for six months, was observed in Ag in addition to immediate whole mortality after bleaching, due to the continuous loss of living tissue by partial mortality. This highlights the need for multiple surveys at least during several months to accurately assess the impact of thermal stress event to corals. In contrast to DHW based on local measurements, DHW obtained from satellite data were similar between 1998 and 2016. Although satellite-based measurement of sea surface temperature is very useful to reveal variations in heat stress at a large spatial scale, temperature should be measured on site when variations at smaller spatial scales are of interest.

AB  - Climate change is one of the greatest threats to the persistence of coral reefs. Sustained and ongoing increases in ocean temperatures and acidification are altering the structure and function of reefs globally. Here, we summarise recent advances in our understanding of the effects of climate change on scleractinian corals and reef fish. Although there is considerable among-species variability in responses to increasing temperature and seawater chemistry, changing temperature regimes are likely to have the greatest influence on the structure of coral and fish assemblages, at least over short-medium timeframes. Recent evidence of increases in coral bleaching thresholds, local genetic adaptation and inheritance of heat tolerance suggest that coral populations may have some capacity to respond to warming, although the extent to which these changes can keep pace with changing environmental conditions is unknown. For coral reef fishes, current evidence indicates increasing seawater temperature will be a major determinant of future assemblages, through both habitat degradation and direct effects on physiology and behaviour. The effects of climate change are, however, being compounded by a range of anthropogenic disturbances, which may undermine the capacity of coral reef organisms to acclimate and/or adapt to specific changes in environmental conditions.

AB  - The flexibility afforded to genotypes in different environments by phenotypic plasticity is of interest to biologists studying thermal adaptation because of the thermal lability of many traits. Differences in thermal performance and reaction norms can provide insight into the evolution of thermal adaptation to explore broader questions such as species distributions and persistence under climate change. One approach is to study the effects of temperature on fitness, morphological and more recently gene expression traits in populations from different climatic origins. The diverse climatic conditions experienced by Drosophila melanogaster along the eastern Australian temperate-tropical gradient are ideal given the high degree of continuous trait differentiation, but reaction norm variation has not been well studied in this system. Here, we reared a tropical and temperate population from the ends of the gradient over six developmental temperatures and examined reaction norm variation for five quantitative traits including thermal performance for fecundity, and reaction norms for thermotolerance, body size, viability and 23 transcript-level traits. Despite genetic variation for some quantitative traits, we found no differentiation between the populations for fecundity thermal optima and breadth, and the reaction norms for the other traits were largely parallel, supporting previous work suggesting that thermal evolution occurs by changes in trait means rather than by reaction norm shifts. We examined reaction norm variation in our expanded thermal regime for a gene set shown to previously exhibit GxE for expression plasticity in east Australian flies, as well as key heat-shock genes. Although there were differences in curvature between the populations suggesting a higher degree of thermal plasticity in expression patterns than for the quantitative traits, we found little evidence to support a role for genetic variation in maintaining expression plasticity.

AB  - An evaluation of the link between climate and population dynamics requires understanding of climate effects both within and across generations. In ectothermic vertebrates, demographic responses to climate changes should crucially depend on balancing needs for heat and water. Here, we studied how temperature and rainfall regimes experienced before and during adulthood influenced reproductive performances (litter size, offspring size, and survival) in a natural population of the live-bearing common lizard, Lacerta vivipara, monitored continuously from 1989 to 2004. Rainfall regime, but not temperature, had both immediate and delayed effects on these reproductive performances. Rainfall during the first month of life was positively correlated with juvenile survival. Females experiencing more rainfall during gestation produced smaller neonates that showed greater survival when controlling for the positive effect of body size on survival. Furthermore, females that experienced heavier rainfall when in utero produced fewer but longer neonates during adulthood. These demographic effects of rainfall on adult reproductive traits may come from maternal effects of climate conditions and/or from delayed effects of rainfall on the environment experienced early in life. Irrespective of the precise mechanism, however, this study provides evidence of intergenerational climate effects in natural populations of an ectothermic vertebrate.

AB  - Effects of seasonal or daily temperature variation on fitness and physiology of ectothermic organisms and their ways to cope with such variations have been widely studied. However, the way multivoltines organisms cope with temperature variations from one generation to the next is still not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the multivoltine midge Chironomus riparius Meigen (1803) responds mainly via acclimation as predicted by current theories or whether rapid genetic adaptation is involved. To investigate this issue, a common garden approach has been applied. A mix of larvae from five European populations was raised in the laboratory at three different pre-exposure temperatures (PET): 14, 20, and 26 degrees C. After three and five generations, respectively, larvae were exposed to three treatment temperatures (TT): 14, 20, and 26 degrees C. Mortality was monitored for the first 48 hr and after emergence. After three generations, significant mortality rate differences depended on an interaction of PET and TT. This finding supports the hypothesis that chironomids respond rapidly to climatic variation via adaptive mechanisms and to a lesser extent via phenotypic plasticity. The result of the experiment indicates that three generations were sufficient to adapt to warm temperature, decreasing the mortality rate, highlighting the potential for chironomids to rapidly respond to seasonally changing conditions.

AB  - Anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus distribution in European waters spans from the Mediterranean Sea to the North Sea, and is expected to expand further north with global warming. Observations from the eastern Mediterranean (North Aegean Sea), the Bay of Biscay and the North Sea reveal latitudinal differences in growth, maximum size, fecundity and timing of reproduction. We set up a mechanistic framework combining a bioenergetics model with regional physical-biogeochemical models providing temperature and zooplankton biomass to investigate the underlying mechanisms of variation in these traits. The bioenergetics model, based on the Dynamic Energy Budget theory and initially calibrated in the Bay of Biscay, was used to simulate growth and reproduction patterns. Environment partly explained the increased growth rate and larger body size towards the north. However, regional calibration of the maximum assimilation rate was necessary to obtain the best model fit. This suggests a genetic adaptation, with a pattern of cogradient variation with increasing resource towards the north, in addition to a countergradient thermal adaptation. Overall, the seasonal energy dynamics supports the pattern of body-size scaling with latitude, i.e. food-limited growth but low maintenance costs in the warm Aegean Sea, and larger size in the North Sea allowing sufficient storage capacity for overwintering. Further, the model suggests a synchronisation of reproductive timing with environmental seasonality as a trade-off between thresholds of temperature and reserves for spawning and overwintering, respectively. Finally, low temperature, short productive and spawning seasons, and insufficient reserves for overwintering appear to be current limitations for an expansion of anchovy to the Norwegian Sea.

AB  - The interaction between the continuous microstructure evolution during thermal cycling and the long-term reliability of wafer-level chip-scale packages (WLCSPs) with Sn-1.0Ag-0.5Cu (wt%) (SAC105), Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (wt%) (SAC305), and Sn-3.9Ag-0.6Cu (wt%) (SAC396) solder ball interconnects were investigated. Three different body-sized WLCSP with three different solder alloys on three different board thickness were thermally cycled from 0 degrees C to 100 degrees C with 10 min of dwell time, and the microstructure evolution and their impact to the life cycle numbers were identified. Based on both experimental and calculated data, higher Ag contained solder alloys perform better in thermal cycling. However, the comparison between the calculated life cycle and the experimental results revealed mismatch, which is due to the localized recrystallization areal fraction differences. Smaller die WLCSP with 4 x 4 mm(2) and 3.2 x 3.2 mm(2) exhibited a large difference in expected life cycle numbers. The calculated life cycles expected a lower cycle number with thicker boards for both SAC105 and SAC396 WLCSPs, but the experimental data revealed an increase with SAC105 and a similar level of life cycle time with SAC396, for thicker boards. A widely distributed areal fraction of damage accumulation through the solder rows were observed in SAC105 compared with higher Ag solder alloy joints, which show localized damage accumulation at corner joints. The difference of areal recrystallization distribution explains the difference between SAC105 and SAC305/396 thermal cycling behavior between the calculated and experimental thermal cycling results.

AB  - Locomotor activity and its plasticity were investigated in Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for Long and for Short wings at two different temperatures. Flies were tested in a locometer at two different Activity temperatures. Locomotor activity, a physiological character, showed phenotypic plasticity: locomotor activity scores (l.a.s.) were higher at 25 degrees C than at 20 degrees C in all lines.
   Although at each selection temperature the lines differed significantly in the morphological character wing length, l.a.s.'s were similar in lines with Long and with Short wings per selection temperature. However, a significant difference between selected and unselected control - lines was found. At each selection temperature, plasticity of l.a.s.'s in all lines was similar, except for the Short line selected at 20 degrees C, which showed a higher plasticity. In contrast to earlier experiments no significant correlations between l.a.s. and fresh body weight, and between l.a.s. and wing length were found within each line.

AB  - Many amphibians are explosive breeders, but the key factors that influence migrations to (and from) breeding sites are not well understood for all species. We used a comparative approach to compare and contrast the complex relationships among breeding chronology, environmental conditions, sexual dimorphism/body size, sex ratio, and genetic variation in Small-mouthed (Ambystoma texanum) and Eastern Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum). We intercepted 171 A. texanum and 330 adult A. t. tigrinum on their annual migration to breeding ponds over two consecutive breeding seasons (2003-04). Both species immigrated over a short period of time (4-17 days) and displayed no clear pattern regarding whether males or females typically arrived first at breeding ponds. Sex ratios were skewed toward males in both species but varied between years. Consistent with their expected sexual selection regimes, intraspecific sexual dimorphism was subtle in A. texanum but pronounced in A. t. tigrinum. There was no size-ordered immigration or emigration for either species examined; migration events were triggered by temperature and precipitation. We genotyped four hypervariable microsatellite loci and found no gross difference in the overall level of genetic variation between species but document that our study populations are genetically diverse (mean of >18 alleles per locus and heterozygosities >0.75 in each species), presumably as a result of historically large effective population sizes.

AB  - Under climate change, marine organisms will need to tolerate or adapt to increasing temperatures to persist. The ability of populations to cope with thermal stress may be influenced by conditions experienced by parents, by both genetic changes and transgenerational phenotypic plasticity through epigenetics or maternal provisioning. In organisms with complex life cycles, larval stages are particularly vulnerable to stress. Positive parental carry-over effects occur if more stressful parental environments yield more tolerant offspring while the opposite pattern leads to negative carry-over effects. This study evaluated the role of parental effects in determining larval thermal tolerances for the intertidal mussel, Mytilus californianus. We tested whether thermal environments across a natural gradient (shoreline elevation) impacted mussel temperature tolerances. Lethal thermal limits were compared for field-collected adults and their larvae. We observed parental effects across one generation, in which adult mussels exposed to warmer habitats yielded less tolerant offspring. Interestingly, although parental environments influenced offspring tolerances, we found no clear effects of habitat conditions on adult phenotypes (tolerances). We found indicators of trade-offs in energy investment, with higher reproductive condition and larger egg diameters in low stress environments. These results suggest that parental effects are negative, leading to possible adverse effects of thermal stress on the next generation.

AB  - How organisms may adapt to rising global temperatures is uncertain, but concepts can emerge from studying adaptive physiological trait variations across existing spatial climate gradients. Many ectotherms, particularly fish, have evolved increasing genetic growth capacities with latitude (i.e. countergradient variation (CnGV) in growth), which are thought to be an adaptation primarily to strong gradients in seasonality. In contrast, evolutionary responses to gradients in mean temperature are often assumed to involve an alternative mode, 'thermal adaptation'. We measured thermal growth reaction norms in Pacific silverside populations (Atherinops affinis) occurring across a weak latitudinal temperature gradient with invariant seasonality along the North American Pacific coast. Instead of thermal adaptation, we found novel evidence for CnGV in growth, suggesting that CnGV is a ubiquitous mode of reaction-norm evolution in ectotherms even in response to weak spatial and, by inference, temporal climate gradients. A novel, large-scale comparison between ecologically equivalent Pacific versus Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) revealed how closely growth CnGV patterns reflect their respective climate gradients. While steep growth reaction norms and increasing growth plasticity with latitude in M. menidia mimicked the strong, highly seasonal Atlantic coastal gradient, shallow reaction norms and much smaller, latitude-independent growth plasticity in A. affinis resembled the weak Pacific latitudinal temperature gradient.

AB  - Life history differentiation along climatic gradients may have allowed a species to extend its geographic range. To explore this hypothesis, we compared eleven Omocestus viridulus (Orthoptera: Acrididae) populations along an altitudinal gradient from 410 to 2440 m in Switzerland, both in the field and laboratory. In situ temperature records indicated a striking decline in available heat sums along the gradient, and field populations at high altitudes reached egg hatching and adulthood much later in the year than at low elevation. The reproductive period at high altitude is thus severely limited by season length, especially during a cool year. However, controlled environment experiments revealed that intrinsic rates of embryonic and juvenile development increased with the populations' altitude of origin. This countergradient variation is largely genetic and conforms to predictions of life history theory. No corresponding differentiation in the overwintering egg stage, a pivotal determinant of phenology, was found. This trait seems conserved within the gomphocerine grasshopper subfamily. Although we found evidence for altitudinal adaptation in development, the potential of O. viridulus to adapt to cool alpine climates appears restricted by a phylogenetic constraint.

AB  - Chill-coma recovery (CCR) is an important trait for thermal adaptation in insects. Multiple phenotypes could be affected by selection on CCR if the trait is genetically correlated with other adaptive traits. To test for heritable (co-)variation in CCR, we examined direct and correlated responses to bi-directional selection on CCR. Drosophila buzzatii Patterson & Wheeler (Diptera: Drosophilidae) was artificially selected for decreased and increased recovery time following exposure to 0 degrees C. After 18 selected generations, the selection response in CCR was significant but qualitatively asymmetric, with replicated lines for slow CCR showing the highest response. Knockdown resistance to high temperature was not affected by CCR selection. Starvation resistance in the adult fly showed no clear pattern of correlated responses to CCR selection. Selection on CCR had no impact on developmental time and body size. Chill-coma recovery shows no apparent genetic trade-offs with any of the multiple traits included in this study. These results are largely consistent with recent studies on clines in D. buzzatii, which showed that CCR is not across-population correlated with other clinally varying traits of thermal adaptation. Cold adaptation may evolve toward increased cold resistance independent of upper thermal limits.

AB  - Antagonistic correlations among traits may slow the rate of adaptation to a changing environment. The tide pool copepod Tigriopus californicus is locally adapted to temperature, but within populations, the response to selection for increased heat tolerance plateaus rapidly, suggesting either limited variation within populations or costs of increased tolerance. To measure possible costs of thermal tolerance, we selected for increased upper lethal limits for 10 generations in 22 lines of T. californicus from six populations. Then, for each line, we measured six fitness-related traits. Selected lines showed an overall increase in male and female body sizes, fecundity, and starvation resistance, suggesting a small benefit from (rather than costs of) increased tolerance. The effect of selection on correlated traits also varied significantly by population for five traits, indicating that the genetic basis for the selection response differed among populations. Our results suggest that adaptation was limited by the presence of variation within isolated populations rather than by costs of increased tolerance.

AB  - Organisms can respond to and cope with stressful environments in a number of ways including behavioural, morphological and physiological adjustments. To understand the role of behavioural traits in thermal adaptations we compared heat resistance, locomotor (walking and flying) activity, flight performance and morphology of three European populations of Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae) originating from different thermal conditions (Spain, Switzerland and Denmark) at benign and stressful high temperatures. Spanish flies showed greater heat resistance than Swiss and Danish flies. Similarly, at the stressful high temperature Spanish flies flew the furthest and Danish flies the shortest distance. Neither body size nor wing loading affected flight performance, although flies with narrower wings tended to fly further (wing shape effect). Swiss flies were most active in terms of locomotor activity at the benign temperature, whereas the Spanish flies were able to stay active for longer at the stressful temperature. Population differences in behavioural traits and heat resistance were obtained using flies held for several generations in a laboratory common garden setting; therefore we suggest that exposure to and avoidance of high temperatures under natural conditions has been an important selective agent causing the suggested adaptive differentiation between the populations.

AB  - One of the best-known biogeographic rules for ectotherms is the temperature-size rule, which asserts that ectotherms produce smaller adults at warmer temperatures. Although this is often true, it has become clear that there is no single process behind the pattern and many exceptions to the rule. To disentangle such complex temperature-size relationships, individual clades must be examined at ecological and evolutionary scales. We examined temperature-size relationships for 2,106 individuals from 64 populations and 40 species ofCephaloleiarolled-leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae; Cassidinae) occurring along two tropical elevational gradients: Barva and the Talamanca Cordillera in Costa Rica, Central America. We tested whether the temperature-size rule applied to interspecific elevational assemblages, intraspecific elevational populations or different rearing temperatures for individual populations. At the interspecific scale, evolutionary history, rather than elevation, explains body size. At the intraspecific scale, only one of seven species followed the temperature-size rule across elevations. When larvae were reared at different temperatures, only one of five populations followed the temperature-size rule. Most populations grew to a fixed size regardless of temperature. Size inCephaloleiabeetles is constrained by their evolutionary history and responds to factors that rarely correlate with temperature. As temperature increases, ectotherms will not universally shrink, but determining if and why their size will change will require further investigation.

AB  - Understanding how quickly physiological traits evolve is a topic of great interest, particularly in the context of how organisms can adapt in response to climate warming. Adjustment to novel thermal habitats may occur either through behavioural adjustments, physiological adaptation or both. Here, we test whether rates of evolution differ among physiological traits in the cybotoids, a clade of tropical Anolis lizards distributed in markedly different thermal environments on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. We find that cold tolerance evolves considerably faster than heat tolerance, a difference that results because behavioural thermoregulation more effectively shields these organisms from selection on upper than lower temperature tolerances. Specifically, because lizards in very different environments behaviourally thermoregulate during the day to similar body temperatures, divergent selection on body temperature and heat tolerance is precluded, whereas night-time temperatures can only be partially buffered by behaviour, thereby exposing organisms to selection on cold tolerance. We discuss how exposure to selection on physiology influences divergence among tropical organisms

AB  - Predation is a strong selective pressure generating morphological, physiological and behavioural responses in organisms. As predation risk is often higher during juvenile stages, antipredator defences expressed early in life are paramount to survival. Maternal effects are an efficient pathway to produce such defences. We investigated whether maternal exposure to predator cues during gestation affected juvenile morphology, behaviour and dispersal in common lizards (Zootoca vivipara). We exposed 21 gravid females to saurophagous snake cues for one month while 21 females remained unexposed (i.e. control). We measured body size, preferred temperature and activity level for each neonate, and released them into semi-natural enclosures connected to corridors in order to measure dispersal. Offspring from exposed mothers grew longer tails, selected lower temperatures and dispersed thrice more than offspring from unexposed mothers. Because both tail autotomy and altered thermoregulatory behaviour are common antipredator tactics in lizards, these results suggest that mothers adjusted offspring phenotype to risky natal environments (tail length) or increased risk avoidance (dispersal). Although maternal effects can be passive consequences of maternal stress, our results strongly militate for them to be an adaptive antipredator response that may increase offspring survival prospects.

AB  - We report in this paper an evolutionary experiment on Drosophila that tested life-history theory and the evolutionary theory of aging. As theory predicts, higher extrinsic mortality rates did lead to the evolution of higher intrinsic mortality rates, to shorter lifespans. and to decreased age and size at eclosion; peak fecundity also shifted earlier in life. These results confirm the key role of extrinsic mortality rates in the evolution of growth, maturation, reproduction, and aging, and they do so with a selection regime that maintained selection on fertility throughout life while holding population densities constant.

AB  - This study focused on changes in the maturation schedules, as depicted in maturity ogives, of female small yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea during the 1960-2010 spawning seasons. The two stocks studied were the northern Yellow Sea-Bohai Sea stock (the NYBS, n = 1283) and the southern Yellow Sea stock (the SYS, n=2024). Body length (L-50) and age at median sexual maturity (A(50)) were estimated by an arcsin-square-root (ASR) transformative logistic model and an inverse von Bertalanffy growth function, respectively. The results show that L-50 decreased from 152.8 mm to 105.3 mm between 1960 and 2003-2005 in the NYBS and from 184.4 mm to 110.1 mm between 1960 and 2010 in the SYS. Over the same period, A(50) decreased from approximately 1.5 years in the NYBS and 2.4 years in the SYS to about 1 year in both stocks. Significant intrastock changes (P < 0.01) in length-maturation curves were found in both stocks over long time periods (>= 4 years); however, there were no significant changes (P > 0.05) over short time intervals (<4 years). Significant interstock changes (P < 0.01) were observed in length-maturation curves in corresponding sampling years. Significant positive correlations were found between the instantaneous rate of maturation (delta) and the growth potential index (omega) in the NYBS and between L-50 and asymptotic body length (L-infinity) in the SYS. Significant negative correlations were found between L-50 and the sea surface temperature (SST) daily rise rate in the NYBS and between delta and the mean monthly SST in the SYS. These correlations suggest that declines in length and age at maturation primarily reflect changes in growth associated with overfishing and rising SST. Additionally, a fisheries-induced evolutionary response has contributed to changes in maturation schedules in both stocks. The principal pressures are the stress of continuously higher fishing intensity and an increasing proportion of yearling fish in the catches over time. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The ecological trade-off between developmental time and starvation resistance, acting in a heterogeneous environment, can promote the coexistence of competing species. Heterogeneity results from variation in the vegetation that influences both abiotic (e.g. temperature, humidity) and biotic (e.g. fruit availability during the year) aspects of the environment. In this study, we investigated whether differences between collection sites have led to local differentiation of the two life-history traits underlying the coexistence model: developmental time and starvation resistance. Drosophila were collected from four collection sites, ranging from grassland to secondary forest, along a transect of 15 km. The microclimatic and vegetation differences among these collection sites were considerable. For developmental time, different species showed similar genetic responses to the (habitat) differences between the different collection sites. The shortest developmental times were found in the secondary forest populations and the agricultural area populations, the longest in the grassland populations, and the forest edge populations were intermediate. However, there was no correlation between the habitat ranking based on disturbance and canopy cover, and the ranking of the developmental times. Furthermore, the data did not confirm the generality of the positive correlation between developmental time and starvation underlying the coexistence model. (c) 2006 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita s.l. has been suggested to have high mortality during the ephyra stage, which potentially affects the population size of the later medusa stage. However, the mechanism behind the high mortality rate has still not been clarified. Ephyrae of A. aurita are liberated from the sessile strobila, which are usually surrounded by filter-feeding sessile organisms. In the present study, we carried out a series of feeding trials at 10 A degrees C, offering A. aurita ephyrae to three potential predatory filter-feeding sessile organisms: the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, the ascidian Styela plicata, and the barnacle Amphibalanus eburneus. From the experiments, the mussel was estimated to have the highest ability to consume ephyrae among the sessile organisms. Size-selective filtration experiments showed that the mussel consumed newly liberated ephyrae [3 mm total body diameter (TBD)] at a significantly higher efficiency than larger (5 and 7 mm TBD) ephyrae. Our results demonstrate that filter-feeding sessile organisms, especially the mussel, are potential consumers of the early ephyra stage.

AB  - The influence of water temperature (17 and 25 degreesC) and a period of fasting on the self-selection of macronutrients were examined in common carp held on a 12:12-h light/dark cycle. Eight replicate groups of juvenile carp (ca. 15 g body weight at 17 degreesC and 25 g at 25 degreesC) were fed with three test diets [high-protein (HP), high-fat (HF) and high-carbohydrate (HC) diets] by individual self-feeders for 3 weeks, followed by a 2-week period of fasting and then 3 weeks of refeeding. At 17 degreesC, the carp initially selected the HP and HF diets [HP/HF/HC (%) = 3 8:40:22], whereas at 25 degreesC, the carp selected the HP diet over the others (55:21:24). After fasting, the carp tended to increase their demand for the HF diet at 17 degreesC and for the HC diet at 25 degreesC, but the overall self-selection of the test diets did not differ markedly from that prior to fasting. Carp held at 17 degreesC had higher relative whole body fat content and plasma triglyceride concentration; the latter decreased markedly during fasting. These results suggest that water temperature influences the macronutrient selection by carp: a relatively high demand for both protein and fat at 17 degreesC and for protein at 25 degreesC. Two weeks of fasting, however, did not markedly alter their macronutrient selection. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is difficult to mate Sika does with Wapiti bucks due to differences in body size, estrus period and other environmental factors, although their hybrids have high economic value. In this study, we determined the optimal period of artificial insemination and analyzed specific assisted reproductive technologies to improve hybrid survival. Newborn and fawn hybrids showed strong vitality, particularly with respect to adaptability, stress resistance, growth rate, cold tolerance and gastrointestinal disease resistance. Hybrid deer" displayed characteristics of both parents, provided more venison and exhibited more antler production than their female parents. The buck teasing method led to a higher conception rate than the estrus synchronization method. We determined that the optimal time to perform artificial insemination is from 14 to 18 h after the doe has entered estrus. Does that were overweight both before and during pregnancy often experienced dystocia. By contrast, does that were underweight often birthed fawns with congenital dysplasia. Additional days of lactation significantly increased the growth rate, immunity, and weaning survival rate of fawns without delaying return to estrus for the doe. This research should help improve the production capacity and adaptation of international hybrid deer for market diversification.

AB  - According to a prevailing hypothesis, lowland tropical organisms are unlikely to successfully cross mountain passes because they have neither acclimated nor adapted to the colder temperatures found at higher elevations. However, this expectation assumes that changes in temperature are uniform across space and fails to account for the presence of diverse microclimates created by structurally complex ecosystems, such as rainforests. We collected and analyzed temperature data from Afrotropical, Indomalayan, and Australasian tropical mountain ecosystems to determine the degree of overlap between lowland and upland thermal regimes in three selected microenvironments. The thermal regimes of upland and lowland forest canopies overlapped to a greater extent than the thermal regimes of upland and lowland soils or ground-level sites. Tree-dwelling animals may therefore be able to bypass temperature constraints imposed by geography by virtue of where they live, which could lead to broader distributions and greater resilience to climatic change and variability as compared with ground-dwelling species.

AB  - Continued and accelerating change in the thermal environment places an ever-greater priority on understanding how organisms are going to respond. The paradigm of 'move, adapt or die', regarding ways in which organisms can respond to environmental stressors, stimulates intense efforts to predict the future of biodiversity. Assuming that extinction is an unpalatable outcome, researchers have focussed attention on how organisms can shift in their distribution to stay in the same thermal conditions or can stay in the same place by adapting to a changing thermal environment. How likely these respective outcomes might be depends on the answer to a fundamental evolutionary question, namely what genetic changes underpin adaptation to the thermal environment. The increasing access to and decreasing costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, which can be applied to both model and non-model systems, provide a much-needed tool for understanding thermal adaptation. Here we consider broadly what is already known from non-NGS studies about thermal adaptation, then discuss the benefits and challenges of different NGS methodologies to add to this knowledge base. We then review published NGS genomics and transcriptomics studies of thermal adaptation to heat stress in metazoans and compare these results with previous non-NGS patterns. We conclude by summarising emerging patterns of genetic response and discussing future directions using these increasingly common techniques.

AB  - Understanding the mechanism of metabolic digestion and of food assimilation in wild snake species is of fundamental importance to compare trophic niches, their adaptive significance and evolutionary patterns of diet selection for different snake species. From two adult Hierophis viridiflavus males in fasting condition, we sampled gastric fluids using fiberoptic endoscopy. We analyzed the proteolytic activities (optimal pH and temperature, response to inhibitors) of snake samples by zymography techniques. The two major protease activity bands were always detected at every tested pH. Activity bands were also detectable over 37 degrees C; in particular both bands showed the highest activity ranging from 55 degrees C to 60 degrees C. Ranging from 65 degrees C to 85 degrees C, one band remained visible while the other band disappeared over 60 degrees C. The pattern of proteolytic enzymes activity of sampled gastric fluids highlighted a scenario composed of few active proteases, reflecting the feeding status (e.g., fasting) of studied snakes. Detection of proteolytic activity until 85 degrees C, as in prokaryotic organisms, supported the hypothesis about the presence of proteases of exogenous source.

AB  - Climate change is driving adaptive shifts within species, but research on plants has been focused on phenology. Leaf morphology has demonstrated links with climate and varies within species along climate gradients. We predicted that, given within-species variation along a climate gradient, a morphological shift should have occurred over time due to climate change. We tested this prediction, taking advantage of latitudinal and altitudinal variations within the Adelaide Geosyncline region, South Australia, historical herbarium specimens (n = 255) and field sampling (n 5 274). Leaf width in the study taxon, Dodonaea viscosa subsp. angustissima, was negatively correlated with latitude regionally, and leaf area was negatively correlated with altitude locally. Analysis of herbarium specimens revealed a 2 mm decrease in leaf width (total range 1-9 mm) over 127 years across the region. The results are consistent with a morphological response to contemporary climate change. We conclude that leaf width is linked to maximum temperature regionally (latitude gradient) and leaf area to minimum temperature locally (altitude gradient). These data indicate a morphological shift consistent with a direct response to climate change and could inform provenance selection for restoration with further investigation of the genetic basis and adaptive significance of observed variation.

AB  - Heterogeneous environments are typically expected to maintain more genetic variation in fitness within populations than homogeneous environments. However, the accuracy of this claim depends on the form of heterogeneity as well as the genetic basis of fitness traits and how similar the assay environment is to the environment of past selection. Here, we measure quantitative genetic (QG) variance for three traits important for fitness using replicated experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster evolving under four selective regimes: constant salt-enriched medium (Salt), constant cadmium-enriched medium (Cad), and two heterogeneous regimes that vary either temporally (Temp) or spatially (Spatial). As theory predicts, we found that Spatial populations tend to harbor more genetic variation than Temp populations or those maintained in a constant environment that is the same as the assay environment. Contrary to expectation, Salt populations tend to have more genetic variation than Cad populations in both assay environments. We discuss the patterns for QG variances across regimes in relation to previously reported data on genome-wide sequence diversity. For some traits, the QG patterns are similar to the diversity patterns of ecological selected SNPs, whereas the QG patterns for some other traits resembled that of neutral SNPs.

AB  - Three replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster were cultured at each of two temperatures (16.5 degrees C and 25 degrees C) in population cages for 4 yr. The lifespans of both sexes and the fecundity and fertility of the females were then measured at both experimental temperatures. The characters showed evidence of adaptation; flies of both sexes from each selection regime showed higher longevity, and females showed higher fecundity and fertility, than flies from the other selection regime when they were tested at the experimental temperature at which they had evolved. Calculation of intrinsic rates of increase under different assumptions about the rate of population increase showed that the difference between the lines from the two selection regimes became less the higher the rate of population increase, because the lines were more similar in early adulthood than they were later. Despite the increased adaptation of the low-temperature lines to the low temperature, like the high temperature lines they produced progeny at a higher rate at the higher temperature. The lines may have independently evolved adaptations to their respective thermal regimes during the experiment, or there may have been a trade-off between adaptation to the two temperatures, or mutation pressure may have lowered adaptation to the temperature that the flies no longer encountered.

AB  - Ecologists often assume that the evolutionary response to an environmental gradient will be the same as the phenotypic response. However, under some circumstances the evolutionary response to a gradient may be opposite of the ecological response, a phenomenon known as "countergradient variation." We had previously predicted that counter-gradient selection has occurred in pumpkinseed sunfish in response to a resource gradient created by competition with bluegill sunfish. Because competition only occurs when pumpkinseed are small, rapid growth has evolved to allow passage through the competing size classes as quickly as possible. We performed a common-garden experiment using juvenile pumpkinseed derived from lakes with bluegill and from lakes without bluegill. Pumpkinseed were raised in cages without bluegill, or with a low density of bluegill, or with a high density of bluegill. Bluegill significantly decreased growth for all pumpkinseed, following the predicted ecological gradient. However, pumpkinseed derived from lakes with bluegill grew faster than those from lakes without bluegill under all treatments, following the predicted evolutionary response.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effect of stocking density (125 or 200 fish m(-3)) on the growth performance of three strains of the Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus: the non-improved strain (NS), the genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT) and the Freshwater Aquaculture Center selected tilapia known as the FaST selected line (SL). Each strain and density combination was triplicated in 0.42 m(3) fibreglass tanks within a re-circulating water system. Water temperature was maintained at 29.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C. Large Nile tilapia having a mean body weight of 100-110 g were stocked in each tank and hand-fed four times daily with commercial tilapia pellets (35% protein) for 104 days. Results showed that at the two stocking densities, the GIFT and SL strains showed a significantly higher (P < 0.05) mean weight (MWT), daily growth rate (DGR), specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and gross yield (GY) than the NS. In all three strains, growth performance was negatively affected by stocking density. The lower density (125 fish m(-3)) treatments had significantly higher MWT, DGR and SGR than the higher density one (200 fish m(-3)). However, higher FCR and GY were observed at the higher density. Survival rates were high in all treatments and were not affected by strain or density. In general, the SL strain had better growth parameters than the GIFT strain. The findings of this study demonstrated the superior growth performance of the improved strains at both densities compared with the NS. The higher density (200 fish m(-3)) could be more profitable for the tilapia farms in Kuwait than the lower density of (125 fish m(-3)) in terms of reduced land cost and facilities, demand on the limited low-salinity underground water and manpower.

AB  - Differences between sexes in physiological performance have received little attention in animals. We tested for sex differences in maximum sprint speed and maximal exertion over a range of temperatures in a population of Platysaurus intermedius wilhelmi lizards. We also examined sex-based differences in selected temperature range, mean field body temperatures (T-b), and thermal activity limits. Finally, we conducted field studies to quantify male and female responses to a potential predator, which may be affected by their respective performance capabilities. Males were faster than females at all temperatures, and body size had no significant effect on sprint speeds. Males and females also selected similar T-b's when placed in a thermal gradient, but in the field, male lizards' T-b's were different from those of the females. However, predicted sprint speeds for males and females at their field T-b's are similar. No significant differences were found between males and females with regard to maximal exertion. When approached in the field, adult male lizards took refuge significantly earlier than did adult females and also fled over shorter distances, suggesting that females rely on crypsis as an escape strategy.

AB  - The duration of Drosophila melanogaster larval and pupal periods was measured in laboratory thermal lines and in populations collected along a latitudinal transect in eastern Australia. In replicated laboratory lines kept for 9 years at 16.5 degrees C or 25 degrees C the duration of larval development had continued to diverge compared with 4 and 5 years previously, with more rapid larval development, and hence reduced total duration of pre-adult development, in the low temperature lines at both experimental temperatures. After 4 years of separate evolution, lines derived from the 25 degrees C lines and subsequently cultured at 29 degrees C showed no evidence of significant divergence in the duration of any part of the pre-adult period. The geographic populations showed a decrease in the duration of larval development, and hence of the total pre-adult period, with increasing latitude. In both laboratory and field populations, evolution at lower temperature was associated with more rapid larval development to a larger adult body size, the opposite genetic correlation between these traits to that found within a single temperature. The indications are that lower temperatures may be permissive of more efficient growth in D. melanogaster. It will be important to discover if evolution in response to temperature induces similar correlations in other ectotherms.

AB  - The ignition of a solid exposed to a step in surface temperature, including the effect of the curvature, is analyzed by means of large activation energy asymptotics in the whole range of values of the Damkohler number, D-a, which lead to a thermal runaway. For very large values of D-a the chemical reaction takes place in a surface boundary layer. The evolution of the temperature in this layer is described by a universal problem. Its solution contains a mathematical singularity, which identifies the ignition event occuring at an ignition time much smaller than the conduction time through the solid. When D-a is large but of the same order that the square of the nondimensional activation energy, the ignition time becomes of the order of the conduction time. The structure of the ignition problem is identical to that in the previous case, but its solution depends on the body size and shape. In both cases an initial quasisteady stage is followed by a transition stage in which the nonsteady effects must be retained. Finally, for D-a of order unity the chemical reaction extends over the whole solid, and the ignition process can be described in terms of a first inert heating stage and a second reacting stage in which the temperature evolves according a nonsteady Frank-Kamenetskii equation.

AB  - Ectothermic animals exhibit two distinct kinds of plasticity in response to temperature: Thermal performance curves (TPCs), in which an individual's performance (e.g., growth rate) varies in response to current temperature; and developmental reaction norms (DRNs), in which the trait value (e.g., adult body size or development time) of a genotype varies in response to developmental temperatures experienced over some time period during development. Here we explore patterns of genetic variation and selection on TPCs and DRNs for insects in fluctuating thermal environments. First, we describe two statistical methods for partitioning total genetic variation into variation for overall size or performance and variation in plasticity, and apply these methods to available datasets on DRNs and TPCs for insect growth and size. Our results indicate that for the datasets we considered, genetic variation in plasticity represents a larger proportion of the total genetic variation in TPCs compared to DRNs, for the available datasets. Simulations suggest that estimates of the genetic variation in plasticity are strongly affected by the number and range of temperatures considered, and by the degree of nonlinearity in the TPC or DRN. Second, we review a recent analysis of field selection studies which indicates that directional selection favoring increased overall size is common in many systems-that bigger is frequently fitter. Third, we use a recent theoretical model to examine how selection on thermal performance curves relates to environmental temperatures during selection. The model predicts that if selection acts primarily on adult size or development time, then selection on thermal performance curves for larval growth or development rates is directly related to the frequency distribution of temperatures experienced during larval development. Using data on caterpillar temperatures in the field, we show that the strength of directional selection on growth rate is predicted to be greater at the modal (most frequent) temperatures, not at the mean temperature or at temperatures at which growth rate is maximized. Our results illustrate some of the differences in genetic architecture and patterns of selection between thermal performance curves and developmental reaction norms.

AB  - The root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, was cultured monoxenically on oriental-melon (Cucumis melo L.) roots transformed by Agrobacterium rhizogenes at various temperatures. The developmental zero degree of the nematode was 10.9-degrees-C. The day-degrees for the onset of oviposition were 293, and 473 for completing one generation after inoculation with 2nd-stage juveniles. There were no significant differences in the dimensions of eggs and pre-parasitic 2nd-stage juveniles between transformed roots and intact plant roots, although a slight temperature-dependency was seen in body length, tail length, and the a-avalue of juveniles. Regarding the infectivity on six differential host plants, juveniles produced on transformed roots were the same as those produced on intact host plant roots. These results suggest that the transformed root system is appropriate for culture of root-knot nematodes under sterile conditions.

AB  - 1.The chief objectives were as follows: (i) to describe and compare quantitatively the life cycles of the summer and overwintering generations of Baetis rhodani, including laboratory experiments to determine the number of eggs laid per female and the number of larval instars; (ii) to test Dyar's hypothesis; and (iii) to test for density dependence in the life cycle. Samples of larvae and downstream-drifting adults (newly emerged subimagines and spent female imagines) and counts of egg masses were taken every 2weeks over 39months in a small stony stream. 2.Although females from the summer generation were smaller than those from the overwintering generation and laid fewer eggs, the relationship between the number of eggs laid by a female and body length was the same for both generations, being described by a power function. An exponential equation described the relationship between the mean body length of each instar and instar number; hence, Dyar's hypothesis was validated. Adult males emerged after 17 or 18 larval instars and females after 18 or 19 instars in the summer generation, with higher values of 25 or 26 instars for males and 26 or 27 instars for females in the overwintering generation. Mean instar body length in the summer generation was always larger than that in the overwintering generation, but this did not produce larger final instar larvae because the fewer instars resulted in males and females being smaller on emergence than in the overwintering generation. 3.Male subimagines started to emerge before females, and their emergence patterns indicated that there were two cohorts in each generation. Ovipositing females in the first cohort were always larger than those in the second cohort. Therefore, four mean values for eggs/female (=eggs/egg mass) were used to convert egg masses per m2 to eggs laid per m2. Larvae were divided into six stages: I=instar 1, II=instars 25, III=instars 610, IV=instars 1116, V=instars 1724 (overwintering generation only) and VI=final instars prior to emergence. There were two clear modal densities for each larval stage in each generation, confirming the presence of two cohorts. 4.These modal densities were used to estimate loss rates between successive larval stages, and k-factor analysis' was used to examine the relationship between loss rates for a particular larval stage and the modal value for eggs or larvae at the start of that stage. Loss rates in larval stage II were density dependent and were when population regulation occurred. For all other larval stages, loss rates were density independent and fairly constant with no significant differences between the two generations. Life tables were constructed for egg densities close to the range of modal values found in the stream (133211512m2). The egg density that yielded the maximum number of final instar larvae, and hence adults, was 27002750m2 with poorer survival for initial egg densities below and above these values. 5.This study has shown that (i) the mechanism for population regulation was density-dependent survival in larval stage II (instars 25); (ii) the importance of obtaining information on egg densities and their role in density-dependent processes; (iii) the necessity of frequent sampling for a quantitative description of complex life cycles of aquatic insects.

AB  - How are organisms responding to climate change? The rapidity with which climate is changing suggests that, in species with long generation times, adaptive evolution may be too slow to keep pace with climate change, and that alternative mechanisms, such as behavioural plasticity, may be necessary for population persistence. Species with temperature-dependent sex determination may be particularly threatened by climate change, because altered temperatures could skew sex ratios. We experimentally tested nest-site choice in the long-lived turtle Chrysemys picta to determine whether nesting behaviour can compensate for potential skews in sex ratios caused by rapid climate change. We collected females from five populations across the species' range and housed them in a semi-natural common garden. Under these identical conditions, populations differed in nesting phenology (likely due to nesting frequency), and in nest depth (possibly due to a latitudinal cline in female body size), but did not differ in choice of shade cover over the nest, nest incubation regime, or in resultant nest sex ratios. These results suggest that choice of nest sites with particular shade cover may be a behaviourally plastic mechanism by which turtles can compensate for change in climatic temperatures during embryonic development, provided that sufficient environmental variation in potential nest microhabitat is available.

AB  - Global warming and fisheries harvest are significantly impacting wild fish stocks, yet their interactive influence on population resilience to stress remains unclear. We explored these interactive effects on early-life development and survival by experimentally manipulating the thermal and harvest regimes in 18 zebrafish (Danio rerio) populations over six consecutive generations. Warming advanced development rates across generations, but after three generations, it caused a sudden and large (30?50%) decline in recruitment. This warming impact was most severe in populations where size-selective harvesting reduced the average size of spawners. We then explored whether our observed recruitment decline could be explained by changes in egg size, early egg and larval survival, population sex ratio, and developmental costs. We found that it was most likely driven by temperature-induced shifts in embryonic development rate and fishing-induced male-biased sex ratios. Importantly, once harvest and warming were relaxed, recruitment rates rapidly recovered. Our study suggests that the effects of warming and fishing could have strong impacts on wild stock recruitment, but this may take several generations to manifest. However, resilience of wild populations may be higher if fishing preserves sufficient body size diversity, and windows of suitable temperature periodically occur.

AB  - The phenotypic effects of genetic and environmental manipulations have been rarely investigated simultaneously. In addition to phenotypic plasticity, their effect on the amount and directions of genetic and phenotypic variation is of particular evolutionary importance because these constitute the material for natural selection. Here, we used heterozygous insertional mutations of 16 genes involved in the formation of the Drosophila wing. The flies were raised at two developmental temperatures (18 degrees C and 28 degrees C). Landmark-based geometric morphometrics was used to analyze the variation of the wing size and shape at different hierarchical levels: among genotypes and temperatures; among individuals within group; and fluctuating asymmetry (FA). Our results show that (1) the phenotypic effects of the mutations depend on temperature; (2) reciprocally, most mutations affect wing plasticity; (3) both temperature and mutations modify the levels of FA and of among individuals variation within lines. Remarkably, the patterns of shape FA seem unaffected by temperature whereas those associated with individual variation are systematically altered. By modifying the direction of available phenotypic variation, temperature might thus directly affect the potential for further evolution. It suggests as well that the developmental processes responsible for developmental stability and environmental canalization might be partially distinct.

AB  - We measured the size of eggs produced by populations of Drosophila melanogaster, that had been collected along latitudinal gradients in different continents or that had undergone several years of culture at different temperatures in the laboratory. Australian and South American populations from higher latitudes produced larger eggs when ail were compared at a standard temperature. Laboratory populations that had been evolving at 16.5 degrees C produced larger eggs than populations that had evolved at 25 degrees C or 29 degrees C, suggesting that temperature may be an important selective agent in producing the latitudinal dines. Flies from laboratory populations produced larger eggs at an experimental temperature of 16.5 degrees C than at 25 degrees C, and there was no indication of genotype-environment interaction for egg size. Evolution of egg size in response to temperature cannot be accounted for by differences in adult body size between populations. It is not clear which life-history traits are direct targets of thermal selection and which are showing correlated responses, and disentangling these is a task for the future.

AB  - Global biodiversity is threatened by multiple anthropogenic stressors but little is known about the combined effects of environmental warming and invasive species on ecosystem functioning. We quantified thermal preferences and then compared leaf-litter processing rates at eight different temperatures (5.0-22.5 degrees C) by the invasive freshwater crustacean Dikerogammarus villosus and the Great Britain native Gammarus pulex at a range of body sizes. D. villosus preferred warmer temperatures but there was considerable overlap in the range of temperatures that the two species occupied during preference trials. When matched for size, G. pulex had a greater leaf shredding efficiency than D. villosus, suggesting that invasion and subsequent displacement of the native amphipod will result in reduced ecosystem functioning. However, D. villosus is an inherently larger species and interspecific variation in shredding was reduced when animals of a representative size range were compared. D. villosus shredding rates increased at a faster rate than G. pulex with increasing temperature suggesting that climate change may offset some of the reduction in function. D. villosus, but not G. pulex, showed evidence of an ability to select those temperatures at which its shredding rate was maximised, and the activation energy for shredding in D. villosus was more similar to predictions from metabolic theory. While per capita and mass-corrected shredding rates were lower in the invasive D. villosus than the native G. pulex, our study provides novel insights in to how the interactive effects of metabolic function, body size, behavioural thermoregulation, and density produce antagonistic effects between anthropogenic stressors.

GS information is available for several Pomacentridae species, which have adapted over evolutionary time mainly in reef environments. In the present study, we used comparative phylogenetic methods to evaluate the role of ecological variables in driving GS variation in 49 species of this family. We also aimed to understand how GS evolved, evaluating five continuous character evolution models. We found that GS varied 1.98-fold, with C-values ranging from 0.68 pg (Pomacentrus auriventris) to 1.35 pg (Chrysiptera hemicyanea). Our phylogenetic analyses, based on mitochondrial and nuclear sequences, revealed that Pomacentridae diversification into two main clades occurred similar to 58 Mya, with the two clades showing distinct evolutionary trends. Character reconstruction of GS values revealed expansions and retractions in GS with convergences and parallelisms in different lineages. We also found a significant association between GS and body size and proxies of niche breadth (temperature and salinity), suggesting that species with larger genomes tend to occupy a wider niche breadth. Thus, GS variation may influence the life histories of Pomacentridae fishes, independently of their evolutionary relationships.

AB  - Temperature imposes significant constraints on ectothermic animals, and these organisms have evolved numerous adaptations to respond to these constraints. While the impacts of temperature on the physiology of ectotherms have been extensively studied, there are currently no frameworks available that outline the multiple and often simultaneous pathways by which temperature can affect behaviour. Drawing from the literature on insects, we propose a unified framework that should apply to all ectothermic animals, generalizing temperature's behavioural effects into: (1) kinetic effects, resulting from temperature's bottom-up constraining influence on metabolism and neurophysiology over a range of timescales (from short to long term), and (2) integrated effects, where the top-down integration of thermal information intentionally initiates or modifies a behaviour (behavioural thermoregulation, thermal orientation, thermosensory behavioural adjustments). We discuss the difficulty in distinguishing adaptive behavioural changes from constraints when observing animals' behavioural responses to temperature. We then propose two complementary approaches to distinguish adaptations from constraints, and categorize behaviours according to our framework: (i) kinetic null modelling' of temperature's effects on behaviour; and (ii) behavioural ecology experiments using temperature-insensitive mutants. Our framework should help to guide future research on the complex relationship between temperature and behaviour in ectothermic animals.

AB  - Little is known about the evolutionary implications of habitat fragmentation, although altered selection regimes could influence the genetic constitution of fragmented populations. In particular, fragmentation might lead to selection for enhanced stress resistance and tolerance of unfavorable environmental conditions. We investigated the evolutionary consequences of habitat fragmentation in Drosophila birchii flies from small fragments and the interior of large forests of northern Queensland, Australia, in three consecutive years. Evolved differences were detected in a common garden design. Flies from fragments were larger and less desiccation resistant, particularly in the first year, when they also developed faster, and had higher preadult survival under fluctuating temperatures. Furthermore, juvenile survival and adult body size were linked to a measure of habitat quality, the abundance of D. birchii in nature. The results support the hypothesis that fragmentation and habitat quality impose divergent selection. The results also bolster the conservation strategy of maintaining genetic variation for ecologically relevant traits, because persistence in fragmented habitats seems to depend on genetic variation in multiple expressed traits.

AB  - The notothenioid fishes of the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica are remarkable examples of organismal adaptation to extreme cold. Their evolution since the mid-Miocene in geographical isolation and a chronically cold marine environment has resulted in extreme stenothermality of the extant species. Given the unique thermal history of the notothenioids, one may ask what traits have been gained, and conversely, what characters have been lost through change in the information content of their genomes. Two dramatic changes that epitomize such evolutionary transformations are the gain of novel antifreeze proteins, which are obligatory for survival in icy seawater, by most notothenioids and the paradoxical loss of respiratory haemoproteins and red blood cells, normally deemed indispensable for vertebrate life, by the species of a highly derived notothenioid family, the icefishes. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of these traits and their evolution and suggest future avenues of investigation.
   The formerly coherent paradigm of notothenioid freeze avoidance, developed from three decades of study of antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP) based cold adaptation, now faces challenges stemming from the recent discovery of antifreeze-deficient, yet freeze-resistant, early notothenioid life stages and from definitive evidence that the liver is not the physiological source of AFGPs in notothenioid blood. The resolution of these intriguing observations is likely to reveal new physiological traits that are unique to the notothenioids. Similarly, the model of AFGP gene evolution from a notothenioid pancreatic trypsinogen-like gene precursor is being expanded and refined based on genome-level analyses of the linked AFGP loci and their ancestral precursors. Finally, the application of comparative genomics to study evolutionary change in the AFGP genotypes of cool-temperate notothenioids from sub-Antarctic habitats, where these genes are not necessary, will contribute to the mechanistic understanding of the dynamics of AFGP gene gain and loss.
   In humans and most vertebrates, mutations in the alpha- or beta-globin genes or defects in globin chain synthesis are causes of severe genetic disease. Thus, the 16 species of haemoglobinless, erythrocytenull icefishes are surprising anomalies-in fact, they could only have evolved and thrived due to relaxed selection pressure for oxygen-binding proteins in the cold, oxygen-rich waters of the Southern Ocean. Fifteen of the sixteen icefish species have lost most of the adult alpha beta-globin locus and retain only a small 3' fragment of the alpha-globin gene. The only exception to this pattern occurs in Neopagetopsis ionah, which possesses a disrupted alpha beta-globin gene complex that probably represents a non-functional intermediate on the evolutionary pathway to near total globin gene extinction. By contrast, six of the icefish species fail to express myoglobin. The absence of myoglobin expression has occurred by several independent mutations and distinct mechanisms. Haemoprotein loss is correlated with dramatic increases in cellular mitochondrial density, heart size, blood volume and capillary bed volume. Evolution of these compensatory traits was probably facilitated by the homeostatic activity of nitric oxide, a key modulator of angiogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis. These natural knockouts of the red blood cell lineage are an excellent genomic resource for erythroid gene discovery by comparative genomics, as illustrated for the newly described gene, bloodthirsty.

AB  - Pollutant effects on aquatic key species are confounded by multiple abiotic and biotic stressors. To better discriminate and understand the intrinsic and environmental correlates of changing aquatic ecosystems, we untangle in present study how the effects of a low-dosed fungicide on daphnids (via different exposure routes) becomes modified by increasing temperature and the presence of a predator.
   Using a fractional multifactorial test design, the individual growth, reproduction and population growth rate of Daphnia pulex were investigated under exposure to the fungicide pyrimethanil at an environmental relevant concentration - either directly (via the water phase), indirectly (via food), dually (via water and food) or for multiple generations (fungicide treated source population) - at three temperatures and in presence/absence of the predator kairomones of Chaoborus flavicans.
   Our results clearly illustrate that multiple stress factors can modify the response of an aquatic key species to pollutants. The environmentally relevant exposure of the contaminant via food or the medium is of same importance. Nevertheless, temperature and the presence of a predator are the dominant factors controlling the reproduction of D. pulex. We conclude that sublethal pyrimethanil pollution can disturb the zooplankton community at suboptimal temperature conditions, but the effects will become masked by low temperatures or if chaoborid larvae are present.

AB  - We studied the effects of exposure to seawater equilibrated with CO2-enriched air (CO2 2380 ppm) from eggs to maturity and over two subsequent generations on the copepod Acartia tsuensis. Compared to the control (CO2 380 ppm), high CO2 exposure through all life stages of the 1st generation copepods did not significantly affect survival, body size or developmental speed. Egg production and hatching rates were also not significantly different between the initial generation of females exposed to high CO2 and the 1st and 2nd generation females developed from eggs to maturity in high CO2. Thus, the copepods appear more tolerant to increased CO2 than other marine organisms previously investigated for CO2 tolerance (i.e., sea urchins and bivalves). However, the crucial importance of copepods in marine ecosystems requires thorough evaluation of the overall impacts of marine environmental changes predicted to occur with increased CO2 concentrations, i.e., increased temperature, enhanced UV irradiation, and changes in the community structure and nutritional value of phytoplankton.

AB  - Invasive freshwater species are reported to have tolerance of salinity stress that allows them colonizing new sites in estuaries. Pomacea canaliculata, a gastropod that disperses from its native freshwater habitats to penetrate estuarine environments in invaded regions has raised considerable concern. Previous studies indicated P. canaliculata can survive a short period of exposure at certain environmental salinity. However, salinity tolerance of snails remains unknown in context of a possible long-term acclimation that may further facilitate dispersal into estuaries. Here, in a laboratory experiment, juvenile snails were first exposed to four different levels of pre-acclimation salinity (0, 2, 4 or 6 psu) for 30 days randomly. Snails in each level of pre-acclimation salinity were then transferred to five salinity treatments (8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 psu) separately, with three replicates for each salinity stressor. Pomacea canaliculata pre-acclimated in low salinity environments could survive at least 5 days when exposed to salinities less than 12 psu, with the maximum body weight gains rate (WG, 30.369 +/- 1.418%) and specific growth rate (SGR, 1.326 +/- 0.032% d(-1)). Half of the snails pre-acclimated at 6 psu survived over 25-31 days when exposed to a stressor of 8 psu. The upper limit of pre-acclimation (6 psu) was optimal for post-adaptation of P. canaliculata to stressful saline environments (from 8 to 16 psu). We determined the salinity stress tolerances of the invasive P. canaliculata and examined the effects of salinity pre-acclimation on its survival and growth. The results on enhanced salinity tolerance of P. canaliculata through gradual acclimation is of particular importance to brackish environments (e.g. alkaline lakes, mangrove habitats) of tropical and subtropical coasts. Given the high adaptability of P. canaliculata and its potential threats, early detection and management strategies should urgently be implemented in these regions.

AB  - Selection for increased life span in Drosophila melanogaster has been shown to correlate with decreased early fecundity and increased fecundity later in life. This phenomenon has been ascribed to the existence of trade-offs in which limited resources can be invested in either somatic maintenance or reproduction. In our longevity selection lines, we did not find such a trade-off. Rather, we find that females have similar or higher fecundity throughout life compared to non-selected controls. To determine whether increased longevity affects responses in other traits, we looked at several stress resistance traits (chill coma recovery, heat knockdown, desiccation and starvation), geotactic behaviour, egg-to-adult viability, body size, developmental time as well as metabolic rate. Longevity selected flies were more starvation resistant. However, in females longevity and fecundity were not negatively correlated with the other traits assayed. Males from longevity selected lines were slower at recovering from a chill induced coma and resting metabolic rate increased with age, but did not correlate with life span. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Nongenetic inheritance is a potentially important but poorly understood factor in population responses to rapid environmental change. Accumulating evidence indicates that nongenetic inheritance influences a diverse array of traits in all organisms and can allow for the transmission of environmentally induced phenotypic changes (acquired traits), as well as spontaneously arising and highly mutable variants. We review models of adaptation to changing environments under the assumption of a broadened model of inheritance that incorporates nongenetic mechanisms of transmission, and survey relevant empirical examples. Theory suggests that nongenetic inheritance can increase the rate of both phenotypic and genetic change and, in some cases, alter the direction of change. Empirical evidence shows that a diversity of phenotypes spanning a continuum from adaptive to pathological can be transmitted nongenetically. The presence of nongenetic inheritance therefore complicates our understanding of evolutionary responses to environmental change. We outline a research program encompassing experimental studies that test for transgenerational effects of a range of environmental factors, followed by theoretical and empirical studies on the population-level consequences of such effects.

AB  - Predicted changes in global temperature are expected to increase extinction risk for ectotherms, primarily through increased metabolic rates. Higher metabolic rates generate increased maintenance energy costs which are a major component of energy budgets. Organisms often employ plastic or evolutionary (e.g., local adaptation) mechanisms to optimize metabolic rate with respect to their environment. We examined relationships between temperature and standard metabolic rate across four populations of a widespread amphibian species to determine if populations vary in metabolic response and if their metabolic rates are plastic to seasonal thermal cues. Populations from warmer climates lowered metabolic rates when acclimating to summer temperatures as compared to spring temperatures. This may act as an energy saving mechanism during the warmest time of the year. No such plasticity was evident in populations from cooler climates. Both juvenile and adult salamanders exhibited metabolic plasticity. Although some populations responded to historic climate thermal cues, no populations showed plastic metabolic rate responses to future climate temperatures, indicating there are constraints on plastic responses. We postulate that impacts of warming will likely impact the energy budgets of salamanders, potentially affecting key demographic rates, such as individual growth and investment in reproduction.

AB  - Tsetse flies, Glossina pallidipes (Diptera: Glossinidae) are said to have strong dispersal tendencies. Gene flow among these populations is estimated to be the theoretical equivalent of no more than one or two reproducing flies per generation, thereby raising the hypothesis of local regimes of natural selection. Flies were sampled from four environmentally diverse locations in Kenya to determine whether populations are homogeneous in desiccation tolerance and cuticular lipids. Cuticular hydrocarbon fractions known to act as sex pheromones do not differ among populations, thereby eliminating sexual selection as an isolating mechanism. Cuticular lipid quantities vary among populations and are not correlated with prevailing temperatures, humidities, and normalized density vegetation indices. Females demonstrate a stronger correlation than males between cuticular lipid mass and body weight. Desiccation rates also vary among populations, but are not correlated with the amounts of cuticular lipid. Chemical analysis of cuticular hydrocarbons by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy shows that one of the four populations has more 11,15- and 11,21-dimethyl-31 hydrocarbon on females. These results are discussed in the context of population differences and estimates of gene flow.

AB  - Experiments were conducted to study the life cycle of Dermestes maculatus and to establish the total developmental time and the developmental time of immature stages, in relation with six different temperatures. We also analyzed the variations in size, morphology, and other indicators of temporal variation during life cycle of D. maculatus, in relation with temperature. One hundred larvae were selected per experiment, reared individually. The remaining larvae were reared to evaluate and establish temporal variations among the instars (length, cephalic width, and dry weight). In all trials, survivorship was greater than 50% and seven larval instars were found. Data of the average developmental time of immature stages and of the total cycle, at different temperatures, are provided. This is of relevance when estimating particularly, a minimum PMI. No relation between morphometric parameters and temperature was found, suggesting that other random factors may have been involved. Thus, this indicates that the method of isomegalen diagrams could not be used for calculating PMI.

AB  - The maternal manipulation hypothesis for the evolution of reptilian viviparity has been claimed to apply to any situation where gravid females are able to maintain body temperatures different from those available in external nests, but empirical data that support this hypothesis are very limited. Here, we tested this hypothesis using gravid females of a warm-climate lizard, Mabuya multifasciata, by subjecting them to five thermal regimes for the whole gestation period. We found gravid females selected lower body temperatures and thermoregulated more precisely than did nongravid females. Offspring produced in different treatments differed in head size, limb length and sprint speed, but not in overall body size or mass. Variation in morphological traits of offspring was induced primarily by extreme temperatures. Sprint speed of offspring was more likely affected by the mean but not by the variance of gestation temperatures. Gravid females maintained more stable body temperatures than did nongravid females not because these temperatures resulted in the optimization of offspring phenotypes but because the range of temperatures optimal for embryonic development was relatively narrow. Our data conform to the main predictions from the maternal manipulation hypothesis that females should adjust thermoregulation during pregnancy to provide optimal thermal conditions for developing embryos and that phenotypic traits forged by maternal thermoregulation should enhance offspring fitness.

AB  - Environmental factors have a varied impact on the development of juvenile and adult Cladocera, depending on their different physiological conditions and body size. The values of these factors alter spatially and temporarily thus implying that they play a role in the spatial distribution of the pre-reproductive and potentially reproductive stages of cladocerans. The aim of the study was to determine seasonal and spatial variations in the distribution of juvenile and adult individuals of limnetic Cladocera in relation to selected physico-chemical factors (temperature, conductivity, pH, concentration of dissolved oxygen, total organic carbon, total suspended solids) and fish predation pressure (measured by Chesson's coefficient lambda) in deep Lake Piaseczno (eastern Poland). Adult Cladocera displayed spatial distribution related to fish predation pressure. The species selectively eaten, B. coregoni and D. longispina, and non-selectively eaten, D. cucullata, selected the pelagic zone to exist, whereas those avoided by fish, D. brachyurum and B. longirostris, were evenly distributed in the littoral and pelagic zone. Juvenile cladocerans were strongly impacted by physico-chemical factors. Juvenile Daphnia, Diaphanosoma and B. longirostris showed preferences to biotic zones similar to the adults but differed in their habitat choices. Juvenile and adult stages of B. coregoni differed in their distribution, indicating that adult individuals impacted by high predation pressure alternatively modified their habitat selection. Principal component analysis (PCA) ordination showed a seasonal tendency for the spatial segregation of the cladocerans, suggesting that possible competitive interactions between the studied cladocerans may also influence their distribution patterns.

AB  - The need to find new alternative energy sources brings with it the use of unconventional power generation sources such as bicycles and the question arises as to how safe these sources are from the user's perspective. The present work consists in the estimation of a parameter of easy evaluation, for the safe use of a conventional bicycle in the generation of electrical energy. The generation of energy is achieved by coupling a bicycle to an electric alternator and this to an inverter. The load used was a 100 W lamp. The measurement of non-physiological parameters such as vibration, ambient temperature and pedaling speed as well as certain physiological parameters such as heart rate (HR) and body temperature, were used to determine both physiological and electrical signals when the user is overexerting. A protocol oriented to two routines was defined to evaluate the use of the bicycle in conditions of maximum effort and conditions of safe operation. Eight people between the ages of 22 and 32, body weights from 56 kg to 80 kg and heights from 1.59 m to 1.84 m participated. Voltage and current readings were taken to estimate the power and energy generated by the participants. In the process of user-bike interaction it was found that when the participant over-exerted, he/she resorted to compensatory postural movements to maintain the pedaling speed. These compensatory movements made it possible to observe a relationship between the first derivative of vibration and HR.

AB  - Calanus sinicus is the dominant copepod species in the coastal waters of China. We studied its population dynamics using an individual-based model (IBM) based on physiological processes at the individual level. The model includes modules describing development, growth, reproduction, mortality, diel vertical migration and diapause. Development, growth and reproduction are affected mainly by temperature and food concentration. Mortality includes routine mortality of stage plus density-dependent mortality, and weight-dependent mortality for N1-C6 stages. Control of seasonal diapause is based on lipid accumulation and lipid metabolism. The model was applied in a 1-dimensional water column located in the central Yellow Sea, and simulations showed that the population of C. sinicus peaks twice in 1 yr, with the earlier peak depending strongly on the phytoplankton bloom in spring, and the later (December) peak relying on lipid-stored energy from the over-summering population dominated by diapausing C5s. The model population of C. sinicus goes through 3 generations in 1 yr, and the over-summering population of diapausing C5s consists of both first (G1) and second (G2) generation individuals. Coupled with more extensive field observations of abundance and biomass of C. sinicus, an IBM can be forced using output from an integrated hydrodynamic-nutrient-phytoplankton model to examine the processes responsible for the spatial-temporal variation of C. sinicus throughout its range in the Yellow Sea.

AB  - Thelytokous Wolbachia-infected Trichogramma species have long been considered as biological control agents against lepidopteran pests in agriculture and forestry. Wolbachia has been suggested to increase the probability of the superparasitism of Trichogramma, but the fate of infected offspring in the superparasitised host is still unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate the fitness of thelytokous Wolbachia-infected (TDW) and bisexual Wolbachia-free (TD) Trichogramma dendrolimi Matsumura (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) lines in superparasitised or single-parasitised hosts. The results showed that irrespective of whether Trichogramma wasps were developed from superparasitised or single-parasitised hosts, the TDW line was characterized by reduced fitness, including lower fecundity, shorter longevity, and smaller body size of F1 offspring, and lower emergence rate of F2 offspring than the TD line. This was not true for the survival rate and developmental time of F1 offspring. Additionally, the fitness parameters of T. dendrolimi that developed from superparasitised hosts were lower compared with that of T. dendrolimi that developed from single-parasitised hosts. Interestingly, Wolbachia-infected females had higher dispersal capacity than bisexual females when they developed from superparasitised hosts. The results indicated that Wolbachia negatively affects fitness of T. dendrolimi, but enhance dispersal capacity of T. dendrolimi females in superparasitism condition. Further studies need to be carried out to select the best line that will allow Wolbachia and their host Trichogramma to be better adapted to one another.

AB  - A rare diminutive belemnite, Pumiliobelus n. gen., is described based on the new species P. haigi and P. tumidus from the upper Gearle Siltstone (Cenomanian) of the Carnarvon Basin, Western Australia. No smaller belemnites than these species are known. That they are based on adult specimens rather than juveniles is supported by a large sample, some 80 specimens, of P. haigi which collectively show a proportional range in size typical of belemnite species in general, a group in which juveniles are conspicuously lacking in the fossil record. Rostral morphology places Pumiliobelus in the Dimitobelidae, a distinctively Austral family of Aptian-Maastrichtian age, which became progressively restricted to high latitudes through the late Cretaceous. Each species of Pumiliobelus is known from a single locality where it co-occurs with the long-ranging (Albian-Cenomanian) Dimitobelus diptychus Whitehouse of widespread distribution at mid to high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Dwarfism in the Dimitobelidae, as expressed by Pumiliobelus, is considered to reflect adaptive evolution to engage opportunistic life strategies that favored small body size and rapid population turnover. The rare occurrence of dwarf Dimitobelidae indicates that such strategies were limited in both geographic range and duration. Dwarfism expressed by Pumiliobelus may relate to paedomorphosis induced by rising seawater temperatures in the mid Cretaceous.

AB  - In seasonal environments, natural selection should favor genotypes that acclimate to slow and predictable changes in temperature. Selective pressure for acclimation should be especially strong for animals that complete many generations per year, because seasonal warming or cooling causes offspring to experience different temperatures than their parents did. Here, we studied variation in acclimation capacity among three populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We used a reverse acclimation design to see whether developmental acclimation persisted throughout adulthood. Flies developed from fertilization to adulthood at either 16 degrees or 26 degrees C. Then, flies either remained at the same temperature or moved to the other temperature for 7 days. We measured fecundity at seven temperatures ranging from 14 degrees to 36 degrees C. Genotypes from North Carolina and Vermont laid more eggs at 16 degrees C after spending the larval and adult stages at 16 degrees C, instead of 26 degrees C. In both populations, the benefit of acclimation to 16 degrees C during development was erased by acclimation to 26 degrees C during adulthood. In contrast to our prediction, genotypes from Indiana laid fewer eggs at 16 C or 26 degrees C after developing at this temperature. Overall, these data provide only weak support for the models of optimal acclimation in seasonal environments.

AB  - The community structure and life cycle of dominant chaetognath species were studied in a 0-1000-m water column in the Oyashio region, western subarctic Pacific, six times during the year from March 2003 to February 2004. The abundance of chaetognaths ranged from 3235 to 6691 inds. m(-2). Throughout the study period, ten chaetognath species belonging to nine genera were identified. Among the chaetognaths, Eukrohnia hamata accounted for 39-62% of the abundance, followed by E. hamata/Eukrohnia bathypelagica juveniles, Parasagitta elegans, and E. bathypelagica. The species diversity (H') of chaetognaths varied between 1.12 and 1.50. For E. hamata, individuals had a body length ranging from 2.3-23.8 mm. The abundance of juveniles fluctuated from 22.0-48.3% and was higher in June 2003. Based on cohort analysis, recruitment of E. hamata juveniles occurred from spring to summer, and they reached a body length of 8 mm in one year. The overwintered population showed rapid growth from June to October, when they reached 15 mm in body length. Eukrohnia hamata showed little growth in winter and reproduced the subsequent spring. Thus, a two-year life cycle of E. hamata is proposed for the population in the Oyashio region. For comparable information about the life cycle of E. hamata, an eight to ten-month generation length was reported for the population in the eastern subarctic Pacific. These regional differences in the generation length of E. hamata are attributed to differences in habitat temperature, with much higher temperatures in the eastern (3.8-6.0 degrees C) than the western (2.3-2.9 degrees C) subarctic Pacific.

AB  - We investigated four predictions about how temperature, photoperiod and sex affect the life history plasticity and foraging activity of a damselfly. (i) As predicted, increased temperatures increased foraging activity and growth rates, but in contrast with the prediction, late photoperiod (high time stress) did not affect foraging activity and growth rate. (ii) Unexpectedly, the increase in growth rate at increasing temperatures was not larger under high time stress. (iii) As predicted, age and size at emergence decreased at higher temperatures and at the late photoperiod. Temperature-induced life history shifts were direct or the result of behavioural growth mediation depending on the temperature range. Photoperiod-induced life history shifts were direct. (iv) As predicted, males emerged before females but at a smaller size. The degree of sexual size dimorphism was influenced by the joint effects of temperature and photoperiod. We could only detect genetic variation in size plasticity to photoperiod. The match between the sex-specific life history responses to temperature and photoperiod and predictions by relevant optimality models suggests adaptive life history plasticity to these variables.

AB  - Organisms with complex ecologies and life-cycle processes may shift physiologically (acclimation in tolerance), developmentally, and/or behaviorally (thermoregulation) in response to changes in climate. As such, climate change may trigger multiple, interacting phenotypic responses, which underscores the nuances of characterizing a species capacity to adapt and respond to climate change. In this study, we use a model frog species, Bufo gargarizans, to examine how three phenotypes, thermal tolerance limits (critical thermal minimum, CTmin and critical thermal maximum, CTmax), ontogeny, and behavioral preferences in temperature (Tpref) respond to different levels of thermal exposure (i.e., acclimation ranging from 10 degrees C to 30 degrees C). Acclimation temperature had little effect on Tpref of tadpoles, yet behaviorally they showed strong signs of thermal selection towards an optimum. Both CTmin and CTmax increased with acclimation temperature with an approximate 10% increase in tolerance limits per 1 degrees C increase in exposure. Development and body size both responded to acclimation temperature, both of which also influenced lower but not upper thermal limits. Our study highlights the idiosyncrasies of estimating climate vulnerability, where multiple phenotypes can respond to shifts in temperature-a complexity that is especially apparent in species with complex life-cycles.

AB  - Plasticity, both within and across generations, can shape sexual traits involved in mate choice and reproductive success, and thus direct measures of fitness. Especially, transgenerational plasticity (TGP), where parental environment influences offspring plasticity in future environments, could compensate for otherwise negative effects of environmental change on offspring sexual traits. We conducted a mate choice experiment using stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) with different thermal histories (ambient 17 degrees C or elevated 21 degrees C) within and across generations under simulated ocean warming using outdoor mesocosms. Parentage analysis of egg clutches revealed that maternal developmental temperature and reproductive (mesocosm) environment affected egg size, with females that developed at 17 degrees C laying smaller eggs in 21 degrees C mesocosms, likely owing to metabolic costs at elevated temperature. Paternal developmental temperature interacted with the reproductive environment to influence mating success, particularly under simulated ocean warming, with males that developed at 21 degrees C showing lower overall mating success compared with 17 degrees C males, but higher mating success in 21 degrees C mesocosms. Furthermore, mating success of males was influenced by the interaction between F1 developmental temperature and F0 parent acclimation temperature, demonstrating the potential role of both TGP and within-generation plasticity in shaping traits involved in sexual selection and mate choice, potentially facilitating rapid responses to environmental change.

AB  - Variation in thermal performance within and between populations provides the potential for adaptive responses to increasing temperatures associated with climate change. Organisms experiencing temperatures above their optimum on a thermal performance curve exhibit rapid declines in function and these supraoptimal temperatures can be a critical physiological component of range limits. The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is one of the best-documented biological invasions and factors driving its spatial spread are of significant ecological and economic interest. The present study examines gypsy moth sourced from different latitudes across its North American range for sensitivity to high temperature in constant temperature growth chamber experiments. Supraoptimal temperatures result in higher mortality in northern populations compared with populations from the southern range extent (West Virginia and coastal plain of Virginia, U.S.A.). Sublethal effects of high temperature on traits associated with fitness, such as smaller pupal mass, are apparent in northern and West Virginia populations. Overall, the results indicate that populations near the southern limits of the range are less sensitive to high temperatures than northern populations from the established range. However, southern populations are lower performing overall, based on pupal mass and development time, relative to northern populations. This suggests that there may be a trade-off associated with decreased heat sensitivity in gypsy moth. Understanding how species adapt to thermal limits and possible fitness trade-offs of heat tolerance represents an important step toward predicting climatically driven changes in species ranges, which is a particularly critical consideration in conservation and invasion ecology.

AB  - The infaunal bivalve Ruditapes decussatus (L.) was collected from Ria Formosa, Fare, southern Portugal, and subjected to a range of selected temperatures (20-35 degrees C). Physiological measurements (clearance rate, respiration rate, excretion rate and absorption efficiency) for the calculation of scope-for-growth were under taken at 20, 27 and 32 degrees C after 48 hours acclimation. Experiments on tolerance to air exposure were performed at 20, 28 and 35 degrees C. Increasing temperature resulted in lower clearance rates, leading to a marked reduction of scope for growth. At 32 degrees C scope for growth was negative indicating that clams were having to utilize their energy reserves. Respiration rate and excretion rate were temperature independent in the range 20 - 32 degrees C; due to seasonal thermal acclimation to environmental fluctuating temperatures. When exposed to air, shell valve gaping was observed at all experimental temperatures, resulting in the utilisation of aerobic metabolic pathways and the utilisation of energy reserves, desiccation and consequently death. Median lethal times were ca. 72 h, 48 h and 10 h at 20, 28 and 35 degrees C, respectively. Temperatures above 28 degrees C can therefore significantly weaken clams resistance to air exposure and affect their performance in water. Even ii effects of exposure to high water and air temperatures, on the tidal flats in the summer, are unknown, raising temperatures constitute a significant physiological stress for the clams.

AB  - While an understanding of evolutionary processes in shifting environments is vital in the context of rapid ecological change, one of the most potent selective forces, sexual selection, remains curiously unexplored. Variation in sexual selection across a species range, especially across a gradient of temperature regimes, has the potential to provide a window into the possible impacts of climate change on the evolution of mating patterns. Here, we investigated some of the links between temperature and indicators of sexual selection, using a cold-water pipefish as model. We found that populations differed with respect to body size, length of the breeding season, fecundity, and sexual dimorphism across a wide latitudinal gradient. We encountered two types of latitudinal patterns, either linear, when related to body size, or parabolic in shape when considering variables related to sexual selection intensity, such as sexual dimorphism and reproductive investment. Our results suggest that sexual selection intensity increases toward both edges of the distribution and that the large differences in temperature likely play a significant role. Shorter breeding seasons in the north and reduced periods for gamete production in the south certainly have the potential to alter mating systems, breeding synchrony, and mate monopolization rates. As latitude and water temperature are tightly coupled across the European coasts, the observed patterns in traits related to sexual selection can lead to predictions regarding how sexual selection should change in response to climate change. Based on data from extant populations, we can predict that as the worm pipefish moves northward, a wave of decreasing selection intensity will likely replace the strong sexual selection at the northern range margin. In contrast, the southern populations will be followed by heightened sexual selection, which may exacerbate the problem of local extinction at this retreating boundary.

AB  - The body sizes and shapes of poikilothermic animals generally show clinal variation with latitude. Among the environmental factors responsible for the dine, temperature seems to be the most probable candidate. In the present work we analysed natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster collected at different geographical localities to determine whether the same selective forces acting on wing development in the laboratory are also at work in the wild. We show that the temperature selection acting on wing development in the laboratory is only one of the selective forces operating in the wild. The size differences between natural populations seem to depend exclusively on cell number whereas they depend on cell area in the laboratory. The two wing compartments behave as distinct units of selection subjected to different genetic control, confirming our previous observations on laboratory populations. In addition, subunits of development defined as regions of cell proliferation centres restricted within longitudinal veins can, in turn, be considered as subunits of selection. Their interaction during development and continuous natural selection around an optimum could explain the high wing shape stability generally found in natural populations.

AB  - Understanding the potential for organisms to tolerate thermal stress through physiological or evolutionary responses is crucial given rapid climate change. Although climate models predict increases in both temperature mean and variance, such tolerances are typically assessed under constant conditions. We tested the effects of temperature variability during development on male fitness in the rainforest fly Drosophila birchii, by simulating thermal variation typical of the warm and cool margins of its elevational distribution, and estimated heritabilities and genetic correlations of fitness traits. Reproductive success was reduced for males reared in warm (mean 24 degrees C) fluctuating (+/- 3 degrees C) vs. constant conditions but not in cool fluctuating conditions (mean 17 degrees C), although fluctuations reduced body size at both temperatures. Male reproductive success under warm fluctuating conditions was similar to that at constant 27 degrees C, indicating that briefly exceeding critical thermal limits has similar fitness costs to continuously stressful conditions. There was substantial heritable variation in all traits. However, reproductive success traits showed no genetic correlation between treatments reflecting temperature variation at elevational extremes, which may constrain evolutionary responses at these ecological margins. Our data suggest that even small increases in temperature variability will threaten tropical ectotherms living close to their upper thermal limits, both through direct effects on fitness and by limiting their adaptive potential.

AB  - Evidence is accumulating that many marine ectotherms are undergoing rapid changes in their life-history characteristics. These changes have been variously attributed to fisheries-induced evolution, inhibited adult growth rate due to oxygen limitation at higher temperatures, and plastic responses to density dependence or changes in ocean productivity. Here, we review the diverse underlying mechanisms by which plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change and fisheries are likely to produce similar life-history trends in harvested marine ectotherms, leading to faster life-histories with earlier maturation and smaller adult size-at-age. While mechanistically understanding these growth and maturation changes may be difficult, it is becoming clear that changing life-histories will lead to modified population dynamics, productivity and natural mortality of the affected species. We discuss how the observed and expected life-history changes could affect the assumptions and uncertainty within single and multispecies models currently used in marine ecosystem management, highlighting that models which allow for dynamic life-history traits often report significantly different estimates of stock biomass. Given that both climate- and harvest-induced life-history changes are likely to intensify and possibly amplify each other, there is an urgent need to adequately assess the implications of faster life-histories for marine ecosystem management. This is especially true for data-poor stocks, where growth and maturation are not regularly assessed. Targeted monitoring can be used to inform responsive management, but for improved sustainability outcomes, a precautionary approach to management that is robust to life-history trends is advised.

AB  - Partial migration is common in a variety of taxa and has important ecological and evolutionary implications, yet the underlying factors that lead to different migratory strategies are not clearly understood. Given the importance of temperature in serving as a cue for migration, along with its role in regulating metabolism, growth, reproduction, and survival, we examined how intraspecific variation in critical thermal maximum (CTmax) values influenced migratory strategy (residency vs. migration), timing of migration, growth, and predation vulnerability in a wild population of partially anadromous juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta). Using passive integrated transponder telemetry and mark-recapture techniques, we identified individuals that out-migrated to sea, assumed residency, and were predated by cormorants several months later. Acute thermal stress induced by conducting CTmax trials did not affect the final fate of assayed fish compared with controls. We found that mass and body condition predicted CTmax and migration timing, but CTmax failed to predict migratory strategy or timing, growth (of resident fish), or predation vulnerability. Although there may be links between mass, thermal tolerance, and migration strategy, the relationship between CTmax and migration remains unclear. The role of upper thermal tolerance in influencing life-history strategies should not be neglected, however, as alternative indicators of thermal tolerance could be further explored. The high degree of variation in CTmax estimates warrants additional investigation of how increasingly prevalent high-temperature events might drive selection toward thermally tolerant extremes, which is particularly relevant in a rapidly warming world.

AB  - One proposal for ameliorating global warming is to sequester large amounts of carbon dioxide in the deep ocean, but the environmental consequences of sequestration for sediment-dwelling animals are poorly known. In a previous publication, we reported that similar to 80% of benthic copepods were killed in an experimental release of CO2 off northern California at 3262 m. The effects of this release on nematodes are reported here. We examined samples of nematodes taken inside two 'corrals' into which CO2 was directly injected (providing an extreme endpoint for CO2 exposure) and taken near to and far from this CO2 source. After 30 days, pore-water pH was unchanged (similar to 7.8) at the sediment-water interface far (similar to 40 m) from corrals, but pH profiles were reduced by similar to 0.75 near (similar to 2m) corrals. Corral pH was highly acidic (5.4 in a measurement from a subsequent experiment). Fifty randomly selected nematodes from each of four vertical layers from the 14 cores were photographed. They were assigned to a tail group (based on morphology), and individual biovolume was estimated from measurements of body length and width. Although nematode abundance (expressed as total nematodes and by tail group) was not affected, length, width, and individual biovolume significantly differed between near and far samples. Median nematode biovolume examined across tail group and core layer increased by similar to 48% inside and near corrals. Differences between near and corral samples were always less than differences between near and far samples. However, nematode length:width ratio did not differ between near and far, and the shapes of length, width, and biovolume frequency distributions were similar in all samples. We postulate that the nematode community throughout the upper 3 cm suffered a high rate of mortality after exposure to CO2, and that nematodes were larger because postmortem expansions in body length and width occurred. Decomposition rates were probably low and corpses did not disintegrate in 30 days. The observable effects of a reduction in pH to about 7.0 after 30 days were as great as an extreme pH reduction (5.4), suggesting that 'moderate' CO2 exposure, compared to the range of exposures possible following CO2 release, causes high mortality rates in the two most abundant sediment-dwelling metazoans (nematodes and copepods).

AB  - Most theoretical models for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) rely upon differential fitness of male and female offspring incubated under different thermal regimes. However, there are few convincing data on this topic. We studied incubation effects in a lizard species (Bassiana duperreyi, Scincidae) with genotypic sex determination so that we could separate effects due to incubation temperatures from those due to offspring gender. We incubated eggs under two different fluctuating-temperature regimes that simulated hot and cold natural nest-sites. The effects of our incubation treatments on phenotypes of the hatchling lizards (morphology and locomotor performance) differed between the sexes. Females emerging from eggs exposed to the ''hot nest" treatment (diel cycling, 23-31 degrees C) were larger, and ran faster? than did their sisters from the "cold nest" treatment (16-24 degrees C). Males showed a smaller and less consistent phenotypic response than females. These incubation-induced responses were relatively stable during the first few weeks of life post-hatching, at least in captive lizards maintained under laboratory conditions. These kinds of sex differences in the phenotypic responses of hatchling reptiles to incubation conditions provide a plausible basis for the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles.

AB  - Climatic gradients frequently predict large-scale ecogeographical patterns in animal coloration, but the underlying causes are often difficult to disentangle. We examined ecogeographical patterns of reflectance among 343 European butterfly species and isolated the role of selection for thermal benefits by comparing animal-visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavebands. NIR light accounts for similar to 50% of solar energy but cannot be seen by animals so functions primarily in thermal control. We found that reflectance of both dorsal and ventral surfaces shows thermally adaptive correlations with climatic factors including temperature and precipitation. This adaptive variation was more prominent in NIR than animal-visible wavebands and for body regions (thorax-abdomen and basal wings) that are most important for thermoregulation. Thermal environments also predicted the reflectance difference between dorsal and ventral surfaces, which may be due to modulation between requirements for heating and cooling. These results highlight the importance of climatic gradients in shaping the reflectance properties of butterflies at a continent-wide scale.

AB  - 2. We compared life-history traits of five populations of Leptopilina boulardi, a Drosophila parasitoid, originating from contrasting climates. Referring to cline studies, we hypothesised shorter lifespan, earlier reproduction, and lower lipid content in populations from the hottest and driest areas if life histories have been selected in response to temperature and/or humidity.
   3. Our results are opposite to these predictions. Females from humid and mild climates invested more in early reproduction and lived for fewer days than females from dry and hot areas, which were synovigenic (i.e. they matured additional eggs during adult life) and able to synthesise lipids during adult life.
   4. We suggest that life histories are more adapted to host distribution than to climatic factors. Drosophila patches are more abundant in the humid area, allowing the parasitoids to spend less energy and time finding hosts. This may result in selection for early reproduction traded-off against longevity. In the hot and dry climate, females have to fly large distances to find host patches. Synovigeny, a long lifespan, lipogenesis, and high dispersal ability may be adaptive there. This is the first time that between-population differences in the ability to synthesise lipids have been described in parasitoids.

AB  - Oxolinic acid and florfenicol are the commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases in Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. The changes in selected innate humoral immune response of the fish, bacterial proliferation in serum and transcriptional activity of selected immune and antioxidant defense-related genes following oral administration of these antimicrobial compounds were evaluated. Juvenile cod (75-100 g) were fed commercial feed coated with either florfenicol (10 mg kg(-1) fish, active ingredient) or oxolinic acid (20 mg kg(-1) fish, active ingredient) at a ration of 0.5% body weight for 10 days. Whole blood and serum samples were collected on the 10th day of feeding the antibiotics and at 3,5 and 10 days after their withdrawal. Serum protein was significantly higher in fish at the 10th day post-withdrawal of both antibiotics. Florfenicol-fed fish had lower myeloperoxidase activity at 3 days post-withdrawal, while there were differential effects on alkaline phosphatase activity. Vibrio anguillarum and Aeromonas salmonicida were significantly reduced in the sera of antibiotics-fed fish until the 5th day post-withdrawal. Florfenicol could inhibit V. anguillarum better than oxolinic acid, while A. salmonicida was more susceptible than V. anguillarum upon treatment with both antibiotics. Furthermore, transcriptional profiles of selected genes related to bacterial defense, inflammation and antioxidant defense were dependent on the type of antibiotics that was administered and the time of sampling. These results indicate that oral administration of antibiotics modulates the immune response and antioxidant defense in Atlantic cod and these may, in turn, affect their ability to resist bacterial pathogens.

AB  - Aphelinus asychis is an important aphid endoparasitoid. Under field and greenhouse conditions, high temperature is one of the factors limiting the application of A. asychis for biological pest control. To explore the potential role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and heat shock proteins (HSPs) in this process, we identified 11 genes encoding TRP channels and nine genes encoding HSPs. Three proteins (AasyTRPA5, AasyPyrexia, AasyPainless) that belong to transient receptor potential ankyrin (TRPA) subfamily and nine HSPs are involved in the response to high temperature. We also investigated the survival of A. asychis and the response of the identified TRP channels and HSPs to high temperature. The results showed that the maximum temperature that allowed A. asychis survival was approximately 41 degrees C; females had higher survival rates than that of the males at 40 and 41 degrees C. Short-term heat-shock resulted in increased expression of Aasyshsp in males, and Aasyhsp40, Aasyhsp68, Aasyhsp70-4, Aasyhsp70-5 and Aasyhsp90 were upregulated and then downregulated, whereas Aasyhsp70-3 was upregulated at 41 degrees C. Moreover, Aasyhsp40 and Aasyhsp90 showed higher expression levels in females, while Aasyshsp and Aasyhsp70-3 presented opposite expression patterns. At temperature above 35 degrees C, expression of AasyPyrexia in females was significant higher than that in males, whereas AasyPainless and AasyTRPA5 presented higher expression in males at 40 and 41 degrees C, respectively. Altogether, these results indicate that protection against thermal stress in A. asychis is coordinated by TRP channels and HSPs. These findings provide a basis for understanding the potential mechanism of A. asychis in response to high temperatures.

AB  - This study compares laying performances between two environments of dwarf laying hen lines segregating for the naked neck mutation (NA locus), a selected dwarf line of brown-egg layers and its control line. Layers with one of the three genotypes at the NA locus were produced from 11 sires from the control line and 12 sires from the selected line. Two hatches produced 216 adult hens in Taiwan and 297 hens in France. Genetic parameters for laying traits were estimated in each environment and the ranking of sire breeding values was compared between environments. Laying performance was lower, and mortality was higher in Taiwan than in France. The line by environment interaction was highly significant for body weight at 16 weeks, clutch length and egg number, with or without Box-Cox transformation. The selected line was more sensitive to environmental change but in Taiwan it could maintain a higher egg number than the control line. Estimated heritability values in the selected line were higher in France than in Taiwan, but not for all the traits in the control line. The rank correlations between sire breeding values were low within the selected line and slightly higher in the control line. A few sire families showed a good ranking in both environments, suggesting that some families may adapt better to environmental change.

AB  - Suspension-feeding organisms living in the intertidal zone experience reduced feeding times associated with periodic aerial exposure. The potential morphological and physiological adaptations to this reduced feeding time were investigated for two closely related gastropods, Crepidula fornicata and Crepipatella peruviana. Intertidal C. fornicata had heavier gills than subtidal conspecifics, a difference mediated by larger gill surface areas and greater numbers of gill filaments among intertidal individuals of a given size. In contrast, the gills of intertidal and subtidal C. peruviana were morphologically indistinguishable. Despite relatively larger food-collecting organs, individuals of C. fornicata from the intertidal zone had clearance rates (CR) that were not significantly different from those of subtidal conspecifics. In contrast, the CR of intertidal C. peruviana were significantly lower than those of subtidal conspecifics. The low CR of intertidal C. peruviana may be partially explained by significantly lower measured particle transport velocities across their gills. In the context of feeding, intertidal individuals of C. fornicata performed at least as well as subtidal conspecifics, resulting in a population whose adults were as large as those found subtidally. This suggests that C. fornicata has had a long interaction with the environmental heterogeneity associated with intertidal life. In contrast, intertidal individuals of C. peruviana were on average smaller than subtidal individuals and may be stressed in the intertidal.

AB  - Most temperate-climate lizards become inactive during the winter months of each year. As temperatures drop, they must find appropriate overwintering microhabitats to avoid lethal surface temperatures and/or thermoregulate. The environmental variables that characterize such microhabitats and the cues that lizards utilize to assess them are a critical but understudied component of their natural history. While many studies of overwintering site selection focus on temperature, other factors constituting microhabitats (e.g., surface structures, substrate) may play a role in site selection. We used the Jacky Dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus), an Australian agamid lizard, to test for preference of using various cover types (leaf litter, open sand, sticks, rocks) for overwintering as well as the consequences of cover type selection. Jacky Dragons preferred overwintering beneath leaves compared to other structures, and this choice was associated with growth during winter, but not with survival. Our study highlights the potential importance of cover structures in overwintering site selection, suggests that midwinter activity may be common in Jacky Dragons, and calls for further study of the winter ecology of temperate-climate lizard species.

AB  - The difficult birth process of humans, often described as the obstetric dilemma, is commonly assumed to reflect antagonistic selective pressures favoring neonatal encephalization and maternal bipedal locomotion. However, cephalo-pelvic disproportion is not exclusive to humans, and is present in some primate species of smaller body size. The fossil record indicates mosaic evolution of the obstetric dilemma, involving a number of different evolutionary processes, and it appears to have shifted in magnitude between Australopithecus, Pleistocene Homo, and recent human populations. Most attention to date has focused on its generic nature, rather than on its variability between populations. We re-evaluate the nature of the human obstetric dilemma using updated hominin and primate literature, and then consider the contribution of phenotypic plasticity to variability in its magnitude. Both maternal pelvic dimensions and fetal growth patterns are sensitive to ecological factors such as diet and the thermal environment. Neonatal head girth has low plasticity, whereas neonatal mass and maternal stature have higher plasticity. Secular trends in body size may therefore exacerbate or decrease the obstetric dilemma. The emergence of agriculture may have exacerbated the dilemma, by decreasing maternal stature and increasing neonatal growth and adiposity due to dietary shifts. Paleodemographic comparisons between foragers and agriculturalists suggest that foragers have considerably lower rates of perinatal mortality. In contemporary populations, maternal stature remains strongly associated with perinatal mortality in many populations. Long-term improvements in nutrition across future generations may relieve the dilemma, but in the meantime, variability in its magnitude is likely to persist. Am J Phys Anthropol, 2012.

AB  - Recent theory suggests that tropical terrestrial arthropods are at significant risk from climate warming. Metabolic rate in such ectothermic species increases exponentially with environmental temperature, and a small temperature increase in a hot environment can therefore have a greater physiological impact than a large temperature increase in a cool environment. In two recent studies of the neotropical pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides, simulated climate warming significantly decreased survival, body size and level of sexual dimorphism. However, these effects were minor compared with catastrophic consequences for male fertility and female fecundity, identifying reproduction as the life stage most vulnerable to climate warming. Here, we examine the effects of chronic high-temperature exposure on epigenetic regulation in C. scorpioides in the context of naturally occurring variation in mitochondrial DNA. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications and small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) expression, are particularly sensitive to environmental factors such as temperature, which can induce changes in epigenetic states and phenotypes that may be heritable across generations. Our results indicate that exposure of male pseudoscorpions to elevated temperature significantly altered the expression of >60 sncRNAs in testicular tissue, specifically microRNAs and piwi-interacting RNAs. Mitochondrial haplogroup was also a significant factor influencing both sncRNAs and mitochondrial gene expression. These findings demonstrate that chronic heat stress causes changes in epigenetic profiles that may account for reproductive dysfunction in C. scorpioides males. Moreover, through its effects on epigenetic regulation, mitochondrial DNA polymorphism may provide the potential for an adaptive evolutionary response to climate warming.

AB  - The effect of starvation at selected low temperatures was studied in sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax. The work focused on proximate chemical constituents and blood glucose. Appetite and growth of starved, refed specimens were also examined. Two experimental sets were designed. In one set the fish were exposed to 3-degrees-C, 7-degrees-C and 11-degrees-C and in the other to 3-degrees-C, 8-degrees-C and 13-degrees-C. Survival of the fish in the experimental conditions was 99.7%. Appreciable loss in body weight occurred. The reduction wss more marked in the first week. No significant difference in chemical composition occurred in the first two weeks of starvation. Prolongation of food deprivation resulted in decline of lipid content with a corresponding increase in water content. This trend was the more marked at high temperature. Liver glycogen was the most readily utilizable source of energy. Lipid yielded energy after which proteins were mobilized to save further loss of lipid. Lipid exerted a sparing role for glycogen. The preference for different energy sources depended on exposure temperature and duration of starvation. Lipid chiefly supplied the energy needs of the 3-degrees-C test groups, whereas liver glycogen provided the calorific requirements of fish at 7-degrees-C, 8-degrees-C, 11-degrees-C and 13-degrees-C. In the 3-degrees-C test groups gluconeogenesis occurred after 2 weeks. The products of lipid breakdown may have served as substrates for glycogen biosynthesis. High tolerance of sea bass to low temperature was attributed to high fat content and hyperglycemia. The study also pointed to the involvement of some organs other than liver in generating glucose from their glycogen stores following exhaustion of hepatic glycogen. Starvation stress at the lowest temperatures adversely affected the return of the fish's appetite and growth characters. Compensatory growth occurred in sea bass refed after starvation. The findings have implications for aquaculture management procedures.

AB  - Age at reproduction can influence the survival and future reproduction of an individual as well as that of their offspring. Remarkably, it has been shown that grandmaternal age at reproduction can also affect the characteristics of grandoffspring in humans and in laboratory or semi-captive animals. However, currently we do not know whether grandmaternal age effects exist in wild populations.
   We gathered data on female age at reproduction, offspring and grandoffspring characteristics using a 16-year long-term survey of a natural population of the common lizard, Zootoca vivipara. The dataset contains 579 grandoffspring from 135 litters.
   Body size at birth was not correlated with grandmaternal age at reproduction. However, grandoffspring body condition at birth, grandoffspring survival and reproductive performance of granddaughters were dependent on grandmaternal age. These relationships were independent of maternal age.
   An age-structured model showed that the global effect of grandmaternal age was nonlinear and was largely driven by its effect on grandoffspring survival. Fitness was higher for granddaughters produced by grandmothers of intermediate ages.
   The study shows that age can shape life-history traits for more than one generation, documenting the importance that grandmaternal age can have in wild populations.

AB  - P>1. A key aspect of the ecology and evolution of adaptive prey responses to predator risk is the timing by which the former develop a defensive trait in response to inducing signals released by the latter. This property, called reactivity, has been shown to affect population stability and persistence.
   2. Theoretically, the minimal predator density required by prey to exhibit induced defences is expected to increase with the effectiveness of the defence and decrease with its cost. Likewise, the time required for the prey population to exhibit an induced defence is expected to increase together with cost.
   3. The freshwater rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus and B. havanaensis and their predator Asplanchna brightwelli were used to test the hypothesis that prey species exhibiting defences that offer a larger fitness benefit and lower fitness cost are more reactive to predator signals, in terms of requiring shorter exposure time and lower signal concentration to trigger a morphological defence reaction.
   4. Our results showed that both prey species exhibited costly and effective defences after induction by predator infochemicals. Faster reactions were observed at higher levels of predator cues. Nevertheless, the observed relationship between reactivity and benefit/cost of defences did not agree with our expectations.
   5. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which the timing of induction of morphological defences is experimentally assessed over a gradient of risk signals. We propose new research directions to disentangle the mechanisms and project the consequences of prey decisions at the morphological level.

AB  - Structural changes in the tracheal system during development have the potential to allow insects to compensate for varying oxygen availability. Despite possible compensation, oxygen level during development may also affect insect body size. We investigated how atmospheric oxygen level affects the dimensions of the main dorsal tracheae (DT) and masses of larval Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) reared for up to six generations in 10%, 21% or 40% O-2 at 25degreesC. Wandering-stage third-instar larvae were weighed every other generation, and the dimensions of the DT were measured. Hypoxia produced significantly lighter larvae after one generation of exposure, while hyperoxia did not affect larval mass. Atmospheric oxygen content did not significantly change the diameters of the anterior portions of the main tracheae; however, the posterior diameters were strongly affected. During the first generation of exposure, tracheal diameters were inversely proportional to rearing oxygen levels, demonstrating that developmental plasticity in DT diameters can partially (8-15%) compensate for variation in atmospheric oxygen level. After multiple generations in differing atmospheres and two further generations in 21% O-2, larvae had tracheal diameters inversely related to their historical oxygen exposure, suggesting that atmospheric oxygen can produce heritable changes in insect tracheal morphology.

AB  - Being an assembly of highly sophisticated protein machines, cells depend heavily on proteostatic modules functionality and on adequate supply of energetic molecules for maintaining proteome stability. Yet, our understanding of the adaptations induced by multigenerational proteotoxic stress is limited. We report here that multigenerational (>80 generations) proteotoxic stress in Oregon(R )flies induced by constant exposure to developmentally nonlethal doses of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) (G80-BTZ flies) increased proteome instability and redox imbalance, reduced fecundity and body size, and caused neuromuscular defects; it also accelerated aging. G80-BTZ flies were mildly resistant to increased doses of BTZ and showed no age-related loss of proteasome activity; these adaptations correlated with sustained upregulation of proteostatic modules, which however occurred at the cost of minimal responses to increased BTZ doses and increased susceptibility to various types of additional proteotoxic stress, namely, autophagy inhibition or thermal stress. Multigenerational proteome instability and redox imbalance also caused metabolic reprogramming being evidenced by altered mitochondrial biogenesis and suppressed insulin/IGF-like signaling (IIS) in G80-BTZ, flies. The toxic effects of multigenerational proteome instability could be partially mitigated by a low-protein diet that extended G80-BTZ flies' longevity. Overall, persistent proteotoxic stress triggers a highly conserved adaptive metabolic response mediated by the IIS pathway, which reallocates resources from growth and longevity to somatic preservation and stress tolerance. Yet, these trade-off adaptations occur at the cost of accelerated aging and/or reduced tolerance to additional stress, illustrating the limited buffering capacity of survival pathways.

AB  - The bloom dynamics of metagenic jellyfish are regulated, to a large degree, by the asexual reproduction of benthic polyps. The ecophysiology of polyps is poorly studied compared to pelagic (ephyrae and medusae) life stages. We measured unfed (routine) respiration rates (R-R) of the polyps of four scyphozoan species (Cyanea capillata, Aurelio aurita, Aurelia labiata and Aurelia limbata) acclimated to six temperatures between 7 and 20 degrees C and one species (A. aurita) under hypoxic conditions. Strong increases (Q(10) similar to 7 to 13) in R-R occurred after subtle warming across specific test temperatures (e.g., 12 to 15 degrees C for C. capillata, A. labiata, and A aurita). In some species, R-R at 20 degrees C was lower than at 15 or 18 degrees C suggesting that sub-optimally warm temperatures were approached. Polyps of A. aurita were unable to maintain R-R below 11, 22 and 24% O-2 saturation at 8.0, 15.5 and 19.0 degrees C, respectively. Despite obvious differences in activity and habitat, rates of respiration in polyps, ephyrae and medusae of A. aurita at 15 degrees C appear similar after taking into account differences in body size. A literature comparison of polyp respiration rates suggests a narrowing of thermal windows in individuals collected from higher latitudes. Common garden experiments are needed to thoroughly examine potential local adaptation. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Physiological changes associated with evolutionary and ecological processes such as diversification, range expansion or speciation are still incompletely understood, especially for non-model species. Here we study differences in protein expression in response to temperature in a western Mediterranean diving beetle species complex, using two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis with one Moroccan and one Iberian population each of Agabus ramblae and Agabus brunneus. We identified proteins with significant expression differences after thermal treatments comparing them with a reference EST library generated from one of the species of the complex (A. ramblae). The colonisation during the Middle Pleistocene of the Iberian peninsula by A. ramblae, where maximum temperatures and seasonality are lower than in the ancestral north African range, was associated with changes in the response to 27 degrees C in proteins related to energy metabolism. The subsequent speciation of A. brunneus from within populations of Iberian A. ramblae was associated with changes in the expression of several stress-related proteins (mostly chaperons) when exposed to 4 degrees C. These changes are in agreement with the known tolerance to lower temperatures of A. brunneus, which occupies a larger geographical area with a wider range of climatic conditions. In both cases, protein expression changes paralleled the evolution of thermal tolerance and the climatic conditions experienced by the species. However, although the colonisation of the Iberian peninsula did not result in morphological change, the speciation process of A. brunneus within Iberia involved genetic isolation and substantial differences in male genitalia and body size and shape.

AB  - Salamandra salamandra has an unusual mode of reproduction. Females retain eggs in their oviducts and give birth to aquatic larvae or, in some populations, to fully metamorphosed juveniles. We investigated how variation in the birth size of larvae of five different sibships of S. salamandra affected larval survival, larval growth rates, time to metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis under different food and temperature conditions. Maternal effects, via the effect of larval birth size, attenuated throughout development in all environments but still affected metamorphic traits at lower temperatures. Larval developmental time was negatively correlated with larval birth size and positively correlated with size at metamorphosis. After controlling for the effect of larval birth size, broad-sense heritabilities were obtained for residual values of metamorphic traits, indicating that enough genetic variability exists at lower temperature environments and that responses to selection of metamorphic traits are possible. The size at and the time to metamorphosis were phenotypically and genetically correlated. Since both traits presumably affect fitness, genetic dependence between size and time to metamorphosis may act as a constraint on adaptive evolution through antagonistic pleiotropy. Mass-specific growth, time to metamorphosis, and size at metamorphosis were plastic under different temperature and food conditions, but no significant sibship X environment interaction was found for any trait. In addition, significant cross-environment correlation for size at metamorphosis with respect to the food gradient indicates low potential for the adaptive evolution of reaction norms to heterogeneous food environments.

AB  - Experimental evolution can be a useful tool for testing the impact of environmental factors on adaptive changes in populations, and this approach is being increasingly used to understand the potential for evolutionary responses in populations under changing climates. However, selective factors will often be more complex in natural populations than in laboratory environments and produce different patterns of adaptive differentiation. Here we test the ability of laboratory experimental evolution under different temperature cycles to reproduce well-known patterns of clinal variation in Drosophila melanogaster. Six fluctuating thermal regimes mimicking the natural temperature conditions along the east coast of Australia were initiated. Contrary to expectations, on the basis of field patterns there was no evidence for adaptation to thermal regimes as reflected by changes in cold and heat resistance after 1-3 years of laboratory natural selection. While laboratory evolution led to changes in starvation resistance, development time, and body size, patterns were not consistent with those seen in natural populations. These findings highlight the complexity of factors affecting trait evolution in natural populations and indicate that caution is required when inferring likely evolutionary responses from the outcome of experimental evolution studies.

AB  - Over the last 50 yr, thermal biology has shifted from a largely physiological science to a more integrated science of behavior, physiology, ecology, and evolution. Today, the mechanisms that underlie responses to environmental temperature are being scrutinized at levels ranging from genes to organisms. From these investigations, a theory of thermal adaptation has emerged that describes the evolution of thermoregulation, thermal sensitivity, and thermal acclimation. We review and integrate current models to form a conceptual model of coadaptation. We argue that major advances will require a quantitative theory of coadaptation that predicts which strategies should evolve in specific thermal environments. Simply combining current models, however, is insufficient to understand the responses of organisms to thermal heterogeneity; a theory of coadaptation must also consider the biotic interactions that influence the net benefits of behavioral and physiological strategies. Such a theory will be challenging to develop because each organism's perception of and response to thermal heterogeneity depends on its size, mobility, and life span. Despite the challenges facing thermal biologists, we have never been more pressed to explain the diversity of strategies that organisms use to cope with thermal heterogeneity and to predict the consequences of thermal change for the diversity of communities.

AB  - Soft robots driven by stimuli-responsive materials have unique advantages over conventional rigid robots, especially in their high adaptability for field exploration and seamless interaction with humans. The grand challenge lies in achieving self-powered soft robots with high mobility, environmental tolerance, and long endurance. We are able to advance a soft electronic fish with a fully integrated onboard system for power and remote control. Without any motor, the fish is driven solely by a soft electroactive structure made of dielectric elastomer and ionically conductive hydrogel. The electronic fish can swim at a speed of 6.4 cm/s (0.69 body length per second), which is much faster than previously reported untethered soft robotic fish driven by soft responsive materials. The fish shows consistent performance in a wide temperature range and permits stealth sailing due to its nearly transparent nature. Furthermore, the fish is robust, as it uses the surrounding water as the electric ground and can operate for 3 hours with one single charge. The design principle can be potentially extended to a variety of flexible devices and soft robots.

AB  - Life-history traits or "fitness components"-such as age and size at maturity, fecundity and fertility, age-specific rates of survival, and life span-are the major phenotypic determinants of Darwinian fitness. Analyzing the evolution and genetics of these phenotypic targets of selection is central to our understanding of adaptation. Due to its simple and rapid life cycle, cosmopolitan distribution, ease of maintenance in the laboratory, well-understood evolutionary genetics, and its versatile genetic toolbox, the "vinegar fly" Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most powerful, experimentally tractable model systems for studying "life-history evolution." Here, I review what has been learned about the evolution and genetics of life-history variation in D. melanogaster by drawing on numerous sources spanning population and quantitative genetics, genomics, experimental evolution, evolutionary ecology, and physiology. This body of work has contributed greatly to our knowledge of several fundamental problems in evolutionary biology, including the amount and maintenance of genetic variation, the evolution of body size, clines and climate adaptation, the evolution of senescence, phenotypic plasticity, the nature of life-history trade-offs, and so forth. While major progress has been made, important facets of these and other questions remain open, and the D. melanogaster system will undoubtedly continue to deliver key insights into central issues of life-history evolution and the genetics of adaptation.

AB  - In this study, an intelligent power package with body size of 40mm x 40mm is proposed. The thermal performance of the package with different material options has been analyzed and the materials which produce best thermal performance have been recommended for the final assembly of the package. The proposed power package consists of two high power rated SiC chips, two temperature sensor chips, one customized lead frame (LF), four pieces of customized metal clips and a flexible printed circuit (FPC). The material options include difference die attach materials, solder joint material (JM), molding compound material (MC) and thermal interface materials (TIM). A 3D thermal model is built to analyze the thermal performance of the proposed power package and different material combinations have been applied to the thermal model. The temperature field in the proposed power package has been simulated and the temperature profile of the package has been obtained. The thermal resistance of the proposed power package with different material options has been extracted. The analysis results show that the TIMs impose the most significant effects on the thermal performance of the power package, while effects of die attach materials, solder joint materials and molding compound material on the thermal performance of the package are negligible.

AB  - To investigate the ability of Drosophila serrata to adapt to thermal conditions over winter at the species southern border, replicate lines from three source locations were held as discrete generations over three years at either 19degreesC (40 generations) or temperatures fluctuating between 7degreesC and 18degreesC (20 generations). Populations in the fluctuating environment were maintained either with an adult 0degreesC cold shock or without a shock. These conditions were expected to result in temperature-specific directional selection for increased viability and productivity under both temperature regimes, and reduced development time under the fluctuating-temperature regime. Selection responses of all lines were tested under both temperature regimes after controlling for carry-over effects by rearing lines in these environments for two generations. When tested in the 19degreesC environment, lines evolving at 19degreesC showed a faster development time and a lower productivity relative to the other lines, while cold shock reduced development time and productivity of all lines. When tested in the fluctuating environment, productivity of the 7-18degreesC lines selected with a cold shock was relatively lower than that of lines selected without a shock, but this pattern was not observed in the other populations. Viability and body size as measured by wing length were not altered by selection or cold shock, although there were consistent effects of source population on wing length. These results provide little evidence for temperature-specific adaptation in D. serrata-although the lines had diverged for some traits, these changes were not consistent with a priori predictions. In particular, there was no evidence for life-history changes reflecting adaptation to winter conditions at the southern border. The potential for D. serrata to adapt to winter conditions may therefore be limited.

AB  - Annual fish species have evolved complex adaptations to survive in temporary wetlands. The main adaptation of these fish is the ability to produce embryos that survive dry periods. Embryo development of this fish can show variation at multiple levels influenced by many environmental factors, such as photoperiod and temperature. Predator cues are another factor that can influence the embryonic stage. One way in which annual fish could adapt to predators is by using risk-spreading strategies (through bet-hedging). Nonetheless, this strategy depends on the coevolutionary history between predators and preys and on the degree of environmental unpredictability, resulting in different responses across different species. This study investigated the influence of predator cues on the embryonic development and hatching of two Austrolebias species that inhabit ponds that present differences in hydroperiod and the risk of predator presence. The results confirmed a differentiated response between the two annual fish species tested, corroborating the modulation of hatching against the risk of predation by native predatory fish. The authors further showed that development times varied between the two annual fish species, regardless of the presence of predators. They highlight that the variation in embryonic development is strongly affected by different levels of hydroperiod unpredictability faced by the two species. To unravel finer-scale local adaptations in the annual fish embryo development, future studies should focus on a region with greater spatial gradient.

AB  - Predicting species responses to global warming is the holy grail of climate change science. As temperature directly affects physiological rates, it is clear that a mechanistic understanding of species vulnerability should be grounded in organismal physiology. Here, we review what respiratory physiology can offer the field of thermal ecology, showcasing different perspectives on how respiratory physiology can help explain thermal niches. In water, maintaining adequate oxygen delivery to fuel the higher metabolic rates under warming conditions can become the weakest link, setting thermal tolerance limits. This has repercussions for growth and scaling of metabolic rate. On land, water loss is more likely to become problematic as long as O-2 delivery and pH balance can be maintained, potentially constraining species in their normal activity. Therefore, high temperatures need not be lethal, but can still affect the energy intake of an animal, with concomitant consequences for long-term fitness. While respiratory challenges and adaptive responses are diverse, there are clear recurring elements such as oxygen uptake, CO2 excretion, and water homeostasis. We show that respiratory physiology has much to offer the field of thermal ecology and call for an integrative, multivariate view incorporating respiratory challenges, thermal responses, and energetic consequences. Fruitful areas for future research are highlighted.

AB  - Degree-days (DD) are an increasingly popular method for explaining variation in fish growth and development. By including a base temperature (T-o) the DD formula limits calculations T-o temperatures that are relevant T-o growth. However, our review of growth studies shows multiple T-o values in use for a given fish species. T-o determine how T-o affects the ability of DD T-o explain within-population growth variation, we first show that the ability of DD T-o describe a growing season is robust T-o low values of T-o. We then analyze immature length data from eight species and 85 water bodies in North America T-o show that there is a broad range of T-o values that effectively explain growth variation. Based on these results, we argue that precise T-o estimates are unwarranted for most single-population studies and recommend standard T-o values (0, 5, 10, 15 degrees C). Standardization facilitates comparative studies and promotes the use of DD in future research. To this end, we provide equations for converting annual DD at a given T-o to annual DD at a standard T-o.

AB  - Thermal environments can influence many fitness-related traits including life span. Here, we assess whether longevity in Drosophila melanogaster can experimentally evolve as a correlated response to cold-stress selection, and whether genotype-by-temperature and sex-by-temperature interactions are significant components of variation in life span. Three replicated S lines were cold-stress selected and compared with their respective unselected controls (Clines) in the 16(th) generation of thermal selection. Cold-stress resistance exhibited a substantial direct response to selection, and also showed a significant interaction between sex and type of line. Mean longevity exhibited a significant interaction between adult test temperature (14 and 25 degreesC) and line (with suggestive evidence for increased longevity of S lines when tested at 14 degreesC), but there was no evidence for increased longevity in S lines at normal temperatures (i.e. 25 degreesC). Another temperature-dependent effect was sex-specific, with males being the longer lived sex at 25 degreesC but the less long-lived sex at 14 degreesC. Additionally, we tested in an exploratory way the relationship between longevity and cold-stress resistance by also measuring resistance to a prefreezing temperature before and after one generation of longevity selection at 14 degreesC (selection intensity, i = 1.47 for S lines, and 1.42 for C lines). In this longevity selection, we found that cold-stress resistance increased by about 6% in S lines and 18% in C lines. However, taken together, the results indicate no simple relationship between longevity and cold-stress resistance, with genotype-by-sex interactions in both traits. Temperature dependent interaction in longevity is apparent between S and C lines, and sex-specific variation in mean longevity also depends on temperature.

AB  - Pathways through which phenotypic variation among individuals arise can be complex. One assumption often made in relation to intraspecific diversity is that the stability or predictability of the environment will interact with expression of the underlying phenotypic variation. To address biological complexity below the species level, we investigated variability across years in morphology and annual growth increments between and within two sympatric lake charr Salvelinus namaycush ecotypes in Rush Lake, USA. A rapid phenotypic shift in body and head shape was found within a decade. The magnitude and direction of the observed phenotypic change were consistent in both ecotypes, which suggests similar pathways caused the variation over time. Over the same time period, annual growth increments declined for both lake charr ecotypes and corresponded with a consistent phenotypic shift of each ecotype. Despite ecotype-specific annual growth changes in response to winter conditions, the observed annual growth shift for both ecotypes was linked, to some degree, with variation in the environment. Particularly, a declining trend in regional cloud cover was associated with an increase of early-stage (ages 1-3) annual growth for lake charr of Rush Lake. Underlying mechanisms causing changes in growth rates and constrained morphological modulation are not fully understood. An improved knowledge of the biology hidden within the expression of phenotypic variation promises to clarify our understanding of temporal morphological diversity and instability.

AB  - Many insects use photoperiod as a signal to anticipate upcoming unfavorable conditions. Photoperiod sensitivity may be a relevant factor in Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.) populations at the cool margins of the species' range, where winter conditions have a strong effect on population dynamics. In this study, we evaluated the effect of parental photoperiod on preimaginal survival and developmental time, and on wing length for the first generation of Ae. aegypti from a temperate region (Buenos Aires City, Argentina). Our experiment started with eggs from parents exposed to short-day (SD; 10:14 [L:D]) or long-day (LD; 14:10 [L:D]) photoperiods during their entire life span. Eggs were stored under the same photoperiod (SD or LD) as their parents for 91 d, until immersion. After hatching, larvae were reared until adult emergence in thermal baths at one of two constant temperatures (17 or 23 degrees C), at a photoperiod of 12:12 (L:D) h and fed ad libitum. Survival from larva I to adult emergence was not affected either by parental photoperiod or rearing temperature. At a rearing temperature of 23 degrees C, female offspring from the SD parental photoperiod developed faster and had shorter wings compared with those from the LD parental photoperiod. No effect of parental photoperiod was observed on female offspring reared at 17 degrees C. In male offspring, parental photoperiod had no effect on developmental time and wing length, independently of the rearing temperature. Results indicate that the parental photoperiod may affect some offspring traits. This effect may be a characteristic of Ae. aegypti populations in temperate regions to deal with the winter conditions.

AB  - 1. One of the central questions in evolutionary ecology is how different functional capacities impact fitness, and how it varies across populations. For instance, do phenotypic attributes influence fitness similarly across geographic gradients? Which traits (physiological, morphological and life history) are most likely to be targets of natural selection? Do particular combinations of traits maximize fitness?
   2. In a semi-natural experiment, we analysed introduced populations of an invasive species, the garden snail (Cornu aspersum) in Chile, which show low levels of genetic differentiation in spite of the distance. Specifically, we addressed whether the magnitude, sign and form of selection in snail populations could explain the differentiation (or its absence) among populations.
   3. A common garden/reciprocal transplant experiment was performed in three populations (La Serena, Constitucion and Valdivia) that span a 1300-km latitudinal gradient and differ markedly in climate (semi-arid north to humid south). We released c.450 individuals per population (two generations after field-captured snails) in replicated enclosures at the range extremes (La Serena and Valdivia). Morphological (size and shell darkness), physiological (standard metabolic rate and digestive efficiency) and life-history [growth rate (GR)] traits were measured in all snails before the release. Survival was recorded monthly during 1year.
   4. Survival was significantly higher in snails from La Serena than in snails from Constitucion and Valdivia, when raised at La Serena. However, at Valdivia, survival was not different among source populations. Interestingly, we found negative correlational selection in M-B and SMRR at La Serena, whereas at Valdivia we only found directional selection on GR and M-B, and stabilizing selection on SMRR.
   5. These results suggest that selection on physiological traits related with energy allocation is pervasive, irrespective of climate and distance.

AB  - The aim was to assess whether selection for increased growth rate in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is associated with increased feed intake and/or better feed utilization. Growth responses of offspring from selected and wild lines of Atlantic salmon (initial weight 814 +/- 14 g and 533 +/- 12 g, respectively) were tested in a 14-week experiment. Selected and wild salmon increased body weight by 79 and 39%, respectively, during the experiment. Relative feed intake (DFI), thermal growth coefficient (TGC) and feed efficiency ratio (FER) were significantly higher in the selected (DFI: 0.67% BW d(-1), TGC: 2.96 x 10(-3) and FER: 1.16), than in the wild, line (DFI: 0.48% BW d(-1), TGC: 1.39 x 10(-3) and FER: 0.93). FER was positively correlated with mean growth rate (r = 0.90, n = 6, P < 0.05), and differences between the lines indicated a 4.6% increase in FER per generation of selection. Fish of the selected line had a significantly lower intake of protein and energy per kilogram gain, so the higher growth rate of the selected line was the result of both greater feed consumption and more efficient feed utilization for growth. This implies that selection for increased growth rate in Atlantic salmon may improve both of these traits. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enhancing selection using two-stage selection is normally implemented by pre-selection for tagging weight (BWT) and by final selection for ungutted harvest weight (BWH) and thermal growth coefficient from tagging to harvest (TGC(TH)). However, selection on harvest traits, i.e., gutted weight (GBWH), visceral percentage (VISW%), condition factor (CFH), and overall survival (SURV), can be enhanced by exploiting correlated traits. It can be hypothesized that the efficiency of two-stage selection on genetic response in BWH and TGC(TH) is dependent on their genetic (r(g)) and phenotypic (r(p)) correlations with BWT and therefore dependent on the time point of pre-selection. The aims of this study were, first, to estimate genetic parameters (heritability: h(2), r(p), and r(g)) for BWT (7 months), BWS (weight at sorting, 9 months), BWH (14 months), TGC(TH), GBWH, VISW%, CFH, and SURV. Second, these genetic parameters were used in two deterministic simulation studies; i) one-and two-stage selections to compare genetic responses in BWH and TGC(TH), and ii) alternative selection indices using correlated traits to compare corresponding accuracy of selection (r(IH)) for slaughter traits, CFH, and SURV. Genetic parameters were estimated using an animal mixed model in ASReml on 2,041 fish records. The main results showed that, first, r(g) of BWT was 0.35 with BWH but -0.25 with TGC(TH), whereas the r(g) of BWS was 0.72 with BWH but 0.39 with TGC(TH). Pre-selection for BWS led to genetic response of 54.15 g in BWH which was higher than the genetic response from pre-selection for BWT (51.90 g). Similarly, pre-selection on BWS enhanced correlated genetic response in TGC(TH) to 0.30 g((1/3))/degrees C*day. In contrast, pre-selection for BWT resulted in lower correlated genetic response in TGC(TH) of 0.20 g(1/3)/degrees C*day. It can be concluded that genetic improvement of BWH and TGC(TH) can be enhanced by postponing pre-selection to a later age. However, an optimal time point for tagging and pre-selection should be found to minimize common environmental effects and rearing costs during communal rearing of full-sibs. Second, including GBWH in a selection index can reduce unfavourable selection responses in VISW%. The GBWH is highly genetically correlated with BWH and can be easily indirectly selected. TGC(TH) is a good predictor for selection for lower VISW%, and higher SURV, but not for higher CFH. To control genetic changes in the condition factor, it should be included to the selection index.

AB  - The relative fitness rule states that parasitoid females should adopt risk-prone reproductive behaviours when expecting low reproductive success. Temperature influences the reproductive success of insects by affecting their basal metabolic rate during development, their egg load at emergence, and their life expectancy as adults. Using an aphid-parasitoid model system, we investigated the influence of developmental and adult temperature on the risk-sensitive decision-making of females. We considered the use of a low-quality host nymphal instar by the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi to be a risk-prone behaviour. Immature females were reared at 12, 20 or 28 degrees C and had access to the four nymphal instars of the potato aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae for oviposition at one of these temperatures. Host selection behaviour was continuously recorded during exploitation of an aphid patch. We observed that warm-developed females and parasitoids foraging at high temperature attacked low-quality hosts more frequently than females from other treatments. These results support the hypothesis that a decrease in expected parasitoid reproductive success resulted in risk-prone behaviours. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence suggesting that temperature influences host stage selection and risk-sensitive making decision in parasitoids, and the present study is the first to support the relative fitness rule.(c) 2015 The Linnean Society of London,

AB  - Organismal performance abilities occupy a central position in phenotypic evolution; they are determined by suites of interacting lower-level traits (e.g., morphology and physiology) and they are a primary focus of natural selection. The mechanisms by which higher levels of organismal performance are achieved during evolution are therefore fundamentally important for understanding correlated evolution in general and coadaptation in particular. Here we address correlated evolution of morphological, physiological, and behavioral characteristics that influence interspecific variation in sprint speed in a clade of lacertid lizards. Phylogenetic analyses using independent contrasts indicate that the evolution of high maximum sprinting abilities (measured on a photocell-timed racetrack) has occurred via the evolution of (1) longer hind limbs relative to body size, and (2) a higher physiologically optimum temperature for sprinting. For ectotherms, which experience variable body temperatures while active, sprinting abilities in nature depend on both maximum capacities and relative performance levels (i.e., percent of maximum) that can be attained. With respect to temperature effects, relative performance levels are determined by the interaction between thermal physiology and thermoregulatory behavior. Among the 13 species or subspecies of lizards in the present study, differences in the optimal temperature for sprinting (body temperature at which lizards run fastest) closely matched interspecific variation in median preferred body temperature (measured in a laboratory photothermal gradient), indicating correlated evolution of thermal physiology and thermal preferences. Variability of the preferred body temperatures maintained by each species is, across species, negatively correlated with the thermal-performance breadth (range of body temperatures over which lizards can run relatively fast). This pattern leads to interspecific differences in the levels of relative sprint speed that lizards are predicted to attain while active at their preferred temperatures. The highest levels of predicted relative performance are achieved by species that combine a narrow, precise distribution of preferred temperatures with the ability to sprint at near-maximum speeds over a wide range of body temperatures. The observed among-species differences in predicted relative speed were positively correlated with the interspecific variation in maximum sprinting capacities. Thus, species that attain the highest maximum speeds are (1) also able to run at near-maximum levels over a wide range of temperatures and (2) also maintain body temperatures within a narrow zone near the optimal temperature for sprinting. The observed pattern of correlated evolution therefore has involved traits at distinct levels of biological organization, that is, morphology, physiology, and behavior; and tradeoffs are not evident. We hypothesize that this particular trait combination has evolved in response to coadaptational selection pressures. We also discuss our results in the context of possible evolutionary responses to global climatic change.

AB  - Maternal effects on progeny wing size and shape in a homozygous parthenogenetic strain of Drosophila mercatorum were investigated. The impact of external maternal factors (heat stress) and the impact of internal maternal factors (different maternal and grand maternal age) were studied. The offspring developed under identical environmental conditions, and due to lack of genetic variation any phenotypic difference among offspring could be ascribed to maternal effects. Wing size was estimated by centroid size, shape was analysed with the Procrustes geometric morphometric method and variation in landmark displacement was visualized by principal component analysis. Both kinds of maternal effects had a significant impact on progeny wing size and shape. Maternal heat stress led to the same pattern of response in size and shape among the progeny, with increased difference between the control group and progeny from heat stressed flies in both size and shape with increased maternal heat stress temperature. The effects of maternal age, however, led to different responses in size and shape between the different progeny groups. The observed variation in landmark displacements was similar, and in both cases mainly associated with shape differences of the posterior part of the wing. Finally, our results suggest that maternal effect has some evolutionary implications by altering the genetic correlations among traits, which can affect the response to selective pressures.

Decrease in or total loss of winter diapause expression recently observed in some species could arise from inhibiting maternal effects. In this study, we explored transgenerational effects on diapause expression and traits in one commercial and one Canadian field strain of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi. These strains were reared under short photoperiod (8:16 h LD) and low temperature (14 degrees C) conditions over two generations. Diapause levels, developmental times, physiological and morphological traits were measured. Diapause levels increased after one generation in the Canadian field but not in the commercial strain. For both strains, the second generation took longer to develop than the first one. Tibia length and wing surface decreased over generations while fat content increased. A crossed-generations experiment focusing on the industrial parasitoid strain showed that offspring from mothers reared at 14 degrees C took longer to develop, were heavier, taller with wider wings and with more fat reserves than those from mothers reared at 20 degrees C (8:16 h LD). No effect of the mother rearing conditions was shown on diapause expression. Additionally to direct plasticity of the offspring, results suggest transgenerational plasticity effects on diapause expression, development time, and on the values of life-history traits. We demonstrated that populations showing low diapause levels may recover higher levels through transgenerational plasticity in response to diapause-induction cues, provided that environmental conditions are reaching the induction-thresholds specific to each population. Transgenerational plasticity is thus important to consider when evaluating how insects adapt to changing environments.

AB  - Hypotheses: Recently established populations, sharing common ancestry but facing different reproductive habitat seasonality, will genetically diverge in the timing of their reproductive migrations.
   Organism: Exotic populations of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) established from common ancestors introduced to South Island of New Zealand between 1901 and 1907.
   Site of experiments: Early rearing at Silverstream Hatchery, Waimakariri River, New Zealand, followed by release to sea, growth in coastal ocean, and return to freshwater.
   Methods: We reared early- and late-spawned juveniles from two populations that differ in spawning time in the wild, and released those fish to mature at sea. We obtained dates of migratory return to freshwater, fish age, and experimental group identity from angler captures at river mouths. Analyses involved assessment of population, spawning date, and age at return effects for the current experiment, plus an expanded analysis of data from previous release experiments.
   Results: After 26 generations, the population that reproduces later in the wild now returns to freshwater an average of 18 days later than the early spawning population. This divergence is likely genetic, given the common-garden nature of our experimental design, and was apparent even after accounting for significant effects of age at return and marginal effects of initial spawning date.

AB  - Thermal tolerance allows many organisms, including insects, to withstand stressful temperatures. Thermal generalists are expected to have higher thermal tolerance than specialists, but the environmental conditions leading to the evolution of a thermal generalist life history are not fully understood. Thermal variability has been put forth as an evolutionary driver of high thermal tolerance, but rarely has this been empirically tested. We used a generalist agricultural pest grasshopper, Melanoplus differentialis, to test upper and lower thermal limits of populations that experienced different levels of thermal variability.
   We quantified thermal heterogeneity at five sites in a longitudinal transect in the Midwestern U.S. by examining, over a 101-year period, 1) variance in daily thermal maxima and minima; and 2) daily range. Also, as a measure of a biologically relevant thermal extreme, we depicted days per month at each site that reached a stressfully high temperature for M. differentially. We collected individuals from these sites and tested their upper and lower thermal limits. We found that most of our metrics of thermal heterogeneity differed among sites, while all sites experienced an average of at least two stressfully high temperature events per month. We found that heavier males from these sites were able to withstand both warmer and colder temperatures than smaller males, while heavier females had no thermal advantage over lighter females. However, site of origin had no effect on thermal tolerance.
   Our findings indicate three things: 1) there is no clear correlation between thermal variability and thermal tolerance in the populations we studied; 2) weight affects thermal tolerance range among sites for M. differentialis males, and 3) thermal extremes may be more important than thermal variability in determining CTMax in this species.

AB  - We hypothesized that correlation between growth traits and upper thermal tolerance (UTT) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) might be explained by quantitative trait loci (QTL) localized to the same linkage groups. Microsatellites on three autosomal linkage groups carrying UTT QTL in rainbow trout were tested for associations with fork length (FL) and condition factor (K) in half-sib families of outbred rainbow trout and in backcrosses of trout lines selected on UTT. Additionally, we used a sex-linked microsatellite (OmyFGT19TUF) to test for marker-trait associations at the sex chromosomes. The sex-linked marker OmyFGT19TUF was significantly associated with FL and UTT, accounting for up to 9.6% and 9.7% of variance in these traits, respectively. Male advantages in FL (and, to a lesser extent, UTT) relative to their female sibs were dependent on the origin of the Y chromosome and thus varied among grandsire lines. However, males had higher K in a manner unrelated to Y chromosomal origin, suggesting a partially sex-limited expression of this trait. Omy325UoG was significantly associated with K in one of the outbred half-sib families, but no other significant autosomal marker-trait associations were detected. Our findings illustrate minor evidence that correlation between UTT and FL is partially determined by one or more sex-chromosomal QTL.

AB  - We conducted laboratory experiments to examine the functional response and conducted comparative laboratory and field studies to examine the prey selection of walleye, Stizostedion vitreum, larvae. Maximum consumption rate (C-max, micrograms per hour) increased exponentially with walleye mean length whereas the prey abundance at which 90% of C-max is attained (D-90, prey per litre) increased initially and then declined with mean length. Prey size had no significant effect on C-max whereas D-90 declined significantly with increasing prey size. Selection for relatively larger prey and selection for large cladocerans relative to cyclopoid copepods increased significantly with walleye mean length. Walleye larvae consistently selected most strongly for relatively uncommon prey. Selection for relatively smaller prey and selection for cyclopoid copepods relative to large cladocerans increased significantly with total prey abundance in field studies and some laboratory studies. Variance in prey selection showed a significant, negative relationship with prey abundance in laboratory studies. Selection for medium (greater than or equal to 0.3-0.6 mm body width) relative to smalt (<0.3 mm) prey declined significantly with increasing temperature in field studies. Our results suggest that the feeding success of walleye larvae may be limited by both the abundance and size composition of the zooplankton communities in natural environments.

AB  - The currently rising sea temperatures are expected to affect the structure of aquatic communities. Through increased metabolic rates, activity and feeding motivation, higher temperature can be expected to add to competition and predation risk for many small fish and juveniles. However, behavioural flexibility e.g. individual variation in the expression of behavioural traits may act to buffer the detrimental effects of increased temperature. In the present study we ask how juvenile Atlantic cod respond to food availability and predation risk at the limits of their current natural temperature at the Icelandic coast (3 degrees C-13 degrees C). At 13 degrees C Atlantic cod juveniles responded less to risk, remaining active, dispersed and leaving shelter positions earlier. However, at the same time their feeding attempts reduce significantly and correspondingly to the lower temperature. Therefore, our results suggest that at 13 degrees C Atlantic cod juveniles do not adjust their behaviour to manage the increased feeding motivation while under risk. However, we do find evidence for individual variation in how behaviour is expressed across treatments indicating natural variation that could respond to selection. In conclusion, our results suggest that increased sea temperature could have both immediate negative effects on survival and initiate a selective response in Atlantic cod populations.

AB  - Fisher's fundamental theorem states that heritable variation for net fitness sets a limit to the rate of response to natural selection. How will temperate (i.e. cold-tolerant) species cope with contemporary rapid global warming? Using three-fold replicated lines of Drosophila subobscura that had been allowed to evolve for 4 years (between 32 and 59 generations) at 13 degrees C (cold), 18 degrees C (the supposed optimum temperature), and 22 degrees C (warm) I assess here how net fitness changes according to thermal environments. Net fitness was estimated following the classical approach in population genetics of competing over a number of generation in outbred experimental populations multiple wild-type O chromosomes (homologous to arm 3R in D. melanogaster) independently derived from each base thermal stock in an otherwise homogeneous genetic background against a balancer chromosome. Warm-adapted populations ('warm-adapted O chromosomes') performed comparatively well at all tested temperatures. However, net fitness was severely reduced in cold-adapted populations when transferred to warmer conditions. It seems, therefore, that thermal fitness breath for D. subobscura flies is positively associated to temperature. These findings are discussed in relation to the fast world-wide clinal shifts in the frequency of genetic markers correlated with current climate change.

AB  - Osteology of vertebrates plays an indispensable role in taxonomy, form-function evolution and ecological adaptations. The Asian narrow-mouth toad genus Kaloula is an interesting group that is known for many species having a fossorial life. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive osteological account of Kaloula. Herein, we present the osteology of K. borealis with the help of micro-CT scanning and double-staining technologies, which is the first detailed osteological description of the genus. Osteological comparisons with other members of Microhylinae indicate that K. borealis is characterized by the following traits: skull obviously wider than long; suture between frontoparietals narrow; parasphenoid posterior to vomer; premaxilla, maxilla and vomer edentate; clavicles absent; procoracoids small; omosternum and sternum cartilaginous; crista femoris present and large; femur longer than tibiofibula; prehallux including one element. Remarkably, the species possesses a series of osteological specializations that probably are adaptations for the hindlimbs-first burrowing and a fossorial life, including stout hindlimb, robust crista femoris, tibiofibula shorter than femur, enlarged prehallux, long anterior ramus of the pterygoid and branched bronchial processes of the cricoid. These findings will contribute to the systematics of microhylids and evolutionary interpretations of the osteological adaptation to fossorial life.

AB  - Coccinella septempunctata L. was reared under laboratory conditions using allogamy technique aiming to convert the natural local progeny to laboratory progeny for the purpose of continuing the predator production, as well to sustain numerical values of its biological and morphological parameters. The research was conducted on local C septempunctata strains collected from agro-ecosystems in the Syrian coast. The results proved the stability of the genetic structure of such progenies through three generations as all statistical differences were non-significant at 5% significance level. Also, the results confirmed the response of these progenies to the abovementioned method where fecundity raised (7.5%) from 98.2 +/- 20.8 in parent generation (Po) to 105.6 +/- 20.3 in 2(nd) generation (172). Predation rate of larvae raised (6.8%) from 88.8 +/- 2.87 in Po to 94.8 +/- 12.31 in F2. As well were the values of all other biological parameters (developmental period, reproductively, survival rates and female body length).

AB  - Whole-organism performance depends on body temperature and ectotherms have variable body temperatures. The thermal coadaptation hypothesis posits that thermal reaction norms have coevolved with thermal preference such that organisms attain optimal performance under a narrow range of body temperatures commonly experienced in the wild. Since thermal reaction norms are often similar, researchers interested in the effects of temperature on fitness often use one easily measured thermal reaction norm, such as locomotor performance, and assume it is a good proxy for fitness when testing the thermal coadaptation hypothesis. The extent to which this assumption holds, however, is often untested. In this study, we provide a stringent test of the thermal coadaptation hypothesis in red and in confused flour beetles by comparing the thermal reaction norm for reproductive output to the preferred body temperature range. We also test the assumption that locomotor performance can serve as a proxy for the thermal reaction norm for reproductive output, a more ultimate index of fitness. In both species, we measured the number of eggs laid, righting time, and sprint speed at eight temperatures, as well as the thermal preference in a thermal gradient. The number of eggs laid increased with female sprint speed and with male righting time, and all three performances had similar thermal reaction norms, with 80% of the maximum achieved between 23 and 37 degrees C. Red flour beetles had preferred body temperatures that matched the optimal temperature for performance; confused flour beetles had lower preferred body temperature than the optimal temperature for performance. We found support for the assumption that locomotor performance can serve as a proxy for reproductive output in flour beetles, but we only found evidence for thermal coadaptation in one of the two species.

AB  - Since humans and chimpanzees split from a common ancestor over 6 million years ago, human metabolism has changed dramatically. This change includes adaptations to a high-quality diet, the evolution of an energetically expensive brain, dramatic increases in endurance abilities, and capacity for energy storage in white adipose tissue. Human metabolism continues to evolve in modern human populations in response to local environmental and cultural selective forces. Understanding the nature of these selective forces and the physiological responses during human evolution is a compelling challenge for evolutionary biologists. The complex genetic architecture surrounding metabolic phenotypes indicates that selection probably altered allelic frequencies across many loci in populations experiencing adaptive metabolic change to fit their environment. A recent analysis supports this hypothesis, finding that classic selective sweeps at single loci were rare during the past 250 000 years of human evolution. Detection of selective signatures at multiple loci, as well as exploration of physiological adaptation to environment in humans, will require cross-disciplinary collaboration, including the incorporation of biological pathway analysis. This review explores the Thrifty Genotype Hypothesis, high-altitude adaptation, cold-resistance adaptation, and genetic evidence surrounding these proposed metabolic adaptations in an attempt to clarify current challenges and avenues for future progress.

AB  - When a species experiences a new climate, it can adapt in two main ways: become genetically adapted to the new temperature, or adopt a plastic approach that allows it to survive at a range of temperatures. The constraint on fitness for genetically adapted populations that are exposed to a new temperature has been well studied, but the range of optimal temperatures and their effect on fitness has never been examined across the worldwide distribution of a plastic species. Here, we determined the optimum temperature range of 11 populations of the phenotypically plastic species Drosophila simulans. We measured the influence of temperature on eggs, larvae and adults at six temperatures that span the natural range the flies experience during their primary breeding season. We found no correlation between optimum temperature and native temperature, an effect that is not likely due to laboratory maintenance, suggesting that the species has not locally adapted to temperature. We also found that this species had equal survival and reproductive success at most of the temperatures and life stages that we tested, regardless of the native temperature where the flies originated. Thus, this genetically plastic species has an optimum fitness at a surprisingly wide range of temperatures, and is the first example of a cosmopolitan species exhibiting this large amount of plasticity across its sampling distribution.
