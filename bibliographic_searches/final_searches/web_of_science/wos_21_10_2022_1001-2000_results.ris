AB  - In three years, maximum seawater adaptability in 2-yr-old Baltic salmon (Salmo salar) was found during a period of about 2 wk in late May - early June. At this time the previously mature males developed in one of two directions, One group (8-44%) developed a seawater adaptability comparable with that of immature fish whereas the other did not. Previously mature males that did not adapt to seawater had larger gonadosomatic indices than males with good performance in seawater. Individually tagged previously mature males and immature fish released into the river in spring had a total adult recapture rate of 1.6 and 11.6%, respectively. In both groups the recapture rate was highest for fish released about 2 wk before the time of optimal seawater adaptability. The effect of size on recapture rate was more pronounced among previously mature males than among immature fish, with a particularly low recapture rate of small previously mature males. It is suggested that previously mature male parr can either mature sexually again or complete smoltification in spring and that the probability for smoltification and seaward migration is affected by body size and the conditions for growth during the previous autumn-winter.

AB  - The evolutionary significance of sex-determining mechanisms, particularly temperature-dependent sex de termination (TSD) in reptiles, has remained unresolved despite extensive theoretical work. To investigate the evolutionary significance of this unusual sex-determining mechanism, I incubated eggs of the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) at a male-producing temperature (26 degrees C), a female-producing temperature (30 degrees C), and an intermediate temperature that produced both sexes about equally (28 degrees C). Laboratory experiments indicated that two performance variables, but no morphological measurements, were significantly influenced by incubation temperature (P less than or equal to 0.05): hatchlings from cooler incubation treatments swam faster than turtles from warmer incubation treatments, and hatchlings from 28 degrees C exhibited a greater propensity to run than did individuals from 26 degrees C and 30 degrees C. In the field, hatchlings from the all-male and all-female producing temperatures had significantly higher first-year survivorship than did consexuals from the incubation temperature that produced both sexes (G = 6.622, P = 0.03). Significant directional selection was detected on propensity of hatchlings to run (beta' = -0.758, P = 0.05): turtles that tended to remain immobile had a higher probability of first-year survivorship than did individuals that moved readily. Thus, the effects of the gender x incubation temperature interaction on survivorship of hatchling turtles observed in the field experiment may have been mediated by temperature-dependent antipredator behavior. These results provide a possible functional explanation for the evolutionary significance of TSD in turtles that is consistent with predictions of theoretical models.

AB  - Vertebral number is adaptively important in fishes and is associated with body shape at broad taxonomic ranks. Less is known about this association within species. Rhoadsia is a deep-bodied characid genus endemic to western Ecuador and northwestern Peru. It includes two species differing in body depth (BD), described from different drainages and elevations. Recently, BD has been found to vary with elevation in parallel between similar to 30 and 1260 m across drainages in western Ecuador. Here, we report that vertebral number also covaries with elevation and with body shape. The latter association was present both across and within sites, suggesting that these traits are phenotypically integrated. The ratio of precaudal to caudal vertebrae also differed significantly among drainages, and variation in vertebral number appeared to be associated primarily with the caudal vertebrae, raising questions about its potential adaptive significance given the functional importance of caudal vertebrae in fishes. Vertebral number was associated with body size at some sites, consistent with geographically localized pleomerism. Disentangling the causative mechanisms at play will probably be complex and represents an important future research direction. This is one of the first known cases of an association between vertebral number and elevation in fishes.

AB  - Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) is a common and forensically important blow fly species in the Oriental region. However, in the higher mountain regions and on winter days, its habitats are occupied by a closely related species, Chrysomya pinguis (Walker). The resources that the two species employ to survive are very similar and competition between the species may be one of the factors that trigger differentiation of their behaviors. We conducted experiments to examine how these two closely related species may have adapted to different temperature regimes to avoid competition. Several adult and immature parameters were assessed, such as fecundity, locomotor ability, hatching ratio, larval survivorship, and eclosion ratio. Results indicate that species show specific diapause at high temperature (38 degrees C), larval survivorship of Ch. megacephala was significantly better than that of Ch. pinguis. Conversely, at low temperature (15 degrees C), adult locomotor ability was better for Ch. pinguis than for Ch. megacephala. The results indicate that the two species may have evolved different temperature adaptation strategies to avoid competition. In mixed-species larval rearing experiments, competition between Ch. pinguis and Ch. megacephala was observed: at higher temperature (30 degrees C), the immature performance index of Ch. megacephala was significantly increased when compared to that in single-species culture, whereas the index of Ch. pinguis was decreased. These data are consistent with the idea that tolerance for higher temperature conditions would allow larvae of Ch. megacephala to gain a competitive advantage over Ch. pinguis in certain habitats. These results may help to explain their current distribution in the environment and provide more biological information on these forensically important species.

AB  - Variation in colour patterning is prevalent among and within species. A number of theories have been proposed in explaining its evolution. Because solar radiation interacts with the pigmentation of the integument causing light to either be reflected or absorbed into the body, thermoregulation has been considered to be a primary selective agent, particularly among ectotherms. Accordingly, the colour-mediated thermoregulatory hypothesis states that darker individuals will heat faster and reach higher thermal equilibria while paler individuals will have the opposite traits. It was further predicted that dark colouration would promote slower cooling rates and higher thermal performance temperatures. To test these hypotheses we quantified the reflectance, selected body temperatures, performance optima, as well as heating and cooling rates of an ectothermic vertebrate, Lampropholis delicata. Our results indicated that colour had no influence on thermal physiology, as all thermal traits were uncorrelated with reflectance. We suggest that crypsis may instead be the stronger selective agent as it may have a more direct impact on fitness. Our study has improved our knowledge of the functional differences among individuals with different colour patterns, and the evolutionary significance of morphological variation within species.

AB  - Many organisms modify their physiological functions by acclimating to changes in their environment. Recent studies of thermal physiology have been influenced by verbal models that fail to consider the selective advantage of acclimation and thus make no predictions about variation in acclimation capacity. We used a quantitative model of optimal plasticity to generate predictions about the capacity of Drosophila melanogaster to acclimate to developmental temperature. This model predicts that the ability to acclimate thermal sensitivity should evolve when temperature varies greatly among generations. Based on the model, we expected that flies from the highly seasonal environment of New Jersey would acclimate thermal sensitivity more than would flies from the less seasonal environment of Florida. When raised at constant and fluctuating temperatures, flies from these populations failed to adjust their thermal optima in the way predicted by the model, suggesting that current assumptions about functional and genetic constraints should be reconsidered.

AB  - Aim: To assess whether observed thermal bounds in species' latitudinal ranges (i.e., realized thermal niches) can be used to predict patterns of occurrence and abundance changes observed during a marine heatwave, relative to other important life history and functional traits.
   Location: Rottnest Island, Western Australia.
   Methods: A time series of standardized quantitative surveys of reef fishes spanning 8years of pronounced ocean temperature change is used to test whether accurate predictions on shifts in species occupancy and abundance are possible using species traits.
   Results: Species-level responses in occurrence and abundance were closely related to the mid-point of their realized thermal niche, more so than body size, range size or trophic level. Most of the species that disappeared from survey counts during the heatwave were characterized by geographic ranges that did not extend to latitudes with temperatures equivalent to the ocean temperature peak during the heatwave. We thus find support for the hypothesis that current distribution limits are set directly or indirectly by temperature and are highly responsive to ocean temperature variability.
   Main conclusions: Our study shows that reef fish community structure can change very quickly when exposed to extreme thermal anomalies, in directions predicted from the realized thermal niche of the species present. Such predictions can thus identify species that will be most responsive to changing ocean climate. Continued warming, coupled with periodic extreme heat events, may lead to the loss of ecosystem services and ecological functions, as mobile species relocate to more hospitable climes, while less mobile species may head towards extinction.

AB  - Local adaptation can occur at small spatial scales relative to the dispersal capacity of species. Alpine ecosystems have sharp environmental clines that offer an opportunity to investigate the effects of fine-scale shifts in species' niche breadth on adaptive genetic processes. Here we examine two grasshopper species endemic to the Australian Alps (Kosciuscola spp.) that differ in elevational niche breadth: one broader, K. usitatus (1400-2200 m), and one narrower, K. tristis (1600-2000 m). We examine signatures of selection with respect to environmental and morphological variables in two mountain regions using F-ST outlier tests and environmental association analyses (EAAs) applied to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data (K. usitatus: 9017 SNPs, n = 130; K. tristis: 7363 SNPs, n = 135). Stronger genetic structure was found in the more narrowly distributed K. tristis, which showed almost twice the number of SNPs under putative selection (10.8%) compared with K. usitatus (5.3%). When examining SNPs in common across species (n = 3058), 260 SNPs (8.5%) were outliers shared across species, and these were mostly associated with elevation, a proxy for temperature, suggesting parallel adaptive processes in response to climatic drivers. Additive polygenic scores (an estimate of the cumulative signal of selection across all candidate loci) were nonlinearly and positively correlated with elevation in both species. However, a steeper correlation in K. tristis indicated a stronger signal of spatially varying selection towards higher elevations. Our study illustrates that the niche breadth of co-occurring and related species distributed along the same environmental cline is associated with differences in patterns of microgeographical adaptation.

AB  - Manta and devil rays are an iconic group of globally distributed pelagic filter feeders, yet their evolutionary history remains enigmatic. We employed next generation sequencing of mitogenomes for nine of the II recognized species and two outgroups; as well as additional Sanger sequencing of two mitochondria] and two nuclear genes in an extended taxon sampling set. Analysis of the mitogenome coding regions in a Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian framework provided a well-resolved phylogeny. The deepest divergences distinguished three clades with high support, one containing Manta birostris, Manta alfredi, Mobuki tarapacana, Mobula japanica and Mobula mobular; one containing Mobula kuhlii, Mobula eregoodootenkee and Mobula thurstoni; and one containing Mobula munkiana, Mobula hypostoma and Mobula rochebrunei. Mobula remains paraphyletic with the inclusion of Manta, a result that is in agreement with previous studies based on molecular and morphological data. A fossil-calibrated Bayesian random local clock analysis suggests that mobulids diverged from Rhinoptera around 30 Mya. Subsequent divergences are characterized by long internodes followed by short bursts of speciation extending from an initial episode of divergence in the Early and Middle Miocene (19-17 Mya) to a second episode during the Pliocene and Pleistocene (3.6 Mya - recent). Estimates of divergence dates overlap significantly with periods of global warming, during which upwelling intensity - and related high primary productivity in upwelling regions decreased markedly. These periods are hypothesized to have led to fragmentation and isolation of feeding regions leading to possible regional extinctions, as well as the promotion of allopatric speciation. The closely shared evolutionary history of mobulids in combination with ongoing threats from fisheries and climate change effects on upwelling and food supply, reinforces the case for greater protection of this charismatic family of pelagic filter feeders.

AB  - Background: Changed temperature not only threaten agricultural production, but they also affect individual biological behavior, population and community of many insects, and consequently reduce the stability of our ecosystem. Insect's ability to respond to temperature stress evolved through a complex adaptive process, thus resulting in varied temperature tolerance among different insects. Both high and low extreme temperatures are detrimental to insect development since they constitute an important abiotic stress capable of inducing abnormal biological responses. Many studies on heat or cold tolerance of ladybirds have focused on measurements of physiological and biochemical indexes such as supercooling point, higher/lower lethal temperatures, survival rate, dry body weight, water content, and developmental duration. And studies of the molecular mechanisms of ladybird responses to heat or cold stress have focused on single genes, such as those encoding heat shock proteins, but has not been analyzed by transcriptome profiling.
   Results: In this study, we report the use of Digital Gene Expression ( DGE) tag profiling to gain insight into transcriptional events associated with heat-and cold-stress in C. montrouzieri. About 6 million tags ( 49 bp in length) were sequenced in a heat stress group, a cold stress group and a negative control group. We obtained 687 and 573 genes that showed significantly altered expression levels following heat and cold shock treatments, respectively. Analysis of the global gene expression pattern suggested that 42 enzyme-encoding genes mapped to many Gene Ontology terms are associated with insect's response to heat-and cold-stress.
   Conclusions: These results provide a global assessment of genes and molecular mechanisms involved in heat and cold tolerance.

AB  - Ectothermic animals depend on environmental temperature to regulate their body temperature. The Chaco Tortoise (Chelonoidis chilensis) is widespread in South America; however, populations are threatened mainly because of the pet trade. We described the activity pattern of C. chilensis relative to environmental temperature under semi-natural conditions in a zoo enclosure. We also estimated thermal parameters under controlled laboratory conditions: selected temperature (T-sel) and critical maximum temperature (CTmax) between sex and size indicators. In the enclosure, 81% of the observations were from inactive tortoises and 19% from active tortoises. Tortoises were active over a wide thermal range (12.0 degrees-38.0 degrees C) and T-sel was 34.4 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees C (mean +/- standard error), with no significant differences among sizes or between sexes. Heavier tortoises spent significantly more time at the lowest temperature than lighter ones. The range of CTmax was 36.3 degrees-42.0 degrees C and this parameter was inversely related to tortoise length but did not differ between sexes. The results suggest a wide thermal range in C. chilensis, dependence of thermal behavior on body size but not on sex, and a wider range of body temperatures in smaller individuals than in larger ones. Knowing the parameters that influence thermoregulation contributes to the improvement of management strategies under semi-natural conditions, which, in turn, can be extrapolated to wild populations.

AB  - Thermoregulation in aquatic ectotherms is a complex behavioral pattern that is affected by various biotic and abiotic factors with one being salinity. Especially in coastal and estuarine habitats, altering levels of salinity involve osmoregulatory adjustments that affect total energy budgets and may influence behavioral responses towards temperature. To examine the effect of salinity on behavioral thermoregulation in a marine evertebrate ectotherm, we acclimated juvenile and sub-adult common brown shrimp (Crangon crangon, L.) to salinities of 10, 20 and 30 PSU and investigated their thermal preference in an annular chamber system using the gravitational method for temperature preference determination. Thermal preference of individual brown shrimp was considerably variable and brown shrimp selected a wide range of temperatures in each level of salinity as well as within individual experimental trials. However, salinity significantly affected thermal preference with the shrimp selecting higher temperatures at 10 and 20 PSU when compared to 30 PSU of salinity. Body size had no effect on thermal selection and did not interact with salinity. Temperature preference differed by sex and male shrimp selected significantly higher temperatures at 10 PSU when compared to females. The results show that salinity strongly affects thermal selection in brown shrimp and confirms the strong interrelation of temperature and salinity on seasonal migratory movements that has been previously derived from observations in the field. In the field, however, it remains unclear whether salinity drives thermal selection or whether changes in temperature modify salinity preference.

AB  - 1. Environmental variation experienced in the parental and grandparental generation can affect progeny phenotype, performance and response to selection. Here the effects of parental and grandparental exposure to a non-lethal cold shock are considered in Drosophila serrata Malloch. Development time, viability and early age productivity were measured in flies originating from border and central locations in the distribution of this species that had been held under two separate laboratory maintenance schedules.
   2. Cross-generation effects were detected for several traits. Development time usually decreased following maternal and/or grandmaternal cold exposure. Parental cold exposure negatively influenced viability while grandparental effects on viability were negligible. Early female productivity showed opposing responses depending on generation; maternal cold exposure increased progeny productivity while grandmaternal exposure decreased it. Male parental and grandparental exposure to cold shock decreased male productivity, although this pattern may have been partly confounded by size effects.
   3. Population effects, reflecting geographical origin, were limited to development time, while selective background effects were demonstrated for most traits. The influence these factors had on the expression of cross-generation effects was negligible, given interactions with treatment were not evident. These responses suggest that environmental variation experienced in preceding generations can influence progeny phenotype in a manner that is complex and difficult to predict.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation are predicted to mitigate some of the negative biotic consequences of climate change. Here, we evaluate evidence for plastic and evolutionary responses to climate variation in amphibians and reptiles via a literature review and meta-analysis. We included studies that either document phenotypic changes through time or space. Plasticity had a clear and ubiquitous role in promoting phenotypic changes in response to climate variation. For adaptive evolution, we found no direct evidence for evolution of amphibians or reptiles in response to climate change over time. However, we found many studies that documented adaptive responses to climate along spatial gradients. Plasticity provided a mixture of adaptive and maladaptive responses to climate change, highlighting that plasticity frequently, but not always, could ameliorate climate change. Based on our review, we advocate for more experiments that survey genetic changes through time in response to climate change. Overall, plastic and genetic variation in amphibians and reptiles could buffer some of the formidable threats from climate change, but large uncertainties remain owing to limited data.

AB  - Nongenetic inheritance mechanisms such as transgenerational plasticity (TGP) can buffer populations against rapid environmental change such as ocean warming. Yet, little is known about how long these effects persist and whether they are cumulative over generations. Here, we tested for adaptive TGP in response to simulated ocean warming across parental and grandparental generations of marine sticklebacks. Grandparents were acclimated for two months during reproductive conditioning, whereas parents experienced developmental acclimation, allowing us to compare the fitness consequences of short-term vs. prolonged exposure to elevated temperature across multiple generations. We found that reproductive output of F1 adults was primarily determined by maternal developmental temperature, but carry-over effects from grandparental acclimation environments resulted in cumulative negative effects of elevated temperature on hatching success. In very early stages of growth, F2 offspring reached larger sizes in their respective paternal and grandparental environment down the paternal line, suggesting that other factors than just the paternal genome may be transferred between generations. In later growth stages, maternal and maternal granddam environments strongly influenced offspring body size, but in opposing directions, indicating that the mechanism(s) underlying the transfer of environmental information may have differed between acute and developmental acclimation experienced by the two generations. Taken together, our results suggest that the fitness consequences of parental and grandparental TGP are highly context dependent, but will play an important role in mediating some of the impacts of rapid climate change in this system.

AB  - 1. Experimental growth data for Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.), all fed on excess rations, from 11 European watercourses between 54 and 70degreesN were analysed and fitted to a new general growth model for fish. The model was validated by comparing its predictions with the growth rate of charr in the wild.
   2. Growth performance varied among populations, mainly because of variation in the maximum growth potential, whereas the thermal response curves were similar. The estimated lower and upper temperatures for growth varied between -1.7 to 5.3 and 20.8-23.2degreesC, respectively, while maximum growth occurred between 14.4 and 17.2degreesC.
   3. There was no geographical or climatic trend in growth performance among populations and therefore no indication of thermal adaptation. The growth potential of charr from different populations correlated positively with fish body length at maturity and maximum weight in the wild. Charr from populations including large piscivorous fish had higher growth rates under standardised conditions than those from populations feeding on zoobenthos or zooplankton. Therefore, the adaptive variation in growth potential was related to life-history characteristics and diet, rather than to thermal conditions.

AB  - Organisms can diverge in life history when introduced outside their native range due to release from predators, competitors, and parasites, and also due to genetic drift and local adaptation. We studied the ecology of the American Bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) in its introduced range in British Columbia (BC). To assess differences between introduced and native populations, we compared the population ecology of BC bullfrogs to published life-history parameters from the bullfrog's extensive native range in eastern North America. In BC, bullfrogs emerged from hibernation in late April and early May. Breeding choruses developed fully when air temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C. Eggs were laid from mid-June to mid-July when the mean water temperature was 20 degrees C. Mean egg mass size was 13,014 +/- 7,296 eggs (mean standard deviation). Tadpoles hatched in 3 to 5 days and overwintered the first year as tadpoles. Approximately 68% of the tadpoles metamorphosed at the end of the following summer, but the remaining spent a second winter in the pond. Bullfrogs were large enough to attain sexual maturity 2 yr after metamorphosis. Bullfrog population density among ponds varied from 4.1 to 530 frogs/ha. Terrestrial insects were the primary prey item of bullfrogs < 150 g, whereas frogs were the primary prey item of larger bullfrogs. The life-history parameter values estimated for BC bullfrogs were within the range observed for bullfrogs in their native habitats. Due to milder weather conditions in southwestern BC, the seasonal pattern and growth rate of bullfrogs were similar to lower latitude populations in Kentucky and Missouri. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that when released from native predators and parasites bullfrogs build up to unusually high population densities or attain significantly larger sizes in their introduced range.

AB  - Thermal interface materials (TIMs) have been widely adopted for improved thermal dissipation in flip chip ball grid array (FCBGA), flip chip lidded ball grid array (FCLGA) and flip chip pin grid array (FCPGA) packaging. As the next generation devices' requirements for power get even higher, enhanced thermal performance at the package level is increasingly important. A typical TIM applies a polymer type, but the current polymer TIM products are insufficient to meet the advanced product roadmap requirements due to lack of thermal conductivity, TIM delamination on large size die, unstable process workability and other reasons.
   Even potential candidates for a high thermal conductivity TIMs, such as silver (Ag)-Sintered TIM and graphite sheet have difficulties covering all the development goals of a large body package due to high thermal resistance, poor TIM coverage or too thick bond line thickness (BLT).
   To meet the high-end central processing unit (CPU) market's needs, an indium (In) TIM has been selected for FCLGA or FCPGA products. A pure indium TIM has a low liquidus point and provides a good way to reduce stress during In TIM soldering. However, this characterization of Indium TIM could be a weak point for FCBGAs which need an additional reflow process after TIM and lid attachment. TIM re-melting could occur during the reflow process and affect TIM coverage, cause delamination and create a component shortage issue. This is one of the main reasons that a pure indium TIM is hard to apply on FCBGA devices.
   In this paper, a metal TIM (In and tin (Sn) alloy) will be discussed as a solution for next generation FCBGAs that have a large body size and require high thermal conductivity. These new alloy TIMs are expected to provide better thermal dissipation performance due to both a "high liquid phase point" and a "low solid phase point.".

AB  - In order to gain insights into links between fitness and physiological function, the phenotypic plasticity of life-history traits and thermal tolerances has been investigated in a laboratory strain of the polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica acclimated to a broad range of temperatures. Reproductive pairs were kept in isolation for two months at one of six temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C), and survival and a number of life-history traits recorded. Tolerance to heat and cold was assessed in individuals that survived the acclimation period by measuring upper and lower thermal limits. Life-history and thermal tolerance traits showed different relationships with temperature: generally non-monotonic for life-history and monotonic for thermal limits. The thermal history of the strain used in the study seemed to be partly responsible for this pattern, affecting the thermal responses of most life-history traits, but not those of the upper and lower thermal limits. Survival correlated positively with tolerance to cold but not with heat tolerance. This result supports the idea that tolerance to heat is under stronger selection in O. labronica, resulting in a lower level of plasticity for this trait. Some life-history features positively co-varied with tolerance to heat (e.g. body size), whilst in other cases reproductive traits showed apparent trade-offs with thermal limits. In all cases correlations amongst traits were apparently driven by their relationship with temperature. Even if we found no evolutionary trade-offs among the thermal responses of life-history traits and thermal limits, the strategies evolved by organisms to cope with thermal variability result from the mutual interaction of these traits, which plays a key role in defining organisms' responses to temperature changes and fluctuations.

AB  - 1. Worldwide, the excessive use of insecticides has resulted in field-evolved insecticide-resistant populations of diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella. A deltamethrin-resistant DBM population from the field was divided into two subpopulations in the laboratory. One population (S-strain) was maintained with no further exposure to insecticides, whereas the other population (R-strain) was maintained under a regime of intermittent selection with deltamethrin. 2. Individuals from both strains were reared at constant temperatures in the range 10-35 degrees C in the absence of deltamethrin, and the effects of rearing temperature on various traits were investigated. At the time of experimentation, the R-strain was 20-fold more resistant to deltamethrin than the S-strain. 3. Temperature differentially affected developmental time, adult life span, pupal weight, and fecundity of both strains. Although both strains laid eggs after being reared at 10 degrees C, few of these eggs were fertile. The R-strain developed significantly faster than the S-strain. The integrated performance of the S-strain and R-strain was greatest at 25 and 15 degrees C, respectively. 4. The present study provides important information on the complexities of the outcomes of the interactions between ectotherms and temperature. Specifically, temperature-trait relationships may not be unimodal, and ectotherm genotypes (in this case insecticide-resistance status) and abiotic stresses can interact with unpredictable outcomes. 5. Current models predicting DBM population dynamics and relative abundance in different locations do not consider different thermal biologies of different genotypes. The present study shows the dramatic effects of environment on many parameters used in these models and will help to enhance their accuracy, and thus their utility.

AB  - To fully understand the evolution of sexual dimorphism, it is necessary to study how genetic and developmental systems function to generate sex-specific phenotype as well as sex-specific selection. Males and females show different patterns of energy storage and mitochondrial metabolism from early stages of life, and this may underlie sex-specific developmental pathway to shape both juvenile and adult phenotype. Here, we examined sex-specific relationships between juvenile morphology and behavior, and transcriptional profiles of 4 candidate genes related to mitochondrial function in the 3-spined stickleback. This study provides, for the first time to our knowledge, evidence for sex differences in melanin pigmentation and antipredator behavior as well as the expression of mitochondria-related genes in juvenile sticklebacks. Males were paler and bolder, and overexpressed genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and antioxidant enzymes compared to females. Relationships between phenotypic traits and gene expression were also sex-specific. In general, females showed stronger positive correlations between body size or pigmentation and the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and activity. In both sexes, more fearful individuals overexpressed those genes. Our results suggest that mitochondrial function may either facilitate or constrain sex-specific responses to selection on dimorphic phenotype, possibly generating intralocus sexual conflict on the transcriptional regulation of mito-nuclear genes during ontogeny. This study highlights that mitochondrial regulation plays an important role in the process of phenotypic differentiation between the 2 sexes from early stages of life before apparent sexual dimorphism appears.

AB  - Stressful environments may increase quantitative genetic variation in populations by promoting the expression of genetic variation that has not previously been eliminated or canalized by natural selection. This "selection history" hypothesis predicts that novel stressors will increase quantitative genetic variation, and that the magnitude of this effect will decrease following continued stress exposure. We tested these predictions using Drosophila melanogaster and sternopleural bristle number as a model system. In particular, we examined the effect of high temperature stress (31 degrees C) on quantitative genetic variation before and after our study population had been reared at 31 degrees C for 15 generations. High temperature stress was found to increase both additive genetic variance and heritability, but contrary to the selection history hypothesis prediction, the magnitude of this effect significantly increased after the study population had been reared for 15 generations under high temperature stress. These results demonstrate that high temperature stress increases quantitative genetic variation for bristle number, but do not support the selection history hypothesis as an explanation for this effect.

AB  - The western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) varies significantly in individual growth rates and life-history traits (maturation, reproduction, and survival) among adjacent populations in nature. This study focuses on assessing the genetic and environmental components of the substantial among-population variation in growth rates. Litters of neonates from nine populations inhabiting either mountain meadow or lakeshore habitat were reared for one year in a common-garden experiment with two temperature treatments. Diet, frequency of feeding, light exposure, and daytime temperatures were identical for all individuals. The two different nighttime temperatures (20 degreesC and 25 degreesC) were chosen to mirror field differences in nighttime thermoregulatory constraints for mountain-meadow and lakeshore snakes, respectively. Temperature and source habitat interacted to affect first-year growth rate. Neonates from meadow dams grew fastest in the cooler treatment, whereas those from lakeshore dams grew fastest in the warmer treatment. The observation that naive neonates, which were gestated and raised under identical conditions, grew fastest in environments characteristic of their natal population is evidence both that there are genetic differences among populations for growth and that these differences reflect adaptation to local habitats at a very small geographic scale. In addition, significant directional selection for large birthweight was measured for neonates from all populations. These results are considered in the context of population colonization history, migration and selection, and competing models for growth rate variation.

AB  - The evolution of reptilian viviparity is favoured, according to the cold-climate hypothesis, at high latitudes or altitudes, where egg retention would entail thermal benefits for embryogenesis because of maternal thermoregulation. According to this hypothesis, and considering that viviparity would have evolved through a gradual increase in the extent of intrauterine egg retention, highland oviparous populations are expected to exhibit more advanced embryo development at oviposition than lowland populations. We tested for possible differences in the level of egg retention, embryo development time and thermal biology of oviparous Zootoca vivipara near the extreme altitudinal limits of the species distribution in the north of Spain (mean altitude for lowland populations, 235 m asl.; for highland populations, 1895 m asl.). Altitude influenced neither temperature of active lizards in the field nor temperature selected by lizards in a laboratory thermal gradient, and pregnant females selected lower temperatures in the thermal gradient than did males and nonpregnant females across altitudinal levels. Eggs from highland populations contained embryos more developed at the time of oviposition (Dufaure and Hubert's stages 3335) than eggs of highland populations (stages 3034) and partly because of this difference incubation time was shorter for highland embryos. When analysed for clutches from both altitudinal extremes at the same embryonic stage at oviposition (stage 33), again incubation time was shorter for highland populations, indicating genuine countergradient variation in developmental rate. Our results indicate that temperature is an environmental factor affecting the geographical distribution of different levels of egg retention in Z. vivipara, as predicted by the cold-climate hypothesis on the evolution of viviparity.

AB  - The golden takin (Budorcas laxicolor bedfordt) is a large, forest-dwelling ungulate endemic to the Qingling Mountains, China. A recent Study showed that golden takin move to cifff'erent elevations depending oil the season, remaining at high elevations In Summer, intermediate elevations in winter. and at low elevations for short periods inSpring and autumn. We proposed the following hypotheses' seasonal movement of'golden takin is it response to it shitt in vegetation phenology, which affects forage quality, and uphill movement of golden takin in winter is an adaptation to select areas with higher thermal energy. To test tile I st hypothesis we used relative plienological development derived from the normalized difference vegetation index time series to link seasonal shifts in veoetation phenology to movement patterns Golden takin Golden takin descended to a low elevation with the greening of vegetation in early spring, ascended to it high elevation in late Spring, and descended agai in autumn ass vegetation sencsced To test the 2nd hypothesis we compared thermal energy in the winter habitat with that in other areas of the home range. Using the amount of solar radiation calculated by a solar radiation model. In winter. preterence of the golden takin for exposed Southern slopes at intermediate elevations correlated closely with areas of higher solar radiation Our results indicate that solar radiation and vegetation phenology are critical Eactors in driving seasonal movement of golden takin DOI: 10.1644/08-CMAMM-A-390R1

AB  - Image matching and water-body-detection methodologies are essential parts of generating good-quality digital elevation model (DEM) data. It is one of the very important results for image matching where 1-D searching in the along-track direction is sufficient to find the maximum correlation point if reconstructed unprocessed Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection data (Level-1A data) are used as the source data for DEM products. This important situation is obtained from the general formulation of how to make 1-D searching possible. The image matching quality is evaluated for this 1-D searching method. An image correlation kernel size of 5 by 5 is recommended as the most suitable selection for better horizontal resolution with a slight sacrifice of the image matching error. The satellite pointing fluctuation effect on image matching is also evaluated, leading to the conclusion that it does not seriously affect DEM quality. The water-body-detection technique is another core of DEM generation. The low image correlation coefficient, the low reflectance of water in the near-infrared band 3N, and other spectral characteristics of water were used to identify surface water bodies. In addition, water-body size and the standard deviation of the water-body perimeter elevation are limited for consistent detection without misidentification. As a result, the minimum size of a detectable water body is 0.2km(2).

AB  - Background: Despite its pervasiveness, the genetic basis of adaptation resulting in variation directly or indirectly related to temperature (climatic) gradients is poorly understood. By using 3-fold replicated laboratory thermal stocks covering much of the physiologically tolerable temperature range for the temperate (i.e., cold tolerant) species Drosophila subobscura we have assessed whole-genome transcriptional responses after three years of thermal adaptation, when the populations had already diverged for inversion frequencies, pre-adult life history components, and morphological traits. Total mRNA from each population was compared to a reference pool mRNA in a standard, highly replicated two-colour competitive hybridization experiment using cDNA microarrays.
   Results: A total of 306 (6.6%) cDNA clones were identified as 'differentially expressed' (following a false discovery rate correction) after contrasting the two furthest apart thermal selection regimes (i.e., 13 degrees C vs. 22 degrees C), also including four previously reported candidate genes for thermotolerance in Drosophila (Hsp26, Hsp68, Fst, and Treh). On the other hand, correlated patterns of gene expression were similar in cold- and warm-adapted populations. Analysis of functional categories defined by the Gene Ontology project point to an overrepresentation of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, nucleic acids metabolism and regulation of transcription among other categories. Although the location of differently expressed genes was approximately at random with respect to chromosomes, a physical mapping of 88 probes to the polytene chromosomes of D. subobscura has shown that a larger than expected number mapped inside inverted chromosomal segments.
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that a sizeable number of genes appear to be involved in thermal adaptation in Drosophila, with a substantial fraction implicated in metabolism. This apparently illustrates the formidable challenge to understanding the adaptive evolution of complex trait variation. Furthermore, some clustering of genes within inverted chromosomal sections was detected. Disentangling the effects of inversions will be obviously required in any future approach if we want to identify the relevant candidate genes.

AB  - The calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus annandalei is distributed exclusively in the Indo-Pacific regions from subtropical to tropical estuaries and shallow coastal waters. Its population dynamics is not well understood despite its ecological importance to natural ecosystems and potential applications to aquaculture. We studied the combined effects of temperature and salinity on survivorship and reproduction of P. annandalei. The experimental protocol included adult cohort life table analysis and observations on reproductive parameters of individual females (paired with males) in relation to 9 different temperature-salinity combinations. At salinity level 10-20, the average survival (l(x)= 0.5) and life expectancy at moulting was significantly higher at 18 degrees C (38 days); however, at salinity 30, the survival was significantly higher at 25 degrees C (22.17 days) than either of those at 18 or 32 degrees C. The gross and net reproductive rates were higher (267 and 176 nauplii female(-1) respectively) at salinity 10 and temperature 25 degrees C. Neither interclutch duration nor embryonic development time was affected by salinity; whereas, temperature had a significant effect on both parameters. The clutch size was significantly affected by salinity, but not by temperature. Across temperature-salinity combinations tested in the present study, the total lifetime fecundity was significantly correlated with adult generation time, but not with longevity. The population growth rate (Euler's Gamma) was negatively related to the adult generation time across temperature-salinity levels tested. Continued production of viable fertile clutches by the female required remating with the male at frequent intervals. Our results suggest that the most appropriate temperature-salinity combination for this species is 25 degrees C at salinities 10-15 for reproduction, and 20 degrees C at salinity 10 for survival.

AB  - Aim Temperature influences most components of animal ecology and life history - but what kind of temperature? Physiologists usually examine the influence of body temperatures, while biogeographers and macroecologists tend to focus on environmental temperatures. We aim to examine the relationship between these two measures, to determine the factors that affect lizard body temperatures and to test the effect of both temperature measures on lizard life history. Location World-wide. Methods We used a large (861 species) global dataset of lizard body temperatures, and the mean annual temperatures across their geographic ranges to examine the relationships between body and mean annual temperatures. We then examined factors influencing body temperatures, and tested for the influence of both on ecological and life-history traits while accounting for the influence of shared ancestry. Results Body temperatures and mean annual temperatures are uncorrelated. However, accounting for activity time (nocturnal species have low body temperatures), use of space (fossorial and semi-aquatic species are colder'), insularity (mainland species are hotter') and phylogeny, the two temperatures are positively correlated. High body temperatures are only associated with larger hatchlings and increased rates of biomass production. Annual temperatures are positively correlated with clutch frequency and annual longevity, and negatively correlated with clutch size, age at first reproduction and longevity. Main conclusions Lizards with low body temperatures do not seem to have slower' life-history attributes than species with high body temperatures. The longer seasons prevalent in warm regions, and physiological processes that operate while lizards are inactive (but warm enough), make environmental temperatures better predictors of lizard life-history variation than body temperatures. This surprisingly greater effect of environmental temperatures on lizard life histories hints that global warming may have a profound influence on lizard ecology and evolution.

AB  - Climate change in terms of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature has impact on agriculture including insect pests that minimize the crop yields. To address these impacts, biological studies on aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover on Bt cotton was conducted for six generations during 2013-14 and 2014-15 under different climate change conditions. The results revealed that the biometry of aphid was influenced by increased carbon dioxide (550 ppm CO2) and temperature (rise in 2 degrees C of the prevailing temperature). This was evidenced by decrease in nymphal developmental time (3.67 +/- 0.21 days), longevity of adult (9.43 +/- 0.41 days), increased fecundity (32.46 +/- 0.95) and reduced life cycle (12.28 +/- 0.23 days) in the elevated conditions (both 550 ppm CO2 with 32 degrees C as well as in 550 ppm CO2 + 34 degrees C). However, morphometry of aphid showed slight variations in all the treatments but, aphids under elevated conditions showed reduced body size which indicated that the fitness of aphid was effected in the enriched carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature conditions.

AB  - In reptiles, reproductive maturity is often determined by size rather than age. Consequently, growth early in life may influence population dynamics through effects on generation time and survival to reproduction. Because reproductive phenology and pre- and post-natal growth are temperature dependent, environmental conditions may induce multi-species cohort effects on body size in sympatric reptiles. I present evidence of this using 10 years of neonatal size data for three sympatric viviparous snakes, Dekay's Brown snakes (Storeria dekayi), Red-bellied Snakes (S. occipitomaculata), and Common Garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis). End-of-season neonatal size varied in parallel across species such that snout-vent length was 36%-61% greater and mass was 65%-223% greater in years when gestating females could achieve higher April-May (vs. June-July or August-September) operative temperatures. Thus, temperature had a larger impact during follicular enlargement and ovulation than during gestation or post-natal growth. Multi-species cohort effects like these may affect population dynamics and the magnitude of these effects may increase with climate change.

AB  - Populations within species often exhibit variation in traits that reflect local adaptation and further shape existing adaptive potential for species to respond to climate change. However, our mechanistic understanding of how the environment shapes trait variation remains poor. Here, we used common garden experiments to quantify thermal performance in eight populations of the marine snail Urosalpinx cinerea across thermal gradients on the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts of North America. We then evaluated the relationship between thermal performance and environmental metrics derived from time-series data. Our results reveal a novel pattern of 'mixed' trait performance adaptation, where thermal optima were positively correlated with spawning temperature (cogradient variation), while maximum trait performance was negatively correlated with season length (countergradient variation). This counterintuitive pattern probably arises because of phenological shifts in the spawning season, whereby 'cold' populations delay spawning until later in the year when temperatures are warmer compared to 'warm' populations that spawn earlier in the year when temperatures are cooler. Our results show that variation in thermal performance can be shaped by multiple facets of the environment and are linked to organismal phenology and natural history. Understanding the impacts of climate change on organisms, therefore, requires the knowledge of how climate change will alter different aspects of the thermal environment.

AB  - Sister species living in sympatry offer the opportunity to study the degree of divergence in their ecological, physiological and life-history traits. It has been hypothesized that closely related species with overlapping distribution should differ in their niche to reduce competition for resources. Furthermore, the investigation of sympatric species may shed light on how they may coexist without outcompeting each other. In the present study, we assess the degree of physiological divergence in two sympatric lacertid lizards, Podarcis bocagei and Podarcis guadarramae lusitanicus. These species share a Pliocenic ancestry and overlap at a both geographical and ecological scale. We assessed their thermal preferences and water loss rates, two physiological traits considered stable across congeneric species. We found that the two species differ in both traits, with P. bocagei selecting higher temperature than P. g. lusitanicus and losing more water than the latter at and above its preferred temperature. The results also showed that for both species body size has a relevant impact on thermal and hydric traits, with bigger individuals losing proportionally less water and selecting higher temperatures. These results, combined with previous evidence, suggest that physiological mechanisms, ecological preferences and morphology probably allow these two species to overlap in their distribution while selecting different microhabitats and thus decreasing possible competition between them.

AB  - 1. It has been postulated that climate warming may pose the greatest threat species in the tropics, where ectotherms have evolved more thermal specialist physiologies. Although species could rapidly respond to environmental change through adaptation, little is known about the potential for thermal adaptation, especially in tropical species.
   2. In the light of the limited empirical evidence available and predictions from mutation-selection theory, we might expect tropical ectotherms to have limited genetic variance to enable adaptation. However, as a consequence of thermodynamic constraints, we might expect this disadvantage to be at least partially offset by a fitness advantage, that is, the hotter-is-better hypothesis.
   3. Using an established quantitative genetics model and metabolic scaling relationships, we integrate the consequences of the opposing forces of thermal specialization and thermodynamic constraints on adaptive potential by evaluating extinction risk under climate warming. We conclude that the potential advantage of a higher maximal development rate can in theory more than offset the potential disadvantage of lower genetic variance associated with a thermal specialist strategy.
   4.Quantitative estimates of extinction risk are fundamentally very sensitive to estimates of generation time and genetic variance. However, our qualitative conclusion that the relative risk of extinction is likely to be lower for tropical species than for temperate species is robust to assumptions regarding the effects of effective population size, mutation rate and birth rate per capita.
   5. With a view to improving ecological forecasts, we use this modelling framework to review the sensitivity of our predictions to the model's underpinning theoretical assumptions and the empirical basis of macroecological patterns that suggest thermal specialization and fitness increase towards the tropics. We conclude by suggesting priority areas for further empirical research.

AB  - Life histories show genetic population-level variation due to spatial variation in selection pressures. Phenotypic plasticity in life histories is also common, facilitating fine-tuning of the phenotype in relation to the prevailing selection regime. In multivoltine (= 2 generations per year) insects, individuals following alternative developmental pathways (diapause/direct development) experience different selection regimes. We studied the genetic and phenotypic components of juvenile development in Cabera exanthemata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) in a factorial split-brood experiment. F2 offspring of individuals originating from populations in northern and central Finland were divided among manipulations defined by temperature (14 degrees C /20 degrees C ) and day length (24 h/15 h). Short day length invariably induced diapause, whereas continuous light almost invariably induced direct development in both regions, although northern populations are strictly univoltine in the wild. Individuals from northern Finland had higher growth rates, shorter development times and higher pupal masses than individuals from central Finland across the conditions, indicating genetic differences between regions. Individuals that developed directly into adults tended to have higher growth rates, shorter development times and higher pupal masses than those entering diapause, indicating phenotypic plasticity. Temperature-induced plasticity was substantial; growth rate was much higher, development time much shorter and pupal mass higher at 20 degrees C than at 14 degrees C . The degree of plasticity in relation to developmental pathway was pronounced at 20 degrees C in growth rate and development time and at 14 degrees C in pupal mass, emphasizing multidimensionality of reaction norms. The observed genetic variation and developmental plasticity seem adaptive in relation to time-stress due to seasonality.

AB  - Populations undergoing rapid climate-driven range expansion experience distinct selection regimes dominated both by increased dispersal at the leading edges and steep environmental gradients. Characterisation of traits associated with such expansions provides insight into the selection pressures and evolutionary constraints that shape demographic and evolutionary responses. Here we investigate patterns in three components of wing morphology (size, shape, colour) often linked to dispersal ability and thermoregulation, along latitudinal gradients of range expansion in the Speckled Wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria) in Britain (two regions of expansion in England and Scotland). We measured 774 males from 54 sites spanning 799 km with a 10-year mean average temperature gradient of 4 degrees C. A geometric morphometric method was used to investigate variation in size and shape of forewings and hindwings; colour, pattern, and contrast of the wings were examined using a measure of lightness (inverse degree of melanism). Overall, wing size increased with latitude by similar to 2% per 100 km, consistent with Bergmann's rule. Forewings became more rounded and hindwings more elongated with history of colonisation, possibly reflecting selection for increased dispersal ability. Contrary to thermal melanism expectations, wing colour was lighter where larvae developed at cooler temperatures and unrelated to long-term temperature. Changes in wing spot pattern were also detected. High heterogeneity in variance among sites for all of the traits studied may reflect evolutionary time-lags and genetic drift due to colonisation of new habitats. Our study suggests that temperature-sensitive plastic responses for size and colour interact with selection for dispersal traits (wing size and shape). Whilst the plastic and evolutionary responses may in some cases act antagonistically, the rapid expansion of P. aegeria implies an overall reinforcing effect between these two mechanisms.

AB  - Growth variability within individuals and among groups and locations and the phenomenon of summer growth reduction has been described for juvenile flatfish in a variety of European coastal areas whereby the underlying causes still remain elusive. Potential mechanisms were tested for juvenile plaice Pleuronectes platessa L. in the western Dutch Wadden Sea, by analysing published and unpublished information from long-term investigations (1986-present). Growth variability did occur and could be explained by differences induced by environmental variability (water temperature), and by non-genetic irreversible adaptation and sex. Dynamic Energy Budget analysis indicated that especially sexually-dimorphic growth in combination with variability in sex ratio could explain most of the variability in growth and the increase in the range of the size of individuals within the population over time. Summer growth reduction was not only observed among 0-group plaice in the intertidal, but also in the subtidal and tidal gullies as well as among I- and II-group plaice. Intraspecific competition for food was not detected but some support for interspecific competition with other predators was found. Also resource competition (due to crowding) with the other abundant epibenthic species (0-, I- and II-group flounder Platichthys flesus; the brown shrimp Crangon crangon; the shore crab Carcinus maenas; the goby species Pomatoschistus minutus and Pomatoschistus microps) could not explain the summer growth reduction. The observed growth reduction coincided with a decrease in stomach content, especially of regenerating body parts of benthic prey items. It is hypothesised that macrozoobenthos becomes less active after the spring phytoplankton bloom, reducing prey availability for juvenile plaice in summer, causing a reduction in food intake and hence in growth.

AB  - The ability of the recently described stem nematode of creeping thistle (Cirsium arvense L.), Ditylenchus weischeri, to develop on and parasitize yellow pea (Pisum sativum L.) is uncertain. The current study examined nematode life-stage progression and generation time on yellow pea as affected by temperature with the related pest, D. dipsaci, used as a positive control. Relationships for body length of the two nematode species and life stage were unaffected by rearing on plant hosts compared with carrot disks. Then plant-reared J4 individuals of both nematode species were used to determine the effect of temperature (17, 22, and 27 degrees C) on life-stage progression and minimum generation time with yellow pea. At 17 and 22 degrees C, D. weischeri 14 individuals progressed to only the adult stage whereas, at 27 degrees C, the minimum generation time from J4 to J4 was 30 days or 720 growing degree-days. The minimum generation time for D. dipsaci was 24, 18, and 22 days or 336, 342, and 528 growing degree-days at 17, 22, and 27 degrees C, respectively. The results indicate that development of D. weischeri is temperature dependent and reproduction is unlikely on yellow pea in the Canadian Prairies, where mean daily air temperatures of 27 degrees C are rare and not sustained.

AB  - Females of Lampropholis delicata are dimorphic for colour pattern, the difference between morphs being the presence or absence of a distinct white mid-lateral stripe. A less distinct striped morph occurs also in males. We evaluated alternative hypotheses for the maintenance of this polymorphism by examining temporal and spatial variation in morph frequency, testing for differential selection among morphs using data on body size and reproductive traits from preserved specimens, and experimentally manipulating colour pattern in free-ranging lizards of both sexes, to assess the influence of the lateral stripe on survival rates. We found that the relative frequency of striped individuals varied among populations and decreased from north to south in both sexes, coincident with an increasing incidence of regenerated tails. Morph frequencies did not change through time within a population. Striped gravid females appeared to survive better and produced larger clutches than did non-striped females. In our experimental study, the relationship between survival and colour morph differed between the two sexes; males painted with a white lateral stripe had lower survival than control (brown stripe) males, but survival did not differ between striped and control females. The different response in the two sexes may be due partly to differences in temperature and microhabitat selection. We propose that the white lateral stripe decreases susceptibility to predators in gravid females but increases risk of predation in males, especially in combination with low temperatures. The polymorphism might be maintained by: (1) opposing fitness consequences of the stripe in males and females; (2) sex-specific habitat selection; and (3) gene flow in combination with spatial variation in relative fitness of the two morphs.

AB  - Hydrologic restriction of salt marshes and subsequent invasion by Phragmites australis could influence the reproductive success of Fundulus heteroclitus, a common salt marsh resident that forages and spawns on the marsh surface at flood tide. Previous research in our laboratory using data from 2010 to 2011 examined the proportion of actively spawning F. heteroclitus residing in altered New England salt marshes as part of a larger experiment to examine the physiological condition of fish in restricted and restored marshes relative to paired unrestricted (reference) sites. We detected a significant decrease in the proportion of actively spawning fish in restricted relative to paired unrestricted marshes, but no difference between restored and paired unrestricted marsh fish. In this manuscript, we conduct a re-analysis of a portion of that data (July 2011) to explore potential mechanisms behind previous results. Using forward stepwise selection and generalized linear mixed models, we determined that the reduction in actively spawning restricted marsh fish was due to a single predictor (lipid mass); there were no effects of water temperature, body size, parasite prevalence, parasite density, and growth rate on the response. Previous results indicate healthy restricted marsh fish already have reduced energy reserves. Since investment in oocytes is energetically costly (this analysis), the effect could manifest at the population level as a reduction in actively spawning fish. In addition, oocyte quality is reduced in restricted marshes (as measured by % lipid; 13.9 +/- 1.6 % SD) relative to paired unrestricted marshes (15.9 +/- 2.3 % SD). Although these data are preliminary and represent a single lunar cycle, additional studies are warranted to explore relationships between P. australis invasion, restoration, and effects on the fecundity of this ubiquitous salt marsh fish.

AB  - We investigated population divergence in body melanisation in wild samples of Drosophila melanogaster across an elevational gradient (512-2202 m) in the Western Himalayas. Wild populations are characterized by higher phenotypic variability as compared with laboratory populations. Significant differences in elevational slope values for three posterior abdominal segments (fifth, sixth and seventh) in wild versus laboratory populations suggest plastic effects. However, elevational. slope values do not differ for the three anterior abdominal segments (second, third and fourth). Thus, elevational changes in melanisation include genetic as well as plastic effects. Fitness consequences of within population variability were analyzed on the basis of assorted darker and lighter flies from two highlands as well as from two lowland localities. There is lack of correlation of melanisation with body size as well as ovariole number in assorted darker and lighter flies. For each population, darker flies showed higher desiccation resistance, lower rate of water loss, longer copulation duration and greater fecundity as compared with lighter flies. Phenotypic variations in body melanisation can be interpreted in relation with seasonal changes in temperature as well as humidity (Tcv and RHcv) of the sites of origin of populations. Thus, elevational changes in body melanisation may represent genetic response to selection pressures imposed by colder and drier climatic conditions in the Western Himalayas.

AB  - Dermacentor reticulatusticks, one of the most important vectors and reservoirs of tick-borne diseases in Europe, are widespread in the temperate climate zone and in some localities in the subtropical climate zone of the western Palaearctic region. These ticks occur in a large area characterised by a varied climate type, vegetation, and availability of potential hosts. Hence, they exhibit high ecological plasticity and adaptability to periodically adverse conditions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability ofD. reticulatusadults to overwinter in the natural habitat. Specimens marked with a permanent oil marker on the festoons were placed in their natural habitats for the winter. Concurrently, tick survival in laboratory conditions at a temperature of 5 degrees C and 18 degrees C was assessed as a control. The groups were compared with each other by determination of the weight of fat bodies. In the field conditions, 67.9% females and 60.0% males survived the winter. There was no significant difference in the survival of ticks in the laboratory. A significantly lower fat body weight was found in the group of ticks overwintering in the field conditions and exhibiting questing activity between spring and late autumn during the following year. On the population scale, adultD. reticulatusticks are able to survive the winter in temperate climate conditions at a level ensuring a further increase in their population size. In adverse weather conditions, ticks enter diapause, thus maximally reducing the utilisation of the content of their fat bodies. This facilitates long-term survival in the environment.

AB  - Separating genetic and environmental causes of the latitudinal differences among populations is crucial when evaluating the potential for microevolutionary responses to the changing environment. We studied among-population and environmental components of variation in several life-history traits of a lichen-feeding moth Eilema depressum when offspring of replicate Swiss and Finnish females were reared in a common-garden factorial experiment. A partial second generation was produced only among Swiss larvae, more likely so at higher temperature regime and higher host quality, and more frequently among the offspring of particular females. Growth rates of larvae that chose the diapause development were higher in northern individuals. Our results thus reveal adaptive differences between latitudinal populations in studied life-history traits, allowing to expect rapid adaptation of the species to further environmental changes. In contrast, invariable responses of the growth rates of the larvae to temperature and host quality support the idea that some basic parameters of insect growth show a high degree of evolutionary conservatism.

AB  - In fewer than two decades after invading the Americas, the fly Drosophila subobscura evolved latitudinal clines for chromosomal inversion frequencies and wing size that are parallel to the long-standing ones in native Palearctic populations. By sharp contrast, wing shape clines also evolved in the New World, but the relationship with latitude was opposite to that in the Old World. Previous work has suggested that wing trait differences among individuals are partially due to the association between chromosomal inversions and particular alleles which influence the trait under consideration. Furthermore, it is well documented that a few number of effective individuals founded the New World populations, which might have modified the biometrical effect of inversions on quantitative traits. Here we evaluate the relative contribution of chromosomal inversion clines in shaping the parallel clines in wing size and contrasting clines in wing shape in native and colonizing populations of the species. Our results reveal that inversion-size and inversion-shape associations in native and colonizing (South America) populations are generally different, probably due to the bottleneck effect. Contingent, unpredictable evolution was suggested as an explanation for the different details involved in the otherwise parallel wing size clines between Old and New World populations of D. subobscura. We challenge this assertion and conclude that contrasting wing shape clines came out as a correlated response of inversion clines that might have been predicted considering the genetic background of colonizers.

AB  - Multiple theories predict the evolution of foraging rates in response to environmental variation in predation risk, intraspecific competition, time constraints, and temperature. We tested six hypotheses for the evolution of foraging rate in 24 spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) populations from three latitudinally divergent sites using structural equation models derived from theory and applied to our system. We raised salamander larvae in a common-garden experiment and then assayed foraging rate under controlled conditions. Gape-limited predation risk from marbled salamanders solely explained foraging rate variation among populations at the southern site, which was dominated by this form of selection. However, at the middle and northern sites, populations evolved different foraging rates depending on their unique responses to local intraspecific density. The coupling of gape-limited predation risk from marbled salamanders and high intraspecific density at the middle site jointly contributed to selection for rapid foraging rate. At the northernmost site, intraspecific density alone explained 97% of the interpopulation variation in foraging rate. These results suggest that foraging rate has evolved multiple times in response to varying contributions from predation risk and intraspecific competition. Predation risk often varies along environmental gradients, and, thus, organisms might often shift evolutionary responses from minimizing predation risk to maximizing intraspecific competitive performance.

AB  - Northern range margin populations of the European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) have rapidly declined during recent decades. Extensive agricultural land use has fragmented the landscape, leading to habitat disruption and loss, as well as eutrophication of ponds. In Northern Germany (Schleswig-Holstein) and Southern Sweden (Skane), this population decline resulted in decreased gene flow from surrounding populations, low genetic diversity, and a putative reduction in adaptive potential, leaving populations vulnerable to future environmental and climatic changes. Previous studies using mitochondrial control region and nuclear transcriptome-wide SNP data detected introgressive hybridization in multiple northern B. bombina populations after unreported release of toads from Austria. Here, we determine the impact of this introgression by comparing the body conditions (proxy for fitness) of introgressed and nonintrogressed populations and the genetic consequences in two candidate genes for putative local adaptation (the MHC II gene as part of the adaptive immune system and the stress response gene HSP70 kDa). We detected regional differences in body condition and observed significantly elevated levels of within individual MHC allele counts in introgressed Swedish populations, associated with a tendency toward higher body weight, relative to regional nonintrogressed populations. These differences were not observed among introgressed and nonintrogressed German populations. Genetic diversity in both MHC and HSP was generally lower in northern than Austrian populations. Our study sheds light on the potential benefits of translocations of more distantly related conspecifics as a means to increase adaptive genetic variability and fitness of genetically depauperate range margin populations without distortion of local adaptation.

AB  - Since Antarctica and the surrounding Southern Ocean are facing global climate change, biota inhabiting those coastal regions is now challenged by environmental fluctuations including coastal freshening. In this study, the effects of salinity range of 0-75 (practical salinity unit, PSU) on the Antarctic harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus kingsejongensis was investigated by measurement of 96 h survival rate, lifespan, and sex ratio with further analysis of multigenerational growth parameters and mRNA expressions under salinity of 15-45. Different stages of the copepods (i.e., nauplius, male, and female) generally showed tolerance to hypo- and hypersalinity, wherein female copepods were more tolerant than males when exposed to salinity fluctuations. Lifespan was significantly shortened by hypo- and hypersalinity compared to control salinity (34), but there was no significant difference in the sex ratio between salinity treatments. Multigenerational experiments across five generations revealed that exposure to salinities of 15 and 45 reduced body length compared to that in control salinity and the first generation of each salinity group. Our results provide evidence regarding T. kingsejongensis on their preferred salinity ranges, physiological limit to salinity fluctuations, and population dynamics in future salinity.

AB  - It is increasingly clear that parental environment can play an important role in determining offspring phenotype. These "transgenerational effects" have been linked to many different components of the environment, including toxin exposure, infection with pathogens and parasites, temperature and food quality. In this study, we focus on the latter, asking how variation in the quantity and quality of nutrition affects future generations. Previous studies have shown that artificial diets are a useful tool to examine the within-generation effects of variation in macronutrient content on life history traits, and could therefore be applied to investigations of the transgenerational effects of parental diet. Synthetic diets varying in total macronutrient content and protein: carbohydrate ratios were used to examine both within-and trans-generational effects on life history traits in a generalist stored product pest, the Indian meal moth Plodia interpunctella. The macronutrient composition of the diet was important for shaping within-generation life history traits, including pupal weight, adult weight, and phenoloxidase activity, and had indirect effects via maternal weight on fecundity. Despite these clear within-generation effects on the biology of P. interpunctella, diet composition had no transgenerational effects on the life history traits of offspring. P. interpunctella mothers were able to maintain their offspring quality, possibly at the expense of their own somatic condition, despite high variation in dietary macronutrient composition. This has important implications for the plastic biology of this successful generalist pest.

AB  - Egg parasitoid rearing on factitious hosts is an important step to reduce costs and increase availability of the biocontrol agent but it requires quality control to achieve success in field conditions. To this end, this study evaluated the quality of Telenomus remus (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) reared on Corcyra cephalonica (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) for until 45 generations. In the first bioassay, we evaluated the body size of the laboratory-produced parasitoids. In the second bioassay, flight activity was examined, measuring the percentage of flyers', walkers' and deformed' parasitoids. The third bioassay assessed parasitism on Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) eggs. Our data indicate that the laboratory-reared parasitoid neither lost its ability to fly nor to parasitize S. frugiperda eggs. In conclusion, quality did not decrease significantly during 45 generations, and therefore rearing of T. remus on C. cephalonica as factitious host promises to be successful.

AB  - Behavioural thermoregulation is important for the success of cool-climate lizards, and a basis of the cold-climate hypothesis for the evolution of viviparity in squamate reptiles. The temperature (T-sel) selected by pregnant females in a thermal gradient is considered to be optimal for embryonic development; however, exposure to T-sel throughout pregnancy has been difficult to estimate in small-bodied lizards as temperature-sensitive telemetry is impractical. In addition, the value of maternal thermophily during pregnancy is controversial: some studies have shown elevated T-sel, whereas others have found lowered T-sel or no change during pregnancy. We estimated indirectly the overall exposure to T-sel during the 4-5 months of pregnancy of the cool-climate, sub-alpine species Oligosoma maccanni (McCann's skink, 3-6 g) from southern New Zealand. The thermal environment available to skinks was modelled using temperature loggers inside validated copper models in basking and retreat sites. Pregnant skinks were able to achieve mean T-sel (28.9 degrees C) in the field very infrequently (4-15% of each month during the final 4 months of pregnancy). In field thermoregulatory studies, pregnant females did not bask more frequently and did not show altered field body temperature compared with non-pregnant adults, suggesting that all skinks (whether pregnant or not) thermoregulate maximally whenever conditions allow. Further research on cool-climate lizards should address the significance for offspring phenotypes of low and variable exposure to T-sel during pregnancy, as well as the significance of temperatures for embryos in maternal bodies (viviparity) versus nest sites (oviparity) arising from differences in maternal body size.

AB  - Directionality in populations of replicating organisms can be parametrized in terms of a statistical concept: evolutionary entropy. This parameter, a measure of the variability in the age of reproducing individuals in a population, is isometric with the macroscopic variable body size. Evolutionary trends in entropy due to mutation and natural selection fall into patterns modulated by ecological and demographic constraints, which are delineated as follows: (i) density-dependent conditions (a unidirectional increase in evolutionary entropy), and (ii) density-independent conditions, (a) slow exponential growth (an increase in entropy); (b) rapid exponential growth, low degree of iteroparity (a decrease in entropy); and (c) rapid exponential growth, high degree of iteroparity (random, nondirectional change in entropy). Directionality in aggregates of inanimate matter can be parametrized in terms of the statistical concept, thermodynamic entropy, a measure of disorder. Directional trends in entropy in aggregates of matter fall into patterns determined by the nature of the adiabatic constraints, which are characterized as follows: (i) irreversible processes (an increase in thermodynamic entropy) and (ii) reversible processes (a constant value for entropy). This article analyzes the relation between the concepts that underlie the directionality principles in evolutionary biology and physical systems. For models of cellular populations, an analytic relation is derived between generation time, the average length of the cell cycle, and temperature. This correspondence between generation time, an evolutionary parameter, and temperature, a thermodynamic variable, is exploited to show that the increase in evolutionary entropy that characterizes population processes under density-dependent conditions represents a nonequilibrium analogue of the second law of thermodynamics.

AB  - We studied the Thermal Performance Curves (TPCs) of 87 species of rainforest ants and found support for both the Thermal Adaptation and Phosphorus Tolerance hypotheses. TPCs relate a fitness proxy (here, worker speed) to environmental temperature. Thermal Adaptation posits that thermal generalists (ants with flatter, broader TPCs) are favored in the hotter, more variable tropical canopy compared to the cooler, less variable litter below. As predicted, species nesting in the forest canopy 1) had running speeds less sensitive to temperature; 2) ran over a greater range of temperatures; and 3) ran at lower maximum speeds. Tradeoffs between tolerance and maximum performance are often invoked for constraining the evolution of thermal generalists. There was no evidence that ant species traded off thermal tolerance for maximum speed, however. Phosphorus Tolerance is a second mechanism for generating ectotherms able to tolerate thermal extremes. It posits that ants active at high temperatures invest in P rich machinery to buffer their metabolism against thermal extremes. Phosphorus content in ant tissue varied three fold, and as predicted, temperature sensitivity was lower and thermal range was higher in P rich species. Combined, we show how the vertical distribution of hot and variable vs. cooler and stable microclimates in a single forest contribute to a diversity of TPCs and suggest that a widely varying P stoichiometry among these ants may drive some of these differences.

AB  - 1. Time constraints cause strong selection on life-history traits, because populations need to complete their life cycles within a shorter time. We therefore expect lower genetic variation in these traits in high-than in low-latitude populations, since the former are more time-constrained.
   2. The aim was to estimate life-history traits and their genetic variation in an obligately univoltine damselfly along a latitudinal gradient of 2730 km.
   3. Populations were grown in the laboratory at temperatures and photoperiods simulating those at their place of origin. In a complementary experiment, individuals from the same families were grown in constant temperature and photoperiod that mimicked average conditions across the latitude.
   4. Development time and size was faster and smaller, respectively, and growth rate was higher at northern latitudes. Additive genetic variance was very low for life-history traits, and estimates for egg development time and larval growth rate showed significant decreases towards northern latitudes. The expression of genetic effects in life-history traits differed considerably when individuals were grown in constant rather than simulated and naturally variable conditions.
   5. Our results support strong selection by time constraints. They also highlight the importance of growing organisms in their native environment for correct estimates of genetic variance at their place of origin. Our results also suggest that the evolutionary potential of life-history traits is very low at northern compared to southern latitudes, but that changes in climate could alter this pattern.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity in thermally-regulated traits enables close tracking of changing environmental conditions, and can thereby enhance the potential for rapid population increase, a hallmark of outbreak insect species. In a changing climate, exposure to conditions that exceed the capacity of existing phenotypic plasticity may occur. Combining information on genetic architecture and trait plasticity among populations that are distributed along a latitudinal cline can provide insight into how thermally-regulated traits evolve in divergent environments and the potential for adaptation. Dendroctonus ponderosae feed on Pinus species in diverse climatic regimes throughout western North America, and show eruptive population dynamics. We describe geographical patterns of plasticity in D. ponderosae development time and adult size by examining reaction norms of populations from multiple latitudes. The relative influence of additive and non-additive genetic effects on population differences in the two phenotypic traits at a single temperature is quantified using line-cross experiments and joint-scaling tests. We found significant genetic and phenotypic variation among D. ponderosae populations. Simple additive genetic variance was not the primary source of the observed variation, and dominance and epistasis contributed greatly to the genetic divergence of the two thermally-regulated traits. Hybrid breakdown was also observed in F-2 hybrid crosses between northern and southern populations, further indication of substantial genetic differences among clinal populations and potential reproductive isolation within D. ponderosae. Although it is unclear what maintains variation in the life-history traits, observed plasticity in thermally-regulated traits that are directly linked to rapid numerical change may contribute to the outbreak nature of D. ponderosae, particularly in a changing climate.

AB  - Species-rich adaptive radiations typically diversify along several distinct ecological axes, each characterized by morphological, physiological, and behavioral adaptations. We test here whether different types of adaptive traits share similar patterns of evolution within a radiation by investigating patterns of evolution of morphological traits associated with microhabitat specialization and of physiological traits associated with thermal biology in Anolis lizards. Previous studies of anoles suggest that close relatives share the same structural niche (i.e., use the same types of perches) and are similar in body size and shape, but live in different climatic niches (i.e., use habitats with different insolation and temperature profiles). Because morphology is closely tied to structural niche and field active body temperatures are tied to climatic niches in Anolis, we expected phylogenetic analyses to show that morphology is more evolutionarily conservative than thermal physiology. In support of this hypothesis, we find (1) that thermal biology exhibits more divergence among recently diverged Anolis taxa than does morphology; and (2) diversification of thermal biology among all species often follows diversification in morphology. These conclusions are remarkably consistent with predictions made by anole biologists in the 1960s and 1970s.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is often used as a measure of underlying developmental instability (DI), motivated by the idea that morphological variance is maladaptive. Whether or not DI has evolutionary potential is a highly disputed topic, marred by methodological problems and fuzzy prejudices. We report here some results from an ongoing study of the effects of karyotype, homozygosity and temperature on wing form and bilateral asymmetry using isochromosomal lines of Drosophila subobscura. Our approach uses the recently developed methodologies in geometric morphometrics to analyse shape configurations of landmarks within the standard statistical framework employed in studies of bilateral asymmetries, and we have extended these methods to partition the individual variation and the variation in asymmetries into genetic and environmental causal components. The analyses revealed temperature-dependent expression of genetic variation for wing size and wing shape, directional asymmetry (DA) of wing size, increased asymmetries at suboptimal temperature, and a transition from FA to DA in males as a result of increase in the rearing temperature. No genetic variation was generally detected for FA in our samples, but these are preliminary results because no crosses between lines were carried out and, therefore, the contribution of dominance was not taken into account. In addition, only a subset of the standing genetic variation was represented in the experiments.

AB  - Background: Ecological factors often have a strong impact on spatiotemporal patterns of biodiversity. The integration of spatial ecology and phylogenetics allows for rigorous tests of whether speciation is associated with niche conservatism (constraints on ecological divergence) or niche divergence. We address this question in a genus of livebearing fishes for which the role of sexual selection in speciation has long been studied, but in which the potential role of ecological divergence during speciation has not been tested.
   Results: By combining reconstruction of ancestral climate tolerances and disparity indices, we show that the earliest evolutionary split in Xiphophorus was associated with significant divergence for temperature variables. Niche evolution and present day niches were most closely associated with each species' geographic distribution relative to a biogeographic barrier, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Tests for similarity of the environmental backgrounds of closely related species suggested that the relative importance of niche conservatism and divergence during speciation varied among the primary clades of Xiphophorus. Closely related species in the two swordtail clades exhibited higher levels of niche overlap than expected given environmental background similarity indicative of niche conservatism. In contrast, almost all species of platyfish had significantly divergent niches compared to environmental backgrounds, which is indicative of niche divergence.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that the relative importance of niche conservatism and divergence differed among the clades of Xiphophorus and that traits associated with niche evolution may be more evolutionarily labile in the platyfishes. Our results ultimately suggest that the taxonomic scale of tests for conservatism and divergence could greatly influence inferences of their relative importance in the speciation process.

AB  - Within populations, phenotypic plasticity may allow adaptive phenotypic variation in response to selection generated by environmental heterogeneity. For instance, in multivoltine species, seasonal changes between and within generations may trigger morphological and physiological variation enhancing fitness under different environmental conditions. These seasonal changes may irreversibly affect adult phenotypes when experienced during development. Yet, the irreversible effects of developmental plasticity on adult morphology have rarely been linked to life-history traits even though they may affect different fitness components such as reproduction, mobility and self-maintenance. To address this issue, we raised larvae of Pieris napi butterflies under warm or cool conditions to subsequently compare adult performance in terms of reproduction performance (as assessed through fecundity), displacement capacity (as assessed through flight propensity and endurance) and self-maintenance (as assessed through the measurement of oxidative markers). As expected in ectotherms, individuals developed faster under warm conditions and were smaller than individuals developing under cool conditions. They also had more slender wings and showed a higher wing surface ratio. These morphological differences were associated with changes in the reproductive and flight performance of adults, as individuals developing under warm conditions laid fewer eggs and flew larger distances. Accordingly, the examination of their oxidative status suggested that individuals developing under warm conditions invested more strongly into self-maintenance than individuals developing under cool conditions (possibly at the expense of reproduction). Overall, our results indicate that developmental conditions have long-term consequences on several adult traits in butterflies. This plasticity probably acts on life-history strategies for each generation to keep pace with seasonal variations and may facilitate acclimation processes in the context of climate change.

AB  - The tropical and subtropical estuarine fish Rivulus marmoratus is known for its synchronous, self-fertilizing hermaphroditism. It matures within 3 mo and can produce eggs throughout the year These features would allow a particular strain to quickly colonize refuge such as crab holes in the high intertidal zone habitat. However, a high strain diversity has been found in the field. In order to explain this observation, we examined the phenotypic responses of R. marmoratus to variation in biotic and abiotic environmental factors over two consecutive generations and employed a modified Euler-Lotka equation to estimate and compare the net reproductive rate, R, among strains. We included five strains of R. marmoratus and manipulated levels of temperature, salinity, and food for the parental generation and levels of food only for the second generation. Low temperature (19 degrees C) inhibited sexual maturity, precluding any egg production during the entire 6-mo study. For individuals kept at high temperature (26 degrees C), salinity and food had an interactive effect on time to maturity, body size at maturity, and number of eggs produced. Using multivariate analysis of variance, we found a significant two-way interactive effect (food levels for the parental and the second generations) on the five reproductive traits studied in the second generation. When each trait was analyzed separately, we found significant three-way interactions for time to maturity and total length at maturity.
   We found that the fitness values for each strain varied in different environmental combinations (3 salinities x 3 incubation salinities for eggs x 2 food levels). However, four of five strains had similar overall fitness. Despite a lack of generic variation within each strain, X. marmoratus demonstrates considerable phenotypic variation in response to environmental changes. This feature and genetic variation among strains may explain how this species can survive and even prosper in an extremely variable and stressful environment.

AB  - Biological control of water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes, has resulted in variable outcomes in temperate regions where cool climates are thought to limit population growth and performance of the biological control agents. The weevil, Neochetina eichhorniae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), originating from Argentina, was introduced into northern California, USA, in 1982. The realized distribution and abundance of this weevil is limited, and the exotic weed remains a problem. In this study, we tested populations of N. eichhorniae from northern California, Australia, South Africa, and Uruguay to examine the effects of low temperature on life-history performance to determine if cold hardiness differs between populations. We measured the development time, fecundity, survivorship, and thermal tolerance (chill coma: CTmin and supercooling point SCP) of the four N. eichhorniae populations under two temperature treatments simulating fall and winter seasons of northern California. Results suggest that immature stages of all populations tested failed to survive and females did not reproduce in the winter treatment. In the fall treatment, all populations showed similar performance in most of the measured life history traits. The Australian population had the highest intrinsic rate of increase, net reproductive rate and doubling time, due to its longer oviposition period, and higher daily fecundity (2.1 +/- 0.2 eggs per day), twice that of the California population (1.0 +/- 0.2 eggs per day). Thus, the introduction of N. eichhorniae from Australia into northern California may increase weevil densities, distribution, and improve biological control of water hyacinth.

AB  - For 3-4 generations, selection of the nymphs most rapidly and slowly developing at 28 degrees C was performed in four families of the red soldier bug Pyrrhocoris apterus L. In each generation, du- ration of development of nymphs was determined at 5 constant temperatures from 20 C to 28 degrees C. From these data the linear regression coefficient of the development rate against temperature ( the development thermolability coefficient) for each generation was calculated. As a result of the selection the average duration of the nymph development was shortened or increased statistically significantly depending on its direction. The artificial selection for the development duration has been established to change not only this parameter, but also the temperature norms of the insect develop ment. At selection for fast development the regression straight line slope (i.e., the regression coefficient value) increased statistically significantly, i.e., development became more dependent on temperature. As a rule, the temperature threshold of development increased. At selection for slow development the values of the regression coefficient and of the threshold decreased, but these differences were not statistically significant. The effect of artificial selection for the development duration on temperature norms of insect development has been revealed for the first time.

AB  - Species responses to environmental change are likely to depend on existing genetic and phenotypic variation, as well as evolutionary potential. A key challenge is to determine whether gene flow might facilitate or impede genomic divergence among populations responding to environmental change, and if emergent phenotypic variation is dependent on gene flow rates. A general expectation is that patterns of genetic differentiation in a set of codistributed species reflect differences in dispersal ability. In less dispersive species, we predict greater genetic divergence and reduced gene flow. This could lead to covariation in life-history traits due to local adaptation, although plasticity or drift could mirror these patterns. We compare genome-wide patterns of genetic structure in four phenotypically variable grasshopper species along a steep elevation gradient near Boulder, Colorado, and test the hypothesis that genomic differentiation is greater in short-winged grasshopper species, and statistically associated with variation in growth, reproductive, and physiological traits along this gradient. In addition, we estimate rates of gene flow under competing demographic models, as well as potential gene flow through surveys of phenological overlap among populations within a species. All species exhibit genetic structure along the elevation gradient and limited gene flow. The most pronounced genetic divergence appears in short-winged (less dispersive) species, which also exhibit less phenological overlap among populations. A high-elevation population of the most widespread species, Melanoplus sanguinipes, appears to be a sink population derived from low elevation populations. While dispersal ability has a clear connection to the genetic structure in different species, genetic distance does not predict growth, reproductive, or physiological trait variation in any species, requiring further investigation to clearly link phenotypic divergence to local adaptation.

AB  - Large comparative studies in animal ecology, physiology and evolution often use animals reared in the laboratory for many generations; however, the relevance of these studies hinges on the assumption that laboratory populations are still representative for their wild living conspecifics. In this study, we investigate whether laboratory-maintained and freshly collected animal populations are fundamentally different and whether data from laboratory-maintained animals are valid to use in large comparative investigations of ecological and physiological patterns. Here, we obtained nine species of Drosophila with paired populations of laboratory-maintained and freshly collected flies. These species, representing a range of ecotypes, were assayed for four stress-tolerance, two body-size traits and six life-history traits. For all of these traits, we observed small differences in species-specific comparisons between field and laboratory populations; however, these differences were unsystematic and laboratory maintenance did not eclipse fundamental species characteristics. To investigate whether laboratory maintenance influence the general patterns in comparative studies, we correlated stress tolerance and life-history traits with environmental traits for the laboratory-maintained and freshly collected populations. Based on this analysis, we found that the comparative physiological and ecological trait correlations are similar irrespective of provenience. This finding is important for comparative biology in general because it validates comparative meta-analyses based on laboratory-maintained populations.

AB  - Insects are among the most diverse and widespread animals across the biosphere and are well-known for their contributions to ecosystem functioning and services. Recent increases in the frequency and magnitude of climatic extremes (CE), in particular temperature extremes (TE) owing to anthropogenic climate change, are exposing insect populations and communities to unprecedented stresses. However, a major problem in understanding insect responses to TE is that they are still highly unpredictable both spatially and temporally, which reduces frequency- or direction-dependent selective responses by insects. Moreover, how species interactions and community structure may change in response to stresses imposed by TE is still poorly understood. Here we provide an overview of how terrestrial insects respond to TE by integrating their organismal physiology, multitrophic, and community-level interactions, and building that up to explore scenarios for population explosions and crashes that have ecosystem-level consequences. We argue that TE can push insect herbivores and their natural enemies to and even beyond their adaptive limits, which may differ among species intimately involved in trophic interactions, leading to phenological disruptions and the structural reorganization of food webs. TE may ultimately lead to outbreak-breakdown cycles in insect communities with detrimental consequences for ecosystem functioning and resilience. Lastly, we suggest new research lines that will help achieve a better understanding of insect and community responses to a wide range of CE.

AB  - Local genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are two mechanisms that can have marked effects on the morphology, performance, and behaviour of animals, producing geographic variation among populations. However, few studies have examined how these mechanisms interact during ontogeny to shape organismal phenotypes. We incubated eggs of the western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis, from four populations (representing two latitudes and altitudes) in either a warm or cool environment in the laboratory. We then raised the hatchlings under common laboratory conditions, measured morphological and performance traits until 5 weeks of age, and compared juvenile morphology with that of field-caught adults from each population. The results obtained indicate that some phenotypic traits that contribute to performance (body size, hindlimb length, head shape) were relatively canalized in juveniles and differed among populations in a way that was consistent with adults from their population of origin. However, other traits (forelimb length, inter-limb length, mass, tail length), showed significant effects of incubation temperature, and this environmentally induced variation persisted throughout the experiment. Although selection pressure may be stronger for traits that are integral to survival, developmental effects might still have a lasting impact on traits less important to organismal fitness. We discuss the results obtained in the present study the context of the life history of these animals.

AB  - The parental environment can alter offspring phenotypes via the transfer of non-genetic information. Parental effects may be viewed as an extension of (within-generation) phenotypic plasticity. Smaller size, poorer physical condition, and skewed sex ratios are common responses of organisms to global warming, yet whether parental effects alleviate, exacerbate, or have no impact on these responses has not been widely tested. Further, the relative non-genetic influence of mothers and fathers and ontogenetic timing of parental exposure to warming on offspring phenotypes is poorly understood. Here, we tested how maternal, paternal, and biparental exposure of a coral reef fish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus) to elevated temperature (+1.5 degrees C) at different ontogenetic stages (development vs reproduction) influences offspring length, weight, condition, and sex. Fish were reared across two generations in present-day and projected ocean warming in a full factorial design. As expected, offspring of parents exposed to present-day control temperature that were reared in warmer water were shorter than their siblings reared in control temperature; however, within-generation plasticity allowed maintenance of weight, resulting in a higher body condition. Parental exposure to warming, irrespective of ontogenetic timing and sex, resulted in decreased weight and condition in all offspring rearing temperatures. By contrast, offspring sex ratios were not strongly influenced by their rearing temperature or that of their parents. Together, our results reveal that phenotypic plasticity may help coral reef fishes maintain performance in a warm ocean within a generation, but could exacerbate the negative effects of warming between generations, regardless of when mothers and fathers are exposed to warming. Alternatively, the multigenerational impact on offspring weight and condition may be a necessary cost to adapt metabolism to increasing temperatures. This research highlights the importance of examining phenotypic plasticity within and between generations across a range of traits to accurately predict how organisms will respond to climate change.

AB  - Understanding the evolutionary potential of morphological evolution is still a major problem in evolutionary biology. In this study, we tried to quantify the amount of variation of different traits among species of a Drosophila clade reared under standard conditions. Nineteen different traits have been measured on nine species of the same clade, the Neotropical saltans group of Drosophila. Measured traits can be distributed into five categories: size-traits (wing and thorax), shape indices (ratios among the size traits), number of sternopleural bristles on the thorax, number of abdominal bristles on successive sternites, and dorsal pigmentation of abdomen. All species are of medium size with a generally dark pigmentation. A remarkable feature is the presence of numerous bristles on the 6th sternite of the males, while this segment is bare in other Drosophila species. A multivariate analysis revealed that it was possible to discriminate all the investigated species by using the complete set of measured traits. For each trait, phenotypic variability was investigated at the within- and between-species levels. As a rule, the interspecific coefficient of variation (CV) was much greater than the within species CV, and it is proposed to call it realized evolvability. All possible correlations were calculated between traits across species, providing many unexpected results. Size traits were highly correlated among them, but not correlated with shape indices. Abdominal traits (bristles and pigmentation) were correlated, but often in opposite directions, with thoracic shape indices. Tergite pigmentation was negatively correlated with bristle number on sternite. For the moment, most of the correlations cannot be explained by developmental processes or parallel selective pressures. Nonetheless, mapping the evolution of the two characters on a molecular phylogeny of the studied species revealed two opposite phylogenetic trends for abdominal pigmentation and setation, respectively. Our data suggest a need for similar studies in other well-defined Drosophila clades.Resume
   Comprendre le potentiel evolutif des caracteres morphologiques constitue un probleme majeur de la biologie de l'evolution. Dans cet article, nous essayons de quantifier la variation de differents caracteres entre les especes d'un clade de Drosophilaelevees dans les conditions standard du laboratoire. Dix neuf traits differents ont ete mesures sur 9 especes appartenant au meme clade, le groupe saltans de Drosophila. Les caracteres mesures peuvent etre repartis en cinq categories: des caracteres de taille (aile et thorax) des indices de forme (rapports entre les caracteres de taille); le nombre de soies sternopleurales sur le thorax, le nombre des sois abdominales sur le sternites successifs et finalement la pigmentation des tergites. Toutes les especes sont de taille moyenne avec une pigmentation generale sombre. Une caracteristique remarquable est la presence de nombreuses soies sur le 6eme sternite des males, alors que ce segment est completement nu chez les autres especes de Drosophila. Une analyse multivariee a montre qu'il etait possible de discriminer toutes les especes etudiees en utilisant l'ensemble des caracteres mesures. Pour chaque trait, la variabilite phenotypique a eteetudiee aux niveaux intra et interspecifique. En regle generale, le coefficient de variation (CV) interspecifique etait beaucoup plus grand que le CV intraspecifique, et il est propose de l'appeler evolvabilite realisee. Toutes les correlations possibles entre les differents caracteres des especes ont ete calculees, conduisant souvent a des resultats inattendus. Les caracteres de taille sont fortement correles entre eux, mais non avec les indices de forme. Les caracteres de l'abdomen (soies et pigmentation) sont correles, mais souvent de facon opposee, avec les indices de forme. La pigmentation des tergites est negativement correlee avec le nombre des soies sur les sternites. Pour le moment, il ne semble pas possible d'explique la plupart des correlations par des processus de developpement ou bien par des pressions selectives paralleles. Cependant, la comparaison de deux caracteres avec le phylogenie moleculaire a revele des tendances phylogenetiques opposees concernant la pigmentation et la setation de abdomen. Ces resultats suggerent la necessite d'etudes comparatives similaires dans d'autres clades bien definis de Drosophila.

AB  - Animals can produce different phenotypes from the same genome during development, environmental adaptation and evolution, which is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation. The obligatory parthenogenetic marbled crayfish, Procambarus virginalis, whose genome and methylome are fully established, proved very suitable to study this issue in detail. Comparison between developmental stages and DNA methylation revealed low expression of Dnmt methylation and Tet demethylation enzymes from the spawned oocyte to the 256 cell embryo and considerably increased expression thereafter. The global 5-methylcytosine level was 2.78% at mid-embryonic development and decreased slightly to 2.41% in 2-year-old adults. Genetically identical clutch-mates raised in the same uniform laboratory setting showed broad variation in morphological, behavioural and life history traits and differences in DNA methylation. The invasion of diverse habitats in tropical to cold-temperate biomes in the last 20 years by the marbled crayfish was associated with the expression of significantly different phenotypic traits and DNA methylation patterns, despite extremely low genetic variation on the whole genome scale, suggesting the establishment of epigenetic ecotypes. The evolution of marbled crayfish from its parent species Procambarus fallax by autotriploidy a few decades ago was accompanied by a significant increase in body size, fertility and life span, a 20% reduction of global DNA methylation and alteration of methylation in hundreds of genes, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms were involved in speciation and fitness enhancement. The combined analysis of phenotypic traits and DNA methylation across multiple biological contexts in the laboratory and field in marbled crayfish may serve as a blueprint for uncovering the role of epigenetic mechanisms in shaping of phenotypes in macro-invertebrates.

AB  - Climate change will result in some areas becoming warmer and others cooler, and will amplify the magnitude of year-to-year thermal variation in many areas. How will such changes affect animals that rely on ambient thermal heterogeneity to behaviourally regulate their body temperatures? To explore this question, we raised 43 captive-born tiger snakes Notechis scutatus in enclosures that provided cold (19-22 degrees C), intermediate (19-26 degrees C) or hot (19-37 degrees C) thermal gradients. The snakes adjusted their diel timing of thermoregulatory behaviour so effectively that when tested 14 months later, body temperatures (mean and maximum), locomotor speeds and anti-predator behaviours did not differ among treatment groups. Thus, the young snakes modified their behaviour to compensate for restricted thermal opportunities. Then, we suddenly shifted ambient conditions to mimic year-to-year variation. In contrast to the earlier plasticity, snakes failed to adjust to this change, e. g. snakes raised at cooler treatments but then shifted to hot conditions showed a higher mean body temperature for at least two months after the onset of the new thermal regime. Hence, thermal conditions experienced early in life influenced subsequent thermoregulatory tactics; the mean selected temperature of a snake depended more upon its prior raising conditions than upon its current thermoregulatory opportunities. Behavioural plasticity thus allows snakes to adjust to suboptimal thermal conditions but this plasticity is limited. The major thermoregulatory challenge from global climate change may not be the shift in mean values (to which our young snakes adjusted) but the increased year-to-year variation (with which our snakes proved less able to deal).

AB  - Rapid climate change is likely to impose strong selection pressures on traits important for fitness, and therefore, microevolution in response to climate-mediated selection is potentially an important mechanism mitigating negative consequences of climate change. We reviewed the empirical evidence for recent microevolutionary responses to climate change in longitudinal studies emphasizing the following three perspectives emerging from the published data. First, although signatures of climate change are clearly visible in many ecological processes, similar examples of microevolutionary responses in literature are in fact very rare. Second, the quality of evidence for microevolutionary responses to climate change is far from satisfactory as the documented responses are often - if not typically - based on nongenetic data. We reinforce the view that it is as important to make the distinction between genetic (evolutionary) and phenotypic (includes a nongenetic, plastic component) responses clear, as it is to understand the relative roles of plasticity and genetics in adaptation to climate change. Third, in order to illustrate the difficulties and their potential ubiquity in detection of microevolution in response to natural selection, we reviewed the quantitative genetic studies on microevolutionary responses to natural selection in the context of long-term studies of vertebrates. The available evidence points to the overall conclusion that many responses perceived as adaptations to changing environmental conditions could be environmentally induced plastic responses rather than microevolutionary adaptations. Hence, clear-cut evidence indicating a significant role for evolutionary adaptation to ongoing climate warming is conspicuously scarce.

AB  - I incubated eggs of the smooth softshell turtle (Apalone mutica) at 26-degrees, 28-degrees, and 30-degrees-C in 2 yr to investigate the physiological significance of temperature on developing embryos and hatchlings. In particular, I tested the hypothesis that temperature has a direct effect on physiology of developing embryos independent of the hydric environment, specifically as expressed through its effects on hatchling size and locomotor performance. Hatching success was lowest at 26-degrees but did not differ significantly among treatments or between years. Survivorship of turtles to 2 wk posthatching varied significantly among temperature treatments, because relatively few individuals from 26-degrees-C survived. Duration of incubation was negatively related to incubation temperature. However, sex determination of hatchling turtles was independent of incubation temperature. All but one measure of body size of turtles varied positively with incubation temperature in both years, which suggests that temperature directly affected embryonic growth. Body size of hatchlings also differed significantly among clutches, even after accounting for initial egg mass, which implies maternal or genetic variation in embryonic development. Measures of locomotor performance (running and swimming speed) were significantly influenced by incubation temperature in both years, such that warmer temperatures produced faster hatchlings. In 1989, but not in 1990, larger turtles ran and swam faster than smaller individuals. Clutch exhibited a significant influence on running and swimming speed in both years, which suggests maternal or genetic effects underlying performance. Both measures of locomotor performance were positively correlated in both years, and the correlations were significant, which indicates that faster runners were also faster swimmers. Running and swimming speed were highly repeatable within the 1-d trials in both years and exhibited significant heritable variation. These findings highlight the pervasive influence of environmental and genetic factors on the physiological ecology of embryonic and hatchling turtles and indicate that growth and locomotor performance may possess the genetic variation necessary to evolve in response to selection pressures in nature. Experimental field studies of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of variation in these traits would prove valuable in elucidating the pervasive impact of environmental conditions during embryonic development.

AB  - The genetic basis for developmental stability, the ability of an organism to withstand genetic and environmental disturbance of development, is poorly understood. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA: small random deviations from symmetry in paired, bilateral traits) is the most widely used measure of developmental stability, and evidence suggests FA is weakly and negatively associated with genome-wide heterozygosity. We investigated the genetic basis of developmental stability in the yellow dung fly. Fly lines were inbred for 16 generations at which time they were homozygous at the phosphoglucomutase (PGM) loci and PGM appears to influence FA in at least one other taxon. After 16 generations of inbreeding, lines homozygous for different PGM alleles were crossed and levels of FA for four metric traits were compared in the inbred and crossed flier. We also compared FA levels in these flies with previously gathered data on wild-type (second generation outcrossed) flies, and additionally looked at the effects of two environmental stresses (larval food limitation and increased temperature) on FA. There were no significant differences in any measure of FA, nor in mean FA, in any trait when inbred and crossed flies were compared. Comparison of FA in these and wild flies also revealed no significant differences. Food limitation had no influence on I;A, whereas heat stress increased FA of naturally, but not sexually, selected traits. Our results do not show a negative relationship between heterozygosity and FA, but support the notion that FA levels are stress, trait and taxon specific.

AB  - To investigate the adaptability of Apostichopus japonicus (A. japonicus) strain "Anyuan No. 1" in the South China Sea, field monitoring and microRNA-mRNA integrated analyses were conducted between "Anyuan No. 1" and a regular A. japonicus population from Wendeng (Shandong Province, as a control) in the Xiapu farming area in Fujian Province, China. The results showed that "Anyuan No. 1" exhibited greater body weight increase and a higher number of papillae compared to the control during two and a half months of field monitoring. Comparative microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA transcriptome analyses identified 12 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and 165 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in "Anyuan No. 1" compared to the control. Long-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADL), transmembrane protein 251 (TMEM251), dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family protein 7-like (Dhrs7), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP-7), CDK5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1 (CDK5RAP1), visual pigment-like receptor peropsin, 39S ribosomal protein, miR-10, miR-153, miR-7, and miR-3529 were identified as gene and miRNA candidates correlated with superior economic traits in "Anyuan No. 1". Collectively, "Anyuan No. 1" is suitable for large-scale cultivation extension due to its better adaptability to the South China Sea area. Furthermore, we identified "miR10-ACADL" as a potential module for further molecular marker-assisted selective breeding of A. japonicus.

AB  - Metabolic rate determines the physiological and life-history performances of ectotherms. Thus, the extent to which such rates are sensitive and plastic to environmental perturbation is central to an organism's ability to function in a changing environment. Little is known of long-term metabolic plasticity and potential for metabolic adaptation in marine ectotherms exposed to elevated pCO(2). Consequently, we carried out a series of in situ transplant experiments using a number of tolerant and sensitive polychaete species living around a natural CO2 vent system. Here, we show that a marine metazoan (i.e. Platynereis dumerilii) was able to adapt to chronic and elevated levels of pCO(2). The vent population of P. dumerilii was physiologically and genetically different from nearby populations that experience low pCO(2), as well as smaller in body size. By contrast, different populations of Amphiglena mediterranea showed marked physiological plasticity indicating that adaptation or acclimatization are both viable strategies for the successful colonization of elevated pCO(2) environments. In addition, sensitive species showed either a reduced or increased metabolism when exposed acutely to elevated pCO(2). Our findings may help explain, from a metabolic perspective, the occurrence of past mass extinction, as well as shed light on alternative pathways of resilience in species facing ongoing ocean acidification.

AB  - A fundamental problem in evolutionary biology is the understanding of the factors that promote or constrain adaptive evolution, and assessing the role of natural selection in this process. Here, comparative phylogenetics, that is, using phylogenetic information and traits to infer evolutionary processes has been a major paradigm. In this study, we discuss Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models (OU) in the context of thermal adaptation in ectotherms. We specifically applied this approach to study amphibians's evolution and energy metabolism. It has been hypothesized that amphibians exploit adaptive zones characterized by low energy expenditure, which generate specific predictions in terms of the patterns of diversification in standard metabolic rate (SMR). We complied whole-animal metabolic rates for 122 species of amphibians, and adjusted several models of diversification. According to the adaptive zone hypothesis, we expected: (1) to find "accelerated evolution" in SMR (i.e., diversification above Brownian Motion expectations, BM), (2) that a model assuming evolutionary optima (i.e., an OU model) fits better than a white-noise model and (3) that a model assuming multiple optima (according to the three amphibians's orders) fits better than a model assuming a single optimum. As predicted, we found that the diversification of SMR occurred most of the time, above BM expectations. Also, we found that a model assuming an optimum explained the data in a better way than a white-noise model. However, we did not find evidence that an OU model with multiple optima fits the data better, suggesting a single optimum in SMR for Anura, Caudata and Gymnophiona. These results show how comparative phylogenetics could be applied for testing adaptive hypotheses regarding history and physiological performance in ectotherms.

AB  - Chemical communication plays a pivotal role in shaping sexual and ecological interactions among animals. In lizards, fundamental mechanisms of sexual selection such as female mate choice have rarely been shown to be influenced by quantitative phenotypic traits (e.g., ornaments), while chemical signals have been found to potentially influence multiple forms of sexual and social interactions, including mate choice and territoriality. Chemical signals in lizards are secreted by glands primarily located on the edge of the cloacae (precloacal glands, PG) and thighs (femoral glands), and whose interspecific and interclade number ranges from 0 to > 100. However, elucidating the factors underlying the evolution of such remarkable variation remains an elusive endeavour. Competing hypotheses suggest a dominant role for phylogenetic conservatism (i.e., species within clades share similar numbers of glands) or for natural selection (i.e., their adaptive diversification results in deviating numbers of glands from ancestors). Using the prolific Liolaemus lizard radiation from South America (where PG vary from 0 to 14), we present one of the largest-scale tests of both hypotheses to date. Based on climatic and phylogenetic modelling, we show a clear role for both phylogenetic inertia and adaptation underlying gland variation: (i) solar radiation, net primary productivity, topographic heterogeneity and precipitation range have a significant effect on PG variation, (ii) humid and cold environments tend to concentrate species with a higher number of glands, (iii) there is a strong phylogenetic signal that tends to conserve the number of PG within clades. Collectively, our study confirms that the inertia of niche conservatism can be broken down by the need of species facing different selection regimes to adjust their glands to suit the demands of their specific environments.

AB  - Local adaptation is considered a paradigm in studies of salmonid fish populations. Yet, little is known about the geographical scale of local adaptation. Is adaptive divergence primarily evident at the scale of regions or individual populations? Also, many salmonid populations are subject to spawning intrusion by farmed conspecifics that experience selection regimes fundamentally different from wild populations. This prompts the question if adaptive differences between wild populations and hatchery strains are more pronounced than between different wild populations? We addressed these issues by analyzing variation at 74 microsatellite loci (including anonymous and expressed sequence tag- and quantitative trait locus-linked markers) in 15 anadromous wild brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) populations, representing five geographical regions, along with two lake populations and two hatchery strains used for stocking some of the populations. F-ST-based outlier tests revealed more outlier loci between different geographical regions separated by 522 228 km (mean +/- s.d.) than between populations within regions separated by 117 +/- 79 km (mean +/- s.d.). A significant association between geographical distance and number of outliers between regions was evident. There was no evidence for more outliers in comparisons involving hatchery trout, but the loci under putative selection generally were not the same as those found to be outliers between wild populations. Our study supports the notion of local adaption being increasingly important at the scale of regions as compared with individual populations, and suggests that loci involved in adaptation to captive environments are not necessarily the same as those involved in adaptive divergence among wild populations.

AB  - We experimentally tested a series of hypotheses proposed by Masaki (1979, 1986) for the evolution of ovipositor length in crickets. Female crickets use the ovipositor to bury eggs in the soil, where it was hypothesized to protect their eggs from desiccation, cold and other disturbance. However, we found no effect of depth on the overwinter survival of eggs of three species of Nemobiinae. The probability of hatchlings reaching the soil surface was negatively correlated with depth documenting a significant cost to females laying eggs deep in the soil. Hatchling survival may be an important agent of selection on ovipositor length in habitats of different soil moistures. Hatchling survival in the soil was also correlated with body size, which may impose a constraint on egg-size fecundity trade-offs. Females of a bivoltine population of Allonemobius socius lay eggs at shallower depths when reared under summer compared to fall conditions and, therefore, may be able to respond to selection through behavioral plasticity when morphological adaptation is constrained by allometry.

AB  - Under conditions of global warming, organisms are expected to track their thermal preferences, invading new habitats at higher latitudes and altitudes and altering the structure of local communities. To fend off potential invaders, indigenous communities/populations will have to rapidly adapt to the increase in temperature. In this study, we tested if decades of artificial water heating changed the structure of communities and populations of the Daphnia longispina species complex. We compared the species composition of contemporary Daphnia communities inhabiting five lakes heated by power plants and four non-heated control lakes. The heated lakes are ca. 3-4 degrees C warmer, as all lakes are expected to be by 2100 according to climate change forecasts. We also genotyped subfossil resting eggs to describe past shifts in Daphnia community structure that were induced by lake heating. Both approaches revealed a rapid replacement of indigenous D. longispina and D. cucullata by invader D. galeata immediately after the onset of heating, followed by a gradual recovery of the D. cucullata population. Our findings clearly indicate that, in response to global warming, community restructuring may occur faster than evolutionary adaptation. The eventual recolonisation by D. cucullata indicates that adaptation to novel conditions can be time-lagged, and suggests that the long-term consequences of ecosystem disturbance may differ from short-term observations.

AB  - The desert tortoise occurs in two strikingly different desert regimes in the southwestern United States In. the Mojave Desert, rainfall is more irregular and resources are more limited than in the Sonoran Desert. We examined the age structure of tortoise populations from these two deserts to determine whether the difference in resource availability has driven an evolutionary divergence in life history strategies, Age and growth rates strongly reflect the ecological adaptation of the two populations. The oldest Sonoran males reached 54 years, compared to only 43 years in females. The oldest West Mojave (WM) males reached 56 years, compared to only 27 years in females. WM tortoises grew faster than Sonoran ones, and females reached sexual maturity at earlier ages (similar to 17-19 years) than Sonoran females (similar to 22-26 years). These traits and the higher rate of clutch production in the WM population are likely the evolutionary adaptation for low juvenile survivorship and a significantly shorter life span. Frequent droughts in the WM Desert and the lowest annual rainfall area within the range of the desert tortoise cause chronic physiological stress, likely annually, and are proposed as a major selection force producing contrasting life-history strategies.

AB  - Resource allocation to growth, reproduction, and body maintenance varies within species along latitudinal gradients. Two hypotheses explaining this variation are local adaptation and counter-gradient variation. The local adaptation hypothesis proposes that populations are adapted to local environmental conditions and are therefore less adapted to environmental conditions at other locations. The counter-gradient variation hypothesis proposes that one population out performs others across an environmental gradient because its source location has greater selective pressure than other locations. Our study had two goals. First, we tested the local adaptation and counter-gradient variation hypotheses by measuring effects of environmental temperature on phenotypic expression of reproductive traits in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis Say, from three populations along a latitudinal gradient in a common garden experimental design. Second, we compared patterns of variation to evaluate whether traits covary or whether local adaptation of traits precludes adaptive responses by others. Across a latitudinal range, N. orbicollis exhibits variation in initiating reproduction and brood sizes. Consistent with local adaptation: (a) beetles were less likely to initiate breeding at extreme temperatures, especially when that temperature represents their source range; (b) once beetles initiate reproduction, source populations produce relatively larger broods at temperatures consistent with their local environment. Consistent with counter-gradient variation, lower latitude populations were more successful at producing offspring at lower temperatures. We found no evidence for adaptive variation in other adult or offspring performance traits. This suite of traits does not appear to coevolve along the latitudinal gradient. Rather, response to selection to breed within a narrow temperature range may preclude selection on other traits. Our study highlights that N. orbicollis uses temperature as an environmental cue to determine whether to initiate reproduction, providing insight into how behavior is modified to avoid costly reproductive attempts. Furthermore, our results suggest a temperature constraint that shapes reproductive behavior.

AB  - The molecular basis of short term cold resistance (indexed as chill-coma recovery time) has been mostly addressed in D. melanogaster, where candidate genes (Dca (also known as smp-30) and Frost (Fst)) have been identified. Nevertheless, in Drosophila, the ability to tolerate short term exposure to low temperatures evolved several times independently. Therefore, it is unclear whether variation in the same candidate genes is also responsible for short term cold resistance in distantly related Drosophila species. It should be noted that Dca is a candidate gene for cold resistance in the Sophophora subgenus only, since there is no orthologous gene copy in the Drosophila subgenus. Here we show that, in D. americana (Drosophila subgenus), there is a north-south gradient for a variant at the 59 non-coding region of regucalcin (a Dca-like gene; in D. melanogaster the proteins encoded by the two genes share 71.9% amino acid identities) but in our D. americana F2 association experiment there is no association between this polymorphism and chill-coma recovery times. Moreover, we found no convincing evidence that this gene is up-regulated after cold shock in both D. americana and D. melanogaster. Size variation in the Fst PEST domain (putatively involved in rapid protein degradation) is observed when comparing distantly related Drosophila species, and is associated with short term cold resistance differences in D. americana. Nevertheless, this effect is likely through body size variation. Moreover, we show that, even at two hours after cold shock, when up-regulation of this gene is maximal in D. melanogaster (about 48 fold expression change), in D. americana this gene is only moderately up-regulated (about 3 fold expression change). Our work thus shows that there are important differences regarding the molecular basis of cold resistance in distantly related Drosophila species.

AB  - Organ shape evolves through cross-generational changes in developmental patterns at cellular and/or tissue levels that ultimately alter tissue dimensions and final adult proportions. Here, we investigated the cellular basis of an artificially selected divergence in the outline shape of Drosophila melanogaster wings, by comparing flies with elongated or rounded wing shapes but with remarkably similar wing sizes. We also tested whether cellular plasticity in response to developmental temperature was altered by such selection. Results show that variation in cellular traits is associated with wing shape differences, and that cell number may play an important role in wing shape response to selection. Regarding the effects of developmental temperature, a size-related plastic response was observed, in that flies reared at 16 A degrees C developed larger wings with larger and more numerous cells across all intervein regions relative to flies reared at 25 A degrees C. Nevertheless, no conclusive indication of altered phenotypic plasticity was found between selection strains for any wing or cellular trait. We also described how cell area is distributed across different intervein regions. It follows that cell area tends to decrease along the anterior wing compartment and increase along the posterior one. Remarkably, such pattern was observed not only in the selected strains but also in the natural baseline population, suggesting that it might be canalized during development and was not altered by the intense program of artificial selection for divergent wing shapes.

AB  - Ectotherms may respond to variable environmental conditions by altering their phenotypes. Phenotypic plasticity was initially thought to be beneficial to an organism's physiological fitness but several alternative hypotheses have been proposed with growing empirical support. In this study, we tested the full suite of hypotheses by investigating acclimation responses of locomotor performance for nine populations of five species of sub-Antarctic weevils, using static and fluctuating temperatures. Species showed typical locomotion thermal performance curves with temperature of the maximum speed (T-opt) ranging between 22.3 +/- 1.7 degrees C (mean +/- s.e.m.) and 31.1 +/- 0.7 degrees C. For most species, T-opt was not affected by acclimation. For maximum speed (U-max), significant, positive effects of acclimation were found for all species except a supralittoral one. Individuals acclimated to 0 degrees C showed much lower values than the other two acclimation treatments (15 degrees C and fluctuating 0-15 degrees C). Performance breadth (the index of the breadth of the curve, T-br) typically showed little response to acclimation. None of the traits of the supralittoral species was affected by acclimation treatment. Responses to stable and fluctuating temperature treatments were similar. Our findings also revealed that the mean estimated activation energy 0.40 +/- 0.015 eV (mean +/- s.e.m.) was lower than for other herbivores, the category to which these weevils belong, suggesting that some form of compensation in the rate-temperature relationship may be evident. Thus, we typically found support for the 'warmer is better' hypothesis for acclimation of locomotor performance, although some compensation was evident.

AB  - Fish skin is the potential gelatin source since the increase of the demand for the halal food due to the religious consideration. The yield of gelatin obtained from connective tissue of animal skin greatly affected by the extraction process and age of the animals that used as raw material. Research about the potential of the Pangasius hypophthalmus (striped catfish) skin as halal gelatin source have been developing. However, there was no information about the correlation between the length of striped catfish that representing age with the gelatin content. Here we optimize the gelatin extraction method from striped catfish skin with different length body size (sub adult and adult size) using statistical analysis of Placket Burman Design. We performed preliminary study to determine the variables used in the main study. We used 9 variables in the extraction process and analyzed the p-value of each variable. According to this analysis, three variables with the lowest p-values were selected: temperature (p=0.000); soaking time in alkali solution (p=0.055) and soaking time in acid solution (p=0.244). Range value of selected variables were determined according to the related previous studies. Results from our study showed that the maximum yield of sub adult and adult were obtained when we used 70 degrees C as temperature of extraction, i.e. 37.42% and 30.31%, respectively. In general, sub adult striped catfish have higher yield than the adult one at the temperature of 40 and 70 degrees C. However, the gelatin yielded from extraction process temperature of >= 70 degrees C exhibited dark pigmentation, while the gelatin that obtained with temperature treatment of <= 55 degrees C showed less pigmentation. The gelatin yielded from sub adult striped catfish showed more pigmentation than the adult one. We suggested for process of extraction both size of striped catfish should be at 55 degrees C, since it showed higher yield extraction with less pigmentation.

AB  - Significant relationships among morphology, behavior, performance and fitness have long served as bona fide evidence for the role of selection in shaping natural populations. Here, I discuss how studies of ecological performance, or how organisms perform in nature, provide an ecological context for such selection studies. Laboratory studies assume that the level of performance expressed under "optimal" conditions accurately reflects the level of performance used in nature, but I show here that this assumption is not always borne out. A review of how various factors affect ecological performance (ontogeny, microhabitat, and macrohabitat) show that animals often express very different levels of movement speed both among different tasks, and when comparing laboratory versus field performance. Thus, a failure to take this variation into account could lead to negative, or even misleading significant fitness-character correlations. While laboratory performance studies should continue to play a key role in studies of selection, recent technological (Le., portable high-speed cameras) and methodological developments should enable researchers to measure performance in nature to high degrees of accuracy. Thus, I encourage researchers to measure performance both in the laboratory and in the field, and thus expand the traditional paradigm of morphology --> performance --> fitness to morphology --> ecological performance --> fitness.

AB  - The European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) was first introduced to Massachusetts in 1869 and within 150 years has spread throughout eastern North America. This large-scale invasion across a heterogeneous landscape allows examination of the genetic signatures of adaptation potentially associated with rapid geographical spread. We tested the hypothesis that spatially divergent natural selection has driven observed changes in three developmental traits that were measured in a common garden for 165 adult moths sampled from six populations across a latitudinal gradient covering the entirety of the range. We generated genotype data for 91,468 single nucleotide polymorphisms based on double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing and used these data to discover genome-wide associations for each trait, as well as to test for signatures of selection on the discovered architectures. Genetic structure across the introduced range of gypsy moth was low in magnitude (F-ST = 0.069), with signatures of bottlenecks and spatial expansion apparent in the rare portion of the allele frequency spectrum. Results from applications of Bayesian sparse linear mixed models were consistent with the presumed polygenic architectures of each trait. Further analyses indicated spatially divergent natural selection acting on larval development time and pupal mass, with the linkage disequilibrium component of this test acting as the main driver of observed patterns. The populations most important for these signals were two range-edge populations established less than 30 generations ago. We discuss the importance of rapid polygenic adaptation to the ability of non-native species to invade novel environments.

AB  - Climatic variation is a key driver of genetic differentiation and phenotypic traits evolution, and local adaptation to temperature is expected in widespread species. We investigated phenotypic and genomic changes in the native range of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus. We first refine the phylogeographic structure based on genome-wide regions (1,901 double-digest restriction-site associated DNA single nucleotide polymophisms [ddRAD SNPs]) from 41 populations. We then explore the patterns of cold adaptation using phenotypic traits measured in common garden (wing size and cold tolerance) and genotype-temperature associations at targeted candidate regions (51,706 exon-capture SNPs) from nine populations. We confirm the existence of three evolutionary lineages including clades A (Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos), B (China and Okinawa), and C (South Korea and Japan). We identified temperature-associated differentiation in 15 out of 221 candidate regions but none in ddRAD regions, supporting the role of directional selection in detected genes. These include genes involved in lipid metabolism and a circadian clock gene. Most outlier SNPs are differently fixed between clades A and C, whereas clade B has an intermediate pattern. Females are larger at higher latitude yet produce no more eggs, which might favor the storage of energetic reserves in colder climate. Nondiapausing eggs from temperate populations survive better to cold exposure than those from tropical populations, suggesting they are protected from freezing damages but this cold tolerance has a fitness cost in terms of egg viability. Altogether, our results provide strong evidence for the thermal adaptation of A. albopictus across its wide temperature range.

AB  - Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) breeding companies depend on changing light, temperature and feeding regimes to achieve new generations outside the natural spawning season. However, there have been few conducted trials reported that have studied whether this shift affects important traits. We test whether an induced shift of two months earlier or two months later than normal spawning season affects the nutritional status (folate, methio-nine, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, free amino acids, N-metabolites and lipids) in broodstock liver and muscle and whether this affects the levels of the same nutrients in the offspring. The results showed significant seasonal differences in the Cahill cycle (glucose-alanine cycle), 1C metabolism and for free amino acids catabolized in the citric acid cycle all which are important for embryonic growth The broodstock nutritional status was reflected in the eggs. Nutritional status of broodstock liver and muscle and newly fertilized eggs showed two general sce-narios: Advanced spawning period did not obtain optimal deposition of nutrients in the eggs. Delayed spawning broodstock displayed a metabolic profile which indicated that it had enhanced catabolization of muscle protein which led to accumulation of aminogroups from muscle breakdown to such a degree that these amino groups were increased in the eggs. The total body weight at start-feeding stage revealed best growth for both the normal and late spawning compared to early spawning. We show here that environmental alterations in broodstock husbandry influence the nutrient status of the next generation via nutritional and metabolic programming. This is an important concept which needs more careful awareness as the metabolism compensate and regulate the energy between catabolism and anabolism through the early stages of cell divisions which give rise to changes in permanent traits for the next generation.

AB  - Environmental stress has been suggested to be a major evolutionary force, both through inducing strong selection and because of its direct impact on developmental buffering processes that alter the evolvability of organisms. In particular, temperature has attracted much attention because of its importance as an ecological feature and the relative ease with which it can be experimentally manipulated in the lab. Evolution Canyon, Lower Nahal Oren, Israel, is a well studied natural site where ecological parameters are suspected to drive evolutionary differentiation. In this study, using Drosophila melanogaster isofemale lines derived from wild flies collected on both slopes of the canyon, we investigated the effect of developmental temperature upon the different components of phenotypic variation of a complex trait: the wing. Combining geometric and traditional morphometrics, we find only limited evidence for a differentiation among slopes. Investigating simultaneously phenotypic plasticity, genetic variation among isofemale lines, variation among individuals and fluctuating asymmetry, we could not identify a consistent effect of the stressful conditions encountered on the south facing slope. The prevailing structuring effect is that of the experimentally manipulated temperature which clearly influences wing mean size and shape. Variability, in contrast, is not consistently affected by temperature. Finally, we investigated the specific relationship between individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry. Using metric multi-dimensional scaling we show that the related patterns of wing shape variation are not identical, supporting the view that the underlying developmental processes are to a certain extent different.

AB  - Correlated responses to artificial selection for stress tolerance can provide insight into underlying genetic variation and the physiological basis of stress resistance. Lines of Drosophila melanogaster held in the absence of food or with an unsuitable resource, specifically decomposing lemon, responded to selection by becoming starvation resistant. The lemon-selected lines also adapted by evolving a resource-based induction response. Compared to control lines, the selected lines tended to store more lipid, develop slower and have a larger body size. Additional responses included resistance to desiccation and acetone fumes, suggesting multiple stress resistance is a correlated result of selection for starvation resistance. The specific metabolic rate was lower in the starvation selected lines and enzyme activities changed in response to selection. In particular, enzyme activities indirectly associated with lipid biogenesis increased in both types of selected lines. The correlated responses to the two selection regimes were sufficiently consistent to indicate a common basis for starvation resistance. Specific responses to starvation selection appeared to oppose the short-term phenotypic responses to starvation. Thus, a common response to stress selection may be to ameliorate the immediate physiological impact of the stress factor.

AB  - Clinal variation for repeat number in the Thr-Gly region of the period circadian timing gene in Drosophila melanogaster was described in Europe and has subsequently been used as evidence of thermal selection on period alleles. To test for clinal variation in this gene along the east coast of Australia, the period polymorphism was scored on flies from multiple samples collected repeatedly over a 5-year interval, along with variation at another circadian rhythm locus, clock. For period, there was no consistent evidence of clinal variation in the 17 and/or 20 repeat alleles, although when average allele length was examined a weak consistent clinal pattern was detected. For clock there was no evidence of clinal variation in the two most common alleles or in average repeat size. These data are inconsistent with the reported patterns in Europe and suggest that clinal variation in timing genes needs to be re-examined in this region.

AB  - We investigated the effect of temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) on fecundity, life span and morphology of the rotifer Brachionus caudatus f. apsteini. For each temperature, short posterior-spined and long posterior-spined clones of H. caudatus f apsteini were individually cultured for up to six generations. The rotifers were fed Chlorella sp. at a density of 1 x 10(6) cells ml(-1). Morphometric data (body size and spine length) were collected. Total number of offspring producing by a single female per life cycle at high temperature was higher than at low temperature. The duration of juvenile period, reproductive period, post-reproductive period and life span of both clones of B. caudatus f. apsteini decreased with increasing temperature. All offspring of short posterior-spined clone produce posterior spines at 20 and 25 degrees C, with an average length of 19.8 +/- 6.6 and 11.9 +/- 2.6 mu m, respectively. In contrast, they cannot develop posterior spines at 30 degrees C, at which the average length of the posterior spine remnant was 6.4 +/- 1.3 mu m. On the other hand, all offspring of long posterior-spined clone have long posterior spines with average lengths of 36.8 +/- 6.1, 36.3 +/- 5.2 and 36.6 +/- 6.2 mu m at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively. This study indicated that the production of posterior spines can be induced by low temperature and that short posterior-spined and long posterior-spined clones are genetically different.

AB  - An increase in aquatic animal production can be achieved by extending aquaculture areas geographically, utilizing new species for culture, and using new technologies. Among new technologies useful for the increase of aquaculture production is the application of genetics and genomics. New molecular tools that benefit aquaculture have been developed. There has been a large number of experimental and review papers published concerning molecular markers and the range of their applications, including aquaculture and food product analyses. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has emerged as genotyping technology with wide and significant applications in aquaculture. SNPs can be used for construction of genetic linkage maps, finding quantitative trait loci (QTL) for useful traits like growth, body weight, grilsing, thermal and low oxygen tolerance, resistance to stress and diseases, mapping sex determination loci and identification of progeny in selection and chromosome manipulation experiments, assessment of genomic selectionand marker assisted selection in aquaculture. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) facilitate the finding associations between SNPs and a trait in related or unrelated specimens. However, many traits are complex and can be controlled by number of QTL. Genotyping by genome reduction complexity sequencing emerged as an efficient and applicable technology in genomic selection. Identification of genes, sequences and nucleotides (substitutions) directly influencing phenotypic variations opens the possibility of marker-assisted selection for desirable characters in culture. SNP and QTL associations can be enhanced using genome editing technology. Examples of successful applications of SNPs in aquaculture of fish, crustacean and mollusk species, representing most geographic areas, and ecological risks assessment are reviewed.

AB  - Background: Understanding the genetic architecture of ecologically relevant adaptive traits requires the contribution of developmental and evolutionary biology. The time to reach the age of reproduction is a complex life history trait commonly known as developmental time. In particular, in holometabolous insects that occupy ephemeral habitats, like fruit flies, the impact of developmental time on fitness is further exaggerated. The present work is one of the first systematic studies of the genetic basis of developmental time, in which we also evaluate the impact of environmental variation on the expression of the trait.
   Results: We analyzed 179 co-isogenic single P[GT1]-element insertion lines of Drosophila melanogaster to identify novel genes affecting developmental time in flies reared at 25 C. Sixty percent of the lines showed a heterochronic phenotype, suggesting that a large number of genes affect this trait. Mutant lines for the genes Merlin and Karl showed the most extreme phenotypes exhibiting a developmental time reduction and increase, respectively, of over 2 days and 4 days relative to the control (a co-isogenic P-element insertion free line). In addition, a subset of 42 lines selected at random from the initial set of 179 lines was screened at 17 C. Interestingly, the gene-by-environment interaction accounted for 52% of total phenotypic variance. Plastic reaction norms were found for a large number of developmental time candidate genes.
   Conclusion: We identified components of several integrated time-dependent pathways affecting egg-to-adult developmental time in Drosophila. At the same time, we also show that many heterochronic phenotypes may arise from changes in genes involved in several developmental mechanisms that do not explicitly control the timing of specific events. We also demonstrate that many developmental time genes have pleiotropic effects on several adult traits and that the action of most of them is sensitive to temperature during development. Taken together, our results stress the need to take into account the effect of environmental variation and the dynamics of gene interactions on the genetic architecture of this complex life-history trait.

AB  - Understanding the ecological process of population differentiation and identifying the molecular changes that contribute to adaptation is a central aspect of evolutionary biology. In this study we analyzed the geographic variation in allozyme allele frequencies (based on 15 enzyme systems representing 18 loci) across 18 populations of the butterfly Lycaena tityrus from different altitudes. Population genetic analyses showed that within population genetic diversity (e.g. mean number of alleles per loci: 1.8; expected heterozygosity: 12%) was within the typical value range for the Lepidoptera. The populations of L. tityrus investigated showed a remarkable genetic differentiation (F-ST: 0.065), being clearly divided into an alpine (high-altitude) and a non-alpine (low-altitude) cluster. This differentiation was almost entirely caused by variation at a single enzyme locus, PGI. Although the involvement of historical events cannot be ruled out, several lines of evidence suggest that the specific pattern of allozyme (and in this case particularly PGI) variation found is caused by thermal selection. For example, genetic variation was highly locus-specific rather than relatively uniform, as should be expected for effects of natural selection. Further, the PGI 2-2 genotype dominating in alpine (in contrast to low-altitude) populations is known to exhibit increased cold stress resistance and relatively long development times typical of alpine populations. Thus, PGI (or possibly a closely linked gene) is an obvious target for thermal selection in L. tityrus. This study exemplifies how allozyme analyses can be used to detect candidate loci likely to be under selection.

AB  - Risk assessments of the ecotoxicological effects insecticides impose on ectotherms have increasingly considered temperature. However, the changes toxicants induce in thermoregulatory behavioral traits may lead to a divergence of thermal selection and temperature-dependent changes of contaminant toxicity. This study demonstrated the interaction of behavioral thermoregulation and temperature-dependent toxicity of betacyfluthrin (BC) in the lizard Eremias argus. Based on the negative relationship between temperature and BC toxicity, seeking a warming environment was assumed to represent a self-rescue behavior (and vice versa). The results showed that BC-treated lizards (0-20 mu g/g body weight (bw)) showed such self-rescue behavior, while lizards exposed to an extremely high BC dose (200 mu g/g bw) sought a cooler environment. Biochemical assays showed that BC affected neurotransmitter systems, caused oxidative stress, and interfered with ion-transport in the central nervous system. Biomarkers of the cholinergic and glutamatergic system, ion-transport function, and oxidative stress were identified as potential biochemical variables related to thermoregulatory behavior. Apparently, seeking a warmer environment is a survival strategy with the aim to neutralize BC toxicity, while seeking a cooler environment aims to attenuate the harmful effects of metabolic and oxidative stress, and to decelerate internal BC diffusion. This phenomenon could be also explained by the concept of the "cooling trap", i. e., a behavior where cooler temperatures are sought. This impairs survival after exposure to BC at it has a negative temperature coefficient, derived from a dysfunction of the central nervous system regarding thermoregulation caused by the high dosage of neurotoxicant and resulting temperature maladaptation. Implications of the interaction between thermoregulatory behavior and temperature-dependent toxicity are presented, which may aid further temperature-dependent risk assessments.

AB  - Elevated temperatures resulting from climate change are expected to disproportionately affect ectotherms given their biological function has a direct link to environmental temperature. Thus, as climate change leads to rapid increases in water temperatures in rivers, aquatic ectotherms, such as fish may be highly impacted. Organisms can respond to these stressors through flexible and rapid phenotypic change induced via developmental and/or transgenerational plasticity. In oviparous species, gravid females may translate environmental stress across generations via increased exposure of eggs to maternally derived glucocorticoids (i.e., maternal stress), which has been shown to result in diverse phenotypic effects in offspring. Recent studies suggest these phenotypic changes from maternal glucocorticoids may elicit predictive adaptive responses, where offspring exposed to maternal stress may be better prepared for the stressful environment they will encounter (i.e., environmental match hypothesis). We applied the environmental match hypothesis to examine whether a prenatal exogenous increase in egg cortisol may prepare Chinook salmon offspring (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to cope with thermal challenges after being reared in chronically elevated temperatures. Specifically, we exposed eggs to aqueous bath of cortisol-dosed (1,000 ng/mL) or control (0 ng/ml) solutions, and then raised both treatments at current (+0 degrees C-contemporary ambient river temperature) or elevated (+3 degrees C-projected future river temperature) thermal regimes. We quantified thermal performance in fish 7-9 month post fertilization using two methods: via critical thermal maximum (CTMax), and energetic responses (in plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate) to environmentally relevant, but challenging thermal spikes over 3 days. Overall, we found that exposure to elevated rearing temperatures had a large impact on thermal tolerance, where elevated-temperature reared offspring had significantly higher CTMax. In comparison, egg cortisol treatment had little to no clear effects on CTMax and blood energetic response. Our study demonstrates the importance of elevated water temperatures as an inducer of offspring phenotypes (via early developmental cues), and highlights the significance of examining offspring performance in environments with ecologically relevant stressors.

AB  - We measured the rate at which the metabolic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), citrate synthase (CS), and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) acclimate in the response to lowered temperature in the axial muscle of tadpoles of Limnodynastes peronii (Anura: Myobatrachidae) over 6 weeks. In addition, we measured growth rates of the tadpoles kept at both temperatures and examined the activities of these enzymes in the liver tissue of the control group and cold-acclimated group at the end of the experiment. We found that LDH acclimates in axial muscle; the differences between the control and cold-acclimated group became apparent after 21 days. After 42 days, the activity of LDH in axial muscle in the cold-acclimated group was 30% greater than the control group. Growth rates were maintained at 0.7 mm/week within both treatments despite the 10 degreesC difference in temperature between experimental groups. Both LDH and CS were increased in activity in the liver (5 and 1.3 times greater, respectively, in the cold-acclimated group). The thermal sensitivity (Q(10)) of LDH was between 20 and 30 degreesC in the cold-acclimated group (1.2+/-0.01) when compared to the control group (1.6+/-0.15). The rate at which acclimation in this species occurs is appropriate for seasonal changes in temperature, and these animals may not be able to respond to a rapid drop in temperature.

AB  - Some fish species, such as killifish, that normally inhabit temperate water environments are also found in extreme thermal environments such as thermal springs. The extent of the adaptations involved is not known. In the present laboratory study, we exposed killifish (Aphanius dispar) acclimated to a normal thermal environment to elevated temperatures (37-40 degrees C) in which related killifish species live permanently. Our objective was to determine whether there is evidence that killifish have heat-shock characteristics that make permanent adaptation likely. The fish was exposed to this temperature for a period of 44 days and then compared with control fish kept at their normal temperature (24 degrees C) with respect to growth, survival and histopathology of gill and heart tissues. At the end of the experimental time, the percentage of body weight gain and specific growth rate were significantly lower in fish kept in thermal stress compared with the control group. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was also significantly affected by water temperature, so that during thermal stress the values of FCR were negative. Fish condition (Condition factor: CF) did not differ significantly between both groups at the end of the experiment. On days 11 and 33, however, CF was significantly lower in the thermal stress group. The gill showed blood congestion in primary lamellae and shortened secondary lamellae in fish kept at 37-40 degrees C. No specific alterations were found in the cardiac tissue of fish kept in thermal stress conditions. Under thermal stress, 40% of fish survived until the end of the experiment. A preliminary conclusion drawn from this work is that A. dispar, which lives at normal temperatures, shows evidence of adaptability to elevated temperatures that could be a factor in the ability of killifish to adapt permanently over time to thermal environment.

AB  - Bigfin reef squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana) is a candidate squid species that has potential to be utilized in aquaculture on a commercial scale. Although this species has been successfully cultured over multiple generations, appropriate feeding strategies are still limited due to a lack of understanding of its digestive physiology. The present study focused on digestive enzymes and chyme characteristics in terms of time response profiles following feeding. Squids (1.78 +/- 0.05 g body weight) were serially collected at different post-prandial times (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18 and 24 h) and the specimens were used in the analysis of digestive enzymes (n = 10) and chyme characteristics (n = 5). Food provided to the animals substantially transited to the gastrointestinal tract and peaked at 1 h after feeding, and then dramatically decreased with post-prandial time (P < 0.05). The digestion process was initiated shortly after the food arrived and exhibited the same pattern over 24 h of observation. The highest activities of protein-, carbohydrate- and lipid-digesting enzymes were observed within a range of 0.5 to 4 h after feeding and reached basal levels as observed in fasted squids post-prandially within 8 h. Pearson correlation analysis indicated a highly significant relationship between digestive enzyme activity and digestosomatic index across post-prandial times (r = 0.660-1.000, P < 0.01). These responses matched well with chyme characteristics, in terms of thermal properties of nutrients, microstructure, and molecular weight patterns of the relevant proteins. Findings from the current study have thus provided basic information on the digestive physiology of bigfin reef squids that can be applied when designing specimen-harvesting strategies.

AB  - Maternal temperature is known to affect many aspects of offspring phenotype, but its effect on offspring physiological thermal tolerance has received less attention, despite the importance of physiological traits in defining organismal ability to cope with temperature changes. To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica to investigate the influence of maternal temperature on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30 degrees C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24 degrees C and then exposed to 18 or 30 degrees C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24 degrees C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother-offspring temperatures did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were observed when temperatures persisted across generations. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30 degrees C may have benefited offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring performance when mother-offspring environments did not match. Our results provided evidence for a trans-generational effect of temperature on physiological performance characterised by a high context dependency, and are discussed in the light of maternal pre-reproductive experiences.

AB  - The scope of anti-predatory adaptation is expected to be greater in warm than in cold environments. High temperatures lower the costs associated with the production and maintenance of energetically expensive traits and enable ecological interactions to intensify. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the expression of anti-predatory morphology within a marine gastropod species (the knobbed whelk Busycon carica) over a large (> 1400 km) geographic area that spans more than 10 degrees C annual temperature variation. We also conducted experimental predation studies with a powerful durophagous predator, the stone crab Menippe, to verify the anti-predatory advantages of a heavily ornamented shell morphology (e.g. increased thickness, pronounced spines), and we used repair scar data to assess clinal variation in selective pressure from predators. We predicted that repair scar rates would be greatest in warm southernmost latitudes, and that expression of energetically costly anti-predatory morphology would peak in concert with elevated predation pressures. Experiments confirmed that whelks with energetically costly, heavily ornamented shells had higher survivorship rates than those with weakly ornamented shells. As predicted, we also found that the expression of anti-predatory traits was greatest in the southern part of B. carica's range. After standardizing shells for size, shape, and exposure time to enemies, repair scar rates also peaked to the south. Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of anti-predatory traits along the geographic cline is governed by the interaction of two selective factors: temperature and predation, with the former acting as the ultimate control on the scope of adaptation both by escalating predation pressure in the southern part of B. carica's range and by physically limiting (to the north) and facilitating (to the south) the production of anti-predatory traits. Feedbacks between temperature and predation thus causally interact to enable and drive, respectively, the observed geographic cline in energy-intensive anti-predatory shell traits.

TI  - FATIGUE BEHAVIOR OF A TITANIUM FEMORAL HIP-PROSTHESIS WITH PROXIMAL SLEEVE-STEM MODULARITY
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED BIOMATERIALS
LA  - English
AB  - Modular hip prostheses are increasing in variety and utilization. Component stability, high endurance limit, and minimal particulate debris generation are critical for long-term clinical success. The purpose of this study was to characterize the fatigue response and evaluate the in vitro potential for component motion and wear of the S-ROM(TM), a Ti-6Al-4V hip prosthesis with a modular design based on a Morse taper connection. A fatigue jig was designed to simulate fixation of the device at the sleeve-bone interface only with distal support mainly against the lateral endosteal cortex. Two series of tests were performed in air at room temperature: one with direct vertical loading (to produce high bending moments in the coronal plane) and one with a compound loading angle directed at 15 degrees out-of-plane (to include torsional physiological loads). Applied loads using a servohydraulic test machine ranged from 5 X BW (body weight) to 9 X BW (1 x BW = 73 kg, approximate to 160 Ib) at 10 Hz on an Instron apparatus. No mechanical failures were observed on the 11-mm size stems below 6 X BW for in-plane vertical loading, and at or below 7 X BW for out-of-plane loading. Using displacement monitoring with a sensitivity of 35 mu m, no measurable slippage or relative motion was detected between the stem and sleeve when they were properly assembled. Examination of the contact areas with scanning electron microscopy revealed random surface modification (an indication of fretting or burnishing) with occasional evidence of transfer of material between stem and sleeve. At loads under 7 X BW there was no visual evidence of loose wear debris in the presence of gross stability. Overall, the extent of surface change or wear was relatively small in all components tested at physiological load levels. (C) 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Comparative phylogenetic studies of adaptation are uncommon in biomechanics and physiology. Such studies require data collection from many species, a challenge when this is experimentally intensive. Moreover, researchers struggle to employ the most biologically appropriate phylogenetic tools for identifying adaptive evolution. Here, we detail an established but greatly underutilized phylogenetic comparative framework - the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process - that explicitly models long-term adaptation. We discuss challenges in implementing and interpreting the model, and we outline potential solutions. We demonstrate use of the model through studying the evolution of thermal physiology in treefrogs. Frogs of the family Hylidae have twice colonized the temperate zone from the tropics, and such colonization likely involved a fundamental change in physiology due to colder and more seasonal temperatures. However, which traits changed to allow colonization is unclear. We measured cold tolerance and characterized thermal performance curves in jumping for 12 species of treefrogs distributed from the Neotropics to temperate North America. We then conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses to examine how tolerances and performance curves evolved and to test whether that evolution was adaptive. We found that tolerance to low temperatures increased with the transition to the temperate zone. In contrast, jumping well at colder temperatures was unrelated to biogeography and thus did not adapt during dispersal. Overall, our study shows how comparative phylogenetic methods can be leveraged in biomechanics and physiology to test the evolutionary drivers of variation among species.

AB  - Simple Summary The global warming and rapid climate change that we are witnessing is generally influencing all of the living world, so all species must necessarily cope with these changes in order to survive. The ability to withstand environmental stress, especially during the last two decades, has been of great importance for any species' long-term survival. For that purpose, we studied these abilities in the Drosophila subobscura species, which is known to be a good model organism for studying adaptations to environmental changes such as in temperature. We chose to investigate thermal stress responses in D. subobscura populations from two different altitudes, through four traits linked to stress tolerance: desiccation resistance, heat knock-down resistance, starvation resistance, and chill coma recovery time. Correlations between the populations' origin and these traits were found, as well as the significant influence of the laboratory thermal conditions and sex on these traits showing that males and cold-adapted populations are expected to fare much worse in a fast-changing warming environment. Global warming and climate change are affecting many insect species in numerous ways. These species can develop diverse mechanisms as a response to variable environmental conditions. The rise in mean and extreme temperatures due to global warming and the importance of the population's ability to adapt to temperature stress will further increase. In this study, we investigated thermal stress response, which is considered to be one of the crucial elements of population fitness and survival in fast-changing environments. The dynamics and variation of thermal stress resistance traits in D. subobscura flies originating from two natural populations sampled from different altitudes were analysed. Three different temperature regimes (25 degrees C, 19 degrees C, and 16 degrees C) were used for the F1 progeny from both localities to establish six experimental groups and investigate stress resistance traits: desiccation resistance, heat knock-down resistance, starvation resistance, and chill-coma recovery time. We detected that laboratory thermal conditions and population origin may have an effect on the analysed traits, and that sex also significantly influences stress resistance. Individuals from the lower altitude reared at higher temperatures show inferior resistance to thermal shock.

AB  - Water temperature and feeding frequency are two important components in feeding strategy that directly affect the growth and physiology of fishes. The rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) has been cultured for decades in the laboratory as an experimental fish and is widely used in environmental science research. An 8-week factorial feeding experiment was conducted on juvenile rare minnows to investigate the interaction between water temperature (ambient, 20, 24, 28 degrees C) and feeding frequency (one, two, three meals per day) on growth performance, feed utilization, gut evacuation and adaptability to variable environmental conditions. Groups fed three times a day at 28 degrees C attained the maximum final body weight, followed by those fed two times a day at 24 degrees C. There was an obvious curvilinear relationship between specific growth rate and temperature. Increased temperature significantly promoted food consumption and growth rate, but there were no benefits on growth by feeding multiple times at temperatures of 18 degrees C or lower. Temperature and feeding frequency also affected gut evacuation rates: high temperature and frequency lead to fast evacuation. These results show that the optimal temperature and feeding frequency for rare minnow is 24 degrees C and two meals a day for maximal growth, feeding efficiency, and daily management. The findings also suggest that the rare minnow has the ability to rapidly adapt to changing culture conditions by adjusting physiological activities in the short term. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Temperature is a critical driver of ectotherm life-history strategies, whereby a warmer environment is associated with increased growth, reduced longevity and accelerated senescence. Increasing evidence indicates that thermal adaptation may underlie such life-history shifts in wild populations. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs) can help uncover the molecular mechanisms of temperature-driven variation in growth, longevity and senescence. However, our understanding of these mechanisms is still limited, which reduces our ability to predict the response of non-model ectotherms to global temperature change.
   In this study, we examined the potential role of thermal adaptation in clinal shifts of life-history traits (i.e. life span, senescence rate and recruitment) in the Columbia spotted frog Rana luteiventris along a broad temperature gradient in the western United States.
   We took advantage of extensive capture-recapture datasets of 20,033 marked individuals from eight populations surveyed annually for 14-18 years to examine how mean annual temperature and precipitation influenced demographic parameters (i.e. adult survival, life span, senescence rate, recruitment and population growth). After showing that temperature was the main climatic predictor influencing demography, we used RAD-seq data (50,829 SNPs and 6,599 putative CNVs) generated for 352 individuals from 31 breeding sites to identify the genomic signatures of thermal adaptation.
   Our results showed that temperature was negatively associated with annual adult survival and reproductive life span and positively associated with senescence rate. By contrast, recruitment increased with temperature, promoting the long-term viability of most populations. These temperature-dependent demographic changes were associated with strong genomic signatures of thermal adaptation. We identified 148 SNP candidates associated with temperature including three SNPs located within protein-coding genes regulating resistance to cold and hypoxia, immunity and reproduction in ranids. We also identified 39 CNV candidates (including within 38 transposable elements) for which normalized read depth was associated with temperature.
   Our study indicates that both SNPs and structural variants are associated with temperature and could eventually be found to play a functional role in clinal shifts in senescence rate and life-history strategies in R. luteiventris. These results highlight the potential role of different sources of molecular variation in the response of ectotherms to environmental temperature variation in the context of global warming.

AB  - Identifying sources of phenotypic variability in secondary sexual traits is critical for understanding their signaling properties. role in sexual selection, and for predicting their evolutionary dynamics. The present study tests, for till effects of genotype, developmental temperature, and their interaction, on size and fluctuating asymmetry of the male sex comb. a secondary sexual character, in Drosophila bipectinata Duda. Both the size and symmetry of elements of the sex comb have been shown previously to be under sexual selection in a natural population in northeastern Australia. Two independent reciprocal crosses were conducted at 25 degrees and 29 degrees C between genetic lines extracted from this Population that differed in the size of the first (TC1) and third (TC3) comb segments. These temperatures are within the documented range experienced by the species in nature. Additive and dominance genetic effects were detected for TC1. whereas additive genetic, and Y-chromosomal effects were detected for TC3. TC2 and TC3 decreased sharply with increasing temperature, by 10% and 22%, respectively. In contrast, positional fluctuating asymmetry (PFA) significantly increased with temperature, by up to 38%. The results (1) document an important source of environmental variance in a sexual ornament expected to reduce trait heritability in field populations, and thus act to attenuate response to sexual selection, (2) suggest that variation in ornament size reflects differences in male condition; and (3) Support the general hypothesis that asymmetry in a sexual ornament is indicative of developmental instability arising from environmental stress. The "environmental heterogeneity'' (EH) hypothesis is proposed, and supportive evidence for it presented, to explain negative size-FA correlations in natural populations. Data and theory challenge the use of negative size-FA correlations observed in nature to support the FA-sexual selection hypothesis, which posits that such correlations are driven by differences in genetic quality among individuals.

AB  - Drosophila species often exhibit latitudinal clines for morphological traits, frequently interpreted as adaptations to local climates conditions, especially to temperature. While there are many works on climatic data and genetic variations, the precise effects of temperature in natural conditions are not known. Here, we investigated the phenotypic variations of wild collected Drosophila simulans adults over 12 successive months during which average air temperature varied from 14 to 30 degrees C. Three kinds of traits were measured each month on random samples of 50 flies from two sites and, as control, in laboratory cultures grown at several constant temperatures ranging for 12 to 31 degrees C. All traits exhibited major changes in their mean values. For size-related traits and abdomen pigmentation, a maximum was observed during the coldest months and a minimum in summer. For sternopleural bristles number, a reverse shape was observed with a maximum in July. The shapes of these curves match the shapes of the reaction norms observed under laboratory conditions. For size and pigmentation, mean values are negatively correlated to temperature, but the magnitude of the variation was far less important in nature than in the laboratory. We suggest that the air temperature is not a convenient indicator of the real developmental temperature in nature, especially for low temperatures. Our results show that thermal seasonal variations produce different phenotypes, which may be submitted to natural selection. However, temperature is not the only source of variation and nutritional effects on larvae play also an important role. The impact of temperature in nature is clearly less important than when investigated in the laboratory. Such a result should be considered in ecological genetic studies, especially when biological data are correlated with a diversity of abiotic climatic factors.

AB  - Environmental variables and interspecific interactions influence fishes' habitat use. The eurythermic and euryhaline European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax is increasing in Norwegian waters. We compare diel- and seasonal habitat use and home ranges of this species with Atlantic cod Gadus morhua in the Oslofjord, Norway. Individual depth and horizontal positions were obtained using acoustic telemetry. Fish were tracked using both portable and stationary receivers. Both species displayed high site fidelity from June to October. In late October, the sea bass migrated out of the core area whereas the cod remained. Cod home ranges (11.4 +/- 5.5 ha) were smaller than sea bass home ranges (42.6 +/- 26.1 ha) throughout the study. Home range increased with individual body size in sea bass, but not cod. The two species had differential diel- and seasonal depth use. Sea bass used depths shallower than 4 m during June through September, with diel vertical migrations rarely exceeding 2 m. After September, sea bass sought deeper waters; stabilizing at 11 m in November with a diel migration amplitude of 7 m. Cod stayed deeper than the 9-10 m thermocline in August with vertical migration amplitude of 7 m and moved into daytime depths of 6.5 m with diel amplitude of 4.5 m in December. Sea bass actively selected warmer temperatures and the lowest salinities available, whereas cod avoided temperatures higher than 13 degrees C and salinities below 24 ppt. The differential temperature preference for these species is likely the main driver for the differential depth utilization. A model using air temperatures as a predictor was constructed predicting daytime and night-time depth use. This study provides novel insights to the habitat use of the two species under Nordic fjord conditions-information to be included in upcoming management programs emerging due to the continuing northward colonization of sea bass along the Norwegian coast.

AB  - Fuel efficiency requirements demand lightweight construction of vehicle body parts. The usage of advanced high strength steels permits a reduction of sheet thickness while still maintaining the overall strength required for crash safety. However, damage, internal defects (voids, inclusions, micro fractures), microstructural defects (varying grain size distribution, precipitates on grain boundaries, anisotropy) and surface defects (micro fractures, grooves) act as a concentration point for stress and consequently as an initiation point for failure both during deep drawing and in service. Considering damage evolution in the design of car body deep drawing processes allows for a further reduction in material usage and therefore body weight. Preliminary research has shown that a modification of load paths in forming processes can help mitigate the effects of damage on the material.
   This paper investigates the load paths in Nakajima tests of a DP800 dual phase steel to research damage in deep drawing processes. Investigation is done via a finite element model using experimentally validated material data for a DP800 dual phase steel. Numerical simulation allows for the investigation of load paths with respect to stress states, strain rates and temperature evolution, which cannot be easily observed in physical experiments. Stress triaxiality and the Lode parameter are used to describe the stress states. Their evolution during the Nakajima tests serves as an indicator for damage evolution. The large variety of sheet metal forming specific load paths in Nakajima tests allows a comprehensive evaluation of damage for deep drawing. The results of the numerical simulation conducted in this project and further physical experiments will later be used to calibrate a damage model for simulation of deep drawing processes.

AB  - Global warming increasingly pressures species to show adaptive migratory responses. We hypothesized that warming increases invasion of alpine lakes by low-elevation montane zooplankton by suppressing native competitors and predators. This hypothesis was tested by conducting a two-factor experiment, consisting of a warming treatment (13 vs. 20 degrees C) crossed with three invasion levels (alpine only, alpine+montane, montane only), in growth chambers over a 28-day period. Warming significantly reduced total consumer biomass owing to the decline of large alpine species, resulting in greater autotrophic abundance. Significant temperature-invasion interactions occurred as warming suppressed alpine zooplankton, while stimulating certain imported species. Herbivorous invaders suppressed functionally similar alpine species while larger native omnivores reduced invasion by smaller taxa. Warming did not affect total invader biomass because imported species thrived under ambient and warmed alpine conditions. Our findings suggest that the adaptability of remote alpine lake communities to global warming is limited by species dispersal from lower valleys, or possibly nearby warmer alpine ponds.

AB  - Urbanization poses serious extinction risks, yet some species thrive in urban environments. This may be due to a pronounced developmental plasticity in these taxa, since phenotypically, plastic organisms may better adjust to unpredictable urban food resources. We studied phenotypic plasticity in Nuctenea umbratica, a common European forest and urban vegetation spider. We subjected spiderlings to low (LF), medium (MF) and high (HF) food treatments and documented their growth and developmental trajectories into adulthood. Spiders from the three treatments had comparable numbers of instars and growth ratios, but differed in developmental periods. Longest developing LF spiders (a (TM) EuroaEuro parts per thousand= 390, a (TM),aEuro parts per thousand= 320 days) had the smallest adults, but MF (a (TM) EuroaEuro parts per thousand= 300, a (TM),aEuro parts per thousand= 240 days) and HF (a (TM) EuroaEuro parts per thousand= 240, a (TM),aEuro parts per thousand= 210 days) spiders reached comparable adult sizes through shorter development. While males and females had comparable instar numbers, females had longer development, higher growth ratios, adult sizes and mass; and while males adjusted their moulting to food availability, female moulting depended on specific mass, not food treatment. We discussed the patterns of Nuctenea sex-specific development and compared our results with published data on two other Holarctic urban colonizers (Larinioides sclopetarius, Zygiella x-notata) exhibiting high plasticity and fast generation turn-over. We conclude that despite relatively unconstrained developmental time in the laboratory enabling Nuctenea to achieve maximal mass and size-main female fitness proxies-their relatively fixed growth ratio and long generation turn-over may explain their lower success in urban environments.

AB  - The altitudinal gradient in diversity of dung beetles (Scarabaeidae) was studied in a Mediterranean mountain chain located in Central Anatolia to (i) determine if there are altitudinal differences between the main taxonomic groups, (ii) describe the seasonal variations in these assemblages and (iii) assess whether closed habitats influence dung beetle diversity differentially at different altitudes. Beetles were collected throughout a year at 14 localities between 469 and 1810 m above sea level in three different types of habitats. Dung beetle assemblages at 400 to 1200 m did not vary greatly in species richness, abundance and biomass. However, they varied in composition, with the assemblages dominated by species of Scarabaeinae up to 900 m, whereas in the mid-mountain assemblages (from 900 m to 1600 m) the numbers of species of Aphodiinae was higher. The decline with increase in altitude in richness, abundance and biomass of both small and large species of Scarabaeinae up to 1500 m, together with the constancy of these parameters in the case of Aphodiinae, accounts for the changes in the composition from the lowland to mid-mountain localities. Unlike at other Mediterranean localities, the open/closed structure of the habitat only slightly influences these assemblages independently of altitude or season. The general seasonal pattern follows the classical Mediterranean bimodal pattern associated with summer drought, but the patterns are more complex when the seasonal responses of the different groups and at different localities are analysed separately. We propose that the interplay between local climatic conditions (mainly temperature) and evolutionary conserved species preferences accounts for both the current seasonal and altitudinal gradients and the changes in species composition in terms of Aphodiinae and Scarabaeinae.

AB  - Trait specialization often comes at the expense of original trait function, potentially causing evolutionary tradeoffs that may render specialist populations vulnerable to extinction. However, many specialized adaptations evolve repeatedly, suggesting selection favors specialization in specific environments. Some garter snake (Thamnophis) populations possess specialized mutations in voltage-gated sodium channels that allow them to consume Pacific newts (Taricha) defended by a highly potent neurotoxin (tetrodotoxin). These mutations, however, also decrease protein and muscle function, suggesting garter snakes may suffer evolutionary tradeoffs. We measured a key physiological process, standard metabolic rate (SMR), to investigate whether specialized adaptations in toxin-resistant garter snakes affect baseline energy expenditure. In snakes, skeletal muscles influence metabolism and power ventilation, so inefficiencies of sodium channels in these muscles might impact whole-animal energy expenditure. Further, because sodium channels are membrane-bound proteins, inefficiencies of channel kinetics and performance might be exacerbated at suboptimal temperatures. We measured SMR in 2 species, Thamnophis atratus and Thamnophis sirtalis, that independently evolved tetrodotoxin resistance through unique mutations, providing replicate experiments with distinct underlying genetics and potential physiological costs. Despite our expectations, neither resistance phenotype nor sodium channel genotype affected metabolism and resistant snakes did not perform worse under suboptimal body temperature. Instead, T. atratus and T. sirtalis show nearly identical rates of mass-adjusted energy expenditure at both temperatures, despite differing eco-morphologies, life histories, and distant phylogenetic positions. These findings suggest SMR may be a conserved feature of Thamnophis, and that any organismal tradeoffs may be compensated to retain whole-animal function.

AB  - Ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management (EAFMs) have emerged as requisite for sustainable use of fisheries resources. At the same time, however, there is a growing recognition of the degree of variation among individuals within a population, as well as the ecological consequences of this variation. Managing resources at an ecosystem level calls on practitioners to consider evolutionary processes, and ample evidence from the realm of fisheries science indicates that anthropogenic disturbance can drive changes in predominant character traits (e.g. size at maturity). Eco-evolutionary theory suggests that human-induced trait change and the modification of selective regimens might contribute to ecosystem dynamics at a similar magnitude to species extirpation, extinction and ecological dysfunction. Given the dynamic interaction between fisheries and target species via harvest and subsequent ecosystem consequences, we argue that individual diversity in genetic, physiological and behavioural traits are important considerations under EAFMs. Here, we examine the role of individual variation in a number of contexts relevant to fisheries management, including the potential ecological effects of rapid trait change. Using select examples, we highlight the extent of phenotypic diversity of individuals, as well as the ecological constraints on such diversity. We conclude that individual phenotypic diversity is a complex phenomenon that needs to be considered in EAFMs, with the ultimate realization that maintaining or increasing individual trait diversity may afford not only species, but also entire ecosystems, with enhanced resilience to environmental perturbations. Put simply, individuals are the foundation from which population-and ecosystem-level traits emerge and are therefore of central importance for the ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management.

AB  - Wafer Level Chip Scale Packaging (WLCSP) designs, including Wafer Level Fan-Out (WLFO) technologies, are gaining more and more applications for next generation small and thin devices. Since the WLCSP and WLFO packages are mounted directly on the motherboard without a substrate as a buffer, the large coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between the silicon die and the motherboard makes the temperature cycle board level reliability (BLR) of WLCSP and WLFO a tremendous challenge, especially for large body sizes. Currently, a tin (Sn)-silver (Ag)-copper (Cu) solder alloy such as SAC405 is commonly used in WLCSP and WLFO designs, but it has difficulty meeting the board level reliability when the footprint exceeds a certain size. As a result, a new type of solder alloy, SACQ, has been developed in recent years to enhance BLR performance. However, there is little published reliability data of how this new SACQ solder performed in actual package applications. There is also lack of a BLR life prediction model for SACQ solder, unlike the other typical eutectic or leadfree solders. In this paper, the board level temperature cycle reliability of SACQ solder is tested with various WLCSP and WLFO packages configurations. The failure modes associated with SACQ solder are evaluated in detail as well. The temperature cycle performance of SACQ solder is also compared to SAC405 solder, and shows significant improvement consistently over all the packages tested. In addition to the empirical study, a BLR life prediction model for SACQ is also developed based on finite element model (FEM). The required SACQ creep material properties, finite element model setup, damage indicator selection, and life prediction model correlation are all described with details in the paper.

AB  - 1. The temperature-size rule (TSR) is a widespread phenomenon, which describes the phenotypic plastic response of species size to temperature: individuals reared at colder temperatures mature as larger adults than at warmer temperatures.
   2. The TSR is driven by an unequal thermal response of growth and development rates. However, we currently lack an understanding of how these rates change through ontogeny and their decoupling. Further, we do not know how this decoupling varies across generations.
   3. Using the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana as a model, we examine growth and development rates through ontogeny at different temperatures across two generations.
   4. The slopes of natural-logged weight-specific growth rates against temperature are steeper in earlier than later larval stages, indicating their greater temperature dependence, whereas development rates maintain the same temperature dependence across life stages. An inverse TSR is generated in early larval stages; the typical TSR (smaller size at warmer temperatures) is only established later in ontogeny.
   5. Phase-specific temperature dependence of growth and development rates is not significantly different across the 1st and 2nd generation, suggesting the TSR is primarily a within-generation outcome.
   6. Ontogenetic size responses in Artemia are compared to other crustacean species to identify patterns within this subphylum. Data for a range of crustaceans follow the same ontogenetic pattern: early larval stages show an inverse or no TSR, with TSR being only established in later stages. Adults often, but not always, show the greatest response.

AB  - Thermal ecology and mate competition are both pervasive features of ecological adaptation. A surge of recent work has uncovered the diversity of ways in which temperature affects mating interactions and sexual selection. However, the potential for thermal biology and reproductive ecology to evolve together as organisms adapt to their thermal environment has been underappreciated. Here, we develop a series of hypotheses regarding (1) not only how thermal ecology affects mating system dynamics, but also how mating dynamics can generate selection on thermal traits; and (2) how the thermal consequences of mate competition favour the reciprocal co-adaptation of thermal biology and sexual traits. We discuss our hypotheses in the context of both pre-copulatory and post-copulatory processes. We also call for future work integrating experimental and phylogenetic comparative approaches to understand evolutionary feedbacks between thermal ecology and sexual selection. Overall, studying reciprocal feedbacks between thermal ecology and sexual selection may be necessary to understand how organisms have adapted to the environments of the past and could persist in the environments of the future.

TI  - Characterization of Fine-Pitch Solder Bump Joint and Package Warpage for Low K High-Pin-Count Flip-Chip BGA through Shadow Moire and Micro Moire Techniques
T2  - 2011 IEEE 61ST ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE (ECTC)
LA  - English
CP  - IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)
AB  - Flip chip-substrate interconnect joint reliability using either leaded, lead-free solder bumps or more recent Cu pillar, has been well recognized since the first flip chip package was developed and started volume production. Recently the relative displacement between the bump and bump pad, induced by package warpage, has received significantly increasing interest, especially for those devices with low K dielectric and fine-pitch interconnects (solder bump, eutectic tin-lead, lead free or Cu pillar), as the pitch becomes smaller and the package body size becomes larger. In order to quantitatively characterize the physical relation between package micron-level warpage and solder bump nano-level displacement, a systematic study of warpage characteristics of 1112-ball flip-chip BGA with and without a heat spreader was carried out in this study, using both Shadow Moire technique and Micro Moire interferometry. Shadow Moire technique was used to characterize the overall package warpage between room temperature and solder ball reflow temperature of 230 degrees C. Micro Moire interferometry was carried out at temperature range from room temperature to 114 degrees C. Effects of a heat spreader on the total package warpage were characterized through Shadow Moire measurement which clearly showed it is effective to alter the warpage pattern of a package from convex(w/o) to concave(w/), while the package warpage of both types of packages were well-controlled under 16um. Furthermore, the correlation between Shadow Moire and Micro Moire is also described in this study. A close correlation between two interferometry results is established. This study develops a very useful physical method enables a direct and quantitative estimation of solder bump displacement in terms of package-level warpage. Results can be used to evaluate chip-level interconnect reliability, packaging design and materials selection, particularly, for the next generation of Si nodes and the implementation of new low-K dielectric.

AB  - Respiration, ammonium and phosphate excretions and phytoplankton consumption of mesozooplankton were examined biweekly in a coastal area of the eastern Mediterranean from January 1989 to January 1990. Taking into account the ambient temperature, the metabolic rates estimated (4 to 31.2 mu l O-2 mg(-1) dw h(-1), 0.4 to 3.5 mu g NH4-N mg(-1) dw h(-1) and 0.1 to 0.6 mu g PO4-P mg(-1) dw h(-1)) were lower than those reported for the western Mediterranean, which might be related to the higher oligotrophy in the eastern Mediterranean. Maxima for these metabolic rates and that for zooplankton community respiration (7 mg O-2 m(-3) d(-1)) were all observed during the period of higher temperatures; some degree of acclimation was also inferred and this may be attributed to the high abundance of cladocerans in the summer. Simple and multiple regression models, the latter based on stepwise variable selection, suggested that temperature was the most significant variable affecting zooplankton metabolism. Body weight and population composition were also important variables. Feeding activity, sometimes showing an increase with food concentration, seemed to increase metabolic rate, but temperature may mask this effect. The low O:N ratio indicated a protein-oriented metabolism. Furthermore, the O:N, N:P and O:P fluctuations indicated a dissimilarity in zooplankton dietary pattern, probably due to the low phytoplankton levels and differing exploitation of other supplementary food sources. The results stress the importance of temperature, rather than food or other factors, for zooplankton metabolism in coastal areas of the oligotrophic eastern Mediterranean, which during summer is comparable to oligotrophic tropical seas.

AB  - The goal of this symposium paper was to identify and quantify developmental plasticity in the onset of cardiovascular responses in the zebrafish. Developmental plasticity was induced by altering the developmental environment in one of three ways: (1) by developing zebrafish in a constant current of 5 body lengths per second, (2) by developing zebrafish at a colder temperature (20 degrees C), and (3) by developing zebrafish in severe hypoxia (DO=0.8 mg/L). Early morphological development was significantly affected by each of the treatment environments with hypoxia slowing development the most and producing the highest variation in measurements. Development in constant water current did not significantly affect the timing onset of cardiovascular responses to the pharmacological agents applied. Development at 20 degrees C significantly delayed the onset of all cardiovascular responses measured by 2-3 days. Development in hypoxia, however, not only delayed onset of all cardiovascular responses, but also shifted the onset relative to the developmental program. Hypoxia clearly has a profound affect on the onset of cardiovascular regulation and it will take many more studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which hypoxia is having its effect. Furthermore, long term studies are also needed to assess whether the plasticity measured in this study is adaptive in the evolutionary sense. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Females of many insects possess an ovipositor, which in crickets is usually used to place eggs deep into the soil. Ovipositor length in female striped ground crickets (Allonemobius socius) increased at higher latitudes and altitudes in North America, despite an opposing trend in overall body size. Crickets inhabiting regions with short growing seasons and long, cold winters invariably had longer ovipositors than crickets inhabiting warmer regions. The only exception to this observation was for first generation crickets in bivoltine populations where there was no pattern of geographic variation in ovipositor length. However, second generation females from these same populations always had longer ovipositors than their first generation ancestors, and followed a pattern of geographic variation similar to that found for univoltine crickets. Overall, these results support Masaki's (1986) model, which predicts that longer ovipositors will evolve in northern cricket populations as an evolutionary response to the selective advantages of overwintering eggs being oviposited deep in the soil in cold habitats.
   In order to determine the mechanisms underlying patterns of phenotypic variation in the wild, and to test the hypothesis that interpopulation variation reflects genetic differentiation while intergeneration variation within a population reflects environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity, crickets from eight populations were brought to the laboratory and reared through three generations in a common garden. It was found that laboratory-reared populations varied significantly in ovipositor length, with the pattern of variation mimicking that found for field-collected crickets. This finding supports the hypothesis that geographic variation in the wild has a significant genetic basis. The influence of environment on ovipositor length was examined in 20 full-sib families from a bivoltine population. Crickets reared in ''autumn-like'' conditions (30 degrees C, 15:9 h, L:D), such as might be experienced by second generation bivoltine crickets in the wild, were generally larger and had significantly longer ovipositors than siblings reared under ''spring-like'' conditions (27 degrees C, 11:13 h, L:D). This pattern corresponds to that observed for bivoltine populations in the wild and suggests the importance of environmental cues for phenotypic plasticity, or polyphenism in ovipositor length in bivoltine populations of this cricket.

AB  - Toxicity studies on freshwater organisms are commonly conducted by quantifying effects on asexual (clonal) reproductive rates in Daphnia, whereas studies of effects on sexual reproductive rates remain relatively rare. Sexual reproduction in Daphnia and the associated production of resting eggs allows them to survive unfavorable environmental conditions and is thus a crucial component of their long-term fitness. It also maintains genetic diversity within Daphnia populations and hence their potential for adaptation to new environmental conditions. This aspect of their biology may therefore be important to consider in toxicity studies. The aim of this study was to investigate for the first time how mercury (Hg) affects sexual versus asexual reproduction in Daphnia under varying environmental conditions. Specifically, we experimentally tested the interactive effects of Hg and temperature on the population dynamics of Daphnia magna. For this purpose, we exposed D. magna to environmentally relevant concentrations (0 mu g/L, 0.5 mu g/L and 2 mu g/L) of Hg (in the form of mercury (II) chloride) found in stream water and measured biomass growth rate resulting from asexual reproduction, and resting egg production resulting from sexual reproduction. This was done at both 17 degrees C and 24 degrees C. Biomass growth rate did not vary across Hg treatments and depended mainly on temperature and population density. Density dependence of biomass growth rate was indeed more pronounced at 24 degrees C than at 17 degrees C, as resource limitation from intraspecific competition was further exacerbated by the rise in feeding rates with temperature. Density dependence of resting egg production was unaffected by Hg and temperature, but resting egg production was higher under Hg exposure at low temperature. These findings show that depending on environmental conditions, rates of sexual reproduction in D. magna may respond to metal exposure at lower concentrations than those impacting population growth during the asexual phase.

AB  - Because fitness of ectotherms, including reptiles, is highly dependent on temperature and water availability, the study of ecophysiological traits, such as preferred temperature (T-p) and water loss rates (WLRs), may provide mechanistic evidence on the restricting factors to the species ranges. The Moorish gecko, Tarentola mauritanica, is a species complex with a circum-Mediterranean distribution. In the Iberian Peninsula, two sister parapatric forms of the complex, known as the Iberian and the European clades, are found. Ecological models previously performed using presence records and bioclimatic variables suggest niche divergence between both lineages correlated with precipitation rather than with temperature. In this study, we test this correlative hypothesis using ecophysiological evidence. In the laboratory, we analyzed the T-p and WLRs for 84 adult males from seven distinct populations ascribed to one of the two lineages present in Iberia. Specifically, we evaluated the existence of trait conservatism versus adaptation among populations, lineages, or both. In addition, we tested for a trade-off between water and thermal traits and assessed whether climate regime of sampling localities had any influence on the ecophysiological patterns found. We found that T-p is quite conserved at both the population and lineage levels and independent from body size. In contrast, water loss experiments revealed some variation among populations, but the regression analysis failed to detect correlation between T-p and WLR at any level. Overall, the European lineage displayed a trend for higher water loss and was more diverse among populations when compared with the Iberian lineage. The lack of correspondence between ecophysiological traits and local climatic conditions favors phylogenetic signal versus adaptation. This suggests divergent evolutionary responses to the environment, mainly acting on water ecology, in both lineages, which may account for the differences in their range expansion.

AB  - The Charnov-Bull model of differential fitness is often used to explain the evolution and maintenance of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Most tests of the model focus on morphological proxies of fitness, such as size traits, whereas early life physiological traits that are closely related to lifetime fitness might provide a framework for generalizing the Charnov-Bull model across taxa. One such trait is the strength of the early-life immune response, which is strongly linked to early-life survival and fitness. Here, we manipulated temperature, variance in temperature, and sex to test the Charnov-Bull model using a physiological trait, immune system strength, in the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina). We found no evidence of sex-specific differences in bactericidal capacity of hatchling blood, and no evidence that mean temperature influences bactericidal capacity. However, we did find that fluctuating incubation temperature (i.e. a more naturalized incubation regime) is associated with a greater bactericidal capacity compared with constant temperature incubation. We also found that egg mass, a proxy for maternal provisioning, is positively associated with bactericidal capacity. Our findings suggest that the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles is unrelated to our measure of early-life innate immunity. Our study also underlines how immune response is condition dependent in early life, and questions the biological relevance of constant temperature incubation in experimental studies on ectotherm development.

AB  - The ability of powered flight in insects facilitated their great evolutionary success allowing them to occupy various ecological niches. Beyond this primary task, wings are often involved in various premating behaviors, such as the generation of courtship songs and the initiation of mating in flight. These specific functions imply special adaptations of wing morphology, as well as sex-specific wing morphologies. Although wing morphology has been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen, 1830), a comprehensive understanding of developmental plasticity and the impact of sex on wing size and shape plasticity is missing for other Diptera. Therefore, we raised flies of the three Diptera species Drosophila melanogaster, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann, 1824) and Musca domestica (Linnaeus, 1758) at different environmental conditions and applied geometric morphometrics to analyze wing shape. Our data showed extensive interspecific differences in wing shape, as well as a clear sexual wing shape dimorphism in all three species. We revealed an impact of different rearing temperatures on wing shape in all three species, which was mostly explained by plasticity in wing size in D. melanogaster. Rearing densities had significant effects on allometric wing shape in D. melanogaster, while no obvious effects were observed for the other two species. Additionally, we did not find evidence for sex-specific response to different rearing conditions in D. melanogaster and C. capitata, while a male-specific impact of different rearing conditions was observed on non-allometric wing shape in M. domestica. Overall, our data strongly suggests that many aspects of wing morphology underly species-specific adaptations and we discuss potential developmental and functional implications of our results.

AB  - In our previous studies, inter-specific hybrid F-1 with significant heterosis in growth was produced by hybridizing the bay scallop, Argopecten irradians irradians with the Peruvian scallop, A. purpuratus. However, due to the hermaphroditic nature of the two Argopecten scallops, it is difficult to produce the hybrid seed at large scales. To efficiently utilize the genetic resources of the two scallops, this study aimed to breed a new scallop strain from the hybrids. The key step in the selection was the breeding of the F-1 generation from the hybrid cohort, most of which were both male- and female-sterile. A small cohort of F-1 with normal male- and female-fertility was produced through mass spawning of a large cohort of hybrids. The F-2-F-6 cohorts were reproduced with size- and color-selected brood stocks from the F-1-F-5 cohort, respectively. The results showed that, compared with the control bay scallop cohorts, the average shell height, average whole body weight and average adductor muscle weight were increased by 15.6%, 37.9% and 40.7% in F1, by 14.7%, 33.9% and 43.6% in F-2, by 14.1%, 33.1% and 38.4% in F-3, by 11.7%, 38.8% and 49.3% in F-4, by 12.2%, 37.9% and 53.8% in F-5, by 18.5%, 42.6% and 75% in F-6, respectively. After six generations of selection, the median lethal temperature range was expanded from 3.0-29.0 degrees C in F-1 to 0 degrees C-29.1 degrees C in F-6, suggesting that the selected strain can be reared in most waters of China, especially in Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea. Thus, through continuous selection on size and color, we have obtained a superior strain from the hybrids between the bay scallop and the Peruvian scallop, which is named 'Bohai Red'.

AB  - To determine the relative role of climatic variables (temperature and precipitation) on land snail Xerolenta obvia populations, field surveys were conducted in Poland at two sites (SW and NE) with striking differences in climatic regime during two growing seasons. In a temperate climate of Central Europe X. obvia is an annual species with the majority of snails hatching in autumn. They overwinter as juveniles, continue their growth in spring and summer, and reproduce in the following autumn. Due to the comparatively milder climate, the SW population is more plastic, some individuals can live and reproduce longer. The two variants of the growth model are presented. We found that the length of growing season and temperature were additional factors determining differences in snails' growth and population dynamics between the sites. The growth rate of X. obvia is negatively correlated with the initial size of their shells and varies among sites. These two geographically distant populations differ in terms of their shell size and morphology. The SW population is characterised by larger, dark banded shells compared to the NE one, which is dominated by snails with smaller, white shells. A pattern of decreasing body size in areas with shorter growing season may explain differences in the shell size of X. obvia. Larger shells in regions with warmer and drier environment perhaps constitute responses to selection by environmental factors.

AB  - The ability of coldwater species and populations to respond to the predicted temperature increases associated with climate change will largely depend on existing adaptive potential within and among populations. Southern inland populations of Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush are broadly characterized by two ecotypes (small and large bodied) which differ in their trophic ecology, life history traits, and body size. Using common-garden experiments, we investigated population-specific differences in thermal performance (growth, temperature tolerance, and temperature preference) and whether the differences were consistent between ecotypes. We further explored the role of acclimation temperature on growth and thermal performance in two representative ecotypic populations. The evidence from this study indicated that the differences were population specific rather than ecotype specific. A strong inverse relationship between early growth rate and temperature preference suggests that the differences in early growth among Lake Trout populations are driven by adaptive variation in temperature preference. Acclimation temperature had a greater effect than source population on growth and temperature tolerance, although both significantly influenced temperature preferences. Small-bodied ecotypes were less tolerant of elevated temperatures and exhibited less within-population variation, potentially indicating their greater vulnerability to changing ecological conditions under climate change scenarios.

AB  - Insect migration redistributes enormous quantities of biomass, nutrients and species globally. A subset of insect migrants perform extreme long-distance journeys, requiring specialized morphological, physiological and behavioral adaptations. The migratory globe skimmer dragonfly (Pantala flavescens) is hypothesized to migrate from India across the Indian Ocean to East Africa in the autumn, with a subsequent generation thought to return to India from East Africa the following spring. Using an energetic flight model and wind trajectory analysis, we evaluate the dynamics of this proposed transoceanic migration, which is considered to be the longest regular non-stop migratory flight when accounting for body size. The energetic flight model suggests that a mixed strategy of gliding and active flapping would allow a globe skimmer to stay airborne for up to 230-286 h, assuming that the metabolic rate of gliding flight is close to that of resting. If engaged in continuous active flapping flight only, the flight time is severely reduced to similar to 4 h. Relying only on self-powered flight (combining active flapping and gliding), a globe skimmer could cross the Indian Ocean, but the migration would have to occur where the ocean crossing is shortest, at an exceptionally fast gliding speed and with little headwind. Consequently, we deem this scenario unlikely and suggest that wind assistance is essential for the crossing. The wind trajectory analysis reveals intra- and inter-seasonal differences in availability of favorable tailwinds, with only 15.2% of simulated migration trajectories successfully reaching land in autumn but 40.9% in spring, taking on average 127 and 55 h respectively. Thus, there is a pronounced requirement on dragonflies to be able to select favorable winds, especially in autumn. In conclusion, a multi-generational, migratory circuit of the Indian Ocean by the globe skimmer is shown to be achievable, provided that advanced adaptations in physiological endurance, behavior and wind selection ability are present. Given that migration over the Indian Ocean would be heavily dependent on the assistance of favorable winds, occurring during a relatively narrow time window, the proposed flyway is potentially susceptible to disruption, if wind system patterns were to be affected by climatic change.

AB  - AimA focal task for invasion biology is to identify the environmental variables and biological traits that set and underpin realised and potential habitats of invasive species. Ecophysiology provides powerful empirical knowledge that connects theory with natural phenomena and may improve the accuracy of species distribution modelling. We used the introduced Kamchatka red king crab Paralithodes camtschaticus of the Barents Sea as a prime case to show how thermal behaviour may drive the spreading of a marine invader in context of ocean warming. Finally, we discuss the conceivable consequences for a poleward spread of invasive top predators on native marine biota, conservation and management policies.
   LocationBarents Sea, Euro-Arctic shelves, Northeast Atlantic.
   MethodsWe used novel and non-manipulative tests which allowed adult red king crab to freely select and monitor ambient temperature in situ across a<1-14 degrees C gradient by means of a temperature data storage tag attached to the carapace.
   ResultsAdult red king crab, irrespective of body size, maturation stage and nutritional state, (1) displays clear behavioural thermoregulation in a hetero-thermal environment and, (2) conclusively selects temperatures in the coldest end of a gradient and avoids temperatures >4 degrees C. The final thermal preferendum matches completely present day Arctic shelf temperatures north and east in the Barents Sea.
   Main conclusionsThis is the first published study on the thermal behaviour of a marine invasive top predator. Our tests and the concurrent realised habitat north-east of Kola Peninsula suggest that the introduced red king crab is capable of invading the Euro-Arctic shelves in less than three decades. We argue that current management practices of the introduced red king crab compromise Arctic biodiversity and conservation and, to counteract further spreading, we recommend free fisheries on this species across its entire distributional area in the Northeast Atlantic.

AB  - Context. The composition of a protoplanetary disk at a given location does not only depend on temperature and pressure but also on the time dependent transport of matter, such as radial drift of solid bodies, which could release water and other volatile species before disintegration or accretion onto a larger body with potentially considerable implications for the composition of planets.
   Aims. We performed a parameter study focused on the water depletion of different sized bodies able to cross the water snowline by gas-induced radial drift.
   Methods. Either the analytical Hertz-Knudsen-Langmuir sublimation formula assuming equilibrium temperature within the body or a more involved, numerical model for the internal thermal evolution was coupled with an a-disk model. Different properties of the disk and the embedded body were explored.
   Results. Bodies with radii up to 100 m drift faster toward the central star than the water snowline, and can therefore cross it. The region that can be reached before complete disintegration - and is therefore polluted with H2O ice - extends to 10% closer to the star than the snowline location. The extent of this polluted region could be multiple times larger in the presence of a dust mantle, which is, however, unlikely to form due to frequent collisions with objects smaller than a centimeter.
   Conclusions. Given a significant abundance of meter-sized boulders in protoplanetary disks, the transport of water by radial drift of these bodies toward regions closer to the star than the snowline is not negligible and this flux of volatiles can be estimated for a given distribution of solid body sizes and compositions. A simple expression for surface sublimation is applicable for a homogeneous body consisting of only dust and water ice without a dust mantle.

AB  - A conceptual approach to study spatial movements of fish using an individual-based neural network genetic algorithm model is presented. Artificial neural networks, where the weights are adapted using a genetic algorithm, are applied to evolve individual movement behaviour in a spatially heterogeneous and seasonal environment. A 2D physical model (for the Barents Sea) creates monthly temperature fields, which again are used to calculate zooplankton production and predation pressure. Daily fish movement is controlled by reactive or predictive mechanisms. Reactive movement governs search for local optimal habitats, whereas predictive control enables adaptation to seasonal changes. Levels of growth and predation pressure at the time of decision are used to assess whether to apply reactive or predictive movement control. To make the model realistic on a large scale, each of the individuals are scaled up to represent a clone of one million siblings acting and growing synchronously. The fish lives for up to two years, and may reproduce in its second year. In order to spawn it has to be at the designated spawning area in the south-western part of the lattice in January. During spawning it produces a number of offspring in proportion to its body size. The "genetic constitution" of offspring (the weights of the synapses in the neural networks) is a mix of their "mother's" and a randomly picked member of the population.
   The model is able to solve the problem of navigating in a heterogeneous and seasonal environment. The movement of the artificial fish follows a seasonal pattern, typical for migrating pelagic fish stocks. During summer and autumn the distribution is widespread whereas during spring it is more concentrated. When trophic feedback is removed (i.e. zooplankton survival is independent of fish predation) the distribution of the fish is less dispersed which shows that the model allows for density dependent behaviour. Large-scale migration is an interplay between reactive and predictive movement control and when only one of these is allowed, the individuals are unable to adapt properly. Throughout most of its life the fish relies heavily on reactive movement, but during the spawning migration predictive movement control is applied almost exclusively. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This report investigates female sizes, egg sizes and egg hatching rates in relation to temperature for the near-shore calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa cultured at 6, 9, 14 and 24 degrees C for several generations to achieve acclimatization. Inverse size relationships of eggs and females were revealed with increasing temperature. Eggs produced at 6 degrees C were 85 +/- 4 mu m in diameter, but decreased to 80 +/- 3 mu m at 24 degrees C. Female cephalothorax length was 840 +/- 52 and 692 +/- 39 mu m at 9 and 24 degrees C, respectively. Parallel hatching experiments were performed between non-acclimatized and acclimatized cultures across a range of temperatures reflecting natural conditions in Danish waters. A greater fraction of eggs enter quiescence as temperature declines. Eggs were able to hatch at temperatures as low as 1.5 degrees C. Final egg hatching success increased with temperature. Acclimatization of the copepods resulted in a lower maximum hatching rate, but a higher final hatching success at 9 and 6 degrees C compared with egg hatching from non-acclimatized copepods. Eggs develop significantly better at low temperatures when compared with females in culture. This adaptation suggests that the observed annual population fluctuations in, for example, Danish waters can be explained as follows: the population of copepods in the pelagic virtually die out during the autumn-winter months; the population the following year emerges from resting eggs from the sediment and is produced by the pelagic copepods the previous year(s).

AB  - Species that span large latitudinal gradients face strong differences in voltinism and in winter conditions within their range. Latitudinal gradients in winter survival and especially their underlying mechanisms and association with voltinism patterns are poorly studied. We tested in the damselfly Enallagma cyathigerum whether high-latitude populations were better in dealing with the longer winters compared to central- and low-latitude populations and whether this was associated with changes in voltinism. We thereby evaluated whether higher initial levels and/or lower reductions during winter of energy storage (measured as fat content) and investment in immune function [measured as the activity of phenoloxidase (PO)], and/or stronger compensatory responses in food intake contributed to the higher winter survival in high-latitude populations. To this end, we simulated a long high-latitude winter at 4 A degrees C under manipulated food conditions. Across food levels, winter survival was highest in Swedish larvae, intermediate in Belgian larvae, and lowest in Spanish larvae, indicating latitude-specific thermal adaptation that could be partly linked to differences in voltinism. The semi-voltine Swedish larvae were growing slower before winter and as a result accumulated the highest fat content and PO activity when the winter started compared to the univoltine, faster growing Belgian, and Spanish larvae. Fat content and PO activity declined during the winter, yet equally across latitudes, and were not buffered by compensatory food intake. Our data identified possible underlying physiological mechanisms of winter survival and support the hypothesis that widespread latitude-associated voltinism shifts may be a selective factor contributing to latitudinal shifts in winter survival.

AB  - Polyphenism, the expression of discrete alternative phenotypes, is often a consequence of a developmental switch. Physiological changes induced by a developmental switch potentially affect reaction norms, but the evolution and existence of alternative reaction norms remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that, in the butterfly Pieris napi (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), thermal reaction norms of several life history traits vary adaptively among switch-induced alternative developmental pathways of diapause and direct development. The switch was affected both by photoperiod and temperature, ambient temperature during late development having the potential to override earlier photoperiodic cues. Directly developing larvae had higher development and growth rates than diapausing ones across the studied thermal gradient. Reaction norm shapes also differed between the alternative developmental pathways, indicating pathway-specific selection on thermal sensitivity. Relative mass increments decreased linearly with increasing temperature and were higher under direct development than diapause. Contrary to predictions, population phenology did not explain trait variation or thermal sensitivity, but our experimental design probably lacks power for finding subtle phenology effects. We demonstrate adaptive differentiation in thermal reaction norms among alternative phenotypes, and suggest that the consequences of an environmentally dependent developmental switch primarily drive the evolution of alternative thermal reaction norms in P. napi.

AB  - Caprella mutica (Amphipoda) has been successfully reared through several generations per year for public exhibition in a tank of 500 L, more than five year after introduction of the species into the Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium, Japan. The tank was equipped with a coral sand bed filter, a circulation system, and a heater/chiller unit. Artificial seawater (Reef Crystals) was used as a medium. The diatom Phaeodactylum and hatched juveniles of Artemia were provided as food for C. mutica. Two years after the introduction, the sex ratio (females/(females + males)) was 0.50. Males reached body lengths up to 20.5 rum, while the largest female was 10.4 mm long. The average number of embryos/female was 33.0. Embryos were 0.38 to 0.41 mm in the long axis, and 0.30 to 0.33 mm in the short axis. These reproductive characters enable the production of multiple generations in a single year.

AB  - Background: Temperature is a major determinant of spontaneous mutation, but the precise mode, and the underlying mechanisms, of the temperature influences remain less clear. Here we used a mutation accumulation approach combined with whole-genome sequencing to investigate the temperature dependence of spontaneous mutation in an Escherichia coli strain. Experiments were performed under aerobic conditions at 25, 28 and 37 degrees C, three temperatures that were non-stressful for the bacterium but caused significantly different bacterial growth rates.
   Results: Mutation rate did not differ between 25 and 28 degrees C, but was higher at 37 degrees C. Detailed analyses of the molecular spectrum of mutations were performed; and a particularly interesting finding is that higher temperature led to a bias of mutation to coding, relative to noncoding, DNA. Furthermore, the temperature response of mutation rate was extremely similar to that of metabolic rate, consistent with an idea that metabolic rate predicts mutation rate.
   Conclusions: Temperature affects mutation rate and the types of mutation supply, both being crucial for the opportunity of natural selection. Our results help understand how temperature drives evolutionary speed of organisms and thus the global patterns of biodiversity. This study also lend support to the metabolic theory of ecology for linking metabolic rate and molecular evolution rate.

Leptin receptors have been detected in the pancreas and experimental studies have shown that leptin protects the pancreas against the damage induced by caerulein overstimulation. Heat shock proteins (HSP) are endogenous proteins produced by various cells exposed to high temperature or to the noxious agents. HSP protect the cells against various environmental and endogenous stressors. The implication of HSP60 in the leptin-induced pancreatic protection has not been examined yet. The aim of this study was: to investigate the changes of HSP60 mRNA signal in the pancreatic AR42J cells subjected to caerulein and leptin. AR42J cells were incubated in standart medium at 37 degrees C for: 0, 1, 3, 5, 12 or 24 h, under basal conditions. Incubation time of 3 h was selected for the next experiments. AR42J cells were incubated in presence of caerulein (10(-11), 10(-9) or 10(-7)M), leptin (10(-8) or 10(-6)M), or combination of above. Gene expression for HSP60 was determined by RT-PCR. The mRNA signal for HSP60 has been observed in AR42J pancreatic cells under basal conditions. Incubation of AR42J cells in presence of leptin (10(-8) or 10-(6)(M)) resulted in the significant increase of gene expression for HSP60 in both groups of AR42J cells. Caerulein stimulation reduced mRNA signal for HSP60. The strongest mRNA signal for HSP60 has been observed after the exposition of AR42J cells to combination of leptin and caerulein. We conclude that: 1. Gene expression for HSP60 has been detected in pancreatic AR42J cells under basal conditions. 2. HSP60 gene expression was significantly increased in pancreatic AR42J cells stimulated by leptin whereas caerulein reduced this signal. 3. The strongest gene expression for HSP60 has been detected in the cells incubated with combination of caerulein and leptin.

AB  - The highly permeable integument of amphibians renders them vulnerable to chemical characteristics of their environment, especially during the aquatic larval stage. As the cane toad (Rhinella marina, Bufonidae) invades southwards along the east coast of Australia, it is encountering waterbodies with highly variable conditions of temperature, pH, and salinity. Understanding the tolerance of toads to these conditions can clarify the likely further spread of the invader, as well as the adaptability of the species to novel environmental challenges. We measured salinity in waterbodies in the field and conducted laboratory trials to investigate the impacts of salinity on toad viability. Eggs and tadpoles from the southern invasion front tolerated the most saline conditions we found in potential spawning ponds during surveys [equivalent to 1200 ppm (3.5 % the salinity of seawater)]. Indeed, high-salinity treatments increased tadpole body sizes, accelerated metamorphosis, and improved locomotor ability of metamorphs (but did not affect metamorph morphology). At very low salinity [40 ppm (0.1 % seawater)], eggs hatched but larvae did not develop past Gosner stage 37. Our study shows that the egg and larval life stages of cane toads can tolerate wide variation in the salinity of natal ponds and that this aspect of waterbody chemistry is likely to facilitate rather than constrain continued southward expansion of the toad invasion front in eastern Australia.

AB  - Peripheral populations occupy the edge of a species' range and may exhibit adaptations to potentially "harsher" marginal environments compared with core populations. The peripheral population of Spotted Gar Lepisosteus oculatus in the Great Lakes basin represents the northern edge of the species' range and is completely disjunct from the core Mississippi River basin population. Age-0 Spotted Gars from the peripheral population experience a growing season approximately half that of the core population but reach similar sizes by winter, suggesting potential for countergradient variation in growth, i.e. an evolutionary response to an environmental gradient such as latitude to compensate for the usual phenotypic effect of that gradient. In this study we used two common garden experiments to investigate potential countergradient variation in growth of young-of-year Spotted Gars from peripheral populations in comparison with those from core populations. Our first experiment showed that in a common environment under temperatures within the first growing season (22-24 degrees C), Spotted Gars from the peripheral population had significantly higher growth rates than those from the core population. Final Spotted Gar weight-length ratio was also higher in the peripheral versus core population. In our second experiment, under three temperature treatments (16, 23, and 30 degrees C), maximum growth occurred at the highest temperature, whereas growth ceased at the lowest temperature for both populations. These results suggest that important genetic and physiological differences could exist between the two population groups, consistent with countergradient variation. Our findings indicate that countergradient growth variation can occur even in relatively slowly evolving fishes, such as gars (family Lepisosteidae), and that protection of peripheral populations should be a key component of fish conservation planning.

AB  - Costs of resistance are expected to contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation for resistance in natural host populations. In the present study, we experimentally test for genetic trade-offs between parasite resistance and larval competitive ability expressed under varying levels of crowding and temperature. Artificial selection for increased behavioral resistance was applied against an ectoparasitic mite (Macrocheles subbadius) in replicate lines of the fruit fly Drosophila nigrospiracula. We then measured correlated responses to selection in larval competitive ability by contrasting replicate selected and control (unselected) lines in the absence of parasitism. Experiments were conducted under variable environmental conditions: two temperatures and three levels of larval density. Our results reveal a negative genetic correlation between resistance and larval-adult survival under conditions of moderate and severe intra- specific competition. At both low and high temperature, percent emergence was significantly higher among control lines than selected lines. This divergence in larval competitive ability was magnified under high levels of competition, but only at low temperature. Hence, the interaction between selection treatment and larval density was modified by temperature. As predicted, larvae experiencing medium and high levels of competition exhibited an overall reduction in female body size compared to larvae at low levels of competition. Female flies emerging from selected lines were significantly smaller than those females from control lines, but this effect was only significant under conditions of moderate to severe competition. These results provide evidence of environment-dependent trade-offs between ectoparasite resistance and larval competitive ability, a potential mechanism maintaining genetic polymorphism for resistance.

AB  - Aedes aegypti, a mosquito closely associated with humans, is the principal vector of dengue virus which currently infects about 400 million people worldwide. Because there is no way to prevent infection, public health policies focus on vector control; but insecticide-resistance threatens them. However, most insecticide-resistant mosquito populations exhibit fitness costs in absence of insecticides, although these costs vary. Research on components of fitness that vary with insecticide-resistance can help to develop policies for effective integrated management and control. We investigated the relationships in wing size, wing shape, and natural resistance levels to lambda-cyhalothrin of nine field isolates. Also we chose one of these isolates to select in lab for resistance to the insecticide. The main life-traits parameters were assessed to investigate the possible fitness cost and its association with wing size and shape. We found that wing shape, more than wing size, was strongly correlated with resistance levels to lambda-cyhalothrin in field isolates, but founder effects of culture in the laboratory seem to change wing shape (and also wing size) more easily than artificial selection for resistance to that insecticide. Moreover, significant fitness costs were observed in response to insecticide-resistance as proved by the diminished fecundity and survival of females in the selected line and the reversion to susceptibility in 20 generations of the non-selected line. As a practical consequence, we think, mosquito control programs could benefit from this knowledge in implementing efficient strategies to prevent the evolution of resistance. In particular, the knowledge of reversion to susceptibility is important because it can help in planning better strategies of insecticide use to keep useful the few insecticide-molecules currently available.

AB  - Understanding how organisms adapt to complex environments lies at the very heart of ecology and evolutionary biology. Clinal variation in traits related to fitness suggests a contribution of directional selection, and analyzing such variation has consequently become a key element in investigating adaptive evolution. In this study we examine climatic adaptation in the temperate-zone butterfly Lycaena tityrus across replicated populations from low-, (mid-) and high-altitudes, each reared at two different temperatures. In common garden experiments, high- compared to low-altitude populations showed a longer development time accompanied by reduced larval growth rates, increased cold- but decreased heat-stress resistance, and increased flight duration across a range of ambient temperatures. In contrast, differences in morphological traits such as pupal mass or wing size were negligible, suggesting that morphology is not necessarily indicative of flight performance. While patterns in stress resistance traits suggest adaptation to local temperatures, development times between populations were associated with differences in season length (enabling a second generation at lower altitudes, while high-altitude populations are monovoltine) rather than with temperature per se. Mid-altitude populations showed either intermediate patterns or patterns resembling low-altitude populations. Plastic responses to different rearing temperatures resulted, as expected, in reduced larval and pupal development times at higher temperatures accompanied by higher growth rates and decreased pupal mass. Further, butterflies reared at a lower temperature showed reduced chill-coma recovery times and decreased heat knock-down resistance as compared to those reared at a higher temperature. In summary, this study demonstrates local adaptations to regional climates, and that environmentally-induced plasticity can be as important as genetic factors in mediating adaptive responses.

AB  - Environmental variation experienced by a species across space and time can promote the maintenance of genetic diversity that may be adaptive in future global change conditions. Selection experiments have shown that purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, populations have adaptive genetic variation for surviving pH conditions at the "edge" (pH 7.5) of conditions experienced in nature. However, little is known about whether populations have genetic variation for surviving low-pH events beyond those currently experienced in nature or how variation in pH conditions affects organismal and genetic responses. Here, we quantified survival, growth, and allele frequency shifts in experimentally selected developing purple sea urchin larvae in static and variable conditions at three pH levels: pH 8.1 (control), pH 7.5 (edge-of-range), and pH 7.0 (extreme). Variable treatments recovered body size relative to static treatments, but resulted in higher mortality, suggesting a potential tradeoff between survival and growth under pH stress. However, within each pH level, allele frequency changes were overlapping between static and variable conditions, suggesting a shared genetic basis underlying survival to mean pH regardless of variability. In contrast, genetic responses to pH 7.5 (edge) versus pH 7.0 (extreme) conditions were distinct, indicating a unique genetic basis of survival. In addition, loci under selection were more likely to be in exonic regions than regulatory, indicating that selection targeted protein-coding variation. Loci under selection in variable pH 7.5 conditions, more similar to conditions periodically experienced in nature, performed functions related to lipid biosynthesis and metabolism, while loci under selection in static pH 7.0 conditions performed functions related to transmembrane and mitochondrial processes. While these results are promising in that purple sea urchin populations possess genetic variation for surviving extreme pH conditions not currently experienced in nature, they caution that increased acidification does not result in a linear response but elicits unique physiological stresses and survival mechanisms.

AB  - During direct development the butterfly Lycaena tityrus was previously found to display sex-related reaction norms in response to temperature. Based on selection for protandry in males and fecundity selection for larger females, males favoured early emergence over large size, leading to a dramatic weight loss at higher temperatures, whereas females maintained similar weights throughout, Because males were able to avoid a weight reduction relative to females in spite of their shorter development at lower temperatures, sexual size dimorphism existed at higher temperatures only. In the present paper we compare sexual differences in life-history traits in L. tityrus between direct and diapause development at 25 degreesC. We demonstrate that, regardless of developmental pathway, protandry persisted and relative sexual size dimorphism, with females being larger, remained unchanged. Although diapausing individuals were less time-constrained, allowing them to grow to considerably higher final weights in both sexes, males were not able to reduce their weight loss relative to females. This is explained by the pressure to gain a developmental advantage solely during post-diapause development, whereas direct developing males may spread the burden over the whole larval period. Our results highlight the importance of considering sexual differences in selective pressures. which may influence central life-history traits in manifold ways.

AB  - A multivariate morphometric investigation was conducted on wings of two parthenogenetic Drosophila mercatorum strains and offspring (F1) of crosses between these parthenogenetic strains with highly inbred sexual individuals of the same species. The parental flies and F1 offspring were reared at three different temperatures: 20, 25, or 28A degrees C. This design allows a comparison of completely homozygous individuals (parental generation) with identical heterozygote offspring (F1), which makes an analysis of phenotypic plasticity of morphometric traits possible, without a potentially confounding effect of genotype-environment interactions, which can increase the phenotypic variability. The same pattern of phenotypic plasticity of wing size between the homozygous parental strains and the heterozygous offspring was found in both strains with an apparent heterotic effect for wing size in the F1 at 25A degrees C. At 20 and 28A degrees C flies from the parental generation had the biggest wings. Phenotypic plasticity of shape was found to be strain dependent. A reduced level of developmental instability (DI) was found in the F1 as compared to the parental strain only in strain 1 reared at 20A degrees C for the wing size and 25A degrees C for the wing shape. For all the other treatments higher DI was found in the F1 when the difference was significant, which is suggestive of outbreeding depression. These findings are difficult to interpret since an apparent heterotic effect of size at 25A degrees C is accompanied by higher DI (though not significant in strain 2) and complex changes in wing shape. Hence, we cannot conclude whether outbreeding lowers or increases the capacity to respond to environmental change via plastic responses and via changes of the level of DI. The degree of change of phenotypic plasticity and DI is trait specific, depending on the environment and on the genotypes which are hybridizing.

AB  - The integration or coadaptation of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits is represented by whole-organism performance traits such as locomotion or bite force. Additionally, maximum sprint speed is a good indicator of whole-organism performance capacity as variation in sprinting ability can affect survival. We studied thermal biology, morphology, and locomotor performance in a clade of Liolaemus lizards that occurs in the Patagonian steppe and plateaus, a type of habitat characterized by its harsh cold climate. Liolaemus of the lineomaculatus section display a complex mixture of conservative and flexible traits. The phylogenetically informed analyses of these ten Liolaemus species show little coevolution of their thermal traits (only preferred and optimum temperatures were correlated). With regard to performance, maximum speed was positively correlated with optimum temperature. Body size and morphology influenced locomotor performance. Hindlimbs are key for maximal speed, but forelimb length was a better predictor for sustained speed (i.e. average speed over a total distance of 1.2 m). Finally, sustained speed differed among species with different diets, with herbivores running on average faster over a long distance than omnivores. J. Exp. Zool. 315:495-503, 2011.

AB  - A central question in ecology and evolution is to understand why sexual selection varies so much in strength across taxa; it has long been known that ecological factors are crucial to this. Temperature is a particularly salient abiotic ecological factor that modulates a wide range of physiological, morphological and behavioural traits, impacting individuals and populations at a global taxonomic scale. Furthermore, temperature exhibits substantial temporal variation (e.g. daily, seasonally and inter-seasonally), and hence for most species in the wild sexual selection will regularly unfold in a dynamic thermal environment. Unfortunately, studies have so far almost completely neglected the role of temperature as a modulator of sexual selection. Here, we outline the main pathways through which temperature can affect the intensity and form (i.e. mechanisms) of sexual selection,via: (i) direct effects on secondary sexual traits and preferences (i.e. trait variance, opportunity for selection and trait-fitness covariance), and (ii) indirect effects on key mating parameters, sex-specific reproductive costs/benefits, trade-offs, demography and correlated abiotic factors. Building upon this framework, we show that, by focusing exclusively on the first-order effects that environmental temperature has on traits linked with individual fitness and population viability, current global warming studies may be ignoring eco-evolutionary feedbacks mediated by sexual selection. Finally, we tested the general prediction that temperature modulates sexual selection by conducting a meta-analysis of available studies experimentally manipulating temperature and reporting effects on the variance of male/female reproductive success and/or traits under sexual selection. Our results show a clear association between temperature and sexual selection measures in both sexes. In short, we suggest that studying the feedback between temperature and sexual selection processes may be vital to developing a better understanding of variation in the strength of sexual selection in nature, and its consequences for population viability in response to environmental change (e.g. global warming).

AB  - Size and development time are universally important traits. Yet evolutionary trends in development time are often viewed as allometric and physiological by-products of initial size, when life-history theory predicts that both traits are targets of selection and evolve adaptively through opposing effects on fitness. Surprisingly, this prediction has rarely been tested by disentangling the direct and indirect effects of size and development time on fitness, as necessary to understand selection on each trait. Here, in a marine external fertiliser that provides novel scope for such tests, we measure directional, quadratic, and correlational selection acting on early size (of embryos and post-hatch larvae) and development time (from fertilisation to hatching) through survival of juveniles in the field. We find little directional selection acting on traits during this selective episode. Rather, selection is primarily correlational, targeting combinations of development time and post-development size in a way that acts against their already-weak positive correlation, and could eventually drive a negative correlation between them if persistent enough. Lack of correlational selection on combinations of embryo size and development time, in contrast, suggests that physiological or allometric constraints more likely explain their positive association. Hence, neither life-history theory nor principles of allometry and physiology alone may predict the evolution of size and development time, warranting greater appreciation of the tension between adaptive and non-adaptive explanations for evolutionary trends in these traits.

AB  - Tadpoles and adults of American toads, Bufo americanus, were forced to sprint at different body temperatures. Tadpoles sprint at 80%, or better, of their maximal sprint rate between 17 and 36 C, whereas adults achieve the same performance level over a narrower range of 21-34 C. In a laboratory thermal gradient with a wet sandy substratum, presumably well-hydrated juvenile toads preferentially select body temperatures that tend to optimize sprint performance. In a thermal gradient with a dry substratum, presumably dehydrated juvenile toads select body temperatures that minimize loss of water. In a thermal gradient with both wet and dry substrata, juvenile toads generally remain on wet substrata and select temperatures available in those wetter environments at which they can best approach maximal sprint performance. They typically avoid dry substrata that would result in dehydration, even when those environments off er temperatures conducive to better sprint performance. juvenile toads, owing to their diurnal habit and small body size, are more able than adults to regulate body temperature through behavioral selection of thermal microsites. Indeed, adult American toads in nature likely rarely achieve body temperatures necessary for optimal locomotor performance. We hypothesize that the thermal optimum for locomotion in B. americanus evolved in response to selective pressures on juveniles.

AB  - Demersal fish landings from the Firth of Clyde peaked in 1973, then declined rapidly until the targeted demersal fishery ceased in 2005. The abundance of large fish decreased during this period, and their numbers have not recovered since 2005. We aim to determine whether changing growth rates have contributed to the decline in the abundance of large fish. Bottom trawl survey data from 1980 to 2012 was used to calculate the annual mean length-at-age and time series of von Bertalanffy growth parameters of five demersal species; cod, haddock, whiting, Norway pout and saithe. Two regions were considered: the Firth of Clyde and the neighbouring seas west of Scotland (the western shelf). There have been substantial decreases in the lengths of most age groups of Clyde haddock and whiting due to declines in both asymptotic length and von Bertalanffy growth rate. Lengths-at-age have also declined in western shelf populations, but at markedly slower rates than within the Clyde. Trends in temperature and year class strength tended to contribute little to changes in the growth parameters, so declines in length-at-age have been largely due to other factors. Fishing intensity is greater in the Clyde than western shelf, and the size selectivity of the fisheries differ as more Clyde vessels use Nephrops trawling gear. Since trends in growth were also more extreme in the Clyde, it appears as though size-selective fishing may have caused reductions in the lengths of these fish. If the changes in growth are partially due to fishing induced evolution then it may take many generations for the changes to reverse. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - At the low temperatures of the overwintering environment of the frog Rana temporaria, small changes in ambient temperature have large effects on metabolism and behaviour, especially since Q(10) values are often greatly elevated in the cold. How the overwintering aquatic frog copes with variable thermal environments in terms of its overall activity metabolism and recovery from pursuit by predators is poorly understood, as is the role of behavioural thermoregulation in furthering recovery from intense activity, Exhaustive exercise was chosen as the method of evaluating activity capacity (defined by time to exhaustion, total distance swum and number of leg contractions before exhaustion) and was determined at 1.5 and 7 degrees C, Other cohorts of frogs were examined at both temperatures to determine the metabolic (acid-base, lactate, glucose, ATF and creatine phosphate) and respiratory responses to exercise in cold-submerged frogs. Finally, temperature preference before and after exercise was determined in a thermal gradient to define the importance of behavioural thermoregulation on the recovery rates of relevant metabolic and respiratory processes. Activity capacity was significantly reduced in frogs exercised at 1.5 versus 7 degrees C, although similar levels of tissue acid-base metabolites and lactate were reached, Blood pH, plasma PCO2 and lactate levels recovered more rapidly at 1.5 degrees C than at 7 degrees C; however, intracellular pH and the recovery of tissue metabolite levels were independent of temperature. Resting aerobic metabolic rates were strongly affected by temperature (Q(10)=3.82); however, rates determined immediately after exercise showed a reduced temperature sensitivity (Q(10)=1.67) and, therefore, a reduced factorial aerobic scope, Excess oxygen consumption recovered to resting values after 5-6.25 h, and 67% recovery times tended to be slightly faster at the lower temperatures, Exercise in the cold, therefore, provided an immediately higher factorial scope, which could be involved in the faster rate of recovery of blood lactate levels in the colder frogs, In addition, exercise significantly lowered the preferred temperature of the frogs from 6.7 to 3.6 degrees C for nearly 7 h, after which they returned to their normal, unstressed preferred temperatures. Thus, a transient behavioural hypothermia in the skin-breathing, overwintering frog may be an important strategy for minimising post-exercise stress and maintaining aerobic metabolism during recovery from intense activity.

AB  - We explored the extent to which a phenotypic trait (walking speed) of Drosophila melanogaster is influenced by population, developmental temperature, adult temperature, and age. Our goals were to estimate the importance of these factors and to test the beneficial acclimation hypothesis. We measured speed of flies from two populations (the Congo and France) that developed at different temperatures (18, 25, and 29 degreesC) and were tested at different temperatures (18, 25, and 29 degreesC) and ages (2, 7, 13 days). Not surprisingly, speed increased strongly with test temperature. Speed was generally greatest for flies reared at an intermediate developmental temperature, contrary to the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, which predicts that speed would be greatest when influenced by interactions involving population. For example, speed was greatest for flies from France that developed at a low temperature, but for flies from the Congo that developed at a high temperature. The impact of developmental temperature declined with age. Surprisingly, speed actually increased with age for flies raised and maintained at a low temperature, but decreased with age for flies raised and maintained at an intermediate or at a high temperature. Thus, walking performance is highly dynamic phenotypically, complicating potential attempts to predict responses to selection on performance.

AB  - Metabolic rate reflects an organism's capacity for growth, maintenance and reproduction, and is likely to be a target of selection. Physiologists have long sought to understand the causes and consequences of within-individual to among-species variation in metabolic rates - how metabolic rates relate to performance and how they should evolve. Traditionally, this has been viewed from a mechanistic perspective, relying primarily on hypothesis-driven approaches. A more agnostic, but ultimately more powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of phenotypic variation is through use of the breeder's equation, because variation in metabolic rate is likely to be a consequence of underlying microevolutionary processes. Here we show that metabolic rates are often significantly heritable, and are therefore free to evolve under selection. We note, however, that 'metabolic rate' is not a single trait: in addition to the obvious differences between metabolic levels (e.g. basal, resting, free-living, maximal), metabolic rate changes through ontogeny and in response to a range of extrinsic factors, and is therefore subject to multivariate constraint and selection. We emphasize three key advantages of studying metabolic rate within a quantitative genetics framework: its formalism, and its predictive and comparative power. We make several recommendations when applying a quantitative genetics framework: (i) measuring selection based on actual fitness, rather than proxies for fitness; (ii) considering the genetic covariances between metabolic rates throughout ontogeny; and (iii) estimating genetic covariances between metabolic rates and other traits. A quantitative genetics framework provides the means for quantifying the evolutionary potential of metabolic rate and why variance in metabolic rates within populations might be maintained.

AB  - Organisms living in extreme environments, such as amphibians inhabiting the Tibetan plateau, are faced with a magnitude of potentially strong selection pressures. With an average elevation exceeding 4500 m, the Tibetan plateau is mainly characterized by low temperatures, but little is known about the influence of this factor on the growth, development, and behaviour of amphibian larvae living in this environment. Using a common garden experiment, we studied the influence of temperatures on the early growth and development of tadpoles of the Tibetan brown frog (Rana kukunoris) endemic to the eastern Tibetan plateau. We discovered that temperature had a significant influence on early growth and development of the tadpoles, with those undergoing high-temperature treatment growing and developing faster than their siblings from a low-temperature treatment. However, high-altitude individuals grew faster than low-altitude individuals at low temperatures. while the opposite was true at high temperatures. These results support the temperature adaptation hypothesis, as tadpoles' growth and developmental rates were maximized at the temperatures experienced in their native environments. These results suggest that variation in ambient temperature. combined with evolutionary adaptation to temperature of local environments, is probably one of the most critical environmental factors shaping altitudinal differences in the growth and development of amphibian larvae on the Tibetan plateau.

AB  - Detection of coding/functional SNPs that change the biological function of a gene may lead to identification of putative causative alleles within QTL regions and discovery of genetic markers with large effects on phenotypes. This study has two-fold objectives, first to develop, and validate a 50K transcribed gene SNP-chip using RNA-Seq data. To achieve this objective, two bioinformatics pipelines, GATK and SAMtools, were used to identify similar to 21K transcribed SNPs with allelic imbalances associated with important aquaculture production traits including body weight, muscle yield, muscle fat content, shear force, and whiteness in addition to resistance/susceptibility to bacterial cold-water disease (BCWD). SNPs ere identified from pooled RNA-Seq data collected from similar to 620 fish, representing 98 families from growth- and 54 families from BCWD-selected lines with divergent phenotypes. In addition, similar to 29K transcribed SNPs without allelic-imbalances were strategically added to build a 50K Affymetrix SNP-chip. SNPs selected included two SNPs per gene from 14K genes and similar to 5K non-synonymous SNPs. The SNP-chip was used to genotype 1728 fish. The average SNP calling-rate for samples passing quality control (QC; 1,641 fish) was >= 98.5%. The second objective of this study was to test the feasibility of using the new SNP-chip in GWA (Genome-wide association) analysis to identify QTL explaining muscle yield variance. GWA study on 878 fish (representing 197 families from 2 consecutive generations) with muscle yield phenotypes and genotyped for 35K polymorphic markers (passing QC) identified several QTL regions explaining together up to 28.40% of the additive genetic variance for muscle yield in this rainbow trout population. The most significant QTLs were on chromosomes 14 and 16 with 12.71 and 10.49% of the genetic variance, respectively. Many of the annotated genes in the QTL regions were previously reported as important regulators of muscle development and cell signaling. No major QTLs were identified in a previous GWA study using a 57K genomic SNP chip on the same fish population. These results indicate improved detection power of the transcribed gene SNP-chip in the target trait and population, allowing identification of large-effect QTLs for important traits in rainbow trout.

AB  - During local adaptation with gene flow, some regions of the genome are inherently more responsive to selection than others. Recent theory predicts that X-linked genes should disproportionately contribute to local adaptation relative to other genomic regions, yet this prediction remains to be tested. We carried out a multigeneration crossing scheme, using two cline-end populations of Drosophila melanogaster, to estimate the relative contributions of the X chromosome, autosomes, and mitochondrial genome to divergence in four traits involved in local adaptation (wing size, resistance to heat, desiccation, and starvation stresses). We found that the mitochondrial genome and autosomes contributed significantly to clinal divergence in three of the four traits. In contrast, the X made no significant contribution to divergence in these traits. Given the small size of the mitochondrial genome, our results indicate that it plays a surprisingly large role in clinal adaptation. In contrast, the X, which represents roughly 20% of the Drosophila genome, contributes negligiblya pattern that conflicts with theoretical predictions. These patterns reinforce recent work implying a central role of mitochondria in climatic adaptation, and suggest that different genomic regions may play fundamentally different roles in processes of divergence with gene flow.

AB  - We modify and apply a nonlethal technique for rapidly quantifying the cold tolerance of large numbers of Drosophila and other small insects. Flies are transferred to individual vials, cooled in groups in progressive 0.5 degreesC steps, and checked for loss of righting response (chill-coma temperature [T-cc]). Flies recover quickly when transferred to ambient temperature, and thus this technique potentially can be used in selection experiments. We applied this technique in several experiments. First, we examined the sensitivity of T-cc to developmental temperature. Drosophila melanogaster (Congo, France), Drosophila subobscura (Spain, Denmark), and Drosophila ananassae (India) were reared from egg to adult at 15 degrees, 18 degrees, 25 degrees, or 29 degreesC, transferred to 15 degreesC for several days, and then progressively chilled: T-cc was positively related to developmental temperature, inversely related to latitude of the population, but independent of sex. The sensitivity of T-cc to developmental temperature (acclimation flexibility) was marked: T-cc shifted on average 1 degrees for each 4 degreesC shift in developmental temperature. Among 15 species of the obscura group of Drosophila, T-cc varied from -0.1 degrees to 4.5 degreesC; T-cc was inversely related to latitude in both nonphylogenetic and phylogenetically based ANCOVA (standardized independent contrasts) and was unrelated to body size.

AB  - Temperature is an important ecological driver modulating life history traits of organisms, such as growth and reproduction. With the ongoing global warming, understanding the mechanisms underlying the effect of temperature on size and resource allocation trade-off is crucial. The temperature-size rule (TSR) describes plastic growth patterns in populations of ectothermic species under different thermal environments, whereby warming results in faster initial growth but lower size at maturity. However, the evolution of the TSR remains poorly understood. Here we conducted an experiment with populations of the medaka fish Oryzias latipes maintained at two temperatures for successive generations to investigate changes in the growth pattern of the TSR. After rearing six generations at cold (20 degrees C) and warm (30 degrees C) temperature, we conducted common garden experiments on the seventh generation where we compare growth trajectories and reproduction patterns in four different groups of fish: (i) fish reared at cold temperature over all seven generations (cold past and present), (ii) fish reared at warm temperature over six generations and at cold temperature at the seventh generation (warm past and cold present), (iii) fish reared at warm temperature over all seven generations (warm past and present) and (iv) fish reared at cold temperature over six generations and at warm temperature at the seventh generation (cold past and warm present). For each treatment, we monitored growth curves and reproduction, and investigated changes in model parameters and reproduction up to 350 days after hatching. Our study showed changes in TSR patterns according to ancestral and developmental temperatures. Developmental temperature mainly impacted age at maturity and asymptotic size, whereas size at maturity was driven more by the dissimilarity between developmental and ancestral temperatures. Our results also highlight a loss of plasticity in temperature-size and reproductive patterns for the fish that were reared under warm condition over six generations.

AB  - Larval and age-0 sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria reside in neustonic waters of the North Pacific during spring and summer. We estimated the potential impacts of elevated surface temperatures on ecological processes of growth, conversion efficiency, and behavior in early juvenile sablefish. Growth experiments tested a wide range of temperatures from 6 to 24(degrees)C, with fish receiving ad libitum or low (3 % body weight d(-1)) rations. With unlimited food, growth increased rapidly as temperature increased to 14(degrees)C, then displayed a more gradual rise to 22 degreesC. Growth rates at the warmer temperatures were among the highest recorded for teleosts, attaining a maximum of 3.3 nun d(-1) in length and a specific growth in weight of 11.8 %. A similar response to temperature was observed at low rations, although at lower overall growth rates. At 24 degreesC, there was a severe decline in growth for both ration levels, and few fish survived the 3 wk experiments. Gross growth efficiency, measured at temperatures of 6 to 22 degreesC, displayed an interactive effect of temperature with ration level consistent with bioenergetic relationship, Conversion peaked at 16 to 20 degreesC for fish receiving ad libitum rations, and at 10 degreesC for fish on restricted rations. Conversion rates of sablefish were comparable to those calculated for a diverse array of fish species, suggesting that the rapid growth rates are driven by high consumption rather than unusually efficient energy transfer. Experiments analyzing sablefish behavior in thermally stratified water columns demonstrated increasing movement into colder water as ration level decreased, in agreement with an energy conserving strategy. Average monthly temperatures within the major nursery areas of neustonic juveniles (north of 40 degreesN) did not exceed 19 degreesC during the last 19 yr. These results suggest that juvenile sablefish are capable of tolerating and thriving at increased temperatures, with the critical caveat that sufficient food resources must be available. Thus, impacts on early life stages exerted by El Nino conditions, oceanographic regime shifts, or climate changes induced by current global warming scenarios are likely to be a consequence of indirect effects on circulation and productivity patterns rather than direct effects of warmer temperatures. However, because the upper thermal limit for growth nearly coincides with the upper limit for survival, exhibiting a sharp demarcation between favorable growth conditions and intolerable temperatures, juvenile sablefish at the southern Limit of their distribution may suffer the direct effects of elevated temperature; recruitment of juveniles to southern populations may become more sporadic if the frequency of warming events increases with climate change.

AB  - When traits experience directional selection, such as that imposed by sexual selection, their genetic variance is expected to diminish. Nonetheless, theory and findings from sexual selection predict and demonstrate that male traits favored by female choice retain substantial amounts of additive genetic variance. We explored this dilemma through an ecological genetic approach and focused on the potential contributions of genotype X environment interaction (GEI) to maintenance of additive generic variance for male signal characters in the lesser waxmoth, Achroia grisella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). We artificially selected genetic variants for two male signal characters, signal rate (SR) and peak amplitude (PA), that influence female attraction and then examined the phenotypic plasticity of these variants (high- and low-SR and high- and low-PA lines) under a range of environmental conditions expected in natural populations.
   Our split-family breeding experiments indicated that two signal characters, SR and PA, and several developmental characters in both high- and low-SR and high- and low-PA lines displayed considerable phenotypic plasticity among the environments tested. Moreover, strong GEIs leading to crossover between high- and low-SR lines were found for SR and developmental period. Therefore, neither high- nor low-SR genetic variants would achieve maximum attractiveness and fitness in every environment, and those variants producing unattractive signals with low SRs under normal conditions may remain in populations provided that gene flow across environments or generation overlap are sufficiently high. We speculate that the phenotypic plasticity for SR and developmental period is adaptive in A. grisella populations experiencing a range of temperature and density conditions.
   Females mating with attractive (high-SR) males may be assured of obtaining good genes because these males sire offspring that develop more rapidly and a crossover for developmental period may parallel that for SR. Such parallel crossovers may be expected wherever good-genes sexual selection mechanisms operate.

AB  - Invertebrate offspring are usually larger in colder environments. To test for possible effects of covariates (e.g. maternal phenotype and feeding conditions) on this pattern, we performed a laboratory experiment to look at the effect of temperature on newborn weight in the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna. Three temperatures (12 degrees C, 16 degrees C and 22 degrees C) and two food levels (10,000 cells ml(-1) and 150,000 cells ml(-1)) were used, and offspring were examined from the first five clutches of mothers that had been maintained under the constant experimental conditions for three generations. Preliminary analysis suggested that newborn weight was significantly affected by temperature although patterns ill the data were not clear cut. In addition, the covariates mother weight and clutch size were positively and negatively correlated with newborn weight, respectively; and later clutches tended to contain heavier offspring. Therefore, in an effort to control for the effects of the covariates, repeated-measures analysis of covariance was performed using ratio values of newborn weight/mother weight (relative newborn weight) as the dependent variable. clutch size as the covariate and clutch number as the repeated measures term. Now, temperature as a main effect in an ANCOVA model did not significantly influence relative newborn weight. The repeated measure term clutch number also became non-significant, indicating that when differences in mother weight due to age were accounted for there were no overall differences in relative newborn weight between clutches from a particular mother. Temperature effects on relative newborn weight were only significant as part of interaction terms with food concentration and with clutch number. Thus there were different weight responses to temperature within food levels, and between clutch numbers within food levels. Under the low-food conditions newborn were heaviest at 16 degrees C, lightest at 12 degrees C and intermediate at 22 degrees C. Conversely, under the high-food condition newborn were lightest at 16 degrees C, heaviest at 12 degrees C and again intermediate at 22 degrees C. However, newborn tended to be heavier under the low food condition, and food concentration was highly significant as a main effect. Mother growth rate showed no significant relationship with newborn weight. It is concluded that direct temperature effects on relative newborn weight are marginal and non-significant. Temperature effects through interactions with food concentration and clutch number are important determinants of newborn weight, but relatively speaking account for only a small proportion of observed variance in newborn weight (25%), compared with the direct effect of food concentration (67%).

AB  - The parental influences on three progeny traits (survival to eyed-embryo stage, post-hatching body length and yolk-sac volume) of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus were studied under two thermal conditions (2 and 7 degrees C) using a factorial mating design. The higher temperature resulted in elevated mortality rates and less advanced development at hatching. Survival was mostly attributable to maternal effects at both temperatures, but the variation among families was dependent on egg size only at the low temperature. No additive genetic variation (or pure sire effect) could be observed, whereas the non-additive genetic effects (parental combination) contributed to offspring viability at 2 degrees C. In contrast, any observable genetic variance in survival was lost at 7 degrees C, most likely due to the increased environmental variance. Irrespective of temperature, dam and sire-dam interaction contributed significantly to the phenotypic variation in both larval length and yolk size. A significant proportion of the variation in larval length was also due to the sire effect at 2 degrees C. Maternal effects were mediated partly through egg size, but as a whole, they decreased in importance at the high temperature, enabling a concomitant increase in non-additive genetic effects. For larval length, however, the additive component, like maternal effects, decreased at 7 degrees C. The present results suggest that an exposure to thermal stress during incubation can modify the genetic architecture of early developmental traits in S. alpinus and presumably constrain their short-term adaptive potential and evolvability by increasing the amount of environmentally induced variation.

AB  - Studies of the relationship of performance and behavioral traits with environmental factors have tended to neglect interindividual variation even though quantification of this variation is fundamental to understanding how phenotypic traits can evolve. In ectotherms, functional integration of locomotor performance, thermal behavior, and energy metabolism is of special interest because of the potential for coadaptation among these traits. For this reason, we analyzed interindividual variation, covariation, and repeatability of the thermal sensitivity of maximal sprint speed, preferred body temperature, thermal precision, and resting metabolic rate measured in ca. 200 common lizards (Zootoca vivipara) that varied by sex, age, and body size. We found significant interindividual variation in selected body temperatures and in the thermal performance curve of maximal sprint speed for both the intercept (expected trait value at the average temperature) and the slope (measure of thermal sensitivity). Interindividual differences in maximal sprint speed across temperatures, preferred body temperature, and thermal precision were significantly repeatable. A positive relationship existed between preferred body temperature and thermal precision, implying that individuals selecting higher temperatures were more precise. The resting metabolic rate was highly variable but was not related to thermal sensitivity of maximal sprint speed or thermal behavior. Thus, locomotor performance, thermal behavior, and energy metabolism were not directly functionally linked in the common lizard.

AB  - Many aphid species have shown remarkable adaptability by invading new habitats and agricultural crops, although they are parthenogenetic and might be expected to show limited genetic variation. To determine if the mode of reproduction limits the level of genetic variation in adaptively important traits, we assess variation in 15 life history traits of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), for five populations sampled along a north-south transect in central North America, and for three traits for three populations from eastern Australia. The traits are developmental times and rates as affected by temperature, body weights as affected by temperature, fecundity, measures of migratory tendency, and photoperiodic responses. The most southerly population from North America is shown to be obligately parthenogenetic, as are the Australian populations, and the four more northerly North American populations are facultatively parthenogenetic with the number of parthenogenetic generations per year increasing from north to south. The broad-sense heritabilities of life history traits varied from 0.36 to 0.71 for nine quantitive traits based on a comparison of within- and between-lineage variances. Using these traits, 7-13 distinct genotypes (i.e. clones) were identified among each of the 18 lines sampled from the North American populations, but the number did not differ significantly among populations. The level of genetic variation differed from trait to trait. For 4 of 12 quantitative traits, the level of variation in the obligately parthenogenetic population from North America was lowest, but significantly lower than all the sexual populations for only 1 trait. The obligately parthenogenetic population had the highest level of genetic variation for two traits, and had intermediate levels for the others. The most northerly population, which was sexual and had relatively few parthenogenetic generations each year, had the lowest level of variation for 5 of 12 traits and the highest level of variation for 2 traits. There was no decline in variability from north to south correlated with the increase in the annual number of parthenogenetic generations. The Australian populations showed no less variation than the North American populations for two of three traits, although the pea aphid was introduced to Australia only 5 years prior to the study, whereas the aphid has been in North America for at least 100 years. The mode of reproduction has not had a substantial impact on the level of genetic variation in life history traits of the pea aphid, but there are population-specific factors that affect the level of variation in certain traits.

AB  - Adaptive radiation is the diversification of species to different ecological niches and has repeatedly occurred in different salmonid fish of postglacial lakes. In Lake Tinnsjoen, one of the largest and deepest lakes in Norway, the salmonid fish, Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus(L.)), has likely radiated within 9,700 years after deglaciation into ecologically and genetically segregated Piscivore, Planktivore, Dwarf, and Abyssal morphs in the pelagial, littoral, shallow-moderate profundal, and deep-profundal habitats. We compared trait variation in the size of the head, the eye and olfactory organs, as well as the volumes of five brain regions of these four Arctic charr morphs. We hypothesised that specific habitat characteristics have promoted divergent body, head, and brain sizes related to utilized depth differing in environmental constraints (e.g., light, oxygen, pressure, temperature, and food quality). The most important ecomorphological variables differentiating morphs were eye area, habitat, and number of lamellae. The Abyssal morph living in the deepest areas of the lake had the smallest brain region volumes, head, and eye size. Comparing the olfactory bulb with the optic tectum in size, it was larger in the Abyssal morph than in the Piscivore morph. The Piscivore and Planktivore morphs that use more illuminated habitats have the largest optic tectum volume, followed by the Dwarf. The observed differences in body size and sensory capacities in terms of vision and olfaction in shallow and deepwater morphs likely relates to foraging and mating habitats in Lake Tinnsjoen. Further seasonal and experimental studies of brain volume in polymorphic species are needed to test the role of plasticity and adaptive evolution behind the observed differences.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the effects of seven oligosaccharides on the growth rate and stress tolerance of Lactobacillus plantarum ZLP001 in vitro, and the potential synbiotic effects of the most effective oligosaccharide [fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS)] and L. plantarum ZLP001 on the growth performance, apparent nutrient digestibility, fecal microbiota, and serum immune index in weaning piglets. Most oligosaccharides were utilized as carbohydrate sources by L. plantarum ZLP001, but we observed obvious differences in the bacterial growth depending on oligosaccharide type and concentration. Oligosaccharides and glucose significantly alleviated the decrease in L. plantarum ZLP001 viability in artificial gastric fluid, whereas none of the sugars affected viability in artificial intestinal fluid. FOS and galacto-oligosaccharide significantly improved the viability of L. plantarum ZLP001 under heat stress (65 degrees C for 15 and 30 min). FOS and soybean oligosaccharide significantly increased the viability of L. plantarum ZLP001 in response to cold stress (4 degrees C for 30 and 60 days). On the basis of the findings of in vitro experiments, we selected FOS for in vivo studies. Eighty-four weaned piglets were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: control (basal diet, no additives), freeze-dried L. plantarum ZLP001 (4.2 x 10(9) CFU/g, 2 g/kg diet), FOS (5 g/kg diet), and combination (0.2% L. plantarum ZLP001 + 0.5% FOS). Body weight and feed consumption were recorded for determinations of the average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed-to-gain ratio (F/G). On day 28, fresh fecal samples were collected to evaluate the apparent digestibility of nutrients and microbiota, and serum samples were collected to determine the immune status. L. plantarum ZLP001 plus FOS significantly increased ADG and decreased the F/G ratio compared with the no-additive control. The combination treatment also increased the apparent nutrient digestibility of dry matter and crude protein. Compared with the control and single supplementation, the combination treatment had a significant regulatory effect on the intestinal microbiota, as evidenced by increases in Lactobacillus spp. and a decrease in Enterobacteriaceae. In addition, the combination treatment increased the concentrations of serum IFN-gamma and immunoglobulin G. In conclusion, FOS can be utilized well by L. plantarum ZLP001 and can be combined with it as a potential synbiotic that shows synergistic effects in weaning piglets.

AB  - Range shifts and expansions resulting from global climate change have the potential to create novel communities with unique plant-animal interactions. Organisms expanding their range into novel biotic and abiotic environments may encounter selection pressures that alter traditional biogeographic patterns of life history traits. Here, we used field surveys to examine latitudinal patterns of life history traits in a broadly distributed ectotherm (mangrove tree crab Aratus pisonii) that has recently experienced a climate change-induced range expansion into a novel habitat type. Additionally, we conducted laboratory and field experiments to investigate characteristics associated with these life history traits (e.g. fecundity, offspring quality, and potential selection pressures). We compared these characteristics in native mangrove habitats in which the species has historically dwelled and novel salt marsh habitats into which the species has recently expanded its range. Consistent with traditional biogeographic concepts (i.e. Bergmann's clines), size at maturity and mean body size of reproductive females increased with latitude within the native habitat. However, they decreased significantly in novel habitats at the highest latitudes of the species' range, which was consistent with habitat-specific differences in both biotic (predation) and abiotic (temperature) selection pressures. Although initial maternal investment (egg volume and weight) did not differ between habitats, fecundity was lower in novel habitats as a result of differences in size at reproduction. Offspring quality, as measured by larval starvation resistance, was likewise diminished in novel habitats relative to native habitats. These differences in off-spring quality may have enduring consequences for species success and persistence in novel habitats. Life history characteristics such as those investigated here are fundamental organismal traits; consequently, understanding the potential impacts of climate change responses on latitudinal patterns of these traits is key to understanding climate change impacts on natural systems.

AB  - We investigated the heat tolerance of adults of three replicated lines of Drosophila melanogaster that have been evolving independently by laboratory natural selection for 15 yr at ''nonextreme'' temperatures (18 degrees C, 25 degrees C, or 28 degrees C). These lines are known to have diverged in body size and in the thermal dependence of several life-history traits. Here we show that they differ also in tolerance of extreme high temperature as well as in induced thermotolerance (''heat hardening''). For example, the 28 degrees C flies bad the highest probability of surviving a heat shock, whereas the 18 degrees C flies generally had the lowest probability. A short heat pretreatment increased the heat tolerance of the 18 degrees C and 25 degrees C lines, and the threshold temperature necessary to induce thermotolerance was lower for the 18 degrees C line than for the 25 degrees C line. However, neither heat pretreatment nor acclimation to different temperatures influenced heat tolerance of the 28 degrees C line, suggesting the loss of capacity for induced thermotolerance and for acclimation. Thus, patterns of tolerance of extreme heat, of acclimation, and of induced thermotolerance have evolved as correlated responses to natural selection at nonextreme temperatures. A genetic analysis of heat tolerance of a representative replicate population each from the 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C lines indicates that chromosomes 1, 2, and 3 have significant effects on heat tolerance. However, the cytoplasm has little influence, contrary to findings in an earlier study of other stocks that had been evolving for 7 yr at 14 degrees C versus 25 degrees C. Because genes for heat stress proteins (hsps) are concentrated on chromosome 3, the potential role of hsps in the heat tolerance and of induced thermotolerance in these naturally selected lines is currently unclear. In any case, species of Drosophila possess considerable genetic variation in thermal sensitivity and thus have the potential to evolve rapidly in response to climate change; but predicting that response may be difficult.

AB  - Some studies have demonstrated that elevated CO2 concentrations in ocean waters negatively impact metabolism and development of marine fish. Particularly, early developmental stages are probably more susceptible to ocean acidification due to insufficient regulations of their acid-base balance. Transgenerational acclimation can be an important mechanism to mediate impacts of increased CO2 on marine species, yet very little is known about the potential of parental effects in teleosts. Therefore, transgenerational effects were investigated on life history in juvenile three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus by acclimating parents (collected in April 2012, 55A degrees 03'N, 8A degrees 44'E) and offspring to ambient (similar to 400 A mu atm) and elevated (similar to 1,000 A mu atm) CO2 levels and measured parental fecundity as well as offspring survival, growth and otolith characteristics. Exposure to elevated CO2 concentrations led to an increase in clutch size in adults as well as increased juvenile survival and growth rates between 60 and 90 days post-hatch and enlarged otolith areas compared with fish from ambient CO2 concentrations. Moreover, transgenerational effects were observed in reduced survival and body size 30 days post-hatch as well as in enlarged otoliths at the end of the experiment, when fathers or both parents were acclimated to the high-CO2 environment. These results may suggest that elevated CO2 concentrations had rather positive effects on life-history traits of three-spined sticklebacks, but that parental acclimation can modify these effects without improving offspring fitness. Although the mechanistic basis of such transgenerational acclimation remains unclear, selective gradients within generations seem to determine the direction of transgenerational effects.

AB  - In this study, we conducted a novel approach of selective breeding by using temperature acclimation to enhance the aquaculture potential of the tropical cyclopoid copepod Apocyclops royi. Two copepod culture strains were acclimated separately at high (28 degrees C, control strain) and low (18 degrees C, selective strain) temperature for 10 months, corresponding to similar to 40 and 15 generations, respectively. After temperature acclimation, multigenerational observations were made to investigate the effects of cold selection on the copepods. Differences in female and nauplius lengths, nauplius production, and fatty acid contents were evaluated between the control and selective strains before (F0) and during the multigenerational observation (F1-F4). Overall, the selective strain exhibited larger females, higher nauplius production, but smaller nauplii than the control strain did. In generation F1, the total fatty acid and omega 6 and omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid contents were higher in the selective strain than in the control strain; however, the fatty acid content gradually decreased in subsequent generations. This paper reports the effects of temperature acclimation on the morphological and physiological traits of A. royi and provides preliminary suggestions for improving its productivity and nutritional value as "designer feed" for aquaculture applications.

AB  - Assessing components of the immune system may reflect disease resistance. In some invertebrates, heat shock proteins (HSPs) are immune effectors and have been described as potent activators of the innate immune response. Several diseases have become a threat to abalone farming worldwide; therefore, increasing disease resistance is considered to be a long-term goal for breeding programs. A trait will respond to selection only if it is determined partially by additive genetic variation. The aim of this study was to estimate the heritability (h(2)) and the additive genetic coefficient of variation (CVA) of HSP70 as a component of innate immunity of the abalone Haliotis rufescens, in order to assess its potential response to selection. These genetic components were estimated for the variations in the intracellular (in haemocytes) and extracellular (serum) protein levels of HSP70 in response to an immunostimulant agent in 60 full-sib families of H. rufescens. Levels of HSP70 were measured twice in the same individuals, first when they were young and again when they were pre-harvest adults, to estimate the repeatability (R), the h(2) and the potential response to selection of these traits at these life stages. High HSP70 levels were observed in abalones subjected to immunostimulation in both the intracellular and extracellular haemolymph fractions. This is the first time that changes in serum levels of HSP70 have been reported in response to an immune challenge in molluscs. HSP70 levels in both fractions and at both ages showed low h(2) and R, with values that were not significantly different from zero. However, HSP70 induced levels had a CVA of 13.3-16.2% in young adults and of 2.7-8.1% in pre-harvest adults. Thus, despite its low h(2), HSP70 synthesis in response to an immune challenge in red abalone has the potential to evolve through selection because of its large phenotypic variation and the presence of additive genetic variance, especially in young animals.

AB  - Climate change is relevant to life around the globe. A rise in ambient temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) may have various impacts on arthropods such as altered life cycles, modified reproductive patterns, and changes in distribution. The sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), is a global pest responsible for significant losses of agricultural yields annually. This study was conducted to determine the impacts of changing temperature and CO2 levels on selected life history parameters of B. tabaci biotype B. Populations were established at three temperature regimes (25, 28, and 33 degrees C), and each population was evaluated in all three environments. Collard, Brassica oleracea ssp. acephala de Condolle (Brassicaceae), was used as the host. These results were based on data from 5 to approximate to 30 generations. Oviposition, nymphal survival, and reproduction were significantly affected by temperature, with net reproductive success declining to 36.4% at 33 degrees C. Overall, 28 degrees C was most favorable for whitefly fitness. However, the optimal temperature for B. tabaci reproduction may be between 28 and 33 degrees C. There were no temperature effects on total nonstructural carbohydrate concentrations in collard, and impacts of the host plant on whitefly development in the different environments were determined to be minimal. An environment of enriched CO2 (750 ppm) was not observed to have an adverse effect on whitefly reproduction. Temperature was negatively correlated with adult body size. Length and width of males and females were affected by temperature. Data regarding population dynamics of B. tabaci in response to climate change are important for accurate predictions and improving management practices.

AB  - Author summary
   Fascioliasis is a neglected zoonotic tropical disease of humans, which reduces the productivity of animal industries, and imposes an economic burden of at least 3.2 billion dollars annually. Although there are four assemblies for F. hepatica and two assemblies for F. gigantica at NCBI, the inherent limited ability of short reads based assemblies made the completeness of genome sequences and the quality of gene annotation challenging. Here, we report the Pacbio assembly of reference genome for F. gigantica, and the quality of assembly and gene annotation are significantly improved compared with previous assemblies. Besides, we found the evidence of transposon-mediated evolution, especially for LINE insertions into gene regions between 41 Ma and 62 Ma, contributing to the speciation and adaption of the Fasciola ancestors. Furthermore, we identified F. gigantica specific gene duplication including 98 gene families, and 3300 protein-protein interactions between F. gigantica and the host in the small intestine and liver environment. These results illustrate the genomic and gene evolution of F. gigantica potentially shaping multiple parasitic characters.
   Fasciola gigantica and Fasciola hepatica are causative pathogens of fascioliasis, with the widest latitudinal, longitudinal, and altitudinal distribution; however, among parasites, they have the largest sequenced genomes, hindering genomic research. In the present study, we used various sequencing and assembly technologies to generate a new high-quality Fasciola gigantica reference genome. We improved the integration of gene structure prediction, and identified two independent transposable element expansion events contributing to (1) the speciation between Fasciola and Fasciolopsis during the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary mass extinction, and (2) the habitat switch to the liver during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, accompanied by gene length increment. Long interspersed element (LINE) duplication contributed to the second transposon-mediated alteration, showing an obvious trend of insertion into gene regions, regardless of strong purifying effect. Gene ontology analysis of genes with long LINE insertions identified membrane-associated and vesicle secretion process proteins, further implicating the functional alteration of the gene network. We identified 852 predicted excretory/secretory proteins and 3300 protein-protein interactions between Fasciola gigantica and its host. Among them, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase genes, with specific gene copy number variations, might play a central role in the phase I detoxification process. Analysis of 559 single-copy orthologs suggested that Fasciola gigantica and Fasciola hepatica diverged at 11.8 Ma near the Middle and Late Miocene Epoch boundary. We identified 98 rapidly evolving gene families, including actin and aquaporin, which might explain the large body size and the parasitic adaptive character resulting in these liver flukes becoming epidemic in tropical and subtropical regions.

AB  - 1. A major barrier for the scientific community of climate change biologists is the spatial mismatch between the size of organisms and the resolution at which global climate data are collected and modelled. Thus, the development of integrative and quantitative tools for the monitoring and spatial characterization of microclimates across spatial scales is a key issue for climate change ecologists.
   2. We proposed an integrative toolbox for quantifying the spatial heterogeneity in surface temperatures by bringing together procedures of unmanned aerial vehicles, thermal imagery, orthomosaic, GIS classification and spatial metrics. This toolbox permits to yield high-resolution visual and infrared orthoimages that are processed into a GIS for selecting surfaces of interest in the landscape (e.g. soil, vegetation). Then, the thermal matrices of selected surfaces (i.e. temperature values of the pixels belonging to the selected surfaces only) are processed within r to generate a variety of thermal landscape metrics (e.g. thermal patch richness and density, thermal aggregation and cohesion index).
   3. We applied this toolbox to the thermal characterization of mountainous agricultural landscapes in Ecuador with implications for ectothermic pest dynamics. UAV flights at a height of 60m above-ground level allowed us to acquired high-resolution visual and thermal images (1 and 5cm/pixel, respectively) for 12 potato fields with a mean surface of 1017117m(2). Landscape metrics on plant and soil surfaces showed that crop phenology drives the spatial patterns of surface temperatures and strongly modifies the overall thermal ecology of crop fields, with potential implications for ectothermic pest occurrence and dynamics.
   4. Overall, our toolbox affords a timely and innovative methodological framework to better assess the thermal heterogeneity of natural landscapes across a wide range of spatial scales. In particular, this toolbox would be of topical interest for ecologists trying to bridge the gap between the resolution of their climatic data and the body size of their study organisms.

AB  - Reptiles with small body size and high surface-to-volume ratios face challenges in thermoregulation and water balance because they rapidly exchange heat and lose moisture via evaporation to the environment. The purpose of this study is to determine the thermoregulatory mode of the skink Scincella lateralis in the field, as well as how temperature and season influence metabolism and water balance in this species. I measured field body temperatures (T-bf) and environmental temperatures during May to December 2012. I measured selected substrate temperatures in laboratory thermal gradients. For both summer and winter acclimatized skinks, I measured oxygen consumption at 24, 28, 32 and 36 degrees C. In the laboratory, I measured rates of heating and cooling in dry or humid air to determine the influence of evaporative cooling on heat exchange. I measured evaporative water loss at 28, 32 and 36 degrees C. In the field, skinks thermoregulated more effectively during autumn/winter (d(e) - d(b) = 9.0) than spring/summer (d(e) - d(b) =2.1), yet maintained similar average body temperatures between seasons (T-b autumn/winter: 28.0 degrees C vs. T-b spring/summer: 29.2 degrees C). Metabolic rates of summer and winter acclimatized skinks measured in the laboratory were temperature insensitive between 28-33 degrees C (Q(10) approximate to 1), corresponding to the skink's preferred temperature range. Metabolic rates were approximately twice as high during summer than winter indicating no seasonal acclimatory increase in metabolic rate. Heating and cooling rates in dry versus humid air indicated that skinks heated more slowly than they cooled in dry air, whereas heating and cooling rates were similar in humid air. Results of the study suggests that distribution and activity of skinks may depend on availability of microenvironments with suitable temperature and moisture conditions, which permit skinks to maintain body temperature and water balance within preferred ranges.

AB  - Altitudinal gradients offer valuable study systems to investigate how adaptive genetic diversity is distributed within and between natural populations and which factors promote or prevent adaptive differentiation. The environmental clines along altitudinal gradients tend to be steep relative to the dispersal distance of many organisms, providing an opportunity to study the joint effects of divergent natural selection and gene flow. Temperature is one variable showing consistent altitudinal changes, and altitudinal gradients can therefore provide spatial surrogates for some of the changes anticipated under climate change. Here, we investigate the extent and patterns of adaptive divergence in animal populations along altitudinal gradients by surveying the literature for (i) studies on phenotypic variation assessed under common garden or reciprocal transplant designs and (ii) studies looking for signatures of divergent selection at the molecular level. Phenotypic data show that significant between-population differences are common and taxonomically widespread, involving traits such as mass, wing size, tolerance to thermal extremes and melanization. Several lines of evidence suggest that some of the observed differences are adaptively relevant, but rigorous tests of local adaptation or the link between specific phenotypes and fitness are sorely lacking. Evidence for a role of altitudinal adaptation also exists for a number of candidate genes, most prominently haemoglobin, and for anonymous molecular markers. Novel genomic approaches may provide valuable tools for studying adaptive diversity, also in species that are not amenable to experimentation.

AB  - Aim To test the hypothesis that adaptive convergent evolution of climate niches occurred in multiple independent lemur lineages. Location Madagascar. Taxon Lemurs. Methods I collected climate and altitude data from WorldClim and summarized the niches of almost all living lemurs (83 species) into phylogenetically controlled principal components. To test for convergent evolution, I searched for multiple, similar climate optima using multi-peak Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models (surface, l1-ou, bayou). I compared the observed level of climate convergence to that simulated under neutral and single-optimum models. To test if behavioural or morphological traits were related to climate niches, I used phylogenetic regressions with activity pattern, diet, and body size. Results From an ancestral niche with high rainfall and low seasonality, four lemur lineages independently converged on climate niche optima characterized by high temperatures and low rainfall, supporting adaptive evolution in southwest deciduous and arid habitats. The observed level of convergence was more frequent than expected under Brownian motion and single-optimum simulations, which illustrates that the results are likely not a result of stochastic evolution over long time periods. Nocturnal and cathemeral activity patterns were common among lineages in the arid climate niche. Conclusion Lemur climate niche evolution demonstrated that convergence explains the distribution of four independent clades in hot, arid environments of southwest Madagascar. The timing of these convergent shifts coincided with the origination of modern arid-adapted plant genera, some of which are important lemur food sources. These communities have high endemicity and are especially threatened by habitat loss. Arid environments are arenas in which convergent evolution is predicted to occur frequently.

AB  - Interspecific and intraspecific variation in the distributions and diets of congeneric sculpins, Myoxocephalus jaok, M. polyacanthocephalus, and M. scorpius, were described from data collected during summer trawl surveys of the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) continental shelf between 2000 and 2010 by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC). Generalized additive models (GAMs) of abundance (count) and presence-absence data were applied separately for each species to examine the influence of selected factors (depth, bottom temperature, substrate type and location) on distribution and abundance. The final models indicated strong predictive relationships, suggesting habitat partitioning between species. Ontogenetic distributions were observed as larger individuals of each species tended to be associated with deeper depths and lower latitudes. Analysis of stomach contents indicated that these species consume a wide variety of prey and that the diet composition also shifted ontogenetically. Multivariate analyses of the mean percent weight (%W) of 23 diet categories indicated that the diets differed among and within species. The diet of M. jaok consisted primarily of mysids, shrimps, and flatfish, with larger sculpins feeding on a greater amount of flatfish prey and less benthic infauna. Both M. polyacanthocephalus and M. scorpius fed considerably on commercially important Chionoecetes crabs, particularly C. opilio; however, similar-sized M. polyacanthocephalus consumed larger Chionoecetes prey than M. scorpius. Diets were more variable among smaller sculpins of these 2 species, and piscivory was more common among M. polyacanthocephalus. Habitat and diet partitioning were evident among species within this genus, as each species exhibited distinct spatial boundaries and diets, possibly avoiding inter-and intraspecific competition in this environment.

AB  - Aim Rates of climate niche evolution underlie numerous fundamental ecological processes and patterns. However, while climate niche conservatism varies markedly among regions and clades, the source of this variation remains poorly understood. We tested whether ecological opportunity can stimulate radiation within climate niche space at biogeographic scales, predicting that rates of climate niche evolution will scale with geographic area and climate heterogeneity.
   Location Caribbean
   Methods We quantified two temperature axes (mean temperature and temperature seasonality of species' localities) of the climate niche for 130 Anolis species on Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Jamaica and the northern and southern Lesser Antilles. Using a species-level phylogeny, we fitted macroevolutionary models that either constrained rates of climate niche evolution or allowed them to vary among regions. Next, we regressed region-specific evolutionary rates against area, species richness and climate heterogeneity. We evaluated whether results were robust to uncertainty in phylogenetic and biogeographic reconstructions and the assumed mode of evolution.
   Results For both niche axes, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model that allowed the net rate of evolution (sigma(2)) to vary among island groups fit the data considerably better than a single-rate Brownian motion model. Nagelkerke pseudo-R-2 values of the fit of these OU models to mean temperature and seasonality axes were 0.43 and 0.66, respectively. Evolutionary rates for both axes were higher in larger areas, which also have more species. Only the rate of mean occupied temperature evolution was positively related to climate heterogeneity, and only after accounting for region size.
   Conclusions Rates of climate niche evolution scale consistently with the area available for radiation, but responses to climate heterogeneity vary among niche axes. For the mean temperature axis, climate heterogeneity generated additional opportunities for radiation, but for seasonality it did not. Overall, the physical setting in which a clade diversifies can influence where it falls on the evolutionary continuum, from climate niche conservatism to radiation.

AB  - The relative importance of genetic versus epigenetic changes in adaptive evolution is a hotly debated topic, with studies showing that some species appear to be able to adapt rapidly without significant genetic change. Epigenetic mechanisms may be particularly important for the evolutionary potential of species with long maturation times and low reproductive potential ('K-strategists'), particularly when faced with rapidly changing environmental conditions. Here we study the transcriptome of two populations of the winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata), a typical 'K-strategist', in Atlantic Canada; an endemic population in the southern Gulf of St Lawrence and a large population on the Scotian Shelf. The endemic population has been able to adapt to a 10 degrees C higher water temperature over short evolutionary time (7000 years), dramatically reducing its body size (by 45%) significantly below the minimum maturation size of Scotian Shelf and other populations of winter skate, as well as exhibiting other adaptations in life history and physiology. We demonstrate that the adaptive response to selection has an epigenetic basis, cataloguing 3653 changes in gene expression that may have enabled this species to rapidly respond to the novel environment. We argue that the epigenetic augmentation of species evolutionary potential (its regulation though gene expression) can enable K-strategists to survive and adapt to different environments, and thismechanism may be particularly important for the persistence of sharks, skates and rays in the light of future climate change.

AB  - 1. Populations within species often occur across divergent habitats and, under the right conditions, can adapt to local conditions. For adult and larval insects, local adaptation in tolerance traits, e.g. thermoregulation and water conservation, is well documented. Eggs of insects are immobile, non-feeding and relatively small, and therefore may be at greater risk from abiotic threats. Selection, therefore, may favour strategies that allow embryos to be robust to desiccation and thermal stresses. In particular, the canteen hypothesis predicts that eggs in hot and dry environments contain more water, and this extra water protects them from elevated rates of water loss.
   2. This study tests the canteen hypothesis by (i) examining geographic patterns of egg size and water content and (ii) measuring egg and neonate performance across a range of manipulated temperatures and humidities. We focused on eggs of the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae). Manduca eggs are larger in xeric regions of the United States - e.g. the southwestern deserts - compared with M. sexta eggs from eastern, mesic regions.
   3. Specifically, we asked: do eggs from warmer or drier regions (i) contain more water, (ii) perform better in dry conditions and (iii) tolerate higher temperatures? We also assessed whether desiccation during the egg stage affects subsequent growth of larvae. We tested M. sexta eggs from three environments: Arizona (warm, dry), North Carolina (cool, humid) and a laboratory strain (cool, dry).
   4. Although M. sexta eggs from warmer and drier populations were larger and contained more water, these changes did not protect them better from abiotic stress. Eggs from all populations were similarly tolerant of high heat and low humidity. Desiccation during the egg stage also had no long-term effects on hatchling growth rate.
   5. Our results provided little support for local adaptation in abiotic stress physiology via the canteen hypothesis. However, low humidity and delayed hatching suggest a different mechanism for desiccation resistance: embryos may modify eggshell conductance in response to internal water status. The geographic cline in egg size may instead arise from selection on any of the three subsequent life stages or may reflect other evolutionary pressures on number-size trade-offs.

AB  - Streptococcus iniae is one of the most serious aquatic pathogens, causing significant economic losses in marine and freshwater species, including Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer). Controlling this gram-positive bacterial pathogen has been an issue in aquaculture systems, due to the combined effects of aquaculture intensification and climatic impacts. To date, there have not been any genetic parameter estimates for S. iniae resistance in Asian seabass. The main aim of this study was to examine genetic variation in S. iniae resistance and its genetic correlations with growth and cannibalism in Asian seabass families produced from a breeding programme for high growth in 2016 and 2017. The study included a total of 5,835 individual fish that were offspring of 41 sires and 60 dams (31 half-sib and 34 full-sib families). The experimental fish were challenged by intraperitoneal injection with a volume containing 10(5) CFU (colony-forming unit)/fish. Resistance to S. iniae was measured as survival rate at 6 hr, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 days post-challenge test. There were significant variations in S. iniae resistance among families at different observation periods (ranging from 24.4% to 80%). Restricted maximum-likelihood method and mixed model analysis were applied to estimate heritability for S. iniae resistance. The heritability for S. iniae resistance ranged from 7% to 18% across different statistical models used. The common full-sib effects accounted for 0.1%-2% of the total variation in resistance to S. iniae. Genetic correlations of the S. iniae resistance at 6 hr and 3 days with later post-challenge test periods were low to moderate. However, these estimates for S. iniae resistance between successive measurement times (5, 7, 10 and 15 days) were high and close to 1. The genetic correlations of resistance with body weights at 180, 270 and 360 days post-hatch were not significant as well with cannibalism. It is concluded that there is substantial additive genetic variation in resistance to S. iniae, suggesting there is potential for genetic improvement of Asian seabass for resistance to S. iniae through selective breeding.

AB  - Both observations of C-type near-Earth asteroids and laboratory investigations of carbonaceous chondritic meteorites provide strong evidence for a high microporosity of C-type asteroids. Boulder microporosity values derived from in-situ measurements at the surface of the rubble-pile NEA (162173) Ryugu are as high as 55 %, which is substantially higher than for water-rich carbonaceous chondrite samples and could indicate distinct evolution paths for the parent body of Ryugu and parent bodies of carbonaceous chondrites, despite spectral similarities. In the present study, we calculate the evolution of the temperature and porosity for early solar system's planetesimals in order to constrain the range of parameters that result in microporosities compatible with Ryugu's high-porosity material and likely burial depths for the boulders observed at the surface. By varying key properties of the parent body, such as accretion time t(0) and radius R that have strong influence on temperature and porosity and by comparing the interior porosity distribution with the measured boulder micro-porosity, hydration, and partial dehydration of the material, we constrain a field within the (R, t(0))-diagram appropriate for bodies that are likely to have produced such material. Our calculations indicate a parent body size of only a few km and its early accretion within less than or similar to 2 - 3 Myr after the formation of Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs). A gradual final porosity profile of best-fit bodies indicates production of both low- and high-density boulders from the parent body material. By contrast, parent body properties for CI and CM chondrites obtained by fitting carbonate formation data indicate a radius of approximate to 20 - 25 km and an accretion time of approximate to 3.75 Myr after CAIs. These results imply a population of km-sized early accreting highly porous planetesimals as parent bodies of the rubble-pile NEA Ryugu (and, potentially, other NEAs) and a population of larger and late accreting less porous planetesimals as parent bodies of water-rich carbonaceous chondrites.

AB  - As temperature-based growth trials are lengthy, expensive and laborious to run, juvenile hapuku (Polyprion oxygeneios) were employed to assess whether respirometric tests and behavioural preference methods could be used to resolve the optimum temperature for growth and feed conversion efficiency in novel culture species. On the basis that the energetic costs of rapid growth are substantial and need to be accommodated physiologically, it was hypothesised that maximal growth and optimal feed conversion (feed conversion ratio, FCR) would be maximised at temperatures where aerobic metabolic scope (AMS) was also maximised. It was further hypothesised that hapuku would behaviourally self-select temperatures that lead to the greatest level of AMS, growth and FCR performance. Acclimating hapuku juveniles to 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 degrees C for 4 weeks resulted in a peak in specific growth rate (SGR) at 18 and 21 degrees C with slower growth at lower and higher temperatures. AMS was also maximal between 18 and 21 degrees C and was therefore tightly linked with SGR. The behavioural thermal preference (T-pref) range of hapuku also fell within the optimum range for growth. FCR, however, was inversely related to temperature with the most and least efficient rates of conversion occurring at 12 degrees C and 24 degrees C respectively. Though AMS and Tpref had no utility in predicting the optimal range for FCR, standard metabolic rate (SMR) showed a positive linear relationship to FCR. The conclusions of the study are threefold: 1) Hapuku select temperatures that optimise both AMS and growth. 2) AMS and T-pref appear tightly linked with SGR and could possibly be used to predict the optimum temperature for growth in novel species. 3) AMS and Tpref have no utility in predicting the optimum temperature for FCR.

AB  - Background: The exoskeleton of an insect could be an important factor in the success of its evolutionary process. This reaches its maximum expression in beetles, which constitute the most diversified animal taxon. The involvement in the management of environmental radiation could be one of the most important functions of the exoskeleton due to the passive contributions to the thermoregulation of body temperature. We study whether the elytra of two sympatric and closely related beetle species respond differentially to the radiation of distinct wavelengths in agreement with their ecological preferences.
   Methods: Onthophagus coenobita (Herbst) and O. medius (Kugelaan) occupy different habitats and environmental conditions (shaded vs. unshaded from solar radiation). The potential adaptive variations to thermoregulation under these different ecological conditions were studied using the responses of their exoskeletons to radiation of different wavelengths (ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared). For these two species, the amounts of the three wavelengths that were reflected, transmitted or absorbed by the exoskeleton were measured using of a spectrophotometer. In addition, the darkness and thickness of the elytra were examined to determine whether these two features influence the management of radiation by the exoskeleton.
   Results: Both species differ in the management of visible and near-infrared radiation. In agreement with habitat preferences, the species inhabiting shaded conditions would allow infrared and visible radiation to penetrate the elytra more easily to heat internal body parts, while the elytra of the heliophilous species would have increased absorbance of these same types of radiation. An increase in body size (and therefore in elytron thickness) and the quantity of dark spots may serve as barriers against exogenous heat gain. However, the maintenance of between-species differences independent of the effects of these two morphological features led us to suspect that an unconsidered elytron characteristic may also be affecting these differences.
   Discussion: The results of the involvement of the exoskeleton thickness and spots in the thermoregulation of insects opens new research lines to obtain a better understanding of the function of the exoskeleton as a passive thermoregulation mechanism in Coleoptera.

AB  - The main goal of this study was to estimate the heritability of the proportion of phenotypic males in progeny of Nile tilapia broodstock based on visually scored sex from six consecutive pedigreed generations from the GIFT project. Mean male proportion was 0.44 across all generations, ranging from 0.37 to 0.56 across generations and environments. Across all generations there was a low but significant "additive" genetic component for male proportion with heritability estimates of 0.12+/-0.02 (observed scale) and 0.22+/-0.04 (underlying liability scale). The within generation heritability estimates varied from 0.00+/-0.03 to 0.25+/-0.07 on the observed scale, and from 0.11+/-0.02 to 0.32+/-0.07 on the underlying liability scale. As expected, genetic correlations between male proportion in the different post-nursery test environments were in 16 out of 17 cases not significantly different from unity (P>0.05) since sex was determined before fish were stocked in the different test environments, indicating no or the same degree of sex dependent mortality among the families in the different environments.
   In general, the regression coefficient of raw family means on the estimated mean family breeding values is expected to be unity for a normal polygenic trait. The regression coefficient of observed full-sib family male proportions on the associated mid-parent estimated breeding values across generations (omitting the records of the 1st generation offspring of each breeder, one generation at a time) was significantly different (P<0.01) from unity (0.64+/-0.12). This suggests that the magnitude of the genetic variation in male proportion found in this study may be biased upwards by some parents having a phenotypic sex different from that determined by the major sex determining system (XX/XY).
   Selection for increased male proportion based solely on family means may lead to an increased fraction of masculinized XX males. If a "normal" (XXxXY) mating produces a significantly skewed sex ratio, this has to be a result of either 1) masculinizing/feminizing of XX/XY offspring, 2) differing viability of "male" and "female" sperm, or 3) sex-specific mortalities prior to recording of sex. Thus, selecting males from "high male" families may involve selecting XX sires, which will counteract the response to selection as all their offspring will be XX females. Genetic selection for increased male proportion in a purebred population (without the use of temperature treatment) is expected to be difficult. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Komodo dragons from hatchlings ( approximate to 0.1 kg) to adults ( <= 80 kg) express the full magnitude of varanid species size distributions. We found that all size groups of dragons regulated a similar preferred body temperature by exploiting a heterogeneous thermal environment within savanna, forest and mangrove habitats. All dragons studied, regardless of size, were able to regulate a daytime active body temperature within the range 34-35.6 degrees C for 5.1-5.6 h/day. The index of effectiveness of thermoregulation (a numerical rating of thermoregulatory activity) was not different among size groups of dragons. However, the index of closeness of thermoregulation, which rates the variability of body temperature, suggests a greater precision for regulating a preferred body temperature for medium compared to small and large dragons. Reference copper cylinders simulating small, medium and large Komodo dragons heated and cooled at the same rate, whereas actual dragons of all size groups heated faster than they cooled. Larger dragons heated and cooled more slowly than smaller ones. The mean operative environmental temperatures of copper cylinders representing medium sized dragons were 42.5, 32.0 and 29.4 degrees C for savannah, forest and mangrove habitats, respectively. The index for average thermal quality of a habitat as measured by the absolute difference between operative environmental temperature and the dragon's thermal range suggests the forest habitat offers the highest thermal quality to dragons and the savannah the lowest. The percent of total daytime that the operative environmental temperature was within the central 50% of the body temperatures selected by dragons in a thermal gradient (Phillips, 1984) was 45%, 15%, and 9% for forest, mangrove and savannah, respectively. Forest habitat offers the most suitable thermal environment and provides the greatest number of hours with conditions falling within the dragon's thermal activity zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The unique properties of terrestrial isopods regarding responses to limiting factors such as drought and temperature have led to interesting distributional patterns along climatic and other environmental gradients at both species and community level. This paper will focus on the exploration of isopod distributions in evaluating climate change effects on biodiversity at different scales, geographical regions, and environments, in view of isopods' tolerances to environmental factors, mostly humidity and temperature.
   Isopod distribution is tightly connected to available habitats and habitat features at a fine spatial scale, even though different species may exhibit a variety of responses to environmental heterogeneity, reflecting the large interspecific variation within the group.
   Furthermore, isopod distributions show some notable deviations from common global patterns, mainly as a result of their ecological features and evolutionary origins. Responses to human disturbance are not always traceable, but a trend towards community homogenisation is often found under strong global urbanisation processes.
   In general, even though it is still not clear how predicted climate change will affect isopod distribution, there is evidence that mixed effects are to be expected, depending on the region under study.
   We still lack robust and extensive analyses of isopod distributions at different scales and at different biomes, as well as applications of distribution models that might help evaluate future trends.

AB  - Aedes aegypti control in Brazil comprises integrated actions, in which larvicide application is a supplementary measure. Despite the importance of analyzing the effects of temperature on the efficiency of larvicides to control mosquito populations, there is still a lack of information regarding the sublethal effect of larvicides. We hypothesized that mosquitoes which survived pyriproxyfen exposure, during their immature development, have small body sizes and live less than mosquitoes that were not exposed to this larvicide. We investigated the sublethal effects of five different pyriproxyfen concentrations (0.0001; 0.001; 0.01; 0.1 and 1 mg.L-1), under three different temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). As we increased the larvicide concentration, less larvae survived and developed into adults. However, at 30 degrees C the survival was higher than at 25 degrees C and 20 degrees C comparing the concentrations of 0.001 mg.L-1 and 0.01 mg.L-1 (10% and 16% high, respectively). Mosquito survivors to pyriproxyfen exposure, in all thermal conditions, had shorter adult life spans than mosquitoes not exposed to pyriproxyfen during the larval stage. The females exposed at 30 degrees C showed smaller wings than females from experiments at 20 degrees C. These findings provide evidence that the biological parameters of the adult lifespan and wing centroid size are impaired due to larval exposure to pyriproxyfen, even at high temperatures. Reduced longevity and small wing size are fitness costs to survive this larvicide exposure. These findings provide support to assess resistance development to larvicides through future generations and contribute to the discussion on improving the rational application of larvicides.

AB  - The physiological ability to survive climatic extremes, such as low temperature, is a major determinant of species distribution. Research suggests that tropically restricted insect populations may possess low to zero variation in stress tolerance, thereby limiting any potential to adapt to colder climates. This paradigm derives largely from contrasts among Drosophila populations and species along the tropical-temperate cline of eastern Australia. Butterfly groups, such as the variously distributed representatives of the genus Eurema, offer opportunities to test the taxonomic breadth of this paradigm. We contribute here by investigating plasticity, repeatability and heritability (h(2)) for cold tolerance in Eurema smilax. This continentally widespread species (extending from the Torres Strait to the south coast of Victoria) offers an important comparative basis for evaluating stress tolerance in geographically restricted congenerics. We reared two generations of E.smilax under laboratory conditions and measured recovery from a chill-coma assay, which is one of the commonly used methods for characterizing adult cold stress tolerance. Trials on F2s conducted over three consecutive days revealed individual repeatability (r=0.405). However, recovery time decreased systematically across trials, which is characteristic of a phenotypically plastic hardening' response to prior cold exposure. Generalized linear modelling, wherein genetic variance was estimated via an animal model' approach, indicated no difference between sexes and no effect of body size, but a significant additive genetic term, corresponding to a heritability estimate of h(2)=0.414 +/- 0.100. These data suggest significant adaptive potential for cold tolerance in E.smilax but show that individuals may also respond directly to extremes of cold via phenotypic plasticity. This indicates the potential to adapt to varied thermal extremes, which would be expected for a broadly distributed species that is resilient to climate change.

AB  - Keystone predation can be a determinant of community structure, including species diversity, but factors underlying "keystoneness" have been minimally explored. Using the system in which the original keystone, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus, was discovered, we focused on two potential (but overlapping) determinants of keystoneness: intrinsic traits or state variables of the species (e.g., size, density), and extrinsic environmental parameters (e.g., prey productivity) that may provide conditions favorable for keystone predator evolution. Using a comparative-experimental approach, with repeated field experiments at multiple sites across a variable coastal environment, we tested predation rates, or how quickly predators consumed prey, and predation effects, or community response to predator presence or absence. We tested five hypotheses: (H-1) predation rates and effects will vary in space but not time; (H-2) per population predation rates will vary primarily with individual traits and population variables; (HJHH(3)) per capita predation rates will vary only with individual traits; (H-4) predation effects will vary with traits, variables, and external drivers; and (H-5) as predicted by the keystone predation hypothesis, diversity will vary unimodally with predation pressure. As hypothesized, predation rates differed among sites but not over time (H-1), and in caging exclusion experiments, predation effect varied with both intrinsic and extrinsic factors (H-4). Unexpectedly, predation rates varied with both intrinsic and extrinsic (H-2, per population), or only with extrinsic (H-3, per capita) factors. Further, in large-plot exclusion experiments, predation effect was most closely associated with individual traits (contra H-4). Finally, taxon diversity varied unimodally with proxies of predation pressure (sessile prey abundance) and was sensitive to extrinsic factors (mussel growth, temperature, and upwelling, H-5). Hence, keystoneness depended on predator individual traits, predator population variables, and environmental parameters. However, temporal differences in caging experiments suggested that environmental characteristics underlying prey dynamics may be preeminent. Compared to prior experiments, predation was weaker with low prey input compared to periods with high prey input. Collectively, our results suggest that keystone predator evolution depends on the coalescence of species-specific characteristics, and environmental parameters favoring high prey productivity. Our approach may be a model for future studies exploring the generality of keystoneness.

AB  - The ideal water conditions for maximizing the performance of the nursery culture of glass eels harvested from the wild for aquaculture need to be determined for the New Zealand shortfin (Anguilla australis) and longfin (Anguilla dieffenbachii) eels. This study determined the survival and growth of glass eels reared under different temperature and salinity conditions in the laboratory. The growth and survival of shortfin and longfin glass eels reared in salt water (35 parts per thousand) maintained at 25 degrees C was examined over 84 days from capture. The mean specific growth rate (SGR) was higher in shortfin [2.30 +/- 0.29% body weight (b.w.) day(-1)] than longfin glass eels (1.52 +/- 0.06% b.w. day(-1)), and survival was also higher in shortfin (76.0 +/- 4.16%) than for longfin glass eels (28.7 +/- 6.36%). A second experiment identified the effect of salinity (0, 17.5 parts per thousand and 35 parts per thousand) and temperature (17.5 and 26.5 degrees C) on the acclimation, growth performance and survival of shortfin and longfin glass eels over a period of 84 days from capture. There was no incidence of mortality for either shortfin or longfin glass eels reared across all salinity treatments (0 parts per thousand, 17.5 parts per thousand and 35 parts per thousand) at 26.5 degrees C, while survival of shortfin and longfin glass eels reared at 17.5 degrees C was the highest in 17.5 parts per thousand, followed by 35 parts per thousand and 0 parts per thousand treatments. Both temperature and salinity affected the SGR of shortfin glass eels, with the highest SGR observed for shortfin glass eels reared in 0 parts per thousand water maintained at 26.5 degrees C. In longfin glass eels, salinity alone had an effect on the SGR, with the highest SGR observed in glass eels reared in 0 parts per thousand water regardless of the water temperature (17.5 and 26.5 degrees C). In addition, the adaptability of glass eels to salinity was evaluated from the development and the physiological responses of gill chloride cell (CC) morphology. The number and size of CCs increased significantly with increasing salinity in both shortfin and longfin eels.

AB  - The Patagonia frog Atelognathus patagonicus (Anura, Ceratophryidae) is endemic to north-western Patagonia where it inhabits permanent and temporary water bodies in a system of endorheic ponds on the basaltic plateau in and around Laguna Blanca National Park, northwestern Patagonia, Argentina. This Endangered species is emblematic of the decline and extinction of amphibian populations as a result of the introduction of fish to Laguna Blanca. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the patterns of larval development in ponds with different hydroperiods and to evaluate the occurrence of different developmental strategies and their implications for conservation management. In penlianent ponds, A. patagonicus tadpoles showed a double strategy, with the presence of both seasonal (short larval period; metamorphs in the same growing season) and overwintering tadpoles (undergoing metamorphosis the following spring). In temporary ponds, desiccation seems to exert great pressure, with accelerated larval development, resulting in short larval periods. Atelognathus patagonicus showed plasticity in the length of larval development, adjusting to the different hydroperiods observed in these wetlands. As a result of this dual strategy, overwintering tadpoles in permanent ponds are larger than seasonal tadpoles. This notable plasticity in developmental strategy enables this species to colonize widely varying environments. These results highlight the importance of preserving a variety of wetlands, including both temporary and permanent ponds, to allow this species to continue to breed and develop in the face of current and potential anthropogenic disturbance, in particular that caused by the activity of local native pastoralists.

AB  - Due to the ephemeral nature of carcasses they grow on, necrophagous blowfly larvae should minimize the time spent on the cadaver. This could be achieved by moving to high-temperature areas. On that basis, we theorized that larvae placed in a heterogeneous thermal environment would move to the higher temperature that speed up their development. This study was designed to (1) test the ability of necrophagous larvae to orientate in a heterogeneous thermal environment, and (2) compare the temperatures selected by the larvae of three common blowfly species: Lucilia sericata (Meigen), Calliphora vomitoria (L.) and Calliphora vicina (Robineau-Desvoidy). For this purpose, we designed a setup we named Thermograde. It consists of a food-supplied linear thermal gradient that allows larvae to move, feed, and grow in close-to-real conditions, and to choose to stay at a given temperature. For each species and replication, 80 young third instars were placed on the thermal gradient. The location of larvae was observed after 19 h, with fifteen replications per species. The larvae of each species formed aggregations that were always located at the same temperatures, which were highly species-specific: 33.3 +/- 1.52 degrees C for L. sericata, 29.6 +/- 1.63 degrees C for C. vomitoria, and 22.4 +/- 1.55 degrees C for C. vicina. According to the literature, these value allows a fast development of the larvae, but not to reach the maximum development rate. As control experiments clearly demonstrate that larval distribution was not due to differences in food quality, we hypothesized that the local temperature selection by larvae may result from a trade-off between development quality and duration. Indeed, temperature controls not only the development rate of the larvae, but also the quality of their growth and survival rate. Finally, results raise questions regarding the way larvae moved on the gradient and located their preferential temperature.

AB  - The ability of hatchling and juvenile turtles to thermoregulate, as evidenced by selection of preferred temperatures in thermal gradients, is an important factor influencing fitness. Previous studies in laboratory thermal gradients suggest that most young turtles select warm temperatures (25 degrees-33 degrees C) within a narrow range. Confounding factors affecting microhabitat selection, such as predator avoidance, foraging, or social interaction, may influence thermal preference in some species, particularly softshell turtles (Apalone spp.) that frequently bury in the substrate to remain cryptic. We analyzed temperature selection of juvenile Apalone spinifera in an aquatic thermal gradient of 15 degrees-30 degrees C with either gravel, sand, or a combination of sand and no substrate. Across all substrate treatments in the gradient tests, hatchlings selected the warmest temperature available (30 degrees C: 56.1% of observations) and avoided the 2 coldest temperatures (15 degrees C: 5.3%; 18 degrees C: 3.6%). Turtles relocated between chambers more often in control tests than when a gradient was present and fewer observations involved a chamber relocation in control tests. In gradient tests, chamber temperature significantly influenced selection, and the interactive effect of temperature and substrate was significant. We observed turtles more frequently in 30 degrees C in tests conducted with a sand substrate than with a gravel substrate or without a substrate. In tests conducted with sand in the 4 coolest chambers only, turtles chose the warmest temperature with a sand substrate more often than all other temperatures, except 30 degrees C. Our results indicate that hatchling A. spinifera can effectively detect temperature differences and select preferred temperatures within at least a 3 degrees C range and that substrate type may affect selected temperature.

AB  - Heritable variation for fitness components is normally measured under favorable laboratory conditions, but organisms in the held experience variable conditions that are often stressful and may affect the expression of heritable variation. We examined heritable variation for early fecundity in three samples of Drosophila melanogaster from the field. Flies were obtained from a rotting fruit pile in summer, autumn, and spring, and progeny were reared under laboratory conditions. Field parents were tested for fecundity at 14 degrees C or 28 degrees C depending on ambient temperatures. Wing/thorax length ratios measured on flies from the spring collection suggested that flies had developed at around 20 degrees C. Progeny were reared and tested at 14 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 28 degrees C. In the summer collection, parent-offspring regression coefficients were high and significant, compared to nonsignificant values obtained in two of three autumn comparisons. In the spring collection, parent-offspring regressions were negative regardless of testing temperature, suggesting that field females with a high fecundity produced offspring with low scores. Comparisons of F-1 and F-2 laboratory generations indicated intermediate heritabilities for fecundity in the laboratory. The lower bound heritability estimate for fecundity in field individuals was 37% in summer and 59% in autumn. Estimates of field heritability and evolvability for wing length measured in the spring collection were lower than in the laboratory. The results indicate that heritabilities and additive genetic variances for fecundity can be high in field-reared flies, but that results may vary between field collections.

AB  - Copepod females invest a quantity of resources in their reproduction. Depending on several biotic and abiotic factors and their evolutionary history a trade-off can be commonly observed between producing a large number of smaller offspring or a small number of larger offspring. In this study, a multi-generational approach was applied to determine whether a trade-off between clutch size and egg size existed in the copepod Eurytemora affinis under different controlled conditions of temperature and salinity. This protocol was based on the follow-up of reproductive (Clutch Size 'CS', Egg Diameter 'ED') and morphological (Prosome Length 'PL') traits during several generations. Copepods were acclimated to cold (7 degrees C) and warm (20 degrees C) temperatures, and then their reproductive output was tested at the higher temperature of 24 degrees C. CS and ED were positively correlated to PL, so as a first step linear regressions between each reproductive trait and female PL were performed. The residuals from the regression lines of CS and ED with PL were calculated to remove the effect of female size. When the normalized data (residuals) of CS and ED plotted together a negative relationship between egg size and egg number revealed the existence of a trade-off. Copepod populations initially acclimated to cold temperature are commonly characterized by relatively smaller CS and larger ED. Conversely, warm temperature adapted females produced relatively larger CS and smaller ED. After transfer to a temperature of 24 degrees C, the ED did not change but the CS showed high variability indicating stressful conditions and no trade-off was observed. These observations suggest that E. affinis is able to modulate its reproduction depending on the encountered temperature. It seems that this copepod species can shift between a K- and an r-strategy in response to colder or warmer conditions. In a late winter-early spring like cold temperature, copepod females seem to invest more on offspring quality by producing relatively larger eggs. This ecological strategy ensures a high recruitment of the spring generation that is responsible for the strength of the maximum population size usually observed in late spring-early summer (May-June). To the contrary, at summer-like temperature, where the population density decreases significantly in the Seine estuary, copepod females seem to switch from K to r strategy by favoring offspring number compared to offspring size. Finally, the use of a higher temperature of 24 degrees C seems to disrupt the observed reproductive trade-off even after several generations. These results suggest that a switching between K- or r-strategy of E. affinis depends highly on temperature effects. The effect of salinity increase during a summer-like temperature of 20 degrees C as well as after transfer to 24 degrees C decreased PL and CS but the ED did not change significantly.

AB  - We evaluated the temporal dynamics of the aggregate groundfish community, further decomposed into functional groups, individual species abundances, and health indicators, from adjacent management units on the Scotian Shelf. On the colder, eastern half of the shelf, several species collapsed in the early 1990s, while, on the western half, no such collapses were evident despite similar exploitation regimes. The decline in the eastern aggregate biomass was influenced by a decline in average body size, which was interpreted as a past integrator of temperature and size-selective fishing. Biomass of 3 out of 4 functional groups declined in the east; 3 out of 4 groups increased in the west. Some species from the east appear to be slowly compensating, but not enough to counter the decline in aggregate biomass. Species inhabiting the warmer western region show strong evidence of compensation, In effect, warmer waters allow potential compensating species to increase at a faster rate. Quantitative measures of functional group temporal stability revealed no differences between areas; therefore, neither area can be considered stable. Physiological condition declined in many species in both regions. Species that increased in the west, or had slower rates of decline, had higher levels of condition than eastern populations. With the exception of cod in the western region, species growth rates declined in both areas. Although the west appears more stable, it is following a similar, but protracted trajectory, to that found in the east. The protracted response in the west may be due to higher demographic rates in warmer waters. To foster resilience in the western area, we should address the rapid pace of new fisheries, effects of size-selective mortality, and the diminishing number of natural refugia.

AB  - Individuals of Pterochloroides persicae reared under controlled conditions were used to describe the morphometry and biological parameters of instars of this aphid. Our results showed that P. persicae developed four instars before reaching the adult stage. The first and the second larval instars both have five antennal segments, although the others have six segments. A significant difference was observed between instars in the first antennal segment (F = 56.11; df = 4, P = 0.026), in the body length (F = 115.38; df = 4, p = 0.014) and in the cauda length (F = 72, 77; df = 4, p = 0.021). The study of developmental and reproductive performance of P. persicae showed that the first instar lasted for 3.17 days, the second instar 2.35 days, the third instar 4.68 days, the fourth instar 5.035 days and the adult 6.86 days. We demonstrate also that the generation time lasted for 15.26 days. The life span was 22.11 days. As for fecundity, a single female of P. persicae gave birth to 29.68 7.38 nymphs with an average reproductive rate per day of 4.32 +/- 2.16.

AB  - The assertive growth of photovoltaics (PV) will occupy a lot of land resources. There is also a needed land resource to expand the culturing area of Eriocheir sinensis. The aquavoltaic systems offer a potential solution to integrate PV power and E. sinensis culturing. In this study, we cultured E. sinensis in an area of PV panels (PV group) and an area with no PV panels (control group), respectively. The results showed that the weight gain rate, body length, body width, and meat yield of male crabs in the PV group significantly increases. In addition, the moisture of muscles, hepatopancreas, and testes in the PV group has significantly increased, and the total lipids of the hepatopancreas and muscles in the PV group were significantly decreased. Moreover, the PV panels affected the content of eight amino acids in different tissues, including Met, Arg, Cys, Pro, Gly, Leu, Tyr, and His. In addition, several saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) had been significantly influenced by the PV panels. n-ary sumation MUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), n-ary sumation n-3 PUFA, n-ary sumation n-6 PUFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio (p < 0.05) in the PV group had significantly decreased. The results of tissue color showed that the L* value of ovaries was significantly higher than in the control group, and a* and b* values of hepatopancreas were significantly lower. In conclusion, PV panels could promote growth performance and amino acid nutrition of crabs. However, the PV panels had a few negative influences on the fatty acid composition and tissue color.

While deterministic (selection) and stochastic (genetic drift) mechanisms are expected to affect trait evolution, genetic drift may be more important than selection in small populations. We examined relationships between mature adult traits and ecological (abiotic and biotic) variables among 14 populations of brook trout. These naturally fragmented populations have shared ancestry but currently exhibit considerable variability in habitat characteristics and population size (49<N-c<10,032; 3<N-b<567). Body size, shape, and coloration differed among populations, with a tendency for more variation among small populations in both trait means and CV when compared to large populations. Phenotypic differences were more frequently and directly linked to habitat variation or operational sex ratio than to population size, suggesting that selection may overcome genetic drift at small population size. Phenotype-environment associations were also stronger in females than males, suggesting that natural selection due to abiotic conditions may act more strongly on females than males. Our results suggest that natural and sexual-selective pressures on phenotypic traits change during the process of habitat fragmentation, and that these changes are largely contingent upon existing habitat conditions within isolated fragments. Our study provides an improved understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of habitat fragmentation and lends insight into the ability of some small populations to respond to selection and environmental change.

AB  - Locomotion performance in reptiles is deeply associated with habitat use, escape from predators, prey capture, and territory defense. As ectotherms, this trait in lizards is extremely sensitive to body temperature (BT). However, most studies rarely look at locomotion patterns in an ontogenic perspective. The Moorish gecko, Tarentola mauritanica, was used to investigate the possible effects of distinct BTs on the locomotor performance within juveniles and adults. Not surprisingly, adult individuals significantly outperform the juveniles in speed at every BT. Moreover, except in the 30-day-old juveniles, there is a general trend for an increase of speed with BT. The comparison of these speed values with the ones obtained for diurnal lizard species, corroborates the premise that because nocturnal species are subject to low thermal heterogeneity, little selection for behavioral thermoregulation, but strong selection for high performance at relatively cool temperatures are expected. Furthermore, the higher locomotor performance in adults at 29 degrees C, roughly coincides with previously obtained preferred BTs. However, further studies need to be conducted to build the full performance curve, and to validate the existence of coadaption between behavioral thermoregulation and thermal sensitivity of physiological performance. Finally, this study has found that adult males run significantly faster than females at the highest BTs, highlighting the importance in understanding sex differences, and its potential to drive sex-specific behaviors, ecology, and ultimately fitness.

AB  - Rainforest conversion and expansion of plantations in tropical regions are associated with changes in animal communities and biodiversity decline. In soil, Collembola are one of the most numerous invertebrate groups that affect the functioning of microbial communities and support arthropod predators. Despite that, information on the impact of changes in land use in the tropics on species and trait composition of Collembola communities is very limited. We investigated the response of Collembola to the conversion of rainforest into rubber agroforestry ("jungle rubber"), rubber, and oil palm plantations in Jambi Province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region which experienced one of the strongest recent deforestation globally. Collembola were sampled in 2013 and 2016 from the litter and soil layer using heat extraction, and environmental factors were measured (litter C/N ratio, pH, water content, composition of microbial community and predator abundance). In the litter layer, density and species richness in plantation systems were 25%-38% and 30%-40% lower, respectively, than in rainforest. However, in the soil layer, density, species richness, and trait diversity of Collembola were only slightly affected by land-use change, contrasting the response of many other animal groups. Species and trait composition of Collembola communities in litter and soil differed between each of the land-use systems. Water content and pH were identified as main factors related to the differences in species and trait composition in both litter and soil, followed by the density of micro- and macropredators. Dominant species of Collembola in rainforest and jungle rubber were characterized by small body size, absence of furca, and absence of intense pigmentation, while in plantations, larger species with long furca and diffuse or patterned pigmentation were more abundant. Overall, land-use change negatively affected Collembola communities in the litter layer, but its impact was lower in the soil layer. Several pantropical genera of Collembola (i.e., Isotomiella, Pseudosinella, and Folsomides) dominated across land-use systems, reflecting their high environmental adaptability and/or efficient dispersal, calling for studies on their ecology and genetic diversity. The decline in species richness and density of litter-dwelling Collembola with the conversion of rainforest into plantation systems calls for management practices mitigating negative effects of the deterioration of the litter layer in rubber plantations, but even more in oil palm plantations.

AB  - Background: In the wake of climate change many environments will be exposed to increased and more variable temperatures. Knowledge about how species and populations respond to altered temperature regimes is therefore important to improve projections of how ecosystems will be affected by global warming, and to aid management. We conducted a common garden, split-brood temperature gradient (4.5 degrees C, 9.7 degrees C and 12.3 degrees C) experiment to study the effects of temperature in two populations (10 families from each population) of anadromous pike (Esox lucius) that normally experience different temperatures during spawning. Four offspring performance measures (hatching success, day degrees until hatching, fry survival, and fry body length) were compared between populations and among families.
   Results: Temperature affected all performance measures in a population-specific manner. Low temperature had a positive effect on the Harfjarden population and a negative effect on the Lervik population. Further, the effects of temperature differed among families within populations.
   Conclusions: The population-specific responses to temperature indicate genetic differentiation in developmental plasticity between populations, and may reflect an adaptation to low temperature during early fry development in Harfjarden, where the stream leading up to the wetland dries out relatively early in the spring, forcing individuals to spawn early. The family-specific responses to temperature treatment indicate presence of genetic variation for developmental plasticity (G x E) within both populations. Protecting between- and within-population genetic variation for developmental plasticity and high temperature-related adaptive potential of early life history traits will be key to long-term viability and persistence in the face of continued climate change.

AB  - Increasing temperature and CO2 concentrations can alter tritrophic interactions in ecosystems, but the impact of increasingly severe drought on such interactions is not well understood. We examined the response of a wheat-aphid-parasitoid system to variation in water-deficit stress levels. Our results showed that arid area clones of the aphid, Sitobion avenae ( Fabricius), tended to have longer developmental times compared to semiarid and moist area clones, and the development of S. avenae clones tended to be slower with increasing levels of water-deficit. Body sizes of S. avenae clones from all areas decreased with increasing water-deficit levels, indicating their declining adaptation potential under drought. Compared to arid area clones, moist area clones of S. avenae had a higher frequency of backing under severe water stress only, but a higher frequency of kicking under well watered conditions only, suggesting a water-deficit level dependent pattern of resistance against the parasitoid, Aphidius gifuensis (Ashmead). The number of S. avenae individuals attacked by the parasitoid in 10 min showed a tendency to decrease with increasing water-deficit levels. Clones of S. avenae tended to have lower parasitism rates under treatments with higher water-deficit levels. The development of the parasitoid tended to be slower under higher levels of water-deficit stress. Thus, the bottom-up effects of water-deficit stressed plants were negative on S. avenae. However, the top-down effects via parasitoids were compromised by water-deficit, which could favor the growth of aphid populations. Overall, the first trophic level under water-deficit stress was shown to have an indirect and negative impact on the third trophic level parasitoid, suggesting that parasitoids could be increasingly vulnerable in future warming scenarios.

AB  - Self-feeding systems have been extensively used to study animal behaviour and food preferences in vertebrates. In this study, we used a dual-choice self-feeding system to explore feeding behaviour and dietary discrimination based on organoleptic cues. Experimental tanks were provided with 2 self-feeders activated by string sensors and connected to a computer system. In the first experiment (E1) [6 tanks, 10 animals/tank, body weight (BW) 266 g +/- 19.4 g], both feeders delivered the same control standard diet to evaluate the potential preference for one feeder. E1 had 3 phases: 1st, animals were allowed to demand from both feeders; 2nd, from only one feeder and 3rd from both feeders again. The second experiment (E2) (11 tanks, 15 animals/tank, BW range 25-50 g) examined whether seabream can discriminate between 3 isoenergetic diets: the control diet; a positive/palatable diet containing high levels of fish, squid and krill meal; and a negative diet in which 1.5% quinine hydrochloride was added to the control diet. E2 had 3 phases: 1st acclimation with control diet; 2nd dual-choice; 3rd dualchoice with reversal of feeders. The third experiment (E3) (8 tanks, 10 animals/tank, BW range 25-50 g) was performed using a single self-feeder per tank, with each tank being fed either control or quinine diet, to corroborate the aversive response to quinine in the absence of dietary choice. E1 demonstrated that animals demanded significantly less when only one feeder/sensor was available. E2 shows that seabream can easily discriminate a bitter compound (quinine) in the diet, showing negative preference (P < 0.05) in both phases, 2nd and 3rd. When no choice was available (E3), seabream equally demanded control or quinine diet, presumably driven by its energy requirements. However, the presence of the bitter substance increased feed refusals, 14.3% rejection of demanded feed in quinine diet, versus 2.6% in control diet, indicating a role of sensory systems in assessing food quality. A positive conditioning with a palatable diet was not effective and no positive choices were measured over a basal diet, although results were possibly influenced by the previous familiarization with the basal diet and by the experimental conditions (fast growing juveniles at high temperature). This poor dietary selection during active feeding periods could partly explain the easy adaptation of this species to substitution diets. Finally, results suggest that food intake is conditioned by agonistic behaviour in an age-dependent manner. The information will be useful for diet and feeding strategy design in seabream.

AB  - Multiple temperature-age constraints for eight H-chondrite samples have been used to provide insight into the thermal history of their parent-body through combination with numerical models of thermal evolution assuming internal heating by Al-26 and conductive cooling. The effect of spreading accretion out over time is the principal focus of this work. A wide range of body size and date of accretion is systematically tested for different values of accretion rate in order to quantify and illustrate the parameter space that is consistent with the available thermo-chronological data. We conclude that the H-chondrite samples considered have a thermal history consistent with a parent body that at some stage had a concentric 'onion-shell' internal structure. That body had a radius no larger than 130 km, and accretion most probably took place over a time interval on the order of 0.0-0.2 Myr, approximately 2 Myr after CAI condensation. In any case, the time interval of accretion is unlikely to have been more than 0.5 Myr supporting evidence in favour of rapid accretion, possibly through reassembly of the fragments of an earlier generation of bodies. Furthermore, the H-chondrites studied here are inferred to have come from a wide depth range within the body where they experienced metamorphism, indicating that preservation of the onion-shell structure is unlikely. The presence of an insulating regolith does not modify this conclusion, as appropriate thermal histories for the three H6 samples considered cannot be reproduced at depths near the surface. Asteroid 6-Hebe may be the parent body of the H-chondrites, but the high bulk density of the latter is difficult to reconcile with a 'rubble-pile' structure of pure H-chondrite material. Finally, optimized thermal histories are used to constrain the temperatures characterizing boundaries between petrological types (800, 1000, and 1140 K for the H3/4, H4/5, and H5/6 boundaries respectively). In detail, the type 6 samples studied here are inferred to have experienced a similar peak temperature (on the order of 1180 K), but spent different times at that temperature, while samples of lower metamorphic grade experienced different peak temperature, but spent more or less the same time within 10 K of peak temperature (on the order of 1 Ma). These results constitute a quantitative framework within which variations in petrographic and textural properties may be interpreted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many species of bats live in dynamic associations in which individuals aggregate or split into smaller or larger groups, moving between roost sites, but factors influencing group size and roost switching decisions in bats living in fission-fusion societies are poorly understood. To test the extent to which fission-fusion dynamics are species-specific and shaped by environmental factors, we radio-tracked two closely related species: noctule bats Nyctalus noctula and Leisler's bats N. leisleri in well-preserved, old-growth stands of the Biaowiea Forest, where roost availability and diversity is high and bats can potentially freely exhibit fission-fusion behaviour. We estimated the number of bats per roost and noted the tree species selected as roost sites. We evaluated the influence of ambient temperature and roost tree species on bat group size and the process of roost switching, and their seasonal component. Our results revealed that bat group size showed species-specific differences in seasonal variation, relationship to ambient temperature and tree species. The number of noctule bats emerging from a roost was relatively stable with a weak tendency to decrease during the breeding season while the number of Leisler's bats emerging from a roost increased when the juveniles started to be volant. Group size of noctule bats increased with ambient temperature. Leisler's bats formed smaller colonies in oaks and ashes than in other tree species. Roost switching rate was associated with ambient temperature and tree species selected by the bats. The bats changed roosts more frequently when the minimum ambient temperature increased, and less often in ashes than in oaks and other tree species. Our results show that bat group size and roost switching behaviour are shaped by both environmental factors and the stage of reproduction.Significance statementEnvironmental factors may affect group size and roost switching behaviour of bats forming fission-fusion associations, but this is expected to vary depending on body size, environmental conditions, as well as seasonally. Few studies have explored this behaviour in tree-dwelling bats and examined how it differs between species. Here, we studied the group size dynamics and the process of roost switching in closely related bat species living in well-preserved, European old-growth forests, for which the knowledge of these patterns is particularly poor. We demonstrate for the first time that bat group size and roost switching rate relates to roost tree species selected by bats, the ambient temperature and varies seasonally, and that these effects are species-specific. The results point out the importance of the availability of suitable roost trees providing a range of microclimatic conditions for maintaining efficient fission-fusion dynamics throughout the reproductive period.

AB  - Background: Producing high quality sterile males is vital in Aedes aegypti rear-and-release birth control strategies. Larval diets, rearing temperatures, and their interactions determine the accumulation rates of essential nutrients in larvae, but these factors have been understudied in relation to mass-rearing techniques for producing eminent males.
   Methods: We compared the effects of two larval diets, a cereal-legume-based diet (Khan's diet) and a standard larval diet developed in the FAO/IAEA Insect Pest Control Laboratory (IAEA 2 diet). Diets were tested at selected temperatures for both larval and male adult life history traits, adult extreme temperature tolerance, and mating capacity relative to energy reserves of reared male adult Ae. aegypti.
   Results: Khan's diet resulted in shorter immature development time at each test temperature (except for 25 degrees C) than an IAEA 2 diet. Larvae reared at 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C with Khan's diet demonstrated low pupation rates (c.80%). We accounted for these phenomena as secondary sex ratio manipulation, because a higher proportion of male adults emerged at 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C than that for the IAEA 2 diet. In general, the pupal development time shortened as temperature increased, resulting in higher teneral energy reserves in male mosquitoes. High energy reserves allowed male mosquitoes reared with Khan's diet to have higher adult longevity (5-6 days longer when sugar-fed and 2-3 days longer when water-fed) and tolerance of heat stress than those fed on the IAEA 2 diet. The IAEA 2 diet produced larger male mosquitoes than Khan's diet did: mosquitoes fed on Khan's diet were 1.03-1.05 times smaller than those fed on the IAEA 2 diet at 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C. No evidence indicated reduced mating capacity for small mosquitoes fed on Khan's diet.
   Conclusions: Larvae reared at 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C with Khan's diet were characterized by shorter immature development time compared with those fed on the IAEA 2 diet. Adult mosquitoes produced from that larval rearing condition exhibited a significant male bias, long lifespan, and better endurance against extreme temperatures relative to energy reserves. Thus, the larval diet at rearing temperature of 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C optimized rearing techniques for the sterile insect programmes. However, mating competitiveness and flight performance of adult males require further investigation.

AB  - Timing of reproduction can help adjust the lifecycle of a species to coincide with biotic and abiotic conditions favorable for the growth and survival of its young. In fishes, factors related to the selection of spawning time include temperature regime, abundance and distribution of prey, and density-dependent feedbacks between population size, growth, survival, and reproduction. An individual-based model for young-of-year largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) is presented. The model is then used to explore how these factors interact to determine optimal spawning time, defined here as that spawning time for which the total biomass of a cohort of bass at one year of age is maximized. When food intake per individual was assumed to be independent of population size, a broad peak in total cohort biomass occurred at intermediate spawning temperatures. With the addition of density dependence in food intake, a nearly constant total biomass was attained across a range of prescribed spawning temperatures. When largemouth bass spawned at different times within a year competed for a common food resource, those spawned earliest tended to produce the greatest total biomass. Fish representing a variety of spawning strategies were able to coexist over 15 simulated generations, however, because the number of offspring produced by any one strategy was limiting by the availability of prey of suitable size. Simulation results argue that recruitment success should not be assessed until well after young begin feeding, as density-dependent factors will determine the relative success of cohorts that survive adverse environmental conditions.

AB  - The microstructure, mechanical response, and failure behavior of lead free solder joints in electronic assemblies are constantly evolving when exposed to isothermal aging and/or thermal cycling environments. In our prior work on aging effects, we have demonstrated that the observed material behavior degradations of Sn-Ag-Cu (SAC) lead free solders during room temperature aging (25 C) and elevated temperature aging (50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 C) were unexpectedly large. The measured stress-strain data demonstrated large reductions in stiffness, yield stress, ultimate strength, and strain to failure (up to 50%) during the first 6 months after reflow solidification. In this study, we have used both accelerated life testing and finite element modeling to explore how prior isothermal aging affects the overall reliability of PBGA packages subjected to thermal cycling. In the experimental work, an extensive test matrix of thermal cycling reliability testing has been performed using a test vehicle incorporating several sizes (5, 10, 15, 19 mm) of BGA daisy chain components with 0.4 and 0.8 mm solder joint pitches (SAC305). PCB test boards with 3 different surface finishes (ImAg, ENIG and ENEPIG) were utilized. In this paper, we concentrate on the reporting the results for a PBGA component with 15 mm body size.
   Before thermal cycling began, the assembled test boards were divided up into test groups that were subjected to several sets of aging conditions (preconditioning) including 0, 6, and 12 months aging at T = 125 degrees C. After aging, the assemblies were subjected to thermal cycling (-40 to +125 degrees C) until failure occurred. The Weibull data failure plots have demonstrated that the thermal cycling reliabilities of pre-aged assemblies were significantly less than those of non-aged assemblies.
   A three-dimensional finite element model of the tested 15 mm PBGA packages was also developed. The cross-sectional details of the solder ball and the internal structure of the BGA were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to capture the real geometry of the package. Simulations of thermal cycling from -40 to 125 C were performed. To include the effects of aging in the calculations, we have used a revised set of Anand viscoplastic stress-strain relations for the SAC305 Pb-free solder material that includes material parameters that evolve with the thermal history of the solder material. The accumulated plastic work (energy density dissipation) was used as the failure variable; and the Darveaux approach to predict crack initiation and crack growth was applied with aging dependent parameters to estimate the fatigue lives of the studied packages. We have obtained good correlation between our new reliability modeling procedure that includes aging and the measured solder joint reliability data. As expected from our prior studies on degradation of SAC material properties with aging, the reliability reductions were more severe for higher aging temperature and longer aging times.

AB  - This paper investigates the constructal design of a body where a rectangular open cavity intruded into a trapezoidal solid by taking the maximum dimensionless thermal resistance minimisation as the optimisation objective in the most fundamental sense. Two cases, i.e. body with heat generation and body heated externally, are considered. The numerical results indicate that for the two cases, the more slender the cavity, the safer the thermal system. In addition, in thermal design and management, the effect of heat origin on the system safety should be taken into account sufficiently. The triple optimisation results show that the optimum ratio of left body height to right body height for the two cases approach each other relatively; the double optimum ratios of right body height to body length for body with heat generation are smaller than those for body heated externally when the ratio of cavity height to cavity length is from 0.01 to 2, while the former are equal or similar to the latter when the ratio of cavity height to cavity length is from 2 to 4, and the former are bigger than the latter when the ratio of cavity height to cavity length is from 4 to 10.

AB  - To examine the effects of incubation temperature and moisture levels on embryonic development and posthatching growth and behavior, we incubated a total of 123 eggs collected from 18 wild female Cuban rock iguanas at 28.0, 29.5, or 31.0 C on wet (-150 kPa), moist (-550 kPa), or dry (-1100 kPa) substrates. Although there was no effect of incubation temperature or water availability on egg survival, larger females exhibited higher infertility and greater mortality of initially viable eggs, suggesting that reproductive senescence may occur in this long-lived species, Incubation temperature, although it had little influence on size at hatching, significantly affected several measures of growth, including changes in body length, mass, and head dimensions. In general, hatchlings from higher incubation temperatures grew faster during their first year. However, by 16 months of age, growth rates no longer varied among hatchlings incubated at different temperatures. Incubation temperature had no detectable effect on thermal selection by hatchlings at 14 to 16 months of age, as there was no tendency for hatchlings incubated at higher temperatures to preferentially select higher basking temperatures. Moisture levels during incubation did not significantly affect size, growth, or thermoregulatory behavior of hatchlings. These results have important implications for understanding how environmental conditions experienced during embryonic development may affect future fitness and survivorship.

AB  - The potential impacts of climate change on marine planktonic ecosystems remain difficult to predict. Climate forcing can alter nutrient availability and predator community composition, and here we show that these shifts may dramatically alter plankton trophic structure, size distributions and biomass. We modeled phytoplankton and zooplankton as a highly resolved size spectrum with size-dependent nutrient uptake and predation and analyzed the model both as a size spectrum and as a food web. Model results identified 2 distinct regimes defined by the average zooplankton feeding preferences. Regime I communities, where planktonic predators are specialists or large relative to prey, had low omnivory, many top predators, low connectance and relatively flat size spectra. Regime II communities, where predators are generalists or small relative to prey, had a high degree of omnivory, no top predators, high connectance and steep size spectra. Model ecosystems with generalist predators had lower size diversity, smaller plankton and gappier size distributions than ecosystems with specialist predators. Nutrient availability had little influence on trophic structure but strongly impacted size structure and biomass. Most surprisingly, phytoplankton biomass sometimes decreased with added nutrients if predators were small relative to prey, implying that both predators and nutrients mediate shifts between bottom-up and top-down control. Based on our synthesized estimates of size-selective feeding parameters, we infer that size and trophic structure should be strongly affected by abundances of generalist, bloom-forming taxa such as salps and jellyfish, many of which are responsive to ocean temperature. Size-selective feeding fundamentally affects community structure and is a likely mechanism of change in planktonic ecosystems where community composition varies with temperature.

AB  - The earlier mean adult emergence between males and females, protandry, has been well studied mathematically and in comparative studies. However, quantitative and evolutionary genetic research on protandry is scarce. The butterfly, Bicyclus anynana exhibits protandry and here we selected for each of the different combinations of male and female development time in this species, thus including direct selection on protandry (i.e., FAST, fast males and fast females; SLOW, slow males and slow females; FMSF, fast males and slow females; and SMFF, slow males and fast females). After eight generations of selection there was no significant response for increased or decreased protandry, whereas selection for increased or decreased development time in both sexes (FAST or SLOW) was successful. Continued selection (> 30 generations) for decreased or increased protandry showed a significant difference between the FMSFC and SMFFC lines (subscript c for continued selection), which was of the same magnitude as the nonsignificant difference observed between the FMSF and SMFF lines at generation eight. This indicated that the initial selection was successful, but that the difference between the lines did not increase with continued selection. Our results also indicate that the genetic covariance across sexes for development time is near unity. Interestingly, lines selected for decreased protandry (SMFF) had lower egg-to-adult survival, and broods from these lines had lower rates of egg hatching. This suggests that interactions with fertility might constrain certain directions of change in patterns of protandry. Moreover, selection yielded a change in the ratio of male to female development time for slow lines, suggesting that some amount of sex-specific genetic variance for development time is still present in this population. The FMSFC line showed the largest effect of selection on protandry, mainly through an effect on female developmental time. Lastly, our results show that temperature has an effect on the amount of protandry in the selected lines. These results are discussed in relation to the ecology of this species and the evolution of protandry.

AB  - Many aquarium fish species have diverse morphotypes. Since different morphotypes may have different preferences for various prey items, offering a single prey species is inadequate for successful aquaculture.Poecilia reticulata, a popular aquarium species, occurs in different morphotypes. To test whether the four morphotypes (yellow tail YT, red tail RT, metallic blue tail MBT and black tail BT) of this fish prefer different items, we quantified somatic growth, feeding behaviour, zooplankton selectivity and functional responses. Standard length (4.5 vs. 11.7 mm) and gape size (0.37 vs. 0.91 mm) of four morphotypes increased linearly with larval age; YT and RT had 25% longer body length and larger gape than the others. Prey encounters, attacks, captures and ingestions increased with larval age. Lowest ingestion rates were recorded for the RT morphotype on rotifers. At any given larval age, prey consumption increased with increasing prey availability. During the fourth and fifth weeks, larval YT and RT consumed higher number (37 +/- 1 ind./predator/30 min) of cladocerans compared with other two morphotypes (24 +/- 1 ind./predator/30 min). Prey selectivity data showed that larvae of MBT and BT continued to prefer rotifers up to 4 weeks, while those of YT and RT preferred cladocerans during the 4th week.

AB  - It is generally believed that harsh climate inhibits growth and development of ectotherms at high latitudes. However, this environmental effect may be counterbalanced by countergradient genetic variation and habitat selection. While there is laboratory evidence for genetically based increases in growth and development rates in amphibians living at high latitudes, it remains unclear how environmental and genetic effects combine in the field to produce gradients of phenotypic variation. We performed a field study on the growth and development of tadpoles and habitat selection of breeding adults of the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) in Denmark and in Estonia where the average onset of breeding differs by 12 days. Although growth and development of Estonian tadpoles trailed Danish conspecifics during the first half of the larval period. Estonian tadpoles caught up in both body length and developmental stage to Danish tadpoles in the last third of the larval period. Breeding ponds in Denmark were significantly larger and deeper than in Estonia, however, the water temperatures in the ponds did not vary substantially between the countries. In Estonia the toads selected shallower breeding ponds with higher temperature and oxygen concentrations, suggesting, that at higher latitudes active selection of specific water bodies ensures faster growth and development of larvae. The results, together with previous laboratory evidence, indicate that amphibian distribution limits are shaped both by adaptive differences in developmental rates and behavioural plasticity. To cope with harsh climates, amphibians in the north apparently require shallow water bodies - a habitat particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic degradation.

AB  - This study employed high-throughput quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing to evaluate the effect of temperature and residual antibiotics on the dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microbial communities during anaerobic digestion of swine manure. The abundances of total ARGs and 16S rRNA genes significantly decreased in all of four treatments (25 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 37 degrees C with 50 mg of wet weight antibiotics of body weight, and 55 degrees C). The abundances of most ARG types were significantly correlated with those of the 16S rRNA gene and transposase gene (P < 0.01). However, the abundances of total ARGs at 55 degrees C were much higher than those of other treatments. Meanwhile, the microbial communities at 55 degrees C, where the Streptococcus pathogen remained at a relatively high abundance and cellulose degraders and hydrogen producers, such as Ethanoligenens and Coprococcus bacteria, increased, were markedly different from those of other treatments. Redundancy analysis indicates that temperature, pH, and the genus Streptococcus had the highest explanation for ARG variation among experimental factors, chemical properties, and representative genera, respectively. Network analysis further showed that the genus Streptococcus contributed greatly to the higher ARG abundance at 55 degrees C. The moderate antibiotic residue only caused a slight and transitory inhibition for microbially diverse populations and promotion for ARG abundance, probably due to the degradation of antibiotics and microbial adaptability. Our results clarify the cooperativity of gene transfer-related items on ARG variation and intensively prove that higher temperature cannot always achieve better ARG removal in anaerobic digestion unless pathogens and gene transfer elements are more efficiently inhibited.
   IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are frequently detected with high abundance in manure-applied soils. Anaerobic digestion is one of widely used processes for animal waste treatment. Thus, it is critical to understand the potential of anaerobic digestion to attenuate ARGs. Although some previous studies recommended thermophilic digestion for ARG removal, they did not get sufficient evidence to support this view. The antibiotics applied to animals are mostly excreted through feces and urine because of incomplete metabolism. It is indispensable to know whether residual antibiotics in manure will hinder ARG attenuation in anaerobic digesters. The significance of our research is in comprehensively understanding the evolution and mechanism of ARGs in anaerobic digestion of swine manure affected by temperature and residual antibiotics, which will allow the development of an ARG elimination strategy before their release into the environment.

CP  - 53rd Electronic Components and Technology Conference
AB  - Intel Pentium(R) 4 ushered a new IA-32 architecture with a jump in performance from. the previous generation microprocessors. Higher core frequency, higher bus speed and new architecture features needed very competitive package designs. The demand on packaging to match such product performance necessitated development of new technologies. This paper describes development and implementation of package technologies for two generations of silicon processes of Pentium 4 as well as for intra-process shrink variations of the die for various applications. Pentium 4 is the new IA-32 architecture processor for use in multiple platforms. In addition to Desktop and Mobile segments, enhanced versions are for use in workstation and server systems also. The Mobile market segment is further divided into Full Feature, Thin & Light and Mini-Note sub-segments with the respective Performance and Value subdivisions. Likewise, the Desktop segment is divided into Performance, Mainstream and Value sub-segments whereas the IA-32 Server segment is subdivided into UP (Uni-Processor), DP (Dual-Processor) & MP (Multi-Processor) catering different market sub-segments.
   Pentium 4 debuted in 0.18 mum Si process with successive migration to 0.13 mum process. It had a roadmap of progressively higher clock frequencies and bus frequencies. The initial packaging for 0.18 mum process Pentium 4 was done using an Interposer type package, which consisted of an OLGA substrate with (flip-chip-attached die) surface mounted on a (through-pin type) PGA interposer at 1.21 mm diagonal pitch. This two-part solution looked unattractive from overall package parasitics as well as line item management perspectives. Therefore, a new organic PGA package called FCPGA was employed with surface mount attached pins at 1.27 mm square pitch. This enabled achieving a socketable package with a single piece part. In addition to eliminating 2 piece parts for packaging, this new package allowed the body size reduction from 53.3 mm to 35.0 mm. It also dramatically improved the package and pin parasitics to allow more robust electrical performance. The product architecture employs the Netburst architecture for turbo performance. The overall power associated with the processor, along with the di/dt posed a challenge for the package design.
   The methodology of designing decoupling capacitor schemes for the packages is described. Power delivery improvement was a major part of the design analysis activities with the package and system level issues considered. I/O performance was analyzed for different design feature parameters ensuring signal integrity. Optimization of design rules for balancing the layout and cost drivers is described. The product performance and cost in the 0.18 mum Si process were optimized by successive die shrinks. The packaging approach to address such cases is also discussed. The socket parameters for the two package types are also compared. The package model and simulation results for package parameter variation are shown. The thermal-electrical reliability aspects of the package parameters were considered to ensure that the package would perform reliably both on a global and local basis. This was especially important in view of the significant power density variation and current demand variation over the die area. Thermal power management was challenging due to the system level cost constraints. Thermal interface material development done for improved thermal resistances is described with the thermal solutions of the packages described briefly. Finally, the future direction of packaging for Intel processors is discussed.

AB  - Increases in temperatures over the last century, more intensively after the eighties, were recorded in several databases for the south-eastern Brazil. These increases are likely to change fish communities in aquatic systems by decreasing abundances, biomass and sizes of some species more sensitive to climate change. Reservoirs may be particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change, as they isolate previously connected areas limiting fish dispersal and migration, as well as increasing water temperature and thermal stratification. We assessed temporal changes in the abundance and biomass of the ichthyofauna in an isolate reservoir (inflowing waters from small tributaries in a highland region) aiming to associate changes with climate effects over three decades (1990, 2000, 2010). Two abundant native species, a loricariid Loricariichthys castaneus (Castelnau, 1855) and a cichlid Geophagus brasiliensis (Quoy & Gaimard, 1824), were selected to assess eventual response to climate changes in their geographical distribution in the Southeast Atlantic Hydrographic Region, considering different carbon emission scenarios using ecological niche models. A decrease in the densities and biomass of the ichthyofauna and of the two selected species were observed in both summer and winter over the three decades, coinciding with increases in temperatures. These decreases were correlated with increases in positive anomalies of temperature, which may be an indicator of climatic changes, although with low explanation of the data variation. The mean size of L. castaneus decreased between the nineties and 2010, whereas no significant trend was found for the size of G. brasiliensis. Our predictions of new area for future adequacy indicated a loss in the distribution area for both species (mainly for G. brasiliensis), considering the most pessimistic scenario for 2050 and 2070, possibly due to climatic changes. Both hydroelectric dams and global warming pose threats to freshwater fish diversity, and both will interact. Changes observed in the fish assemblage over the last decades were essential for an assessment of the consequences of global warming in this type of reservoir combining larger scale studies with future projections.

AB  - Intra-species morphological variation presents a considerable problem for species identification and can result in taxonomic confusion. This is particularly pertinent for species of Neobenedenia which are harmful agents in captive fish populations and have historically been identified almost entirely based on morphological characters. This study aimed to understand how the morphology of Neobenedenia girellae varies with host fish species and the environment. Standard morphological features of genetically indistinct parasites from various host fish species were measured under controlled temperatures and salinities. An initial field-based investigation found that parasite morphology significantly differed between genetically indistinct parasites infecting various host fish species. The majority of the morphological variation observed (60%) was attributed to features that assist in parasite attachment to the host (i.e. the posterior and anterior attachment organs and their accessory hooks) which are important characters in monogenean taxonomy. We then experimentally examined the effects of the interaction between host fish species and environmental factors (temperature and salinity) on the morphology of isogenic parasites derived from a single, isolated hermaphroditic N. girellae infecting barramundi, Lates calcarifer. Experimental infection of L. calcarifer and cobia, Rachycentron canadum, under controlled laboratory conditions did not confer host-mediated phenotypic plasticity in N. girellae, suggesting that measured morphological differences could be adaptive and only occur over multiple parasite generations. Subsequent experimental infection of a single host species, L calcarifer, at various temperatures (22, 30 and 32 degrees C) and salinities (35 and 40 parts per thousand) showed that in the cooler environments (22 degrees C) N. girellae body proportions were significantly smaller compared with warmer temperatures (30 and 32 degrees C; P < 0.0001), whereas salinity had no effect. This is evidence that temperature can drive phenotypic plasticity in key taxonomic characters of N. girellae under certain environmental conditions.

AB  - 1. Understanding the ecological forces that are responsible for the evolution and coexistence of closely related sympatric species is a major interest in evolutionary ecology. In a freshwater system context, flocks or pairs of sympatrically occurring fishes are commonly studied to identify causes and mechanisms of ecological divergence and speciation.
   2. Whereas habitat and diet segregation along the pelagic-benthic axis is frequent in many species pairs in temperate freshwaters, two pelagic planktivores coexist in the post-glacial Lake Stechlin, Germany (common vendace, Coregonus albula and the endemic Fontane cisco, C. fontanae). Accordingly, disruptive selection on traits not related to feeding may have contributed to divergence. Since both species differ slightly in their vertical distribution, species-specific physiological adaptations related to temperature are likely.
   3. We investigated standard and active metabolic rates (AMR) over the range of environmental temperature, which both species experience naturally (4-15 degrees C). Eighty-four specimens of 7-22 cm length were exposed to five relative flow velocities between 0.5 and 2.0 body lengths per second (BL s(-1)) in swim tunnel respirometers.
   4. Fontane cisco showed a reduced standard metabolic rate (SMR) compared to vendace over the entire temperature range. Further, activity metabolism was associated with lower energetic costs in Fontane cisco at 4 degrees C, but higher costs than in vendace at 8 degrees C and 15 degrees C. Total metabolic costs when swimming at 2 BL s(-1) were higher for vendace at < 8 degrees C, but higher for Fontane cisco if temperature exceeds 8 degrees C.
   5. The results indicate that species-specific physiological adaptations contribute to ecological divergence, thus preventing competitive exclusion between the pelagic coregonids of Lake Stechlin. The existence of a vertical gradient in water temperature was probably a crucial factor for the evolution of both competing temperature-related physiological strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary Amphibians have weak dispersal abilities and are sensitive to environmental changes, resulting in their disproportionately high risk of extinction, with many species' populations rapidly declining. Therefore, it is critical for amphibian conservation to understand their adaptive potential by exploring how amphibians respond to environmental changes based on morphological variations. Our results showed that morphological traits of Feirana taihangnica significantly differed among ages. Along with the increase in annual mean temperature, snout-vent length showed an anti-hump trend, indicating no support for Bergmann's rule. Mean ultraviolet-B of the highest and lowest months were positively and negatively correlated with head width, thigh length and tibia width, respectively. The present study can help understand the effects of environmental changes on morphological variations of this mountain frog species and its adaptive potential, providing important implications for species conservation. The Taihangshan swelled-vented frog (Feirana taihangnica), an endemic species to the Qinling Mountains, central China, has experienced a dramatic population decline over the last few decades. The aim of this work was to quantify morphological variation in F. taihangnica across the Qinling Mountains and examine environmental correlates of this variation of morphological traits. We implemented a hierarchical partitioning to estimate the independent contribution of each environmental variable on morphological variations. Temperature seasonality was the greatest contributor in variations of snout-vent length (SVL) and head width, and ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation of the lowest month was the most influential on both thigh length and tibia width. Then, we used generalized additive models to analyze the relationship between each environmental factor and morphological trait variations. Along the increasing of annual mean temperature, SVL decreased firstly and then increased, indicating no support for Bergmann's rule. Furthermore, SVL was negatively correlated with annual precipitation, while positively with temperature seasonality. The mean UV-B of the highest and lowest months was positively and negatively correlated with head width, thigh length and tibia width, respectively. The results of this study help us to understand adaptive potential of this mountain frog species via morphological variations in the light of environmental changes.

AB  - During 1989 ovigerous females of Calanus finmarchicus were sampled in fjord areas near Tromso, northern Norway, at seawater temperatures of 4-5-degrees-C. The offspring were cultivated at 1.5-2-degrees-C to naupliar stage III-VI, and then separated into three different temperature regimes almost-equal-to 40 days after hatching. A significant difference in abundance and stage composition in the three different experimental series evolved within 6 days after differentiation in temperatures, and greater similarities were found for those series which experienced a temperature increase. The stage composition of C. finmarchicus in the three different series was equal at the start of the experiments with the dominance of nauplius stage IV (NIV). In one series, with a constant temperature increase of 0.2-degrees-C day-1, the populations gradually changed into copepodites and a small proportion appeared as copepodite stage IV (CIV) in the period 18-24 days after incubation. At a lower rate of temperature increase (i.e., 0.1-degrees-C day-1) CIV did not appear in the populations, and only three copepodite stage II (CII) and one copepodite stage III (CIII) were found at the end of the experiment. In a third series at a constant temperature of 2-degrees-C population abundance decreased constantly throughout the experimental period, and only a low proportion of the population appeared as copepodite stage I (CI) at Day 18. A tendency for arrested development was observed since CI was not present in the populations at Day 24. The present experiments demonstrate that C. finmarchicus is dependent on a certain temperature increase for successful stage development at low temperatures. However, the results differ from earlier experiments conducted in 1980 on the same species from the same region, since the naupliar developmental rates at 2-degrees-C obtained in 1980 were definitely higher than those obtained in 1989. The overwintering temperature, which female C. finmarchicus experienced, differed markedly between 1980 and 1989. This indicates that different overwintering temperatures experienced by adults could shift the low temperature tolerance of the offspring. The formulated hypothesis for ontogenetic differences in the physiological response to temperature in C. finmarchicus (Tande, 1988) must also be considered in relation to the possibility that the maternal acclimation to the overwintering temperature could modify the rate-temperature response in the offspring later in the spring. This means that caution should be applied when adopting the commonly used empirical temperature functions for estimating stage durations of copepods in high-latitude environments until the possible effect of acclimation has been ruled out in quantitative terms.

AB  - Nocturnal geckos are active at body temperatures 10-35 degrees C below the thermal optima for maximum rate of aerobic metabolism ((V) over dot (o2max)) of diurnal lizards. Therefore, given ancestral (diurnal) lizard physiology, nocturnality causes a substantial thermal handicap in locomotor performance. In prior studies, we hypothesized that a low minimum cost of locomotion (C-min) in geckos was an adaptation that increased locomotor endurance capacity at low, nocturnal temperatures. However, C-min is only part of an integrated system that, in conjunction with the maximum rate of oxygen consumption, sets the maximum speed that can be sustained aerobically (termed the maximum aerobic speed or MAS). We conducted the first phylogenetic analysis of MAS and (V) over dot (o2max) in lizards and found that the greatest changes in MAS, C-min and (V) over dot (o2max) (at activity temperatures) in the evolutionary history of lizards all coincided with the evolution of nocturnality in geckos. Geckos active at 15-25 degrees C did not become optimized for nocturnal temperatures, or fully offset the thermal effects of nocturnality by evolving maximal rates of oxygen consumption comparable to diurnal lizards active at 35 degrees C. Geckos did evolve MAS twice that of diurnal lizards running at low temperatures by evolving a remarkably low C-min. Allometric analysis and phylogenetically independent contrasts of (V) over dot (o2max), C-min, and MAS indicate a 72% evolutionary decrease in (V) over dot (o2max) (at activity temperatures) and a 50% evolutionary decrease in C-min concordant with the evolution of nocturnality in geckos. Experimental measurements show that decreased C-min in six species of gecko increased MAS by 50-120% compared to diurnal lizards at low temperatures; Thus, geckos sufficiently overcame the near paralyzing effects of nocturnal temperatures, but only offset about 50% of the decrease in MAS resulting from the low maximum rate of oxygen consumption. Although the nocturnal environment remains severely suboptimal, the evolution of a low cost of locomotion in the ancestor of geckos was highly adaptive for nocturnality. We also present a generalized approach to ecophysiological evolution that integrates phylogeny with the causal relationships among environment, physiology, and performance capacity. With respect to a clade, two hypotheses are central to our integrative approach: (1) a change of an environmental variable (e.g., temperature) causes a performance handicap; and (2) evolution of a physiological variable (e.g., minimum cost of locomotion [C-min]) increases performance in the derived environment. To test the hypothesis that evolution of a physiological variable is adaptive in nature, we suggest determining if individuals in nature perform at levels exceeding the performance capacity of their hypothetical ancestors and if this additional performance capacity is due to the evolution of the physiological variable in question.

AB  - Increasing abalone growth rates and their physiological efficiency in the use of energy through selective breeding could improve abalone production. High potential responses to selection for growth traits have been estimated in several abalone species; however, the genetic bases underlying individual differences in physiological performance are unknown. The aims of this study were to estimate the heritable variation of physiological traits associated with energy intake and allocation for the red abalone Haliotis rufescens; and the potential correlated responses to selection between growth and physiological traits at three developmental stages. Growth traits (shell length and width, and total mass) and physiological traits [energy intake, standard metabolic rate (SMR), and energy losses by ammonia excretion and feces] were measured in individuals belonging to 60 full-sib families in 2-years old juveniles, 3-y old young adults, and 4-y old near-harvest adult (n = 500-380 individuals/age; total n = 1300). Food intake showed significant h(2) in juveniles and young adults (0.37 and 0.14, respectively); but near zero h(2) in near-harvest adults. Variation in energy required for SMR showed low but significant h(2) (0.13) in young and near-harvest adults. Variation in energy lost through ammonia excretion showed significant h2 in juveniles (0.33) and in near-harvest adults (0.14). Heritability for variation in the energy losses through feces was not significant. Heritabilities for growth traits were all moderate to high and significant for young and pre-harvest adults, but were not significant for juveniles. At the young adult stage, food intake was negatively and highly genetically correlated with each of the growth traits (-0.70 to -0.85); and at the near-harvest adult stage both SMR and ammonia excretion showed high-negative genetic correlations with each growth trait (-0.88 to -1.00). Thus, estimated correlated response to selection indicated that if selection was exerted for higher growth (choosing 5% best individuals), we would be indirectly selecting for abalones with lower food intake (correlated responses of -11 to -15%); or lower metabolic demands of (-14 to -24%), if the selection was applied to young or near-harvest adults, respectively. In turn, shell length could be enhanced up to 18% per generation. These results suggest that higher growth in red abalone is genetically associated with a more efficient use of food and a lower metabolic demand. The possibility to reduce food intake or metabolic demands by selecting for faster growing abalones would be a very positive development for the sustainability of this culture.

AB  - Background: Climate change is leading to increased water temperatures and reduced oxygen levels at sea-cage sites, and this is a challenge that the Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry must adapt to it if it needs to grow sustainably. However, to do this, the industry must better understand how sea-cage conditions influence the physiology and behavior of the fish. Method: We fitted ~2.5 kg Atlantic salmon on the south coast of Newfoundland with Star-Oddi milli-HRT ACT and Milli-TD data loggers (data storage tags, DSTs) in the summer of 2019 that allowed us to simultaneously record the fish's 3D acceleration (i.e., activity/behavior), electrocardiograms (and thus, heart rate and heart rate variability), depth, and temperature from early July to mid-October. Results: Over the course of the summer/fall, surface water temperatures went from ~10-12 to 18-19.5 degrees C, and then fell to 8 degrees C. The data provide valuable information on how cage-site conditions affected the salmon and their determining factors. For example, although the fish typically selected a temperature of 14-18 degrees C when available (i.e., this is their preferred temperature in culture), and thus were found deeper in the cage as surface water temperatures peaked, they continued to use the full range of depths available during the warmest part of the summer. The depth occupied by the fish and heart rate were greater during the day, but the latter effect was not temperature-related. Finally, while the fish generally swam at 0.4-1.0 body lengths per second (25-60 cm s(-1)), their activity and the proportion of time spent using non-steady swimming (i.e., burst-and-coast swimming) increased when feeding was stopped at high temperatures. Conclusion: Data storage tags that record multiple parameters are an effective tool to understand how cage-site conditions and management influence salmon (fish) behavior, physiology, and welfare in culture, and can even be used to provide fine-scale mapping of environmental conditions. The data collected here, and that in recent publications, strongly suggest that pathogen (biotic) challenges in combination with high temperatures, not high temperatures + moderate hypoxia (~70% air saturation) by themselves, are the biggest climate-related challenge facing the salmon aquaculture industry outside of Tasmania.

AB  - The influence of maternal and grandmaternal age on progeny egg-to-adult viability was assessed in Drosophila serrata. Viability in progeny decreased with increasing maternal age. The potential for cumulative age effects was investigated in two environments, one of which im oh ed nutrient and cold stress. Environment influenced viability and female age influenced progeny egg-to-adult viability across one generation. The influence on viability was cumulative across two generations. Females from old mothers, who also had old grandmothers, had the lowest viability in both environments. Grandmaternal effects were associated with a decrease in egg hatch rate whereas maternal effects also involved larval-to-adult viability. The age of the mother and grandmother should be taken into account when evaluating life-history traits in Drosophila.

AB  - Marine ecosystems are currently in a state of flux, with ocean warming and acidification occurring at unprecedented rates. Phenotypic plasticity underpins acclimatory responses by shifting the mean phenotype in a population, which may buffer the negative effects of global change. However, little is known about how phenotypic plasticity evolves across multiple generations. We tested this by reciprocally-transplanting the polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica between control and global change scenarios (ocean warming and acidification in isolation and combined) over five generations. By comparing the reaction norms of four life-history traits across generations, we show that juvenile developmental rate in the combined scenario was the only trait that changed its plastic response across generations when transplanted back to control conditions, and that adaptive plasticity was conserved in most traits, despite significant levels of selection and strong declines in individual fitness in the multi-generational exposure. We suggest the change in level of plasticity in the combined scenario is caused by differential allocation of energy between the mean and the plasticity of the trait along the multigenerational exposure. The ability to maintain within-generational levels of plasticity under global change scenarios has important eco-evolutionary and conservation implications, which are examined under the framework of assisted evolution programs.

AB  - Resistance to low temperatures can vary markedly among invertebrate species and is directly related to their distribution. Despite the ecological importance of cold resistance this trait has rarely been studied genetically, mainly because low and variable fitness of offspring from cold-stressed mothers makes it difficult to undertake selection experiments and compare cold resistance of parents and offspring. One measure of cold resistance that varies geographically in Drosophila melanogaster and that is amenable to genetic analysis is chill-coma recovery. Three replicate lines of D. metanogaster were selected every second generation, for over 30 generations, for decreased recovery time following exposure to 0 degrees C. Correlated responses were scored to characterize underlying physiological traits and to investigate interactions with other traits. Lines responded rapidly to the intermittent selection regime with realized heritabilities varying from 33% to 46%. Selected lines showed decreased recovery time after exposure to a broad range of low temperatures and also had a lower mortality following a more severe cold shock, indicating that a general mechanism underlying cold resistance had been selected. The selection response was independent of plastic changes in cold resistance because the selected lines maintained their ability to harden (i.e. a short-term exposure to cool temperature resulted in decreased recovery time in subsequent chill-coma assays). Changes in cold resistance were not associated with changes in resistance to high temperature exposure, and selected lines showed no changes in wing size, development time or viability. However, there was a decrease in longevity in the selected lines due to an earlier onset of ageing. These results indicate that chill-coma recovery can be rapidly altered by selection, as long as selection is undertaken every second generation to avoid carry-over effects, and suggest that lower thermal limits can be shifted towards increased cold resistance independently of upper thermal limits and without tradeoffs in many life-history traits.

AB  - Generally, ecotoxicologists rely on short-term tests that assume populations to be static. Conversely, natural populations may be exposed to the same stressors for many generations, which can alter tolerance to the same (or other) stressors. The objective of this study was to improve our understanding of how multigenerational stressors alter life history traits and stressor tolerance. After continuously exposing Daphnia magna to cadmium for 120 days, we assessed life history traits and conducted a challenge at higher temperature and cadmium concentrations. Predictably, individuals exposed to cadmium showed an overall decrease in reproductive output compared to controls. Interestingly, control D. magna were the most cadmium tolerant to novel cadmium, followed by those exposed to high cadmium. Our data suggest that long-term exposure to cadmium alter tolerance traits in a non-monotonic way. Because we observed effects after one-generation removal from cadmium, transgenerational effects may be possible as a result of multigenerational exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background
   Ability to resist temperature shock is an important component of fitness of insects and other ectotherms. Increased resistance to temperature shock is known to affect life-history traits. Temperature shock is also known to affect reproductive traits such as mating ability and viability of gametes. Therefore selection for increased temperature shock resistance can affect the evolution of reproductive traits.
   Methods
   We selected replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster for resistance to cold shock. We then investigated the evolution of reproductive behavior along with other components of fitness-larval survivorship, adult mortality, fecundity, egg viability in these populations.
   Results
   We found that larval survivorship, adult mortality and fecundity post cold shock were not significantly different between selected and control populations. However, compared to the control populations, the selected populations laid significantly higher percentage of fertile eggs (egg viability) 24 hours post cold shock. The selected populations had higher mating frequency both with and without cold shock. After being subjected to cold shock, males from the selected populations successfully mated with significantly more non-virgin females and sired significantly more progeny compared to control males.
   Conclusions
   A number of studies have reported the evolution of survivorship in response to selection for temperature shock resistance. Our results clearly indicate that adaptation to cold shock can involve changes in components of reproductive fitness. Our results have important implications for our understanding of how reproductive behavior can evolve in response to thermal stress.

AB  - Adaptive evolution is key in mediating responses to global warming and may sometimes be the only solution for species to survive. Such evolution will expectedly lead to changes in the populations' thermal reaction norm and improve their ability to cope with stressful conditions. Conversely, evolutionary constraints might limit the adaptive response. Here, we test these expectations by performing a real-time evolution experiment in historically differentiated Drosophila subobscura populations. We address the phenotypic change after nine generations of evolution in a daily fluctuating environment with average constant temperature, or in a warming environment with increasing average and amplitude temperature across generations. Our results showed that (1) evolution under a global warming scenario does not lead to a noticeable change in the thermal response; (2) historical background appears to be affecting responses under the warming environment, particularly at higher temperatures; and (3) thermal reaction norms are trait dependent: although lifelong exposure to low temperature decreases fecundity and productivity but not viability, high temperature causes negative transgenerational effects on productivity and viability, even with high fecundity. These findings in such an emblematic organism for thermal adaptation studies raise concerns about the short-term efficiency of adaptive responses to the current rising temperatures.

AB  - Cells and organisms are remarkably robust: they alter the variety and levels of expressed genes and proteins in response to environmental stimuli, including temperature, chemicals, and the stiffness of their surroundings. Ultimately changes in gene and protein expression can result in a distinct phenotypic state, which in some cases is maintained over multiple generations; the ability to pass on a particular phenotypic state to progeny cells is critical for differentiation. Moreover, epigenetic regulation of phenotype is also thought to provide an evolutionary advantage for a population of cells adapting to a fluctuating environment on faster timescales than the occurrence of genetic mutations. However, simple methods to study patterns of gene and protein expression on multi-generational timescales are sparse. Here we describe a technique to study lineages of single cells over multiple generations using a microfluidic device; this reveals patterns of expression where protein levels are correlated across multiple generations. Such quantitative information of protein expression in the context of pedigree remains hidden when studying the population as an ensemble.

AB  - Photoperiod is the major seasonal cue for phenotypic plasticity in the regulation of development and reproduction. Aphids have a peculiar mechanism in which sensitivity to the photoperiod is lost for a few months through successive generations after hatching from diapause eggs, and therefore, the mechanism responsible for the photorefractory period is termed "a seasonal timer". However, whether the seasonal timer has adaptive significance has never been investigated. Here, we show that the photorefractory generation avoids an unseasonal sexual morph production under short days in spring in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris). When the seasonal timer operated, the overwintered generation, stem mothers, produced only parthenogenetic progenies under natural photoperiods and temperatures in both warm and cold springs. After repeated parthenogenesis following diapause, however, aphids with an expired seasonal timer produced sexual females and males typical of autumn under natural photoperiods and temperatures in a warm spring. These sexual morphs are thought to have a reproductive disadvantage compared to parthenogenetic morphs in the following summer. We thus conclude that the seasonal timer is adaptive for avoiding sexual morph production in spring. The present study shows, for the first time, that a photorefractory period lasting over generations is a trait of ecological importance.

AB  - Overwintered and summer generation adult female Colorado potato beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), were reared on 8 different diets (7 plant species and no food) for 30 d, during which time individual fecundity and Bight mill performance were measured. Diet did not affect survival of overwintered females, but strongly affected survival of the newly eclosed summer generation. Fecundity was related positively for both generations to larval success on the different plant species. Tethered flight was greatest amongst starved overwintered females and generally greater in the overwintered generation than in the summer generation. Across treatments, total flight duration was related positively to fecundity for summer generation females; in contrast, it was related negatively to fecundity for the overwintered generation. However, there was no relationship between flight and fecundity within any of the treatments in either generation. Flight was greatest on days 3-6 for overwintered females, peaking later after eclosion for the summer generation, and continuing throughout the 30 d in at least some individuals. Flight was greater for summer generation females with greater emergence weight, and for overwintered females which emerged earlier. Among females nearer to death, or smaller females of tile summer generation, reproduction took precedence over flight. The temporal patterns of fecundity and flight in female L. decemlineata constitute a flexible life history, which seems to represent an adaptation against disappearance of host plants when this risk is highest.

AB  - Anthropogenic pollution has a disadvantageous influence on various life-history traits. Although direct effects are well known, potential fitness-related trans-generational costs are less studied. Previously, empirical findings have demonstrated that environmental conditions faced by the parental generation have an effect on the traits expressed by their offspring. Here, to study this conjecture larvae of the common fruit fly (Drosophila mela-nogaster) were either exposed to a sub-lethal concentration of copper or reared on uncontaminated larval medium. Adult flies were kept under uncontaminated conditions. For the next generation, individuals were mated with their own group and their offspring were either exposed to copper or fed with uncontaminated larval medium. We found that in the parental generation copper exposure reduced fecundity compared with uncontaminated controls. In the progeny, females suffered impaired fecundity only if their larval condition differed from the conditions experienced by their parents. If the progeny was raised under similar conditions than the parental generation, no effect on fecundity was discovered, suggesting acclimatization to the prevailing conditions after short-time copper exposure (two generations). Our results demonstrate that exposure to an environmental stressor like heavy metals causes intra-and trans-generational fitness costs. Further, individuals may be able to acclimatize in prevailing contaminated conditions, but this might in turn debase fitness under uncontaminated conditions. Our findings are consistent with the prediction of the adaptive parental effects hypothesis which states that parents may produce offspring that are more successful under conditions faced by their parents.

AB  - The effects of increasing temperature owing to thermal discharge and global warming on zooplanktons such as Daphnia magna are a growing concern. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of elevated temperature (25 degrees C) on oxidative stress responses, growth, and reproduction of D. magna across 10 generations. The number of offspring per female at 21 d was significantly increased and the rate of adult somatic growth (5-21 d) was decreased in the F0 generation at 25 degrees C compared with those at the reference temperature 20 degrees C. However, the F3 generation showed the lowest number of offspring and the highest adult somatic growth rate and oxidative stress responses (5 d) at 25 degrees C. Moreover, all life-history traits seemed to recover to the levels of the control group from the F6 generation at 20 degrees C. These findings suggest that D. magna under continuous thermal stress exhibits non-adaptive responses in the early generations (F0-F3) and changes to adaptive responses in the later generations (F6-F9). However, the underlying epigenetic mechanism should be identified in the future.

AB  - Although cross generation (CGP) and multigenerational (MGP) plasticity have been identified as mechanisms of acclimation to global change, the weight of evidence indicates that parental conditioning over generations is not a panacea to rescue stress sensitivity in offspring. For many species, there were no benefits of parental conditioning. Even when improved performance was observed, this waned over time within a generation or across generations and fitness declined. CGP and MGP studies identified resilient species with stress tolerant genotypes in wild populations and selected family lines. Several bivalves possess favourable stress tolerance and phenotypically plastic traits potentially associated with genetic adaptation to life in habitats where they routinely experience temperature and/or acidification stress. These traits will be important to help 'climate proof' shellfish ventures. Species that are naturally stress tolerant and those that naturally experience a broad range of environmental conditions are good candidates to provide insights into the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in CGP and MGP. It is challenging to conduct ecologically relevant global change experiments over the long times commensurate with the pace of changing climate. As a result, many studies present stressors in a shock-type exposure at rates much faster than projected scenarios. With more gradual stressor introduction over longer experimental durations and in context with conditions species are currently acclimatized and/or adapted to, the outcomes for sensitive species might differ. We highlight the importance to understand primordial germ cell development and the timing of gametogenesis with respect to stressor exposure. Although multigenerational exposure to global change stressors currently appears limited as a universal tool to rescue species in the face of changing climate, natural proxies of future conditions (upwelling zones, CO2 vents, naturally warm habitats) show that phenotypic adjustment and/or beneficial genetic selection is possible for some species, indicating complex plasticity-adaptation interactions.

AB  - Shallow, tropical marine ecosystems provide essential ecosystem goods and services, but it is unknown how these ecosystems will respond to the increased exposure to the temperature extremes that are likely to become more common as climate change progresses. To address this issue, we tracked the fitness and productivity of a key zooplankton species, the copepod Pseudodiaptomus annandalei, acclimated at two temperatures (30 and 34 degrees C) over three generations. 30 degrees C is the mean temperature in the shallow water of the coastal regions in Southeast Asia, while 34 degrees C simulated a temperature extreme that occurs frequently during the summer period. For each generation, we measured the size at maturity and reproductive success of individuals. In all three generations, we found strong negative effects of warming on all measured fitness-related parameters, including prolonged development time, reduced size at maturity, smaller clutch sizes, lower hatching success, and reduced naupliar production. Our results suggest that P. annandalei are already exposed to temperatures that exceed their upper thermal optimum. Increased exposure to extreme temperatures may reduce the abundance of these tropical marine copepods, and thus reduce the availability of resources to higher trophic levels.

AB  - Adulthood-only downregulation of insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS), an evolutionarily conserved pathway regulating resource allocation between somatic maintenance and reproduction, increases life span without fecundity cost in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. However, long-term multigenerational effects of reduced IIS remain unexplored and are proposed to carry costs for offspring quality. To test this hypothesis, we ran a mutation accumulation (MA) experiment and downregulated IIS in half of the 400 MA lines by silencing daf-2 gene expression using RNA interference (RNAi) across 40 generations. Contrary to the prediction, adulthood-only daf-2 RNAi reduced extinction of MA lines both under UV-induced and spontaneous MA. Fitness of the surviving UV-induced MA lines was higher under daf-2 RNAi. Reduced IIS increased intergenerational F1 offspring fitness under UV stress but had no quantifiable transgenerational effects. Functional hrde-1 was required for the benefits of multigenerational daf-2 RNAi. Overall, we found net benefit to fitness from multigenerational reduction of IIS and the benefits became more apparent under stress. Because reduced daf-2 expression during development carries fitness costs, we suggest that our findings are best explained by the developmental theory of ageing, which maintains that the decline in the force of selection with age results in poorly regulated gene expression in adulthood.

AB  - Theory predicts the emergence of generalists in variable environments and antagonistic pleiotropy to favour specialists in constant environments, but empirical data seldom support such generalist-specialist trade-offs. We selected for generalists and specialists in the dung fly Sepsis punctum (Diptera: Sepsidae) under conditions that we predicted would reveal antagonistic pleiotropy and multivariate trade-offs underlying thermal reaction norms for juvenile development. We performed replicated laboratory evolution using four treatments: adaptation at a hot (31 degrees C) or a cold (15 degrees C) temperature, or under regimes fluctuating between these temperatures, either within or between generations. After 20 generations, we assessed parental effects and genetic responses of thermal reaction norms for three correlated life-history traits: size at maturity, juvenile growth rate and juvenile survival. We find evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy for performance at hot and cold temperatures, and a temperature-mediated trade-off between juvenile survival and size at maturity, suggesting that trade-offs associated with environmental tolerance can arise via intensified evolutionary compromises between genetically correlated traits. However, despite this antagonistic pleiotropy, we found no support for the evolution of increased thermal tolerance breadth at the expense of reduced maximal performance, suggesting low genetic variance in the generalist-specialist dimension.

AB  - Predicting the response of marine animals to climate change is hampered by a lack of multigenerational studies on evolutionary adaptation, particularly to combined ocean warming and acidification (OWA). We provide evidence for rapid adaptation to OWA in the foundational copepod species, Acartia tonsa, by assessing changes in population fitness on the basis of a comprehensive suite of life-history traits, using an orthogonal experimental design of nominal temperature (18 degrees C, 22 degrees C) and p(CO2) (400, 2,000 mu atm) for 25 generations (similar to 1 year). Egg production and hatching success initially decreased under OWA, resulting in a 56% reduction in fitness. However, both traits recovered by the third generation, and average fitness was reduced thereafter by only 9%. Antagonistic interactions between warming and acidification in later generations decreased survival, thereby limiting full fitness recovery. Our results suggest that such interactions constrain evolutionary rescue and add complexity to predictions of the responses of animal populations to climate change.

AB  - Adaptation to new environments is an important issue for invasive species as colonization depends on evolvability in their new distribution range. Here, we considered the case of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci MEAM 1 (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), a pest that has recently invaded Colombia and where thermal adaptation has been proposed to explain its colonizing ability. An experimental evolution study was conducted to assess the evolutionary potential of B. tabaci in relation to its upper thermal limits, to explain its rapid adaptation during post-invasion periods. Selection for hardening capacity was conducted in four whitefly populations. We measured thermal responses in relation to fitness components (survival, fecundity, and viability) for 5-7 generations under a strong selection regime. Heat hardening responded rapidly in both sexes. This was expressed as an increase in survival, but not in fecundity or viability. These results suggest that thermal responses for heat hardening are not correlated and evolve independently. Increased survival after few generations of selection points to high adaptive potential in this insect, which leads to rapid post-invasion adaptation. Our study can help to predict population responses to environmental change and explain the colonizing ability of this pest.

AB  - The impact of a tapioca-based artificial diet on the developmental rate, life history parameters, and fertility was examined over five consecutive generations for the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a highly polyphagous pest of many agricultural crops. The study showed that when fed the tapioca-based artificial diet during larval stage, larval and pupal developmental period, percent pupating, pupal weight, emergence rate of male and female, longevity, fecundity and hatching were non-significantly different than that of the control agar-based artificial diet. Moreover, the cost to rear on tapioca-based diet approached 2.13 times less than the cost of rearing on the agar-based artificial diet. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential cost savings of the tapioca-based artificial diet for rearing H. armigera.

AB  - Metal pollution provide a substantial challenge for environmental health. This study investigated the multigeneration effects of cadmium on populations of the copepod species Pseudodiaptomus annandalei, exposed to a sublethal concentration, 40 mu g/L of cadmium (Cd), over 10 generations. At the end of each generation, copepod individuals were collected to estimate fecundity, bioaccumulation, and real time qPCR quantification of selected differentially expressed genes to evaluate Cd effects and sex-specific responses of copepods across multiple generations. Our results revealed a sex-specific accumulation of Cd integrating 10 successive generations. The concentration of Cd was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in males than in females. We also observed a generational increase in Cd accumulation. Fecundity increased, with the exception of the first generation, possibly as a compensation for a decrease of copepod population size under Cd exposure. Protein expression of copepods exposed to Cd occurred in a sex-specific manner. Hemerythrin was mostly up-regulated in both copepod sexes exposed to Cd with males having the highest expression levels, while heat shock protein 70 was mostly upregulated in males and down-regulated in female copepods, both exposed to Cd. Although copepods are known to develop adaptive mechanisms to tolerate toxic chemicals, continuous exposure to metals could lead to the bioaccumulation of metals in their offspring through maternal transfer and direct uptake from the medium over several generations. As a consequence, increased metal concentrations in copepods could result in physiological damage, reducing their fitness, and possibly compromise copepod population structures. This study showed that mortality, life history traits and molecular responses of a copepod species provided important toxicological endpoints and bio-markers for environmental risk assessments. Environmental pressure resulting from continuous exposure to persistent pollutants like Cd, could have evolutionary significance. The tendency for copepods to selectively adapt to a toxic environment through modifications, could increase their chance of survival over a long term.

AB  - This study has been conducted in a pomegranate orchard in Tarsus, Mersin Province between 2008-2010 and 2012-2013. In this study, the sum of effective temperatures based on a degree-day (DD) model was determined to be successful for the scheduling control of honeydew moth [Cryptoblabes gnidiella (Mill., 1867) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)]. For this purpose, phenological stages, sex pheromone traps, the sum of effective temperatures (ETS), egg hatching time and fruit control were used. ETS values based on the DD model were 80 DD for hanging time of sex pheromone traps, 250 DD for first generation for egg hatching period, 800 DD for the second generation, 1375 DD for the third generation, 1930 DD for the fourth generation, and 2500 DD for fifth generation. However, the first generation of C. gnidiella, which had lower population having come from overwintering places, and fifth generation, which emerged at after harvest, should be monitored regularly so that control applications will be more beneficial.

AB  - Environmental heterogeneity helps maintain genetic variation in fitness. Therefore, one might predict that populations living in heterogeneous environments have higher adaptive potential than populations living in homogeneous environments. Such a prediction could be useful in guiding conservation priorities without requiring detailed genetic studies. However, this prediction will be true only if the additional genetic variation maintained by environmental heterogeneity can be used to respond to novel selection. Here we examine the effect of environmental heterogeneity on future adaptability using replicated experimental Drosophila melanogaster populations that had previously evolved for similar to 100 generations under one of four selective regimes: constant salt-enriched larvae medium, constant cadmium-enriched larvae medium, and two heterogeneous regimes that vary either temporally or spatially between the two media. Replicates of these experimental populations were subjected to a novel heat stress while being maintained in their original larval diet selection regimes. Adaptation to increased temperature was measured with respect to female productivity and male siring success after similar to 20 generations. For female productivity, there was evidence of adaptation overall and heterogeneous populations had a larger adaptive response than homogeneous populations. There was less evidence of adaptation overall for male siring success and no support for faster adaptation in heterogeneous populations.

AB  - Species of North American freshwater snails within the genus Physa are distinguished primarily on differences in shell shape. However, shell shape in this genus is ecophenotypically influenced by environmental factors. The present study examined the degree to which genes and environment influenced spire angle in specimens of Physa virgata collected from a single population in Arlington, Texas. Five separate genetic lines were inbred for five generations, after which progeny were reared under one of three temperature regimes (20, 25, or 30 degrees C) until reaching adult size (approximately 5 mm in shell length). The spire angle of each individual was then measured and comparisons made across thermal regimes and genetic lines. Genetic line and temperature both significantly influenced spire angle. In general, snails reared at warmer temperatures had wider spire angles than snails reared at cooler temperatures. Some genetic lines had wider mean spire angles than others, regardless of temperature. Individual spire angles differed by as much as 23.8 degrees under controlled conditions. These results suggest that shell shape is neither a consistent character nor taxonomically diagnostic. Thus, the number of currently recognized species of Physa is problematic.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate whether the cadmium tolerance developed in the beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua selected for over 150 generations may be related to synthesis of the stress proteins metallothioneins (Mts) and 70 kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70). To achieve this, six S. exigua strains (control, k), 150-generation Cd exposure strain (cd), and four 18-generation Cd exposure strains differing in Cd concentration (cd44, cd22, cdll, cd5) were reared. Stress protein level was measured in the midgut of the 5th larval stage after 1-6, 12 and 18 generations. Cd contents was measured in the pupae. Unlike Cd concentration, which depended on metal contents in food but was not generation-dependent, the pattern of Mts and HSP70 concentrations changed in experimental strains from generation to generation. Stress protein levels in the insects exposed to the highest Cd concentration (the same as in the 150-generation Cd exposure strain), initially higher than in the control strain, after the 12th generation did not differ from the level measured in the control strains. It seems therefore that stress proteins play a protective role in insects of lower tolerance to cadmium. The tolerance developed during multigenerational exposure probably relies on mechanisms other than Mt and HSP70 synthesis.

TI  - Life history and feeding biology of the predatory thrips, Aleurodothrips fasciapennis (Thysanoptera : Phlaeothripidae)
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Details of the life history, the effects of relative humidity and temperature on survival and reproduction, and the predatory ability of Aleurodothrips fasciapennis Franklin were examined under laboratory conditions. Stage-specific development and adult longevity were similar between sexes, and the adult sex ratio was 1:1. Females laid 23.3 +/- 18.0 eggs of which 83% hatched. The survival rate of first instars to adulthood was 82%. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)) was 0.04, assuming a zero or 5.4 day pre-oviposition interval. Temperature did not affect the proportion of eggs that hatched, the proportion of first instars surviving to adulthood or adult sex ratios. However, female fecundity was dependent on temperature being highest at 24-28 degrees C. Relative humidity did not affect adult sex ratio or female fecundity but the proportion of eggs hatched and the survival of first instars to adulthood increased as relative humidity increased. Few eggs hatched when relative humidity was <65%. Larval and adult female A. fasciapennis were voracious feeders but the number of prey killed per progeny was high, suggesting A. fasciapennis was inefficient at converting prey into progeny biomass. The potential value of A. fasciapennis as a biocontrol agent of Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell) on Australian citrus is discussed in terms of its r(m), prey killing power and environmental adaptability. It is concluded that population growth of A. fasciapennis should exceed that of A. aurantii under field conditions but A. fasciapennis may be of little value against A. aurantii on citrus grown under conditions of high temperature and low humidity, or when prey densities are low.

AB  - It is unknown whether transient transgenerational epigenetic responses to environmental challenges affect the process of evolution, which typically unfolds over many generations. Here, we show that in C. elegans, inherited small RNAs control genetic variation by regulating the crucial decision of whether to self-fertilize or outcross. We found that under stressful temperatures, younger hermaphrodites secrete a male-attracting pheromone. Attractiveness transmits transgenerationally to unstressed progeny via heritable small RNAs and the Argonaute Heritable RNAi Deficient-1 (HRDE-1). We identified an endogenous small interfering RNA pathway, enriched in endo-siRNAs that target sperm genes, that transgenerationally regulates sexual attraction, male prevalence, and outcrossing rates. Multigenerational mating competition experiments and mathematical simulations revealed that over generations, animals that inherit attractiveness mate more and their alleles spread in the population. We propose that the sperm serves as a "stress-sensor"that, via small RNA inheritance, promotes outcrossing in challenging environments when increasing genetic variation is advantageous.

AB  - Background: piRNAs have a constitutive role in genome defence by silencing transposable elements in the germline. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, piRNAs also induce epigenetic silencing of transgenes, which can be maintained for many generations in the absence of the piRNA pathway. The role of multi-generational epigenetic inheritance in adaptation to the environment is unknown.
   Results: Here, we show that piRNA biogenesis is downregulated in response to a small increase in temperature. Some effects on gene expression persist into subsequent generations and are associated with a negative fitness cost. We show that simultaneous infection with pathogenic bacteria suppresses downregulation of the piRNA pathway in response to increased temperature. This effect is associated with increased fitness of progeny of infected animals in subsequent generations.
   Conclusions: Our results show that the piRNA pathway integrates inputs from the environment to establish intergenerational responses to environmental conditions, with important consequences for the fitness of the subsequent generation.

AB  - Insecticide exposure may cause both transgenerational and multigenerational effects on populations, but the molecular mechanisms of these changes remain largely unclear. Many studies have focused on either transgenerational or multigenerational mechanisms but did neglect the comparative aspects. This study assessed whether the pyrethroid insecticide etofenprox (formulation Trebon (R) 30 EC) shows transgenerational and/or multigenerational effects on the survival and reproduction of Folsomia candida (Collembola). The activation of stress-related genes was studied to detect whether etofenprox modifies the expression of reproduction-associated genes in trans- and multigenerational treatments. A laboratory study was carried out for three generations with five insecticide concentrations in LUFA 2.2 soil. In the transgenerational treatment, only the parent generation (P) was exposed, but the subsequent generations were not. In the multigenerational treatment, all three generations were exposed to the insecticide in the same manner. Multigenerational exposure resulted in reduced reproduction effects over generations, suggesting that F. candida is capable of acclimating to enhanced concentration levels of etofenprox during prolonged exposure over multiple generations. In the transgenerational treatment, the heat shock protein 70 was up-regulated and cytochrome oxidase 6N4v1 expression down-regulated in a dose-dependent manner in the F2 generation. This finding raises the possibility of the epigenetic inheritance of insecticide impacts on parents. Furthermore, CYP6N4v1 expression was oppositely regulated in the trans- and multigenerational treatments. Our results draw attention to the differences in molecular level responses of F. candida to trans- and multigenerational etofenprox exposure.

AB  - In a replicated, laboratory, natural selection experiment Drosophila melanogaster populations were maintained for 20 generations either on unpolluted medium or on polluted medium containing cadmium chloride at a concentration of 80 mu g/ml. Lines maintained on polluted medium evolved resistance. In comparison with unpolluted lines, their juvenile survivorship increased from 35% to 46%, developmental period decreased from 13.7 days to 13.0 days, and fecundity increased from 3 to 29 eggs per two-day period. Emergence weights, however, did not change. By contrast the "environmental" effect of moving susceptible flies onto polluted medium was that after two generations survivorship fell 62%, developmental period increased 40%, and fecundity fell 97%. Emergence weights fell 31% in females and 28% in males. Resistant lines paid a fitness cost in unpolluted environments, with fecundity being reduced by 44% and emergence weights being reduced by 4% in females and 6% in males. Developmental period, however, was unaffected. Analyses of crosses and backcrosses between the lines suggested that the evolved cadmium resistance was due to a single sex-linked gene. Levels of dominance were calculated, and in each life-history character the resistant allele was found to be completely dominant. Because the life-history effects appear to be produced by a single gene, it is probable that they all depend on the same metabolic pathway. Metallothionein production is a likely candidate because this is known to be controlled by genes on the X-chromosome. The study adds to a small number of examples of single or closely linked genes with large antagonistic pleiotropic effects on life histories. The result here is a between-environment trade-off, allowing animals increased fitness in polluted environments, but only at the cost of reduced growth and reproduction in unpolluted environments.

AB  - It is known that in some insect species the incidence of diapause among the progeny of females that had undergone diapause is relatively low or zero even under strong diapause-inducing conditions. Moreover, the maternal inhibition, preventing the induction of a maladaptive diapause in spring, can persist over several generations. This multigenerational effect based on hypothetical 'interval timer' was thoroughly studied in Aphididae. We first described a similar phenomenon in Hymenoptera: laboratory experiments demonstrated that the proportion of diapausing progeny of Trichogramma females that had undergone diapause was practically zero independently of photoperiodic and temperature conditions used (day lengths of 12 and 18 h and temperatures of 12-15 degrees C). Then the ability to enter diapause recovered gradually and returned to the normal level over two (in Trichogramma telengai) or even five (in Trichogramma principium) generations. We conclude that the observed effect may be based on an interval timer similar to that in aphids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We are beginning to understand how the larvae of molluscs and echinoderms with complex life cycles will be affected by climate change. Early experiments using short-term exposures suggested that larvae in oceans predicted to increase in acidification and temperature will be smaller in size, take longer to develop, and have a greater incidence of abnormal development. More realistic experiments which factored in the complex life cycles of molluscs and echinoderms found impacts not as severe as predicted. This is because the performance of one life history stage led to a significant carryover effect on the subsequent life history stage. Carryover effects that arise within a generation, for example, embryonic and larval stages, can influence juvenile and adult success. Carryover effects can also arise across a generation, known as transgenerational plasticity (TGP). A transgenerational response or TGP can be defined as a phenotypic change in offspring in response to the environmental stress experienced by a parent before fertilization. In the small number of experiments which have measured the transgenerational response of molluscs and echinoderms to elevated CO2, TGP has been observed in the larval offspring. If we are to safeguard ecological and economically significant mollusc and echinoderm species against climate change then we require more knowledge of the impacts that carryover effects have within and across generations as well as an understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for such adaptation.

AB  - Artificial selection experiments provide insights into the evolutionary factors that can shape adaptive responses and have previously been utilized to examine the physiological adaptations that can improve survival to desiccation in Drosophila melanogaster. While such studies demonstrate that multiple resistance mechanisms may arise via different base populations and selection regimes, water retention emerges as a key mechanism for desiccation survival. Here, we present the physiological, correlated response and life history data for a new set of selection lines designed for the genetic dissection of desiccation resistance. After 26 generations of selection for desiccation resistance, female survival increased twofold. In contrast to previous studies, the altered resistance was associated primarily with enhanced dehydration tolerance and increased mass and less consistently with decreased rates of water loss. Life history tradeoffs and correlated selection responses were examined and overlap with previously published data. We crossed the resistant selected lines to desiccation-sensitive lines from the same control background to examine how each heterozygous resistant chromosome (excluding four) may improve desiccation resistance and observed that most of the resistance was due to genes on the third and first chromosomes, although interaction effects with the second chromosome were also detected. Results are compared to other selection responses and highlight the multiple evolutionary solutions that can arise when organisms are faced with a common selection pressure, although water loss rate remains a common mechanism in all studies.

AB  - Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) is increasingly recognized as a mechanism by which organisms can respond to environments that change across generations. Although recent empirical and theoretical studies have explored conditions under which TGP is predicted to evolve, it is still unclear whether the effects of the parental environment will remain beyond the offspring generation. Using a small cyprinodontid fish, we explored multigenerational thermal TGP to address two related questions. First (experiment 1), does the strength of TGP decline or accumulate across multiple generations? Second (experiment 2), how does the experience of a temperature novel to both parents and offspring affect the strength of TGP? In the first experiment, we found a significant interaction between F1 and F2 temperatures and juvenile growth, but no effect of egg diameter. The strength of TGP between F0 and F1 generations was similar in both experiments but declined in subsequent generations. Further, experience of a novel temperature accelerated the decline. This pattern, although similar to that found in other species, is certainly not universally observed, suggesting that theoretical and empirical effort is needed to understand the multigenerational dynamics of TGP.

AB  - The process of local adaptation involves differential changes in fitness over time across different environments. Although experimental evolution studies have extensively tested for patterns of local adaptation at a single time point, there is relatively little research that examines fitness more than once during the time course of adaptation. We allowed replicate populations of the fruit pest Drosophila suzukii to evolve in one of eight different fruit media. After five generations, populations with the highest initial levels of maladaptation had mostly gone extinct, whereas experimental populations evolving on cherry, strawberry and cranberry media had survived. We measured the fitness of each surviving population in each of the three fruit media after five and after 26 generations of evolution. After five generations, adaptation to each medium was associated with increased fitness in the two other media. This was also true after 26 generations, except when populations that evolved on cranberry medium developed on cherry medium. These results suggest that, in the theoretical framework of a fitness landscape, the fitness optima of cherry and cranberry media are the furthest apart. Our results show that studying how fitness changes across several environments and across multiple generations provides insights into the dynamics of local adaptation that would not be evident if fitness were analysed at a single point in time. By allowing a qualitative mapping of an experimental fitness landscape, our approach will improve our understanding of the ecological factors that drive the evolution of local adaptation in D. suzukii.

AB  - An artificial selection experiment was conducted for six generations to investigate the responses to selection for cadmium resistance in the least killifish, Heterandria formosa. There was a rapid response to selection. After only one generation of selection, two of the three selection lines had an increased resistance to cadmium, while all three selection lines had an elevated resistance by the next generation. After six generations of selection, fish from the selection lines survived about three times as long as control line fish when exposed to cadmium. Realized heritability for cadmium resistance,was estimated to be 0.50. Cross-resistance to copper was studied in the F-2, F-3, and F-6 generations; fish from the cadmium-resistant lines had a longer survival time than those, from the control lines. Resistance to heat was investigated in the F2, F3, and F. generations; the cadmium-resistant lines had a significantly shorter survival time than the control lines. Our results showed that evolution of resistance to cadmium was rapid, that cross-resistance to copper occurred, and that the evolution of resistance to cadmium was accompanied by a trade-off (fitness costs) as evidenced by the reduced heat tolerance.

AB  - Environmental change may cause phenotypic changes that are inherited across generations through transgenerational plasticity (TGP). If TGP is adaptive, offspring fitness increases with an increasing match between parent and offspring environment. Here we test for adaptive TGP in somatic growth and metabolic rate in response to temperature in the clonal zooplankton Daphnia pulex. Animals of the first focal generation experienced thermal transgenerational 'mismatch' (parental and offspring temperatures differed), whereas conditions of the next two generations matched the (grand) maternal thermal conditions. Adjustments of metabolic rate occurred during the lifetime of the first generation (i.e. within-generation plasticity). However, no further change was observed during the subsequent two generations, as would be expected under TGP. Furthermore, we observed no tendency for increased juvenile somatic growth (a trait highly correlated with fitness in Daphnia) over the three generations when reared at new temperatures. These results are inconsistent with existing studies of thermal TGP, and we describe how previous experimental designs may have confounded TGP with within-generation plasticity and selective mortality. We suggest that the current evidence for thermal TGP is weak. To increase our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary role of TGP, future studies should more carefully identify possible confounding factors.

AB  - The ability to respond evolutionarily to increasing temperatures is important for survival of ectotherms in a changing climate. Recent studies suggest that upper thermal limits may be evolutionary constrained. We address this hypothesis in a laboratory evolution experiment, encompassing ecologically relevant thermal regimes. To examine the potential for species to respond to climate change, we exposed replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster to increasing temperatures (0.3 degrees C every generation) for 20 generations, whereas corresponding replicate control populations were held at benign thermal conditions throughout the experiment. We hypothesized that replicate populations exposed to increasing temperatures would show increased resistance to warm and dry environments compared with replicate control populations. Contrasting replicate populations held at the two thermal regimes showed (i) an increase in desiccation resistance and a decline in heat knock-down resistance in replicate populations exposed to increasing temperatures, (ii) similar egg-to-adult viability and fecundity in replicate populations from the two thermal regimes, when assessed at high stressful temperatures and (iii) no difference in nucleotide diversity between thermal regimes. The limited scope for adaptive evolutionary responses shown in this study highlights the challenges faced by ectotherms under climate change.

AB  - The large white butterfly, Pieris brassicae, shows a seasonal polyphenism of wing melanisation, spring individuals being darker than summer individuals. This phenotypic plasticity is supposed to be an adaptive response for thermoregulation in natural populations. However, the variation in individuals' response, the cause of this variation (genetic, non genetic but inheritable or environmental) and its relationship with fitness remain poorly known. We tested the relationships between thermal reaction norm of wing melanisation and adult lifespan as well as female fecundity. Butterflies were reared in cold (18 degrees C), moderate (22 degrees C), and hot (26 degrees C) temperatures over three generations to investigate variation in adult pigmentation and the effects of maternal thermal environment on offspring reaction norms. We found a low heritability in wing melanisation (h(2) = 0.18). Rearing families had contrasted thermal reaction norms. Adult lifespan of males and females from highly plastic families was shorter in individuals exposed to hot developmental temperature. Also, females from plastic families exhibited lower fecundity. We did not find any effect of maternal or grand-maternal developmental temperature on fitness. This study provides new evidence on the influence of phenotypic plasticity on life history-traits' evolution, a crucial issue in the context of global change.

AB  - Trans-generational plasticity (TGP) represents a primary mechanism for guaranteeing species persistence under rapid global changes. To date, no study on TGP responses of marine organisms to global change scenarios in the ocean has been conducted on phylogenetically closely related species, and we thus lack a true appreciation for TGP inter-species variation. Consequently, we examined the tolerance and TGP of life-history and physiological traits in two annelid species within the genus Ophryotrocha: one rare (O. robusta) and one common (O. japonica). Both species were exposed over two generations to ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) in isolation and in combination (OAW). Warming scenarios led to a decrease in energy production together with an increase in energy requirements, which was lethal for O. robusta before viable offspring could be produced by the F1. Under OA conditions, O. robusta was able to reach the second generation, despite showing lower survival and reproductive performance when compared to control conditions. This was accompanied by a marked increase in fecundity and egg volume in F2 females, suggesting high capacity for TGP under OA. In contrast, O. japonica thrived under all scenarios across both generations, maintaining its fitness levels via adjusting its metabolomic profile. Overall, the two species investigated show a great deal of difference in their ability to tolerate and respond via TGP to future global changes. We emphasize the potential implications this can have for the determination of extinction risk, and consequently, the conservation of phylogenetically closely related species.

AB  - Y Thermal adaptation to habitat variability can determine species vulnerability to environmental change. For example, physiological tolerance to naturally low thermal variation in tropical forests species may alter their vulnerability to climate change impacts, compared with open habitat species. However, the extent to which habitat-specific differences in tolerance derive from within-generation versus across-generation ecological or evolutionary processes are not well characterized. Here we studied thermal tolerance limits of a Central African butterfly (Bicyclus dorothea) across two habitats in Cameroon: a thermally stable tropical forest and the more variable ecotone between rainforest and savanna. Second generation individuals originating from the ecotone, reared under conditions common to both populations, exhibited higher upper thermal limits (CTmax) than individuals originating from forest (similar to 3 degrees C greater). Lower thermal limits (CTmin) were also slightly lower for the ecotone populations (similar to 1 degrees C). Our results are suggestive of local adaptation driving habitat-specific differences in thermal tolerance (especially CTmax) that hold across generations. Such habitat-specific thermal limits may be widespread for tropical ectotherms and could affect species vulnerability to environmental change. However, microclimate and within-generation developmental processes (e.g. plasticity) will mediate these differences, and determining the fitness consequences of thermal variation for ecotone and rainforest species will require continued study of both within-generation and across-generation eco-evolutionary processes.

AB  - Environmental stress can induce survival advantages that are passed down to multiple generations, representing an evolutionarily advantageous adaptation at the species level. Using the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we found that heat shock experienced in either parent could increase the longevity of themselves and up to the fifth generation of descendants. Mechanistic analyses revealed that transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO, heat shock factor HSF-1, and nuclear receptor DAF-12/FXR functioned transgenerationally to implement the hormetic stress response. Histone H3K9me3 methyltransferases SET-25 and SET-32 and DNA N-6-methyl methyltransferase DAMT-1 participated in transmitting high-temperature memory across generations. H3K9me3 and N-6-methyladenine could mark heat stress response genes and promote their transcription in progeny to extend life span. We dissected the mechanisms responsible for implementing and transmitting environmental memories in descendants from heat-shocked parents and demonstrated that hormetic stress caused survival benefits could be transmitted to multiple generations through H3K9me3 and N-6-mA modifications.

AB  - Understanding the evolutionary potential of organisms to adapt to a changing climate, and the fitness consequences of temperature fluctuations, are critical to forecasting the future of biodiversity. Geographic variation among populations in life history response to temperature mean and variability offers one view of the potential for local adaptation to broaden the thermal niche. We used laboratory growth experiments to examine the effects of temperatures between 13 degrees C and 30 degrees C on five life history traits and the intrinsic rate of increase for 15 Tigriopus californicus populations distributed over 17 degrees of latitude. Different life history stages showed distinct latitudinal shifts in thermal response, while the temperature of peak population growth consistently declined with increasing latitude. In addition, high-latitude populations grew faster at optimal temperatures but showed steeper fitness declines at high temperature. To test geographic population variation in response to the amplitude of daily thermal fluctuations, we grew three northern and three southern populations and manipulated nightly low and daily high temperatures. We found the lowest fitness overall in the treatment with the highest mean temperature, and the treatment with the greatest variability showed high fitness despite an 8 degrees C greater daily range. Population responses to daily thermal variability were unrelated to latitude of origin. Our results indicate that trade-offs between adaptation to high vs. low temperature, and between growth and maturation vs. survival and fecundity, govern local adaptation along the latitudinal gradient. They also indicate that T. californicus populations can maintain fitness over a wide range of daily variability but are more sensitive to small changes in the mean temperature.

AB  - Sea turtles present a model for the potential impacts of climate change on imperiled species, with projected warming generating concern about their persistence. Various sea turtle life-history traits are affected by temperature; most strikingly, warmer egg incubation temperatures cause female-biased sex ratios and higher embryo mortality. Predictions of sea turtle resilience to climate change are often focused on how resulting male limitation or reduced offspring production may affect populations. In the present article, by reviewing research on sea turtles, we provide an overview of how temperature impacts on incubating eggs may cascade through life history to ultimately affect population viability. We explore how sex-specific patterns in survival and breeding periodicity determine the differences among offspring, adult, and operational sex ratios. We then discuss the implications of skewed sex ratios for male-limited reproduction, consider the negative correlation between sex ratio skew and genetic diversity, and examine consequences for adaptive potential. Our synthesis underscores the importance of considering the effects of climate throughout the life history of any species. Lethal effects (e.g., embryo mortality) are relatively direct impacts, but sublethal effects at immature life-history stages may not alter population growth rates until cohorts reach reproductive maturity. This leaves a lag during which some species transition through several stages subject to distinct biological circumstances and climate impacts. These perspectives will help managers conceptualize the drivers of emergent population dynamics and identify existing knowledge gaps under different scenarios of predicted environmental change.

AB  - The effect of chronic exposure of freshwater cladoceran Daphnia magna to low, environmentally relevant concentrations i.e 4 mu L-l of ibuprofen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) in a laboratory experiment was studied. We observed the key life history traits of first and fifth generation individuals: age and size at first reproduction, number of first clutch eggs and individual growth rate. Moreover, chosen molecular/subcellular markers of experimental animals stress response such as triglyceride content, heat shock proteins (HSP) expression and DNA:RNA ratio were collected. Overall, chronic exposure to ibuprofen had no significant effect on the molecular markers nor on the life history parameters of the Daphnia. It did, however, caused lethal morphological deformities in embryos and juvenile daphnids. Depending on the clonal affiliation, exposure to a low dosage of ibuprofen over five generations resulted in the deformation of similar to 3%--similar to 10% of the first clutch of offspring. Also, up to 90% of females carried at least one deformed embryo. This is the first time that research has revealed such an effect of ibuprofen on D. magna. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Insect species can respond adaptively to stress temperature conditions including both thermal limits and reaction norms. In this study, we considered two populations of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), in which adaptive differentiation was detected for tolerance to upper thermal limits. These two populations are found in two regions of Colombia with climatic differences: the Caribbean region with high environmental temperatures and the Southwest region with lower temperature regimens. We assessed the thermal responses to a range of 1 h heat shocks (37, 39, 41, 43 and 44 degrees C) performed below the thermal limits for this species. Thermal responses were measured using three life-history traits involved in fitness: survival, fecundity and viability of the offspring after heat shocks. Survival or fecundity as a response to heat shocks did not differ among populations; however, there were significantly different responses for viability between populations. The Southwestern population showed higher viability responses to low heat shocks than the Caribbean population. This relationship suggests a potential trade-off, which appears to be associated with climatic regions. In addition, these results suggest that adaptation under thermal limits does not necessarily involve similar responses throughout the reaction norm. A potential ongoing evolutionary response is taking place through the thermal reaction norms for viability after the invasion by this pest in Colombia.

AB  - The leaf beetle, Ophraella communa, has been introduced to control the spread of the common ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, in China. We hypothesized that the beetle, to be able to track host-range expansion into colder climates, can phenotypically adapt to cold temperatures across generations. Therefore, we questioned whether parental experience of colder temperatures increases cold tolerance of the progeny. Specifically, we studied the demography, including development, fecundity, and survival, as well as physiological traits, including supercooling point (SCP), water content, and glycerol content of O. communa progeny whose parents were maintained at different temperature regimes. Overall, the entire immature stage decreased survival of about 0.2%-4.2% when parents experienced cold temperatures compared to control individuals obtained from parents raised at room temperature. However, intrinsic capacity for increase (r), net reproductive rate (R-0) and finite rate of increase (lambda) of progeny O. communa were maximum when parents experienced cold temperatures. Glycerol contents of both female and male in progeny was significantly higher when maternal and paternal adults were cold acclimated as compared to other treatments. This resulted in the supercooling point of the progeny adults being significantly lower compared to beetles emerging from parents that experienced room temperatures. These results suggest that cold hardiness of O. communa can be promoted by cold acclimation in previous generation, and it might counter-balance reduced survival in the next generation, especially when insects are tracking their host-plants into colder climates.

AB  - Rain-out shelters provide an effective tool to establish controlled water-stress environments by excluding undesired rain events and have been widely used in the selection and breeding of cool-season turfgrass for improved drought tolerance. However, the efficiency of recurrent selection using rain-out shelters has seldomly been investigated. In this study, we documented the selection process of tall fescue in one cycle of recurrent selection, compared the drought tolerance of two consecutive generations and estimated selection gain of tall fescue using rain-out shelters. Depending on days of drought, relative selection gain ranges from -4.20% to 3.60%, indicating small and unstable improvement from the parental generation. A subsequent analysis of experimental data using Bayesian mixed linear model revealed low narrow-sense heritability estimations (0.18 for parental generation and 0.08 for progeny generation), providing an explanation for this observation.

AB  - The life cycle of the amphipod, Corophium volutator (Pallas), is described from an intertidal mudflat in Maine, near the southern limit of the species' range in the western Atlantic Ocean. This population has two generations per year, with one generation born in May to mid-June and growing to reproduce and give rise to a second generation in August. The individuals born in August form the over-wintering generation. Comparison to sites in the Bay of Fundy, where different populations of C. volutator display one and two generations per year, rejects the hypothesis that episodic predation by shorebirds selects for the life history with two generations per year. Water temperatures during the summer may control the number of generations per year for C. volutator in the western Atlantic.

AB  - 1. Evidence suggests that changes of temperature-related performance curves can trigger a selective response in life-history traits. Hence, it should be expected that insects adapted to different temperature regimes should exhibit optimal performance at the temperature to which they are adapted.
   2. To test this idea we investigated how fecundity and longevity are influenced by ambient temperatures in a set of satyrine butterflies adapted to live in dry open landscapes or in closed forest landscapes, respectively, by keeping egg-laying adult females at five different constant temperatures ranging between 20 and 40degreesC.
   3. We studied four species, two of which are confined to dry and hot open habitats, namely the grayling (Hipparchia semele) and the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), and two of which are shade dwelling, namely the ringlet (Aphantopus hyperantus) and the speckled wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria).
   4. As predicted, the results showed that lifetime fecundity exhibited bell-shaped curves in relation to temperature with the open landscape group peaking at a higher temperature, 30degreesC, compared with the shade-dwelling group that peaked at 25degreesC. Longevity decreased with increasing temperatures among all species, but the open landscape living species survived better at higher temperatures. Moreover, although the magnitude of reproductive effort measured as lifetime egg mass did not differ between the two ecological groups, lifetime fecundity did with open landscape species laying more and smaller eggs than the shade-dwelling species.
   5. This difference in life-history character traits suggests either that dry and relatively warm open habitats open life-history opportunities in terms of higher fecundity and longevity that remain closed to butterflies adapted to cooler temperatures, or that life in dry open habitats actively selects for higher fecundity and survival as a result of increased offspring mortality.

AB  - Given the current rapid climate change, understanding the mechanisms underlying heat tolerance and its plasticity is an important goal of global change biology. Soil fauna communities are especially vulnerable because of their limited dispersal ability. It is generally recognized that transgenerational effects can contribute to the expression of phenotypic plasticity. Nevertheless, transgenerational plasticity in belowground organisms has received relatively little attention in the context of climate change, despite their major role in soil functioning. Here we test for transgenerational effects of heat shock exposure in the soil arthropod Orchesella cincta, a springtail species that regularly experiences heat stress conditions in its natural environment. We exposed females to heat stress, and subsequently investigated the effects of the same stress on the survival of their offspring. Thermal resistance of the progeny from treated and untreated mothers was compared at three life stages: egg, juvenile and adult. We provide evidence that exposure to heat shock induces a life stage-dependent increase in thermal resistance in the subsequent generation. The induced adaptive maternal effect persisted into the adult stage of the progeny. However, there is also a tradeoff resulting in reduced clutch size of treated females. These results are of broad significance to understanding the potential of organisms to cope with a changing climate.

AB  - Female polymorphism is observed in various animal species, but is particularly common in damselflies. The maintenance of this polymorphism has traditionally been explained from frequency and density dependent sexual conflict, however, the role of abiotic factors has recently attracted more interest. Here, the role of ambient temperature in shaping life-history was investigated for the three female morphs of Ischnura elegans (Vander Linden) (Zygoptera: Coenagrionidae). Eggs were obtained from the three mature female morphs for two populations in the Netherlands. Using a split-brood design, eggs of both populations were divided between a cold and a warm treatment group in the laboratory, and egg survival and hatching time were measured. Significant thermal plasticity was found in both hatching time and egg survival between both temperature treatments. However, individuals born to mothers belonging to different colour morphs did not differ in their response to temperature treatment. Independent of colour morph, clear differences in both life-history traits between the populations were found, suggesting local adaptation. Specifically, individuals from one population hatched faster but had lower egg survival in both thermal regimes. The selection force establishing fast hatching could be (facultative) bivoltinism in one of the populations compared to univoltinism in the other. This would be in line with the more southern (and more coastal) location of the presumed bivoltine population and the inverse relation between voltinism and latitude known from earlier studies. However, other natural selection forces, e. g. deterioration of the aquatic habitat, may also drive fast hatching.

AB  - Exposure to low temperatures reduces gamete viability and fecundity in females of insect species like Drosophila. Hence, adaptation to cold stress can in principle involve modifications in reproductive traits in females. Studies on resistance to cold stress have mostly addressed the evolution of adult survivorship post cold shock. Very few studies have addressed the evolution of reproductive traits in females in response to cold stress. We have successfully selected replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster for resistance to cold shock. After 50 generations of selection, we investigated pre- and post-copulatory traits i.e. mating latency, copulation duration, mating frequency and progeny production in female flies exposed to cold shock or control conditions. Post cold shock, females from the selected populations were better at recovery in terms of mating latency, mating success, and progeny production relative to females from the control populations. Performance of the two types of females was not different under control conditions. These findings clearly indicate that adaptation to cold stress involves rapid modification of the reproductive traits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Developmental plasticity can match offspring phenotypes to environmental conditions experienced by parents. Such epigenetic modifications are advantageous when parental conditions anticipate offspring environments. Here we show firstly, that developmental plasticity manifests differently in males and females. Secondly, that under stable conditions, phenotypic responses (metabolism and locomotion) accumulate across several generations. Metabolic scope in males was greater at warmer test temperatures (26-36 degrees C) in offspring bred at warm temperatures (29-30 degrees C) compared to those bred at cooler temperatures (22-23 degrees C), lending support to the predictive adaptive hypothesis. However, this transgenerational matching was not established until the second (F2) generation. For other responses, e.g. swimming performance in females, phenotypes of offspring bred in different thermal environments were different in the first (F1) generation, but became more similar across three generations, implying canalization. Thirdly, when environments changed across generations, the grandparental environment affected offspring phenotypes. In females, the mode of the swimming thermal performance curve shifted to coincide with the grandparental rather than the parental or offspring developmental environments, and this lag in response may represent a cost of plasticity. These findings show that the effects of developmental plasticity differ between traits, and may be modulated by the different life histories of males and females.

AB  - There are comparatively diverse bacterial communities inside seeds, which are vertically transmitted and conserved, becoming sources of endophytes in the next generation of host plants. We studied how rice seed endophyte composition changed over time following crossbreeding, repeated inbreeding, subsequent human selection and planting of different rice seeds in different ecogeographical locations. Using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis to study bacterial communities, we observed that diversity between the original parents and their offspring may show significant differences in richness, evenness and diversity indices. Heat maps reveal substantial contributions of both or either parent in the shaping of the bacterial seed endophytes of the offspring. Most of the terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) of the subsequent progeny could be traced to any or both of its parents while unique T-RFs of the offspring suggest external sources of colonization particularly when the seeds were cultivated in different locations. Many similar groups of endophytic bacteria persist in the seeds even after recultivation in different locations, indicating resilience to environmental changes and conservation of bacteria across generations. This study suggests that parent plants contributed to the shaping of seed bacterial endophytes of their offspring, although it is also possible that these soil grown rice plants recruit similar populations of endophytes from the soil generation after generation. This study also highlights some bacterial groups belonging to Herbaspirilium, Microbacterium, Curtobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Xanthomonas and Enterobacter that may be part of a transmitted and conserved "core microbiota" that are ubiquitous and dominant members of the endophytic communities of the rice seeds.

AB  - Storage of Gonatocerus ashmeadi Girault (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) adults at 2, 5, and 10 degrees C showed that these parasitoids do not survive at 2 degrees C for 5 d, and exposure to 5 and 10 degrees C shortens their life span. The lethal time (LT)(50) (i.e., length of storage time for 50% wasp Survival) at 5 degrees C was 14 d for males and approximate to 29 d for females, whereas at 10 degrees C was 32 and 39 d, respectively. Effects of adult storage at 10 degrees C on other factors indicating fitness, such as fecundity, developmental time, parasitism, emergence, and sex ratio, were examined on female wasps and their progeny at 10-d intervals for up to 60 d. Glassy-winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar), eggs were used as hosts for propagation of this wasp and for assessing its oviposition and fecundity. Increasing adult storage time decreased the length of the ovipositional period for the maternal generation, and oviposition was decreased by 90% after 60-d storage. A significant reduction in maternal lifetime fecundity occurred after 20-d storage and in the incidence of parasitism after 40 d. We also found a carryover effect caused by storage of the maternal generation that was expressed in the F-1 generation. When cold storage of the adult parents was >= 20 d, we observed delayed development, decreased fecundity, reduced longevity, and increased male production occurring in the F-1 generation. Reduced fitness of the F-1 generation was also expressed as a decrease in net reproductive rate (R-0) and an increase in mean generation time (T-c). However, none of these deleterious effects were evident in the F-2 progeny that descended from grandparents that had experienced cold storage. Damage caused by indirect chilling injury and/or induced maternal aging occurring during storage can account for the decreased fitness of maternal and F-1 generations. Providing that the limits of cold tolerance of G. ashmeadi as defined in this study are not exceeded, our results show that short-term cold storage of adults could be used in a mass-rearing program.

AB  - Although exposure to environmental stress is common in most populations, and the physiological effects of stress on individuals are well studied, the evolutionary importance of stress to populations is not well understood. To address multitrait responses to environmental change and potential constraints on character evolution, we analysed, in 100 isofemale lines of Drosophila buzzatii, the genetic relationships between resistance to a short heat shock and several life-history traits: survival in benign conditions, larval developmental time, fecundity and longevity. Estimates of heritability of larval thermotolerance were low, but significant, and all life-history traits varied significantly among isofemale lines. Several of these traits covaried significantly. Most correlations indicated positive life-history relationships, but males and females from lines where female fecundity was higher developed more slowly in the absence of stress, which is a negative life-history relationship. The stress reduced or negated many trait associations, and showed one additional relationship; more larvae from lines that developed fast at 25 degrees C survived to adult after stress than did larvae from slow developing lines. These shifts in fitness relationships, when a single stress bout is applied, suggest that even small increases in environmental stress can have profound effects on evolutionary relationships among life-history traits.

AB  - To investigate the influence of life-history adaptations on the fidelity of laboratory bioassays, copepods Tisbe holothuriae were collected from tno areas (polluted and non-polluted) and maintained in the laboratory under temperatures similar to their wild habitat. The sensitivity of Tisbe increased with increasing temperature. The wild animals from the polluted area were more tolerant to Co2+ and Cr6+ than those from the non-polluted area. Laboratory animals (40 generations after sampling) from the polluted area, were still more tolerant than those from the non-polluted area. These animals also exhibited a similar or increased tolerance, whereas those of the first generation shelved a higher sensitivity, compared to the wild ones from the same area. Demography also varied in successive generations after sampling. Laboratory bioassays using T. holothuriae can predict most of its responses in the field, but attention should be paid to adaptations to temperature, pollution and the laboratory environment.

AB  - Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko is used throughout Europe as an effective biological control agent against the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner). However, in certain climatic regions, the biological control exerted by this parasitoid is less effective. High temperatures inside the released capsules are suspected to have a negative influence on the parasitoids. To simulate these adverse conditions, we applied heat shocks (35-degrees-C and 44-degrees-C) for 6 hours to pupae of Trichogramma brassicae at two periods: white pupae and melanized pupae.
   The results showed the susceptibility of both the white pupae and melanized pupae, especially at 44-degrees-C. At this temperature, the adults (G0 generation) derived from pupae treated at any age showed reduced longevity and fecundity. Moreover, those descended from treated melanized pupae showed an emergence rate lower than that of the control. These effects reduced to half and more the parasitic efficiency of the G, generation. For the progeny (G1 generation), we observed a decrease of the female ratio : 38 % for the progeny of adults derived from treated melanized pupae ; 88 % for the progeny of those derived from treated white pupae. In that condition, the G1 generation, almost totally male, could not have any parasitic activity.

AB  - Environmental variation can induce life-history changes that can last over a large part of the lifetime of an organism. If multiple demographic traits are affected, expected changes in climate may influence environmental covariances among traits in a complex manner. Thus, examining the consequences of environmental fluctuations requires that individual information at multiple life stages is available, which is particularly challenging in long-lived species. Here, we analyse how variation in climatic conditions occurring in the year of hatching of female goshawks Accipiter gentilis (L.) affects age-specific variation in demographic traits and lifetime reproductive success (LRS). LRS decreased with increasing temperature in April in the year of hatching, due to lower breeding frequency and shorter reproductive life span. In contrast, the probability for a female to successfully breed was higher in years with a warm April, but lower LRS of the offspring in these years generated a negative covariance among fecundity rates among generations. The mechanism by which climatic conditions generated cohort effects was likely through influencing the quality of the breeding segment of the population in a given year, as the proportion of pigeons in the diet during the breeding period was positively related to annual and LRS, and the diet of adult females that hatched in warm years contained fewer pigeons. Climatic conditions experienced during different stages of individual life histories caused complex patterns of environmental covariance among demographic traits even across generations. Such environmental covariances may either buffer or amplify impacts of climate change on population growth, emphasizing the importance of considering demographic changes during the complete life history of individuals when predicting the effect of climatic change on population dynamics of long-lived species.

AB  - Food characteristics strongly regulate digestive enzymatic activity of insects through direct influences on their midgut mechanisms. Insect performance is better on diets that contain nutrients in proportions that fit its digestive enzymes. Little is known about the influences of rearing history on parasitism success of Habrobracon hebetor Say. This research focused on the effect of nutrient regulation on survival, development, and parasitism of H. hebetor. Life history and digestive enzyme activity of fourth-stage larvae of H. hebetor were studied when reared on Ephestia kuehniella Zeller. This parasitoid was then introduced to Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner), and above-mentioned parameters were also studied in the first and fourth generations after transfer. In term of parasitism success, H. hebetor preferred E. kuehniella over He. armigera. When the first and fourth generations of He. armigera-reared H. hebetor were compared, the rearing history affected the life history and enzymatic activity of the parasitoid. A better performance of H. hebetor was achieved after it was reared on He. armigera for the four generations. Because, digestive alpha-amylase and general protease of the parasitoid were matched with the new host, it used reserve energy for a better performance. Thus, a better performance of H. hebetor could be obtained when the parasitoid was reared on its original host for at least four generations.

AB  - Replicated lines of Drosophila melanogaster were allowed to evolve in population cage culture at 16.5-degrees-C or 25-degrees-C for five years.  Their larval and pupal development times, larval growth rates, larval critical weights for pupariation and pre-adult survival rates were then measured at both temperatures.  Pre-adult survival showed evidence of adaptation of the lines to their thermal selection regimes, with each set of lines showing superior survival when tested at the temperature at which they had been evolving.  Pupal periods were similar for all lines when growing at 16.5-degrees-C but, at 25-degrees-C, the low temperature lines had the longer pupal periods.  Irrespective of experimental temperature, low temperature lines grew faster and had shorter larval development periods than the high temperature lines.  Larval critical weights for pupariation were higher in the low temperature lines at the low experimental temperature, and higher in the high temperature lines at the higher experimental temperature.  The correlations between these traits induced by thermal evolution were in general different from or opposite to the genetic correlations found within a single temperature.

AB  - 1. Landscape-scale clines in environmental parameters can lead to life-history gradients. Study of interspecific life-history differences can provide evidence of evolutionary adaptations in response to environmental cues, whereas examination of intraspecific life-history variation can identify the ecological mechanisms driving trait evolution.
   2. We examined egg size and fecundity variation in three species of closely related freshwater fish (Galaxiidae) which occur across a habitat gradient in South Island, New Zealand. Inter-population trait variation was assessed in the species with the widest distribution to investigate the ecological mechanisms driving egg size evolution.
   3. Substantial interspecific egg size and fecundity differences were observed. Galaxias paucispondylus, which generally occurs in high altitude headwater streams, showed an average egg size an order of magnitude larger, and fecundity an order of magnitude lower than G. brevipinnis, a species which rears in pelagic environments. Galaxias vulgaris, which rears fluvial environments but is generally distributed in lower catchment reaches than G. paucispondylus, showed intermediate fecundity and egg size traits. This interspecific trait variation is likely to be driven by differences in the larval rearing habitat, i.e. rearing in cold high altitude locations requires large well-developed larvae (and therefore large eggs) but these come at the cost of maternal fecundity, whereas in rearing in warmer lower catchment watercourses, and pelagic habitats, does not require such large well-developed larvae. Hence, fitness is maximised by progressively increasing fecundity by reducing egg size across this habitat cline.
   4. Life history-habitat trends were repeated when intraspecific patterns in the widely distributed G. vulgaris were assessed, with population egg size increasing, and fecundity decreasing, in relation to a suite of interrelated environmental variables up an approximate altitudinal cline.
   5. The results highlight how inter-and intraspecific variation in egg size-fecundity trade-offs in closely related species can interact to drive the evolution of landscape-scale life-history gradients. Egg size differences are likely to be driven by differences in the quality of the larval rearing habitat, i.e. rearing in a challenging habitat requires a larger egg whereas in relatively benign larval rearing habitat, fecundity can be maximised by reducing egg size. The interspecific variation observed provides evidence of trait adaptation in response to an environmental cue, while the intraspecific inter-population differences indicate the potential ecological mechanisms driving trait evolution.

AB  - Multiple paternity is widespread across animal and plant taxa and can increase genetic diversity and enhance fitness, especially in unpredictable environments. A prior study of the intertidal zone porcelain crab, Petrolisthes cinctipes (Randall, 1840), found that most females carried polyandrous broods. We tested the hypothesis that multiple paternity in P. cinctipes enhances fitness through increased average brood tolerance to temperature stress. Embryonic survival of split broods (N = 27) was measured under ambient conditions and following a single one-hour heat shock at 30 degrees C. Two microsatellite loci were used to genotype embryos and mothers in order to distinguish multiple from single paternity in each brood. Mean overall hatching percentage did not differ between singly and multiply sired broods; however, when exposed to a heat-shock, single-sired broods experienced 11% lower hatching success. Though relative fitness was higher in single-sired broods under non-stressful conditions, extrapolation of our results to conditions where temperatures are at least 30 degrees C (present-day extremes for the California coast) for > 2 days of the embryonic brood period, multiply sired broods have a relative fitness that is approximately 24 times higher after 15 generations. Maternal quality (size) and the timing of the heat shock relative to developmental timing also influence the brood response to heat shock. Our results suggest that multiple paternity reduces embryo survival variance between ambient and heat-shock conditions and that polyandrous behavior could be an advantage for P. cinctipes in the thermally variable high-intertidal zone. We conclude that multiple paternity is an important strategy for increasing fitness by genetic diversification in organisms that experience severe and unpredictable levels of environmental stress.

AB  - To persist in an ocean changing in temperature, pH and other stressors related to climate change, many marine species will likely need to acclimatize or adapt to avoid extinction. If marine populations possess adequate genetic variation in tolerance to climate change stressors, species might be able to adapt to environmental change. Marine climate change research is moving away from single life stage studies where individuals are directly placed into projected scenarios ('future shock' approach), to focus on the adaptive potential of populations in an ocean that will gradually change over coming decades. This review summarizes studies that consider the adaptive potential of marine invertebrates to climate change stressors and the methods that have been applied to this research, including quantitative genetics, laboratory selection studies and trans- and multigenerational experiments. Phenotypic plasticity is likely to contribute to population persistence providing time for genetic adaptation to occur. Transgenerational and epigenetic effects indicate that the environmental and physiological history of the parents can affect offspring performance. There is a need for long-term, multigenerational experiments to determine the influence of phenotypic plasticity, genetic variation and transgenerational effects on species' capacity to persist in a changing ocean. However, multigenerational studies are only practicable for short generation species. Consideration of multiple morphological and physiological traits, including changes in molecular processes (eg, DNA methylation) and long-term studies that facilitate acclimatization will be essential in making informed predictions of how the seascape and marine communities will be altered by climate change.

AB  - Selective mortality within a population, based on the phenotype of individuals, is the foundation of the theory of natural selection. We examined temperature-induced shifts in the relationships among early life history traits and survivorship over the embryonic and larval stages of a tropical damselfish, Pomacentrus amboinensis. Our experiments show that temperature determines the intensity of selective mortality, and that this changes with ontogeny. The size of energy stores determined survival through to hatching, after which egg size became a good indicator of fitness as predicted by theoretical models. Yet, the benefits associated with egg size were not uniform among test temperatures. Initial egg size positively influenced larval survival at control temperature (29 degrees C). However, this embryonic trait had no effect on post-hatching longevity of individuals reared at the higher (31 degrees C) and lower (25 degrees C) end of the temperature range. Overall, our findings indicate that the outcome of selective mortality is strongly dependent on the interaction between environment conditions and intrinsic developmental schedules.

AB  - The low initial fitness of progeny from interspecific crosses in animals and the rarity of interspecific hybridization in natural environments have led to a debate about the evolutionary importance of this phenomenon. Here we directly assess the effects of hybridization between Drosophila serrata and Drosophila birchii on evolutionary rates. We looked at the effects on laboratory adaptation over 30 generations in two laboratory environments, one of which involved nutrition and temperature stress. Laboratory adaptation occurred over time in both environments as reflected by a marked change in viability. However, whilst hybrid lines at no stage performed poorly relative to parental lines, their rate of adaptation never exceeded that of the parentals. Thus, there was no evidence that hybridization increased evolutionary rates. Instead, hybrid lines converged phenotypically with one of the parental species.

AB  - An artificial diet to mass-rear Euschistus heros (F. 1798) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) was developed in the laboratory. Biological studies were conducted under controlled conditions of temperature (25 +/- 2 degrees C), RH: 60 +/- 10%, and photoperiod of 14: 10 (L:D) h. Out of 13 diets tested, 2 diets (D9 and D11) were the most suitable. The artificial diets selected had the same composition (green beans, peanuts, sucrose, water, Nipagin, and sorbic acid) except for different antimicrobial agents (D11 has tetracycline, and D9 doesn't). The 68% viability for the egg-adult period of insects reared on these lyophilized artificial diets (LAD) was almost twice as high as the 38% viability obtained with the natural diet. Although adults reared on LAD weighed 17% less than those reared on the natural diet, mean fecundity was higher than on the natural diet (282 eggs/female), reaching 430 eggs/female. The net reproductive rate (Ro) increased over the generations for the diets with lyophilized material and antimicrobial agents. The opposite occurred with the diet of lyophilized material without antimicrobial agents, showing that the insects either adapted or degenerated through generations. Lyophilized diets supported the production of E. heros through at least 10 generations, with no degeneration.

AB  - Wild-collected Drosophila melanogaster females were isolated in culture vials to initiate isofemale lines in the laboratory. Wing length and body pigmentation (thorax, abdominal segments 5, 6 and 7 and their sum) were measured in wild flies and in successive laboratory generations. Heritability was estimated by parent-offspring regression between wild-living flies and laboratory progeny or by calculating intraclass correlation between lines in each laboratory generation. For wing length, phenotypic variability was much higher in nature than in the laboratory, and the estimated heritability with parent-offspring regression (0.14) was significant but quite low. Within laboratory generations? intraclass correlation was much higher, on average 0.34. For pigmentation characteristics, variability in nature was similar to that measured in the laboratory. Parent-offspring regressions produced significant and high heritability values (range 0.40-0.62), except for abdomen segment 5. Intraclass correlations were also significantly greater than zero for all traits (range 0.22-0.47), including segment 5. The stability of the lines over successive laboratory generations was shown by the stability of the overall mean and by a strong positive correlation between family means of successive generations. The correlation across generations demonstrates a genetic repeatability of the trait and should be useful in experiments using isofemale lines.

AB  - We employed common-garden experiments to test for genetic variation in responses of larval life-history traits to temperature between two populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L., 1758) that naturally experience contrasting thermal environments during early life due to spatial and temporal differences in spawning. Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence cod larvae experienced faster growth in warmer water and low, uniform survival across all experimental temperatures (3, 7, 11 degrees C), consistent with previous studies on this spring-spawning population. In contrast, larvae from fall-spawning Southwestern Scotian Shelf cod collected near Sambro, Nova Scotia, lacked plasticity for growth but experienced much lower survival at higher temperatures. Phenotypes that are positively associated with fitness were observed at temperatures closest to those experienced in the wild, consistent with the hypothesis that these populations are adapted to local thermal regimes. The lack of growth plasticity observed in Sambro cod might be due to costly maintenance of plasticity in stable environments or energy savings at cold temperatures. However, additional experiments need to be conducted on Sambro cod and other fall-spawning marine fishes to determine to what extent responses to projected changes in climate will differ among populations.

AB  - Global warming both reduces global temperature variance and increases the frequency of extreme weather events. In response to these ambient perturbations, animals may be subject to trans- or intra-generational phenotype modifications that help to maintain homeostasis and fitness. Here, we show how temperatureassociated transgenerational plasticity in tilapia affects metabolic trade-offs during developmental stages under a global warming scenario. Tropical tilapia reared at a stable temperature of 27 degrees C for a decade were divided into two temperature-experience groups for four generations of breeding. Each generation of one group was exposed to a single 15 degrees C cold-shock experience during its lifetime (cold-experienced CE group), and the other group was kept stably at 27 degrees C throughout their lifetimes (cold-naive CN group). The offspring at early life stages from the CE and CN tilapia were then assessed by metabolomics-based profiling, and the results implied that parental cold-experience might affect energy provision during reproduction. Furthermore, at early life stages, progeny may be endowed with metabolic traits that help the animals cope with ambient temperature perturbations. This study also applied the feature rescaling and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to visualize metabolic dynamics, and the result could effectively decompose the complex omic-based datasets to represent the energy trade-off variability. For example, the carbohydrate to free amino acid conversion and enhanced compensatory features appeared to be hypothermic-responsive traits. These multigenerational metabolic effects suggest that the tropical ectothermic tilapia may exhibit transgenerational phenotype plasticity, which could optimize energy allocation under ambient temperature challenges. Knowledge about such metabolism-related transgenerational plasticity effects in ectothermic aquatic species may allow us to better predict how adaptive mechanisms will affect fish populations in a climate with narrow temperature variation and frequent extreme weather events.

AB  - The whitefly, Bemisia tabaci biotype B (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is a key agricultural pest and virus vector in diverse crops throughout the world. It is distributed in warm environments with short periods of extreme temperatures, suggesting mechanisms to adapt and expand to new areas. The aim of this study was to determine how temperature affects fitness of B. tabaci, particularly during short periods of stressful high temperatures. Thermotolerance curves were constructed at different one-hour heat shocks (37, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45 degrees C and a control at 25 degrees C), measuring its effect on three life history traits involved in fitness: survival, fecundity and viability. Then, temperatures were selected to establish an induced thermotolerance or hardening treatment (40 degrees C/lh, 25 degrees C/lh and 45 degrees C/lh) to compare with the basal thermotolerance (45 degrees C/lh). The heat shocks significantly affected B. tabaci survival between 41 degrees C (82.5%) and 45 degrees C (2.7%). Fecundity was only affected significantly at 45 degrees C without oviposition. Viability diminished significantly at 44 degrees C (67%). Thermal hardening increased survival from 2.73% (45 degrees C/lh) to 10% in males and 33% in females; although it was significantly higher in females, only. These results show high thermotolerance of B. tabaci to heat shocks, evidencing plasticity of the species to survive a broad range of temperatures (>= 25 degrees C), which contributes to explaining the expansion of biotype B distribution in areas and seasons with extreme high temperatures.

AB  - Physiological response and acclimation to thermal stress is a key strategy of insects to cope with changing climate. The underlying mechanism of heat acclimation in insects is still unclear. Here, the heat selection and transcript level response in the larvae of the rice leaf folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee, a serious pest of rice in summer, were studied. The survival and fecundity of larvae during multigenerational heat selection at 39 degrees C were examined, and heat tolerance and mRNA expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and 90 (Hsp90) were examined under heat stress. The results showed that survival and fecundity of larvae increased notably and then kept constant after two or three generations of heat selection. Heat selection improved thermal tolerance of larvae. The Hsp70 mRNA expression of the 3rd-instar larvae increased in all five generations of heat selection, but Hsp90 increased only in the first two generations. The response of Hsp70 to 39 degrees C heat treatment in the larvae kept at 27 degrees C was different from the larvae exposed to the conditioning heat treatments, but the response of Hsp 90 was similar. Moreover, the Hsp70 and Hsp90 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in the heat-acclimated larvae than that in the unacclimated larvae at a comparable duration of exposure to 37 and 41 degrees C. Selection at a high temperature across multiple generations led larvae to heat acclimation, and Hsp70 and Hsp90 were involved in this acclimation process.

AB  - In ectothermic organisms, temperature plays a vital role in survival and reproductive success. Founding isofemale lines from wild-collected females is a basic tool for characterizing quantitative traits in a natural population. The effects of heat shock, i.e., short exposure to heat stress, on survival and reproductive success in 10 recently collected isofemale lines of Drosophila ananassae Doleschall, 1858 were compared. Flies were treated as follows: (i) unstressed control; (ii) placed at 37 degrees C for 90amin (pre-treatment); (iii) placed at 40 degrees C for 60amin 24ah before the fecundity test; and (iv) placed at 40 degrees C for 60 min with pre-treatment 16ah before they were exposed to 40 degrees C. The heat stress strongly affected survival. However, there was no significant difference between the survival of males and females. Furthermore, the female fecundity, measured as F(1) offspring produced over the next 12adays, was also reduced. Heat pre-treatment improved survival of both male and female and also improved female productivity. We found significant variation in female fecundity among isofemale lines, and intraclass correlations increased for stress treatments. The results suggest that a small increase in environmental stress may affect fitness traits, and there is enough genetic variation for thermal adaptation in D.aananassae.

AB  - This study aims to estimate the potential of the municipal solid waste management consortiums in Minas Gerais for electricity generation from Landfill Gas (LFG) and from anaerobic reactors for organic fractions of this waste. Economic viability studies were conducted for both types of enterprises. Projections for landfill biogas generation were made using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) LandGem?R 3.02 software program. Estimates for anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste were performed based on theoretical generation from this substrate's chemical oxygen demand. The power, electricity, and investment values for both projects were calculated, and the respective Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and payback time were also obtained for the various consortiums. The results show that there is economic viability potential for electric energy generation for landfill biogas at the CIAS CENTRO OESTE, CIDES, CISAB Zona da Mata, CONVALE, and CORESAB Boa Vista municipal solid waste consortiums. Electric Energy obtained for the state of Minas Gerais would be about 3,900,000 MWh/year, and the total installed power capacity would be approximately 4500 kW for a Thermal Power Plant (TPP) using LFG for all consortiums. These values were nearly 15,400 MWh/year and 3200 kW for biogas energy derived from the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) anaerobic digestion. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study aimed at assessing the effects of increased air temperature and reduced soil moisture content on the multi-generation toxicity of a soil polluted by metal/metalloid mining wastes. Enchytraeus crypticus was exposed to dilution series of the polluted soil in Lufa 2.2 soil under different combinations of air temperature (20 degrees C and 25 degrees C) and soil moisture content (50% and 30% of the soil water holding capacity, WHC) over three generations standardized on physiological time. Generation time was shorter with increasing air temperature and/or soil moisture content. Adult survival was only affected at 30% WHC (similar to 30% reduction at the highest percentages of polluted soil). Reproduction decreased with increasing percentage of polluted soil in a dose-related manner and over generations. Toxicity increased at 30% WHC (>50% reduction in EC50 in F0 and F1 generations) and over generations in the treatments at 20 degrees C (40-60% reduction in EC50 in F2 generation). At 25 degrees C, toxicity did not change when combined with 30% WHC and only slightly increased with 50% WHC. So, higher air temperature and/or reduced soil moisture content does affect the toxicity of soils polluted by metal/metalloid mining wastes to E. crypticus and this effect may exacerbate over generations.

AB  - Increased variability in water temperature is predicted to impose disproportionally greater fitness costs than mean increase in temperature. Additionally, water contaminants are currently a major source of human-induced stress likely to produce fitness costs. Global change models forecast an increase in these two human-induced stressors. Yet, in spite the growing interest in understanding how organisms respond to global change, the joint fitness effects of water pollution and increased variability in temperature remain unclear. Here, using a multi generational design, we test the hypothesis that exposure to high concentrations of fluoxetine, a human medicine commonly found in freshwater systems, causes increased lifetime fitness costs, when associated with increased variability in temperature. Although fluoxetine and variability in temperature elicited some fitness cost when tested alone, when both stressors acted together the costs were disproportionally greater. The combined effect of fluoxetine and variability in temperature led to a reduction of 37% in lifetime reproductive success and a 17.9% decrease in population growth rate. Interestingly, fluoxetine and variability in temperature had no effect on the probability of survival. Freshwater systems are among the most imperilled ecosystems, often exposed to multiple human-induced stressors. Our results indicate that organisms face greater fitness risk when exposed to multiple stressors at the same time than when each stress acts alone. Our study highlights the importance of using a multi generational approach to fully understand individual environmental tolerance and its responses to a global change scenario in aquatic systems.

AB  - Background
   In Drosophila melanogaster the fitness of males depends on a broad array of reproductive traits classified as pre- and post-copulatory traits. Exposure to cold stress, can reduce sperm number, male mating ability and courtship behavior. Therefore, it is expected that the adaptation to cold stress will involve changes in pre- and post -copulatory traits. Such evolution of reproductive traits in response to cold stress is not well studied.
   Methods
   We selected replicate populations of D. melanogaster for resistance to cold shock. Over 37-46 generations of selection, we investigated pre- and post -copulatory traits such as mating latency, copulation duration, mating frequency, male fertility, fitness (progeny production) and sperm competitive ability in male flies subjected to cold shock and those not subjected to cold shock.
   Results
   We found that post cold shock, the males from the selected populations had a significantly lower mating latency along with, higher mating frequency, fertility, sperm competitive ability and number of progeny relative to the control populations.
   Conclusion
   While most studies of experimental evolution of cold stress resistance have documented the evolution of survivorship in response to selection, our study clearly shows that adaptation to cold stress involves rapid changes in the pre- and post -copulatory traits. Additionally, improved performances under stressful conditions need not necessarily trade-off with performance under benign conditions.

AB  - Global warming poses a threat to organisms with temperature-dependent sex determination because it can affect operational sex ratios. Using a multigenerational experiment with a marine fish, we provide the first evidence that parents developing from early life at elevated temperatures can adjust their offspring gender through nongenetic and nonbehavioural means. However, this adjustment was not possible when parents reproduced, but did not develop, at elevated temperatures. Complete restoration of the offspring sex ratio occurred when parents developed at 1.5 degrees C above the present-day average temperature for one generation. However, only partial improvement in the sex ratio occurred at 3.0 degrees C above average conditions, even after two generations, suggesting a limitation to transgenerational plasticity when developmental temperature is substantially increased. This study highlights the potential for transgenerational plasticity to ameliorate some impacts of climate change and that development from early life may be essential for expression of transgenerational plasticity in some traits.

AB  - Evidence for temperature adaptation in Daphnia magna was inferred from variation in the shape of temperature reaction norms for somatic growth rate, a fitness-related trait. Ex-ephippial clones from eight populations across Europe were grown under standardized conditions after preacclimation at five temperatures (17-29 degrees C). Significant variation for grand mean growth rates occurred both within populations (among clones) and between populations. Genetic variation for reaction norm shape was found within populations, with temperature-dependent trade-offs in clone relative fitness. However, the population average responses to temperature were similar, following approximately parallel reaction norms. The among-population variation is not evidence for temperature adaptation. Lack of temperature adaptation at the population level may be a feature of intermittent populations where environmentally terminated diapause can entrain the planktonic stage of the life-history within a similar range of temperatures.

AB  - The dipteran Drosophila melanogaster can express a form of reproductive quiescence or diapause when exposed to low temperature and shortened photoperiod. Among natural populations in the eastern United States, the frequency of lines that express reproductive diapause in the laboratory varies substantially and predictably with latitudinal origin. The goals of the present study were twofold: (1) to examine the impact of genetic variance for diapause expression on multiple traits associated with organismal fitness; and (2) to evaluate the potential for fitness trade-offs between diapause and nondiapause phenotypes that may result in the observed cline. Even prior to diapause entry or expression, inbred lines that express and do not express reproductive diapause in laboratory assays were constitutively distinct for life span, age-specific mortality rates, fecundity profiles, resistance to cold and starvation stress, lipid content, development time, and egg-to-adult viability. Furthermore, estimates of genetic correlations based on line means revealed significant differentiation for genetic variance/covariance matrices between diapause and nondiapause lines. The data indicate the potential for life-history trade-offs associated with variation for the diapause phenotype. The observed cline in diapause incidence in the eastern United States may be generated by these trade-offs and the associated spatial and/or temporal variation in relative fitness of these two phenotypes in natural populations.

AB  - Life-history traits correlated to reproduction are important in deciding adaptability of insects. Lagria hirta L. has a short phytophagous adult phase in summer and a very long saprophagous larval phase extending from autumn until spring. This study revealed that its reproduction was modified by external factors and by complex interactions involving different life-history traits. Oviposition occurred only at 15-25 degreesC, LD (L16: D8) or SD (L8: D16). Within this temperature range, preoviposition time, fecundity and adult life span were affected (P less than or equal to 0.05). Photoperiod Was found significantly, to affect fecundity, viability of eggs and preoviposition time (P less than or equal to 0.04). Unmated females can lay eggs, but the eggs are sterile. The survival of eggs is also influenced by photoperiod (P < 0.001). In this study, the subtle variations were examined in the last instar's duration, pupal weight, fecundity and adult life span. In terms of reproduction, two correlations were apparent: larval short last instar durations result in heavier pupae and eclose to longer-lived adults; conversely, larvae with longer last instars produce lighter pupae which, if female, tend to lay fewer eggs. These correlations were statistically significant (P less than or equal to 0.05). These trends represent a trade-off in resource allocation: long final instar duration may consume more energy that would be invested in reproduction. This is heterogeneous (phenotypically or genotypically) among the individuals of L. hirta.

AB  - Short summer seasons with low thermal energy input characterise polar ecosystems. Climatic variables and physical isolation of terrestrial habitats act as selective filters which must be passed to allow colonisation, establishment and survival in these extreme environments. Life history studies of the terrestrial biota of such ecosystems give little evidence of adaptive responses to low temperatures having evolved in situ, even though behavioural, ecophysiological and biochemical features allowing tolerance of the likely extremes are well-developed. Observed life history strategies are often consistent with the general predictions of "adversity" (A) or "stress" (S) selection. However, biota successful in these extreme environments may be better-grouped by the lack of particular life history features, rather than common possession.

AB  - The exposure of adult fish to warm or high temperatures is known to impair reproduction, yet the long-term reproductive impacts for treatments at early life are not well clarified. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of warm temperature (WT) during juvenile stage on gonad maturation, gamete quality, and offspring thermotolerance in rainbow trout. While the comparison of basic reproductive parameters in WT females did not reveal any kind of impairment, many WT males showed an atrophied, undeveloped gonad, or a smaller testis with lower milt volume; sperm quality parameters in WT males and deformity rates in the respective progeny were also highly affected. However, despite of such negative effects, many of the remaining progeny presented better rates of survival and growth when exposed to the same conditions as those of parental fish (WT), suggesting that thermal stress in parr stage males elicited intergenerational thermotolerance after a single generation. The present results support that prolonged warming stress during early life stages can adversely affect key reproductive aspects, but contrastingly increase offspring performance at upper thermal ranges. These findings have implications on the capacity of fish to adapt and to cope with global warming.

AB  - The whiteflies belonging to the species groupBemisia tabacitransmit viruses that are the greatest constraint to the production of cassava, Africa's most important food security crop. We studied the life history of an endemic African population ofB. tabaciSSA-ESA at six constant temperatures (16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36 degrees C) in controlled environment chambers, and for 10 generations in the field. Oviposition occurred between 20 and 28 degrees C, with highest fecundity (114.5 +/- 88.2) eggs per female at 20 degrees C. Similarly,B. tabaciadult females average survival time was longest (19.7 days) at 24 degrees C, and shortest (8.5 days) at 36 degrees C. Immature development time decreased with increasing temperature from 59.3 days at 16 degrees C to 16.3 days at 28 degrees C, and increased above 28 degrees C. A constant temperature of 36 degrees C was lethal to eggs and first instars and no immature stage developed further to adults at this temperature. Several temperature-driven models were fitted for describing the species development, survival and reproduction using Insect Life Cycle Modelling (ILCYM (R)) software. Median temperature-dependent development rates in individual immature life stages were statistically described by Taylor, Briere 1 and Tb (Logan) models. Temperature-dependent mortality and senescence rates in immature stages were described by using parabolic nonlinear models. The longevity of adult females and oviposition time was best described by the Weibull distribution. Maximum population growth was predicted between 26 and 28 degrees C. These results will be useful for spatio-temporal analysis of climate change impacts on the distribution and abundance of this pest.

AB  - In many taxa of squamate reptiles, thermal conditions during incubation affect fitness-relevant phenotypic traits of the offspring. Therefore, a gravid female can enhance the fitness of her offspring by selecting appropriate thermal regimes. The maternal manipulation hypothesis (MMH) attributes phylogenetic shifts in a broad array of maternal traits (such as nest-site selection, prolonged uterine retention of eggs, and shivering thermogenesis) to selective advantages driven by embryonic developmental plasticity: mothers enhance the viability of their offspring by providing "better" incubation conditions. In Herpetologica 68:147-159, Schwarzkopf and Andrews (2012) pointed out an alternative possibility: that reproduction-induced shifts in maternal thermoregulatoly tactics have evolved because they enhance maternal, not offspring, fitness. Although possible on logical grounds, this alternative hypothesis is inconsistent with available evidence on squamate biology, especially with the diversity of thermoregulatory modifications induced by reproduction. Most reproduction-associated shifts in maternal thermoregulation likely reflect benefits to offspring (as posited by the NMH), or are nonadaptive consequences of ecological shifts that are enforced by reproduction.

AB  - In order to identify suitable Trichogramma strains for mass production and successful control of key lepidopteran pests in paddy fields in the Greater Mekong Subregion, the effects of high temperatures on wasp life history traits were compared among three strains of Trichogramma chilonis Ishii and two strains of Trichogramma ostriniae Pang et Chen, collected from paddy fields in the region. At a rearing temperature of 25 A degrees C, life history traits differed significantly among the five strains tested and the three T. chilonis strains and a T. ostriniae strain were of high performance. When female wasps were exposed to higher temperatures commonly encountered in the region, negative effects were observed on key life history parameters of adult females and their offspring at 34 A degrees C, which became even more serious at 37 A degrees C. In particular, the two T. ostriniae strains were not able to successfully develop to adulthood at all at 37 A degrees C while for the T. chilonis strains adult emergence was significantly reduced. In addition, the emerged offspring females lived only around one day and no parasitism was observed. When the three T. chilonis strains were exposed to 37 A degrees C for 4 to 12 h at prepupal and pupal stages, reflecting heat shocks that the released Trichogramma may experience in the field, adult emergence was significantly reduced after an exposure time of 12 h. In summary, the three T. chilonis strains show a relatively high potential for incorporation in a biological control program in the target region. Our results also highlight that tests at both rearing and field temperatures are necessary in selection of potential Trichogramma strains for an inundative release program where there is significant difference between rearing and field temperatures.

AB  - Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) biotype B and Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) are invasive whitefly species that often co-occur on greenhouse-grown vegetables in northern China. Although B. tabaci biotype B has been present in China for a relatively short period of time, it has become dominant over T. vaporariorum. We studied the interspecific competitive interactions between the two species in single or mixed cultures at 24 +/- 1 degrees C, 40 +/- 5% RH, and L14:D10 h photoperiod. Female longevity on tomato was not significantly different between species, but B. tabaci reproduced 4.3 to 4.9 fold more progeny. The ratio of female to male progeny in both instances was greater for B. tabaci. When cultured on tomato, cotton, and tobacco, B. tabaci developed 0.8, 3.3, and 4.7 d earlier in single culture, and 1.8, 3.9, and 4.3 d earlier in mixed culture. B. tabaci displaced T. vaporariorum in four, five and six generations when the initial ratios of B. tabaci to T vaporariorum were 15:15,20:10, or 10:20 on tomato. Populations of B. tabaci were 2.3 fold higher than that of T. vaporariorum on tomato plants for seven consecutive generations in single culture. B. tabaci performed better in development, survival, fecundity, and female ratio. We conclude that B. tabaci could displace T. vaporariorum in as short as four generations in a controlled greenhouse environment when they start at equal proportions. Warmer greenhouse conditions and an increase in total greenhouse area could be contributing factors in the recent dominance of B. tabaci.

TI  - CROSS-GENERATION EFFECTS FOR COLD RESISTANCE IN TROPICAL POPULATIONS OF DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER AND DROSOPHILA-SIMULANS
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Cross-generation effects on the cold resistance of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans were investigated by exposing adults to different levels of cold stress and testing the resistance of female F1s and F2s. Maternal and paternal treatments had different effects on progeny resistance. Maternal effects were not detected for either species when progeny were held at 25-degrees-C, but were detected when progeny were acclimated at 13-degrees-C prior to testing. When dams were exposed to a non-lethal cold stress following acclimation, the cold resistance of their progeny was increased, particularly in D. simulans. Grandmaternal exposure to 13-degrees-C and a non-lethal stress led to a small decrease in the cold resistance of D. melanogaster, and a small increase in the resistance of D. simulans. When sires of D. melanogaster and D. simulans were exposed to a cold stress, the resistance of their progeny decreased when progeny were tested without acclimation at 13-degrees-C, but decreased only in D. melanogaster when progeny were acclimated. Paternal effects were smaller than maternal effects and were not evident in the F2 generation.

AB  - Historical data show that recent climate change has caused advances in seasonal timing (phenology) in many animals and plants, particularly in temperate and higher latitude regions. The population and fitness consequences of these phenological shifts for insects and other ectotherms have been heterogeneous: warming can increase development rates and the number of generations per year (increasing fitness), but can also lead to seasonal mismatches between animals and their resources and increase exposure to environmental variability (decreasing fitness). Insect populations exhibit local adaptation in their developmental responses to temperature, including lower developmental thresholds and the thermal requirements to complete development, but climate change can potentially disrupt seasonal timing of juvenile and adult stages and alter population fitness. We investigate these issues using a global dataset describing how insect developmental responds to temperature via two traits: lower temperature thresholds for development (T-0) and the cumulative degree-days required to complete development (G). As suggested by previous analyses, T-0 decreases and G increases with increasing (absolute) latitude; however, these traits and the relationship between G and latitude varies significantly among taxonomic orders. The mean number of generations per year (a metric of fitness) increases with both decreasing T-0 and G, but the effects of these traits on fitness vary strongly with latitude, with stronger selection on both traits at higher (absolute) latitudes. We then use the traits to predict developmental timing and temperatures for multiple generations within seasons and across years (1970-2010). Seasonality drives developmental temperatures to peak mid-season and for generation lengths to decline across seasons, particularly in temperate regions. We predict that climate warming has advanced phenology and increased the number of generations, particularly at high latitudes. The magnitude of increases in developmental temperature varies little across latitude. Increases in the number of seasonal generations have been greatest for populations experiencing the greatest phenological advancements and warming. Shifts in developmental rate and timing due to climate change will have complex implications for selection and fitness in seasonal environments.

AB  - Embryos of annual killifish diapause in soil egg banks while ponds are dry. Their rates of development and survival in different developmental stages determine the numbers and stages of embryos at rewetting. In the Argentinean pearlfish Austrolebias bellottii, we investigated plasticity for desiccation in such embryonal life history components across phases of mild desiccation and rewetting and also effects of life history on hatching. In comparison with nonannuals, our data suggest that incidences of diapause have become relatively independent of the occurrence of desiccation, as if they have become genetically assimilated. We found limited survival effects of desiccation, limited developmental delays, and an acceleration of development into the prehatching stage. This response can be adaptive when desiccation informs that an opportunity to hatch approaches. Embryos arrest development in the prehatching stage (diapause DIII) or in the dispersed-cell phase (diapause DI). Parental pair variation in rates of development and survival in the earliest developmental stages affects the fraction of embryos that are in DI at rewetting and the number surviving. Given such effects on life history fitness components, rates during embryonal development seem "visible" to selection and the developmental system can thus adapt when pair variation contains a heritable component. In agreement with expectations for the presence of diversified bet-hedging, some embryos hatched and others not in over half of the clutches with several developed embryos at the moment of rewetting. Hatching probabilities increased for eggs produced later in the experiment, and they increased when embryos were rewetted a second time after two months. This response is opposite of what is expected when age-dependent hatching would be adapted to exploit opportunities for completing another generation before the dry season.

AB  - Diapause is an adaptation that insects have evolved to synchronize their life cycle with that of seasonal climatic changes and resources availability. However, cues for its induction are not always clear and, in some cases, a maternal effect may be involved. At the population level, just a part of the individuals may exhibit diapause with important consequences in terms of winter survival. Moreover, clear indicators of diapause state are difficult to identify. Diapause induction was thus investigated in the aphid parasitoid speciesAphidius erviHaliday (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) developing in the aphidSitobion avenae(Hemiptera: Aphididae) at four crossed photothermal regimes (16 degrees C and 8 degrees C, 16:8 h L:D and 8:16 h L:D), and during 2 successive generations. We analyzed the reliability of changes in mummy color to assess for the diapausing state compared to dissections, and we measured parasitoid morphological and physiological traits. We observed that the proportion of dark brown mummies increased after one generation under low photothermal regime compared to other regimes. No diapause was recorded at 16 degrees C, 16:8 h L:D, while we observed 16.2% and 67.5% diapause incidence at 8 degrees C, 8:16 h L:D, at 1st and 2nd generation, respectively. Diapause induction is thus increased by short day-length conditions and low temperatures as well as by maternal effects. All parasitoid life-history traits (weight, size, fat content, water content, egg-load, and longevity) were affected by the photothermal regime and/or the generation. These results raise new questions on the environmental thresholds needed to induce diapause and on survival and adaptation potential of commercially available parasitoid strains in different environments.

AB  - Most organisms have complex life cycles, and in marine taxa, larval life-history stages tend to be more sensitive to environmental stress than adult (reproductive) life-history stages. While there are several models of stage-specific adaptation across the life history, the extent to which differential sensitivity to environmental stress (defined here as reductions in absolute fitness across the life history) affects the tempo of adaptive evolution to change remains unclear. We used a heuristic model to explore how commonly observed features associated with marine complex life histories alter a population's capacity to cope with environmental change. We found that increasing the complexity of the life history generally reduces the evolutionary potential of taxa to cope with environmental change. Our model also predicted that genetic correlations in stress tolerance between stages, levels of genetic variance in each stage, and the relative plasticity of different stages, all interact to affect the maximum rate of environmental change that will permit species persistence. Our results suggest that marine organisms with complex life cycles are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic global change, but we lack empirical estimates of key parameters for most species.

AB  - So far only a few studies have been performed to assess the effects of dynamic pollutant exposure on life-history parameters of invertebrates. In a previous multi-generation approach with the midge Chironomus riparius we tested if a chronic tributyltin pre-exposure alters the ability of a population to cope with subsequent cadmium stress. In the experiment two separate chironomid populations were exposed via sediments to different TBT-concentrations (4.46 and 8.93 mu g Sn/kg dw) for several generations, followed by subsequent cadmium exposure (1.2 mg Cd/kg dw) for three generations. While the TBT-exposure to 4.46 mu g Sn/kg dw had only small effects on the development and reproduction of C. riparius the higher TBT-concentration of 8.93 mu g Sn/kg dw led to negative effects on life-history traits. Therefore, a higher adverse effect of the higher TBT-concentration and thus a higher susceptibility to other stressors could be assumed. Within, this paper only the results of the second stressor experiment were presented; clear effects of Cd on development and reproduction of C. riparius were determined independent of the pre-exposure scenario. While no differences in Cd-sensitivity were found between the population without pre-exposure to TBT and the population pre-exposed to the low TBT-concentration (4.46 mu g Sn/kg dw), the pre-exposure of midges to the higher TBT-concentration (8.93 mu g Sn/kg dw) resulted in a significantly higher susceptibility to subsequent Cd-stress. These results document that the exposure history may influence the reaction to altered chemical stress. Our findings are relevant to understand and predict the evolutionary fate of populations in rapidly changing, human-impacted environments. However, the fact that chemical-induced reduced genetic diversity, which is not necessarily linked to genetic adaptation, leads to a reduced fitness under altered stress conditions, is to our knowledge a novel finding.

AB  - Following an environmental change, the course of a population's adaptive evolution may be influenced by environmental factors, such as the degree of marginality of the new environment relative to the organism's potential range, and by genetic factors, including constraints that may have arisen during its past history. Experimental populations of bacteria were used to address these issues in the context of evolutionary adaptation to the thermal environment. Six replicate lines of Escherichia coli (20 degrees C group), founded from a common ancestor, were propagated for 2000 generations at 20 degrees C, a novel temperature that is very near the lower thermal limit at which it can maintain a stable population size in a daily serial transfer (100-fold dilution) regime. Four additional groups (32/20, 37/20, 42/20, and 32-42/20 degrees C groups) of six lines, each with 2000 generation selection histories at different temperatures (32, 37, 42, and daily alternation of 32 and 42 degrees C), were moved to the same 20 degrees C environment and propagated in parallel to ascertain whether selection histories influence the adaptive response in this novel environment. Adaptation was measured by improvement in fitness relative to the common ancestor in direct competition experiments conducted at 20 degrees C. All five groups showed improvement in relative fitness in this environment; the mean fitness of the 20 degrees C group after 2000 generations increased by about 8%. Selection history had no discernible effect on the rate or final magnitude of the fitness responses of the four groups with different histories after 2000 generations. The correlated fitness responses of the 20 degrees C group were measured across the entire thermal niche. There were significant tradeoffs in fitness at higher temperatures; for example, at 40 degrees C the average fitness of the 20 degrees C group was reduced by almost 20% relative to the common ancestor. We also observed a downward shift of 1-2 degrees C in both the upper and lower thermal niche limits for the 20 degrees C selected group. These observations are contrasted with previous observations of a markedly greater rate of adaptation to growth near the upper thermal limit (42 degrees C) and a lack of trade-off in fitness at lower temperatures for lines adapted to that high temperature. The evolutionary implications of this asymmetry are discussed.

AB  - Adaptive plasticity may shift phenotypic traits close to a new optimum for directional selection and probably facilitates adaptive evolution in new environments. However, such plasticity has rarely been reported in life-history evolution, despite overwhelming evidence of life-history variation both among and within species. In this study, the temperatures experienced by gravid females of Scincella modesta were manipulated to identify maternally induced plasticity in reproductive traits and the significance of such changes in the evolution of life history. Consistent with the geographic pattern of life history, the study demonstrated that low temperatures delayed egg oviposition, resulting in a more advanced embryonic developmental stage at oviposition and shorter incubation periods compared with warm temperatures. In addition, females maintained at low temperatures produced larger eggs and hence heavier hatchlings than those at warm temperatures. This study demonstrated that environmental temperatures can induce plastic responses in egg retention and offspring size, and these maternally mediated changes in reproductive life history seem to be adaptive in the light of latitudinal clines of these traits in natural populations.

AB  - Egg to eclosion development time and survivorship were assayed on four laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster that had been reared for over 600 generations in continuous light (LL) and constant temperature. The assays were performed in three environments: continuous light (LL), periodically varying light/dark cycles (LD 12:12 hr), and continuous darkness (DD). Development: time in LL was significantly less than that in LD, which, in turn, was significantly less than that in DD, whereas survivorship did not differ significantly among the three treatments. The results indicate that individuals from Drosophila populations routinely maintained in LL do not suffer any deleterious effects of LL treatment on pre-adult fitness. Other studies on these populations have shown that free-running period (tau) of the eclosion rhythm in DD is greater than that in LD. Our results are, thus, also consistent with the notion that development time may be a function of the free running period.

AB  - Much attention has been focused on insects' ability to survive long-term high-temperature stress and on their resulting population distributions under global warming. In this study, life tables of the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) biotype B, were collected over five consecutive generations at 27, 31, and 35 degrees C and for one generation at 37 degrees C. At 37 degrees C, the intrinsic rate of increase (r) and the net reproductive rate (R-0) of the whitefly were 0.0383 d(-1) and 2.8 offspring, respectively. These results demonstrate that the lethal high temperature for B. tabaci is >37 degrees C. At 27 degrees C, neither R-0 nor r decreased over the generations studied. However, both of these values decreased over time at 31 and 35 degrees C, and the decrease was more evident at 35 degrees C. Our results on the ability of B. tabaci biotype B to survive long-term high-temperature stress are important for understanding its population distribution under global warming.

AB  - Climate-driven warming is altering marine ecosystems at an unprecedented rate and evolutionary adaptation may represent the last resort for many ectothermic organisms to avoid local extinction. The first step to elucidate the potential for adaptation to unfavorable thermal conditions is to assess the degree of genotype-based variation in thermal reaction norms of vital fitness traits. Marine broadcast spawning fishes experience extremely high rates of mortality during early life stages. Paternally derived (genetic) variation underlying offspring fitness in adverse environmental conditions may therefore hold important implications for resilience. This study examined how males differ in their ability to sire viable offspring and whether the paternal contribution modified thermal reaction norms for hatching success in two replicated trials with cod Gadus morhua from the Northwest Atlantic (trial 1) and Baltic Sea (trial 2). Each trial included five temperature treatments (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 degrees C in trial 1, and 6.5, 8.0, 9.5, 11.0, 12.5 degrees C in trial 2) encompassing optimum conditions as well as the amount of warming projected in various future pathways for the year 2100. In both trials, mean hatching success significantly decreased towards thermal extremes. However, half-sibling families varied in their response to different incubation temperatures as indicated by significant paternity x temperature interactions and crossing of reaction norms. The influence of paternity itself was highly significant and explained 56% and 44% of the observed variation in hatching success in trials 1 and 2, respectively. Early embryogenesis represented the most crucial developmental period in terms of thermal tolerance and paternally mediated variation in hatching success. High variation in daily embryo survival among half-sibling families and temperature treatments was observed during blastula and gastrulation stages (until 100% epiboly), while almost no mortality occurred during subsequent development and throughout the hatching period. The observed magnitude of genetic variation underlying thermal reaction norms for embryo viability represents a relevant resource for adaptive responses (favorable selection) of cod populations exposed to environmental variability and/or directional changes, such as ongoing ocean warming.

AB  - Populations of Dialeurodes citri (Ashmead) on oranges were studied in two orange orchards in southern California, USA, to quantify developmental times and mortalities affecting this species. Four populations were followed in detail for three generations over 2 years, by monitoring the development and survival of 200 individuals in each population. Overall, preimaginal mortality among the generation studied varied from 56 to 94%. No evidence of disease or parasitism was present in the populations, and mortality was likely due to generalist predators. Weather records for the period were typical for the region, and periods of rainfall or elevated temperatures did not show any correlation with periods of mortality in the populations. Overall, the populations have high survival rates for whitefly populations, and this high survival is likely a major contributing factor to their pest status in California orchards. Addition of natural enemies to reduce the survival rates of these populations is proposed as the next course of action in suppressing populations below damaging levels.

AB  - There is increasing interest in comparing species of related organisms for their susceptibility to thermal extremes in order to evaluate potential vulnerability to climate change. Comparisons are typically undertaken on individuals collected from the field with or without a period of acclimation. However, this approach does not allow the potential contributions of environmental and carry-over effects across generations to be separated from inherent species differences in susceptibility. To assess the importance of these different sources of variation, we here considered heat and cold resistance in Drosophilid species from tropical and temperate sites in the field and across two laboratory generations. Resistance in field-collected individuals tended to be lower when compared with F1 and F2 laboratory generations, and species differences in field flies were only weakly correlated to differences established under controlled rearing conditions, unlike in F1-F2 comparisons. This reflected large environmental effects on resistance associated with different sites and conditions experienced within sites. For the 8 h cold recovery assay there was no strong evidence of carry-over effects, whereas for the heat knockdown and 2 h cold recovery assays there was some evidence for such effects. However, for heat these were species specific in direction. Variance components for inherent species differences were substantial for resistance to heat and 8 h cold stress, but small for 2 h cold stress, though this may be a reflection of the species being considered in the comparisons. These findings highlight that inherent differences among species are difficult to characterise accurately without controlling for environmental sources of variation and carry-over effects. Moreover, they also emphasise the complex nature of carry-over effects that vary depending on the nature of stress traits and the species being evaluated.

AB  - The way populations respond to selection can be altered when populations are acclimated prior to selection. To examine this possibility, the responses of replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans to selection for increased resistance to cold were compared. Flies were selected without hardening or after they had been hardened by holding them at 4 degrees C for one hour. The selection response in both species was much greater when Hies were not cold-hardened. Cold resistance in both sers of selected lines reached a plateau after a few generations. Surprisingly, continued selection for increased resistance resulted in decreasing levels of resistance. This decrease was no longer evident after selection had been relaxed for a generation, suggesting cross-generation effects. The magnitude of the cross-generation effects increased with additional generations of selection. Cross-generation effects were also detected for fitness components. Relaxing selection for a generation increased fecundity, weight, viability, and development time. Comparisons of relaxed lines and control lines indicated that only fecundity was influenced by selection. Both sets of selected lines had a lower fecundity than control lines. Crosses between control and selected lines and among replicate selected lines indicated that this decrease in fecundity was not associated with inbreeding. The direct and correlated responses to selection for cold resistance can therefore be influenced by acclimation and cross-generation effects.

AB  - Temperature-driven development and survival rates of the mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) were examined at nine constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 27, 30, 32, 35 and 40 degrees C) on hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L.). Crawlers successfully completed development to adult stage between 15 and 35 degrees C, although their survival was affected at low temperatures. Two linear and four nonlinear models were fitted to describe developmental rates of P. solenopsis as a function of temperature, and for estimating thermal constants and bioclimatic thresholds (lower, optimum and upper temperature thresholds for development: T-min, T-opt and T-max, respectively). Estimated thresholds between the two linear models were statistically similar. Ikemoto and Takai's linear model permitted testing the equivalence of lower developmental thresholds for life stages of P. solenopsis reared on two hosts, hibiscus and cotton. Thermal constants required for completion of cumulative development of female and male nymphs and for the whole generation were significantly lower on hibiscus (222.2, 237.0, 308.6 degree-days, respectively) compared to cotton. Three nonlinear models performed better in describing the developmental rate for immature instars and cumulative life stages of female and male and for generation based on goodness-of-fit criteria. The simplified beta type distribution function estimated T-opt values closer to the observed maximum rates. Thermodynamic SSI model indicated no significant differences in the intrinsic optimum temperature estimates for different geographical populations of P. solenopsis. The estimated bioclimatic thresholds and the observed survival rates of P. solenopsis indicate the species to be high-temperature adaptive, and explained the field abundance of P. solenopsis on its host plants.

AB  - 1. Offspring size is a key life-history trait that often covaries negatively with temperature. Most studies focus on how temperature alters selection on offspring size during early life-history stages such as embryos or larvae. The degree to which temperature alters the relationship between offspring size and post-metamorphic performance remains unclear as field studies across multiple temperature regimes are rare.
   2. I deployed over 6,000 individuals of known offspring size, into the field across 28 cohorts spanning 4 years for the model marine invertebrate, Bugula neritina and monitored their survival, growth and reproduction.
   3. Offspring size closely tracked the local environmental temperature across cohorts. This offspring size-temperature covariance appeared to be adaptive, at least from the perspective of mothers. When temperatures were warmer, the relationship between offspring size and performance was weak; when temperatures were cooler, the relationship was strongly positive.
   4. The estimates of selection based on maternal fitness differed from those based on offspring fitness, suggesting temperature-mediated parent-offspring conflict over offspring provisioning exists. I also found evidence for temporal autocorrelation in temperature and selection on offspring size.
   5. The fact that temperature affects the relationship between offspring size and post-metamorphic performance further complicates the challenge in understanding the ubiquitous covariance between offspring size and temperature.

AB  - The efficacy of one new modified and two old meridic diets on Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) for rearing six successive generations was studied. Duration of larval development for insects fed on the modified diet was considerably shortened as most of them went through only five stadia before pupation, while the per cent pupation and per cent eclosion were relatively higher than on other diets. The lowest pupal mortality (6.33 +/- 0.13%) was recorded in the F-1 generation reared on the modified diet, whereas the highest pupal mortality (19.49 +/- 0.15%) was observed in insects reared on a natural diet in the F-6 generation. Blending of chickpea Cicer arietinum L. and red kidney bean Phaseolus vulgaris L. flours with tomato paste proved highly favorable for adult reproduction. These results suggest that the vitality of the tomato fruitworm did not decline obviously after rearing on a modified diet for several generations.

AB  - Background: Drought may become one of the greatest challenges for cereal production under future warming scenarios, and its impact on insect pest outbreaks is still controversial. To address this issue, life-history responses of the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), from three areas of different drought levels were compared under three water treatments.
   Results: Significant differences were identified in developmental time, fecundity and adult weight among S. avenae clones from moist, semiarid and arid areas under all the three water treatments. Semiarid and arid area clones tended to have higher heritability for test life-history traits than moist area clones. We identified significant selection of water-deficit on the developmental time of 1st instar nymphs and adult weight for both semiarid and arid area clones. The impact of intermediate and severe water-stress on S. avenae's fitness was neutral and negative (e.g., decreased fecundity and weight), respectively. Compared with arid-area clones, moist- and semiarid-area clones showed higher extents of adaptation to the water-deficit level of their respective source environment. Adult weight was identified as a good indicator for S. avenae's adaptation potential under different water-stress conditions. After their exposure to intermediate water-deficit stress for only five generations, adult weight and fecundity tended to decrease for moist- and semiarid-area clones, but increase for arid-area clones.
   Conclusions: It is evident from our study that S. avenae clones from moist, semiarid and arid areas have diverged under different water-deficit stress, and such divergence could have a genetic basis. The impact of drought on S. avenae's fitness showed a water-level dependent pattern. Clones of S. avenae were more likely to become adapted to intermediate water-deficit stress than severe water-deficit stress. After continuous water-deficit stress of only five generations, the adaptation potential of S. avenae tended to decrease for moist and semiarid area clones, but increase for arid area clones. The rapid shift of aphids' life-history traits and adaptation potential under drought could have significant implications for their evolutionary dynamics and outbreak risks in future climate change scenarios.

AB  - The present study attempts to elucidate possible microevolutionary adaptations of life-history traits of high-latitude populations of the holarctic, littoral oribatid mite Ameronothrus lineatus by comparing arctic and temperate populations. Additionally, the paper provides an overview of the limited research on general ecology and population biology of arctic populations. In the Arctic the larviparous A. lineatus has a 5-year life cycle (larva-to-larva), and adults survive a further 2-3 years. High survival to maturity is consistent with a low lifetime reproductive output of ca. 20 larvae. The life history can be regarded as an extreme version of the typical oribatid life history. However, several life-history features suggest specific adaptations of arctic populations. In particular, the pre-moult resting stage is synchronized with the warmest part of the arctic summer, which shortens this vulnerable part of development. High reproductive investment by females at relatively low temperatures may represent a physiological adaptation to the cool arctic summer. Finally, prolonged cold exposure positively affects reproduction and survival the following summer, suggesting adaptation of the species to the highly seasonal arctic environment. On the other hand, the ability of all life-cycle stages to overwinter, and a flexible life history with the species being able to take advantage of favourable climatic conditions to accelerate development and larviposition, seem to be ancestral features. Thus, the success of A. lineatus in arctic habitats is probably attributable to a combination of derived and ancestral life-history traits. Studies of conspecific temperate populations are required to elucidate further local adaptations of arctic populations.

AB  - Temperature affects multiple aspects of an organism''s biology and thus defines a major axis of the fundamental niche. For ectotherms, variation in the thermal environment is particularly important because most of these taxa have a limited capacity to thermoregulate via metabolic heat production. While temperature affects all life-history stages, stages can differ in their ability to respond to the thermal environment. For example, in oviparous organisms, free-living adults can behaviorally thermoregulate, whereas developing embryos are at the mercy of the nest environment. These differences in the realized thermal environment should select for life-history stages to have different thermal tolerances, although this has been rarely examined. I tested the hypothesis that stage-specific thermal reaction norms can evolve independently by using southern alligator lizards (Elgaria multicarinata, Anguidae). Using incubation experiments (five temperatures: 24 degrees degrees, 26 degrees degrees, 28 degrees degrees, 30 degrees degrees, and 32 degrees degrees C), I described the thermal reaction norm for embryonic development and compared these results to previous studies on the thermal ecology of adults. Offspring survivorship and morphology were similarly affected by incubation temperature. While developing embryos had the same optimum temperature as adults (approximately 28 degrees degrees C), the breadth of their thermal reaction norms differed. My results suggest that developing embryos of E. multicarinata are more sensitive to variation in the average thermal environment than are adults. Variation in the thermal sensitivity of life-history stages might be common and has implications for how organisms respond to variation in the thermal environment. Identifying those life-history stages that are most sensitive/limiting will be important for developing models that best predict species'' responses to impending environmental change.

AB  - The spatial scale of life-history and demographic variation was investigated in the opportunistic polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica La Greca and Bacci. Individuals were collected along the Italian coasts from three thermally different biogeographical regions of the Mediterranean Sea. For each region, populations from four harbours were considered, and for each harbour, two sites were examined. Life-history and demographic traits were investigated after one generation under a common garden experiment, and their variation at the three spatial scales was assessed. All the traits showed high variability with regard to site. A number of life-history and all demographic traits also varied according to the biogeographical region. Conversely, no differences were found between harbours, suggesting that geographical isolation did not contribute to phenotypic variation. Results confirmed the central role of local conditions for the evolution of life history in species colonizing heterogeneous environments, but they also pointed to the importance of large-scale factors in shaping the phenotypic responses of O. labronica, demonstrating the need for a multi-scale approach for obtaining a good measure of natural variation in widespread opportunistic species.

AB  - 1. When the breeding environment fluctuates across generations, reproductive traits may evolve plasticity that optimises the balance between survival and mating success for the prevailing environment. 2. For sexually selected colouration, this balance can depend on environmental temperatures. Accordingly, breeding colouration often co-varies with temperature through space and time. However, whether such traits exhibit plasticity in response to environmental temperatures is poorly understood. 3. In the present study, a dragonfly (Pachydiplax longipennis) was reared under ambient or experimentally warmed conditions and tested for plasticity in its intrasexually selected wing colouration. Although wing colouration improves male territorial success, these advantages are smaller under warmer conditions than cooler conditions. It was therefore predicted that males reared under the ambient thermal conditions of the study site (Cleveland, Ohio) would develop more wing colouration than those reared under experimentally warmed conditions. 4. Contrary to this prediction, males reared in warm larval temperatures produced more wing colouration. Thus, although the secondary sexual colouration of this species displays some thermal plasticity, it does not appear to be adaptive relative to the known thermal variation of intrasexual selection in this population. 5. Given that the environment often determines the strength and direction of sexual selection, future studies should consider the potential for non-adaptive, and even maladaptive, developmental plasticity in the sexually selected traits of insects.

AB  - Boreal coniferous species with wide geographic distributions show substantial variation in autumn cold acclimation among populations. To determine how this variation is inherited across generations, we conducted a progeny test and examined the development of cold hardening in open-pollinated second-generation (F-2) progeny of Abies sachalinensis. The F1 parents had different genetic backgrounds resulting from reciprocal interpopulational crosses between low elevation (L) and high elevation (H) populations: L x L, L x H, H x L, and H x H. Paternity analysis of the F-2 progeny using molecular genetic markers showed that 91.3% of the fathers were located in surrounding stands of the F-1 planting site (i.e., not in the F1 test population). The remaining fathers were assigned to F-1 parents of the L x L cross-type. This indicates that the high-elevation genome in the F-1 parents was not inherited by the F-2 population via pollen flow. The timing of autumn cold acclimation in the F-2 progeny depended on the cross type of the F1 mother. The progeny of H x H mothers showed less damage in freezing tests than the progeny of other cross-types. Statistical modeling supported a linear effect of genome origin. In the best model, variation in freezing damage was explained by the proportion of maternally inherited high-elevation genome. These results suggest that autumn cold acclimation was partly explained by the additive effect of the responsible maternal genome. Thus, the offspring that inherited a greater proportion of the high-elevation genome developed cold hardiness earlier. Genome-based variation in the regulation of autumn cold acclimation matched the local climatic conditions, which may be a key factor in elevation dependent adaptation.

AB  - We use a state dependent life history model to predict the life history strategies of female steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in altered environments. As a case study of a broadly applicable approach, we applied this model to the American and Mokelumne Rivers in central California, where steelhead are listed as threatened. Both rivers have been drastically altered, with highly regulated flows and translocations that may have diluted local adaptation. Nevertheless, evolutionary optimization models could successfully predict the life history displayed by fish on the American River (all anadromous, with young smolts) and on the Mokelumne River (a mix of anadromy and residency). The similar fitness of the two strategies for the Mokelumne suggested that a mixed strategy could be favored in a variable environment. We advance the management utility of this framework by explicitly modeling growth as a function of environmental conditions and using sensitivity analyses to predict likely evolutionary endpoints under changed environments. We conclude that the greatest management concern with respect to preserving anadromy is reduced survival of emigrating smolts, although large changes in freshwater survival or growth rates are potentially also important. We also demonstrate the importance of considering asymptotic size along with maximum growth rate.

AB  - Arthropod biological control agents are at risk due to climate change, since heat stress negatively impacts their life history traits. Here, we investigated ontogenetic variation of thermal sensitivity in an important whitefly predator, Serangium japonicum Chapin (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). In particular, we evaluated the impact of heat shock on survival rate, development, and reproduction of S. japonicum, and checked whether the negative effects resulting from heat stress are stage-related. The two most heat-tolerant stages of S. japonicum (egg and adult) were exposed to heat shock treatments at 36, 39, and 42 degrees C for 2 h, and 36 and 39 degrees C for 4 h. We found that heat shock significantly reduced egg-to-adult survival rate, extended egg-to-adult development time, and decreased fecundity and oviposition period compared to control (27 degrees C). The sex ratio however was not affected. Eggs exposed to heat shock led to adults whose weight and longevity were considerably reduced. The detrimental effects that resulted from heat shock were carried over to later life stages and even the next generation. Those carry-over effects were independent of stage except for egg-to-adult development time and adult weight. Our results suggest that releasing eggs or adults into fields or greenhouses makes little difference in reducing any negative impact on the developmental performance of S. japonicum induced by heat stress in a warming climate.

AB  - Through functional analyses, integrative physiology is able to link molecular biology with ecology as well as evolutionary biology and is thereby expected to provide access to the evolution of molecular, cellular, and organismic functions; the genetic basis of adaptability; and the shaping of ecological patterns. This paper compiles several exemplary studies of thermal physiology and ecology, carried out at various levels of biological organization from single genes ( proteins) to ecosystems. In each of those examples, trade-offs and constraints in thermal adaptation are addressed; these trade-offs and constraints may limit species' distribution and define their level of fitness. For a more comprehensive understanding, the paper sets out to elaborate the functional and conceptual connections among these independent studies and the various organizational levels addressed. This effort illustrates the need for an overarching concept of thermal adaptation that encompasses molecular, organellar, cellular, and whole-organism information as well as the mechanistic links between fitness, ecological success, and organismal physiology. For this data, the hypothesis of oxygen-and capacity-limited thermal tolerance in animals provides such a conceptual framework and allows interpreting the mechanisms of thermal limitation of animals as relevant at the ecological level. While, ideally, evolutionary studies over multiple generations, illustrated by an example study in bacteria, are necessary to test the validity of such complex concepts and underlying hypotheses, animal physiology frequently is constrained to functional studies within one generation. Comparisons of populations in a latitudinal cline, closely related species from different climates, and ontogenetic stages from riverine clines illustrate how evolutionary information can still be gained. An understanding of temperature-dependent shifts in energy turnover, associated with adjustments in aerobic scope and performance, will result. This understanding builds on a mechanistic analysis of the width and location of thermal windows on the temperature scale and also on study of the functional properties of relevant proteins and associated gene expression mechanisms.

AB  - Lucilia sericata has a facultative diapause in the third larval instar after cessation of feeding. Induction of the diapause is influenced by the photoperiod and temperature conditions experienced by insects in the parental generation as well as those experienced by the larvae themselves. The sensitive stage of the parental generation for induction of diapause was examined using diapause-averting conditions of 16 h light : 8 h darkness (LD 16:8) at 25degreesC and diapause-inducing conditions of LD 12:12 at 20degreesC. The incidence of diapause in the progeny was predominantly determined by the conditions experienced by the parents in the adult stage. Moreover, the results of reciprocal crosses showed that only the mother's experience is involved in the induction of diapause in the progeny.

AB  - Alleles conferring a higher adaptive value in one environment may have a detrimental impact on fitness in another environment. Alleles conferring resistance to pesticides and drugs provide textbook examples of this trade-off as, in addition to conferring resistance to these molecules, they frequently decrease fitness in pesticide/drug-free environments. We show here that resistance to chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate (OP), in Chinese populations of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, is conferred by two mutations of ace1 - the gene encoding the acetylcholinesterase enzyme targeted by OPs - affecting the amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein. These mutations were always linked, consistent with the segregation of a single resistance allele, ace1R, carrying both mutations, in the populations studied. We monitored the frequency of ace1R (by genotyping more than 20000 adults) and the level of resistance (through bioassays on more than 50000 individuals) over several generations. We found that the ace1R resistance allele was costly in the absence of insecticide and that this cost was likely recessive. This fitness costs involved a decrease in fecundity: females from resistant strains laid 20% fewer eggs, on average, than females from susceptible strains. Finally, we found that the fitness costs associated with the ace1R allele were greater at high temperatures. At least two life history traits were involved: longevity and fecundity. The relative longevity of resistant individuals was affected only at high temperatures and the relative fecundity of resistant females - which was already affected at temperatures optimal for development - decreased further at high temperatures. The implications of these findings for resistance management are discussed.

AB  - Functional plant traits are likely to adapt under the sustained pressure imposed by environmental changes through natural selection. Employing Brassica napus as a model, a multi-generational study was performed to investigate the potential trajectories of selection at elevated [CO2] in two different temperature regimes. To reveal phenotypic divergence at the manipulated [CO2] and temperature conditions, a full-factorial natural selection regime was established in a phytotron environment over the range of four generations. It is demonstrated that a directional response to selection at elevated [CO2] led to higher quantities of reproductive output over the range of investigated generations independent of the applied temperature regime. The increase in seed yield caused an increase in aboveground biomass. This suggests quantitative changes in the functions of carbon sequestration of plants subjected to increased levels of CO2 over the generational range investigated. The results of this study suggest that phenotypic divergence of plants selected under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration may drive the future functions of plant productivity to be different from projections that do not incorporate selection responses of plants. This study accentuates the importance of phenotypic responses across multiple generations in relation to our understanding of biogeochemical dynamics of future ecosystems. Furthermore, the positive selection response of reproductive output under increased [CO2] may ameliorate depressions in plant reproductive fitness caused by higher temperatures in situations where both factors co-occur.

AB  - Insects are ectothermic organisms; hence, all aspects of their biology are strongly influenced by ambient temperatures. Different insect species respond differently with phenotypic plasticity and/or genetic adaptation to changing temperatures. Here, we tested the thermal adaptation of the house fly and three of its parasitoids species by comparing life-history parameters in populations from a hot climate region (Jordan Valley) and from a moderate-climate region (Galilee). No significant differences were found between the two house fly populations, both under hot and moderate experimental conditions. Life-history parameters of the parasitoids (Muscidifurax raptor Girault & Sanders, Spalangia endius Walker, and Spalangia cameroni Perkins [Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae]) varied markedly between origins, species, sexes, and experimental conditions. Of the three species tested, only M. raptor collected in the Jordan Valley proved better adapted to experimental heat conditions, compared to its counterpart population that was collected in the Galilee. Additionally, we tested the effect of elevating temperatures on a house fly lab population for 17 consecutive generations and found no evidence for heat adaptation. We discuss our results in the context of house fly control and global warming.

AB  - California pistachios are threatened by several stink bug species (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), including the native Thyanta pallidovirens (Stal) and Chlorochroa uhleri (Stal), as well as the invasive Nezara viridula (L.). In pistachio, control tactics often target specific life stages, which makes knowledge about life histories fundamental to successful IPM programs. For that purpose, life history parameters of these stink bug species were assessed. Nymphal development and survivorship at seven constant temperatures, upper and lower development thresholds, thermal constants, adult longevity and fecundity, and life table parameters were evaluated. No species completed development at 15 degrees C or 35 degrees C. For N. viridula, egg to adult development was fastest at 30 degrees C, whereas for T. pallidovirens there was no significant difference between 27.5 and 30 degrees C and C. uhleri development was similar between 25 and 30 degrees C. Egg to adult survival was highest at 22.5 degrees C and 27.5 degrees C. The thermal requirements as degree-days (DD) to complete immature development were estimated to be 714.3, 370.4, and 434.8 for C. uhleri, T. pallidovirens, and N. viridula, respectively. For C. uhleri, life table calculations produced a value of 56.7 d for mean generation time (T-o), 24.89 for net reproductive rate (R-o) and 0.057 for the intrinsic rate of increase (r). Thyanta pallidovirens had a T-o of 39.9 d, a R-o of 81.10 and a r of 0.11. The results are discussed with respect to the improvement of IPM in California pistachios, and the information presented may contribute to the control of these pest species in other ecosystems.

AB  - Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) is a physiological mechanism where environmental experiences of parents affect phenotypes of the offspring, and potentially facilitates organisms' survival in stressful environments. The Angouimois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier), is a dominant primary grain pest in Africa, particularly affecting sorghum and maize staples. Despite its widely known economic significance, little is known on its thermal responses, particularly how acclimation in one generation impacts fitness in successive generations. We tested how heat (acute and dynamic) as well as fasting acclimation in one generation affects physiological tolerance (i.e., critical thermal maxima [CTmax] and heat knock down time [HKDT]) using laboratory-reared S. cerealella populations. Specifically, we assessed whether pre-exposure to heat or fasting stress confers fitness costs or benefits in subsequent generations (i.e., through TGP). Results showed acclimation had significant effects in interaction with temperature ramping rates on CTmax. Moderate acute heat (34 C) and dynamic temperature (28-38 C) acclimations reduced F1 CTmax and HKDT, particularly at low ramping rates (for CTmax). We did not find fasting acclimation to significantly affect CTmax, indicating a lack of evidence for cross tolerance and/or susceptibility. For HKDT, all acclimation treatments (including fasting) showed significantly lower HKDT compared to controls, and mostly so, for the 38 C and dynamic acclimation (28-38 C) treatments, indicating a transgenerational fitness cost of acclimation. This is the first report of the costs of transgenerational plasticity in a stored product pest of economic significance and has implications in designing heat-based phytosanitary grain treatments.

AB  - The biological control of insect pests using parasitoids may have limited success without an understanding of the effect of temperature on natural enemies. The objective was to determine the parasitism, egg viability and sex ratio of Thichogramma exiguum and Trichogramma acacioi (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) to control Heliothis virescens (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) eggs after two generations on eggs of Anagasta kuehniella at 18, 20, 25, 30 and 33 degrees C. The increase in temperature favored the parasitism of T exiguum. The egg viability of T exiguum ranged between 70.1 and 97.1% and from 81.5 to 98.4% for T acacioi in H. virescens eggs. The sex ratio of T acacioi was constant at all temperatures studied, with only females in the progeny. Trichogramma exiguum reared in H. virescens eggs met the standards of quality control for mass production. Trichogramma exiguum showed higher parasitism than T. acacioi at high temperatures. However, both species had low parasitism on H. virescens eggs.

AB  - Sex determination in Nile tilapia is very labile. It was shown that the sex ratio in temperature treated groups (36 degrees C.10 days) of Oreochromis niloticus can be selected for as a quantitative trait. The standardized test procedure involved the artificial reproduction of breeders with nine days of egg incubation at 28 degrees C and subsequent testing of fry at an elevated temperature of 36 degrees C for 10 days. Family selection was carried out upon the male percentages in treatment groups (high-line>80%, low-line<60%). Selected candidates were taken from corresponding full sib control groups, which were kept at 28 degrees C. After two generations of divergent selection for the male proportion in temperature treated groups, male percentages of 90% and 54% were obtained in the high- and low-line, respectively.
   Herein, the data for a third generation of selection are presented. Twelve families in the high-line and 20 in the low-line were tested. Average male percentages in the treatment groups of 92.7% and 50.4% were obtained. After three generations of selection the cumulated realized heritabilities for the temperature dependent sex ratio were 0.63 in the high- and 0.84 in the low-line, still indicating good potential for selection. Two families in the high-line exhibited only males, whereas in the low-line two families showed a feminising effect in the treatment groups. Generally elevated temperatures (>34 degrees C) are considered to be masculinising in Nile tilapia, feminising effects so far have only been reported in genetic all-male progenies (YY, XY). In the third generation of selection, it could be shown that elevated temperatures might take over a feminising role through selection in genetically mixed sex (XX/XY) progenies. Consequently both, temperature-masculinising and -feminising genes, exist in the same population and can be accumulated through selection. However, the load of temperature-masculinising genes of dams from the high- or low-line had no effect on mean sex ratios in temperature treated groups when a YY-male was used as a sire. From an evolutionary point of view, the prevalence of both temperature-masculinising and -feminising effects might allow the sex ratio to equilibrate at the population level if random mating occurs. This in turn might counteract the evolution of sex chromosomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The life history characteristics of rotifers usually vary at different temperatures, depending on their species or strains. However, differences in the adaptability of rotifers sampled from two climatic zones and belonging to the same cryptic species in response to temperature changes remain undescribed. In this study, the phylogenetic relationships of Brachionus calyciflorus collecting from two climatic zones were reconstructed, and two clones of the same potential cryptic species were selected as representatives of two populations. The life history charatteristics of the two B. calyciflorus strains were comparatively studied at four different temperatures (20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C). The results showed that the responses of the life history traits of B. calyciflorus to temperature were strain-dependent. The Xishuangbanna strain is more suitable for growth at the higher temperature and that the Kunming strain grows preferentially at the lower temperature. Temperature significantly affected the durations of all developmental stages, offspring production, life expectancy at hatching, age-specific fecundity and survivorship of the two strains, which adopted the identical life history strategy (high population growth and low survivorship with increasing temperature). The discrimination of cryptic species is necessary to test the ecological or evolutionary characteristics of species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Epigenetic inheritance is a potential mechanism by which the environment in one generation can influence the performance of future generations(1). Rapid climate change threatens the survival of many organisms; however, recent studies show that some species can adjust to climate-related stress when both parents and their offspring experience the same environmental change(2,3). Whether such transgenerational acclimation could have an epigenetic basis is unknown. Here, by sequencing the liver genome, methylomes and transcriptomes of the coral reef fish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, exposed to current day (+0 degrees C) or future ocean temperatures (+3 degrees C) for one generation, two generations and incrementally across generations, we identified 2,467 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and 1,870 associated genes that respond to higher temperatures within and between generations. Of these genes, 193 were significantly correlated to the transgenerationally acclimating phenotypic trait, aerobic scope, with functions in insulin response, energy homeostasis, mitochondrial activity, oxygen consumption and angiogenesis. These genes may therefore play a key role in restoring performance across generations in fish exposed to increased temperatures associated with climate change. Our study is the first to demonstrate a possible association between DNA methylation and transgenerational acclimation to climate change in a vertebrate.

AB  - Fine-scale adaptive evolution is always constrained by strong gene flow at vertical level in marine organisms. Rapid environmental fluctuations and phenotypic plasticity through optimization of fitness-related traits in organisms play important roles in shaping intraspecific divergence. The coastal systems experience strong variations in multiple abiotic environmental factors, especially the temperature. We used a typical intertidal species, Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), to investigate the interaction between plasticity and adaptive evolution. We collected intertidal and subtidal oysters from two ecological niches and carried out common garden experiments for one generation. We identified fine-scale vertical adaptive divergence between intertidal and subtidal F-1 progeny at both sites, based on different hierarchical phenotypes, including morphological, physiological, and molecular traits. We further quantified the global plasticity to thermal stress through transcriptomic analysis. The intertidal oysters exhibited slow growth rate. However, they showed high survival and metabolic rates under heat stress, indicating vertically fine-scale phenotypic adaptive mechanisms and evolutionary trade-offs between growth and thermal tolerance. Transcriptomic analysis confirmed that the intertidal oysters have evolved high plasticity. The genes were classified into three types: evolutionarily divergent, concordantly plastic, and adaptive plastic genes. The evolved divergence between intertidal and subtidal oysters for these gene sets showed a significant positive correlation with plastic changes of subtidal populations in response to high temperature. Furthermore, the intertidal oysters exhibited delayed large-scale increase in expressional plasticity than that in subtidal counterparts. The same direction between plasticity and selection suggests that the oysters have evolved adaptive plasticity. This implies that adaptive plasticity facilitates the oyster to adapt to severe intertidal zones. The oysters exposed to strong environmental variability are thermal tolerant and have high adaptive potential to face the current global warming. Our findings will not only provide new insights into the significant role of plasticity in adaptive evolution that can be extended to other marine invertebrates, but also provide basic information for oyster resources conservation and reef reestablishment.

AB  - We review previously published studies on how temperature affects development and reproduction of spiders, with an emphasis on recent studies from China published in Chinese. We apply both linear and non-linear models to data from these papers to examine relationships between temperature and the spider's rate of development, and we estimate the thermal requirements of selected species. Intra-and interspecific variation in development time, survival, adult longevity, adult size, and reproduction are considered, and apparently, phenotypic plasticity in these above life history traits is induced by growth temperature. With respect to the life histories and life style of the spider species we argue that the thermal adaptations of spiders might have important roles in fine-tuning the species' life-history strategies: much of this variability is probably a consequence of adaptations to the different thermal conditions prevailing in the natural habitats of these species. Spiders living in warmer climates can withstand higher temperatures than species from colder climates, and species from colder climates can tolerate lower temperatures than species from warmer climates. Cold-habitat species develop more slowly at high temperatures, and warm-habitat species develop more slowly at low temperatures. Also, different species of spiders show different seasonal adaptations to the microenvironments in which they live: fast, low-temperature development is an indicator of adaptation to colder season(s) of the year, whereas slow, low-temperature development and fast, high-temperature development are indicators of adaptation to warm season(s) of the year.

AB  - These experiments are part of a larger study designed to investigate the influence of husbandry parameters on the life history of the apple snail, Marisa cornuarietis. The overall objective of the program is to identify suitable husbandry conditions for maintaining multi-generation populations of this species in the laboratory for use in ecotoxicological testing. In this article, we focus on the effects of photoperiod, temperature, and population density on adult fecundity and juvenile growth. Increasing photoperiod from 12 to 16 h of light per day had no effect on adult fecundity or egg hatching and relatively minor effects on juvenile growth and development. Rearing snails at temperatures between 22 degrees C and 28 degrees C did not influence the rates of egg production or egg clutch size. However, the rates of growth and development (of eggs and juveniles) increased with increasing temperature in this range, and when temperatures were reduced to 22 degrees C egg-hatching success was impaired. Juvenile growth and development were more sensitive to rearing density than adult fecundity traits. On the basis of the present results, we conclude that rearing individuals of M. cornuarietis at a temperature of 25 degrees C, a photoperiod of 12L:12D, and a density of < 0.8 snails L-1 (with lower densities for juvenile snails) should provide favorable husbandry conditions for maintaining multi-generation populations of this species.

AB  - Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia symbionts are now being released into the field to control the spread of pathogenic human arboviruses. Wolbachia can spread throughout vector populations by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility and can reduce disease transmission by interfering with virus replication. The success of this strategy depends on the effects of Wolbachia on mosquito fitness and the stability of Wolbachia infections across generations. Wolbachia infections are vulnerable to heat stress, and sustained periods of hot weather in the field may influence their utility as disease control agents, particularly if temperature effects persist across generations. To investigate the cross-generational effects of heat stress on Wolbachia density and mosquito fitness, we subjected Ae. aegypti with two different Wolbachia infection types (wMel, wAlbB) and uninfected controls to cyclical heat stress during larval development over two generations. We then tested adult starvation tolerance and wing length as measures of fitness and measured the density of wMel in adults. Both heat stress and Wolbachia infection reduced adult starvation tolerance. wMel Wolbachia density in female offspring was lower when mothers experienced heat stress, but male Wolbachia density did not depend on the rearing temperature of the previous generation. We also found cross-generational effects of heat stress on female starvation tolerance, but there was no cross-generational effect on wing length. Fitness costs of Wolbachia infections and cross-generational effects of heat stress on Wolbachia density may reduce the ability of Wolbachia to invade populations and control arbovirus transmission under specific environmental conditions.

AB  - Environmental stress generally exacerbates the harmful effects of inbreeding and it has been proposed that this could be exploited in purging deleterious alleles from threatened inbred populations. However, understanding what factors contribute to variability in the strength of inbreeding depression (ID) observed across adverse environmental conditions remains a challenge. Here, we examined how the nature and timing of stress affects ID and the potential for purging using inbred and outbred Drosophila melanogaster larvae exposed to biotic (larval competition, bacteria infection) and abiotic (ethanol, heat) stressors compared with unstressed controls. ID was measured during (larval survival) and after (male mating success) stress exposure. The level of stress imposed by each stressor was approximately equal, averaging a 42% reduction in outbred larval survival relative to controls. All stressors induced on average the same ID, causing a threefold increase in lethal equivalents for larval survival relative to controls. However, stress-induced ID in larval success was followed by a 30% reduction in ID in mating success of surviving males. We propose that this fitness recovery is due to 'intragenerational purging' whereby fitness correlations facilitate stress-induced purging that increases the average fitness of survivors in later life history stages. For biotic stressors, post-stress reductions in ID are consistent with intragenerational purging, whereas for abiotic stressors, there appeared to be an interaction between purging and stress-induced physiological damage. For all stressors, there was no net effect of stress on lifetime ID compared with unstressed controls, undermining the prediction that stress enhances the effectiveness of population-level purging across generations.

T2  - NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN
LA  - English
AB  - The ubiquity of circadian rhythms suggests that they have an intrinsic adaptive value (Ouyang et al. 1998; Ronneberg and Foster 1997). Some experiments have shown that organisms have enhanced longevity, development time or growth rates when maintained in environments whose periodicity closely matches their endogenous period (Aschoff et al. 1971; Highkin and Hanson 1954; Hillman 1956; Pittendrigh and Minis 1972; Went 1960). So far there has been no experimental evidence to show that circadian rhythms per se (i.e, periodicity itself, as opposed to phasing properties of a rhythm) confer a fitness advantage. We show that the circadian eclosion rhythm persists in a population of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster maintained in constant conditions of light, temperature, and humidity for over 600 generations. The results suggest that even in the absence of any environmental cycle there exists some intrinsic fitness value of circadian rhythms.

AB  - PCNA participates in multiple processes of DNA metabolism with an essential role in DNA replication and intervening in DNA repair. Temperature-sensitive PCNA mutants of Drosophila (mus209) are sensitive to mutagens, impair developmental processes and suppress positional-effect variegation. To investigate the role of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in germline genomic stability, independent mus209-defective and mus209-normal lines were established and maintained over six generations. A time course study was carried out and general genomic alterations were analyzed in the progeny by using arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) and microsatellite analysis. The AP-PCR analysis has shown that a dysfunctional PCNA leads to germline genomic instability, being the amount of genomic alterations transmitted to the progeny directly related to the number of mus209(B1) mutant alleles. In addition, we have found that the frequency of genomic alterations tends to increase over successive generations. Surprisingly, the highest microsatellite instability was found in the heterozygous mus209-defective lines, suggesting a greater mutation rate in these individuals in comparison with the homozygous mus209-defective lines. In conclusion, our results clearly indicate that PCNA is an important factor to maintain genomic stability in germinal cells, both in the overall genome and in simple repeated sequences. The implication of PCNA mutations in transgenerational genomic instability and related to cancer susceptibility is also discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Insects are ectotherms and their ability to resist temperature stress is limited. The immediate effects of sub-lethal heat stress on insects are well documented, but longer-term effects of such stresses are rarely reported. In this study, survival, development and reproduction of the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) biotype B, were compared over five consecutive generations at 27, 31 and 35 degrees C and for one generation at 37 degrees C. Both temperature and generation significantly affected the fitness of the whitefly. These impacts were more dramatic with increasing generations and temperatures. Among the experimental temperatures, the most favorable for development and reproduction were 27 degrees C and 31 degrees C. At 27 degrees C, survival, development and fecundity were all stable over these five generations. At 31 degrees C, immature survival rate was the highest in the fifth generation, but female fecundities decreased in the fourth and fifth generations. At 35 degrees C, egg hatching rate, immature survival rate and female fecundity decreased significantly in the fourth and fifth generations. At 37 degrees C, survival of B. tabaci was not adversely affected, but female fecundity at 37 degrees C was less than 10% of that at 27 degrees C or 31 degrees C. These results demonstrate that the lethal high temperature for B. tabaci is over 37 degrees C, and the whitefly population continued expanding in the five generations at 35 degrees C. The ability of B. tabaci biotype B to survive high temperature stress will play an important role in its population extension under global warming.

AB  - The mollusc Patella ferruginea, endemic to the Mediterranean, is the most endangered marine species of the list of the European Council Directive 92/43/EEC and it is presently under serious risk of extinction. Survival, growth rates and life-history of this species were studied for the first time in this species. A total of 570 specimens (420 introduced in a new habitat and 150 as control) were marked and monitored over a three-year period. Growth rates observed were mainly related to the availability of microalgal food. The mortality rate of transplanted specimens was high (50% mortality immediately after transplant). Seasonality in growth rates was observed in both control and transplanted specimens, with greater growth rates detected in spring-summer (warm season) than in autumn-winter (cold season). Smaller specimens of P. ferruginea had the greatest growth rates in comparison with the bigger specimens, therefore the potential ability to adapt in a new habitat was higher for small specimens immediately after removal. An elevated growth rate (appearing as a light-ring in the border of the shell) was detected immediately after translocation, following which growth rate progressively stabilized over time. Using differential equations and the von Bertalanffy model, the longevity of P. ferruginea was estimated to range between 8.89 and 35.72 years depending on the environment. Transplantation should not be considered as a conservation measure given the elevated mortality rate.

AB  - Reproduction in marine fish is generally tightly linked with water temperature. Consequently, when adults are exposed to projected future ocean temperatures, reproductive output of many species declines precipitously. Recent research has shown that in the common reef fish, Acanthochromis polyacanthus, step-wise exposure to higher temperatures over two generations (parents: +1.5 degrees C, offspring: +3.0 degrees C) can improve reproductive output in the F2 generation compared to F2 fish that have experienced the same high temperatures over two generations (F1 parents: +3.0 degrees C, F2 offspring: +3.0 degrees C). To investigate how a step-wise increase in temperature between generations improved reproductive capacity, we tested the expression of well-known teleost reproductive genes in the brain and gonads of F2 fish using quantitative reverse transcription PCR and compared it among control (+0.0 degrees C for two generations), developmental (+3.0 degrees C in second generation only), step (+1.5 degrees C in first generation and +3.0 degrees C in second generation), and transgenerational (+3.0 degrees C for two generations) treatments. We found that levels of gonadotropin receptor gene expression (Fshr and Lhcgr) in the testes were reduced in developmental and transgenerational temperature treatments, but were similar to control levels in the step treatment. This suggests Fshr and Lhcgr may be involved in regulating male reproductive capacity in A. polyacanthus. In addition, lower Fshb expression in the brain of females in all temperature treatments compared to control, suggests that Fshb expression, which is involved in vitellogenesis, is sensitive to high temperatures. Our results help elucidate key genes that facilitate successful reproduction in reef fishes when they experience a gradual increase in temperature across generations consistent with the trajectory of climate change.

AB  - Resistance to fenvalerate was examined in a laboratory-selected population of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, during exposure through 10 generations. Selection results showed that LD50 values rose from 0.003,ug per larva to 31.1 mu g per larva and 36.7 mu g per larva respectively, in replications 1 and 2 during those 10 generations. Resistant line moth eggs were significantly smaller than those of moths before selection. Therefore, we selected a subpopulation of resistant lines under harsh environmental conditions of low humidity and high temperature, over 10 generations (Harsh line) without insecticide exposure. We selected another subpopulation of resistant lines under optimal environmental conditions of high humidity and normal temperature through all 10 generations (Optimal line). After 10 generations, the LD50 of fenvalerate decreased to 0.03 mu g per larva and 0.02 mu g per larva under harsh conditions and 0.2 mu g per larva and 0.29 mu g per larva under optimal conditions. The LD50 values were lower for the Harsh lines than for the Optimal lines in all generations. The egg size of both lines increased gradually through 10 generations. Comparisons of these two lines showed that the egg size increased more rapidly in the Harsh lines than in Optimal lines in early (first-sixth) generations. In subsequent generations, egg sizes were nearly normal in both lines. Comparison of immature survivability of Harsh and Optimal lines reared under those conditions showed that the survivability of Harsh line individuals was significantly lower than for Optimal lines. Comparison of the two lines' survivability showed an opposite result from the comparison when they were reared under equivalent optimal conditions. These results suggest that susceptibility to insecticides might recover more quickly in Harsh lines than in Optimal lines because resistant insects with small eggs had lower survivability than susceptible insects with normal eggs. They were eliminated more rapidly under harsh environmental conditions.

AB  - The adaptation of organisms to their environment has been a subject of study for a long time. One method to study adaptations in populations involves comparing contemporary populations of the same species under different selective regimes, in what is known as a 'local adaptation' study. A previous study of the cyclically parthenogenetic rotifer Brachionus plicatilis found high heritabilities for some life-history traits. Some of these life-history traits significantly differed among six populations from Eastern Spain and data suggested some traits to have higher evolutionary rates than neutral genetic markers. Here, by studying the same B. plicatilis populations, we examine the variation and possible local adaptation of their main life-history traits, closely related to fitness, in relation to habitat salinity and temperature. These environmental factors have been shown to play a key role in the ecological differentiation among co-generic species of B. plicatilis. The results obtained in this study show that: (1) the seasonality of rotifer populations from Eastern Spain has profoundly influenced sexual reproduction strategies; (2) salinity is probably a key factor in the ecological specialization of some populations; and (3) rotifer populations harbour high variability in their fitness components.

AB  - We test for fitness costs of resistance in a natural host-parasite system, involving Drosophila nigrospiracula and ectoparasitic mites, Macrocheles subbadius. We contrasted rates of mortality at embryonic and pupal stages of host ontogeny between replicate-resistant and -susceptible (control) lines at different temperatures (24, 28, and 34 degrees C). Evidence for a cost of resistance was shown as a 17% overall reduction in egg hatch rate in replicate-resistant lines, although this effect was heterogeneous across replicate selection experiments. This cost of resistance was not magnified under thermal stress. Pupa survivorship was statistically invariant between resistant and control lines, at either temperature. Embryo and pupa mortalities were significantly elevated at the high temperature, confirming that the thermal treatment was physiologically stressful. The results suggest differential sensitivity of life history traits to the pleiotropic effects of genetic resistance against ectoparasitic mites.

AB  - While interactions with global warming and multigenerational effects are considered crucial to improve risk assessment of pesticides, these have rarely been studied in an integrated way. While heat extremes can magnify pesticide toxicity, no studies tested how their combined effects may transmit to the next generation. We exposed mosquito larvae in a full factorial, two-generation experiment to a heat spike followed by chlorpyrifos exposure. As expected, the heat spike magnified the chlorpyrifos-induced lethal and sublethal effects within both generations. Only when preceded by the heat spike, chlorpyrifos increased mortality and reduced the population growth rate. Moreover, chlorpyrifos-induced reductions in heat tolerance (CTmax), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and development time were further magnified by the heat spike. Notably, when parents were exposed to chlorpyrifos, the chlorpyrifos-induced lethal and sublethal effects in the offspring were smaller, indicating increased tolerance to chlorpyrifos. In contrast, there was no such multigenerational effect for the heat spike. Despite the adaptive multigenerational effect to the pesticide, the synergism with the heat spike was still present in the offspring generation. Generally, our results provide important evidence that short exposure to pulse-like global change stressors can strongly affect organisms within and across generations, and highlight the importance of considering multigenerational effects in risk assessment.

AB  - Environmental stressors rarely act in isolation, giving rise to interacting environmental change scenarios. However, the impacts of such interactions on natural populations must consider the ability of organisms to adapt to environmental changes. The phenotypic adaptability of a Daphnia galeata clone to temperature rise and salinisation was investigated in this study, by evaluating its halotolerance at two different temperatures, along a short multigenerational acclimation scenario. Daphniids were acclimated to different temperatures (20 degrees C and 25 degrees C) and salinities (0 g L-1 and 1 g L-1, using NaCl as a proxy) in a fully crossed design. The objective was to understand whether acclimation to environmental stress (combinations of temperature and salinity) influenced the response to the latter exposure to these stressors. We hypothesize that acclimation to different temperature x salinity regimes should elicit an acclimation response of daphniids to saline stress or its interaction with temperature. Acute (survival time) and chronic (juvenile growth) halotolerance measures were obtained at discrete timings along the acclimation period (generations F1, F3 and F9). Overall, exposure temperature was the main determinant of the acute and chronic toxicity of NaCI: daphniid sensitivity (measured as the decrease of survival time or juvenile growth) was consistently higher at the highest temperature, irrespective of background conditions. However, this temperature-dependent effect was nullified after nine generations, but only when animals had been acclimated to both stressors (high salinity and high temperature). Such complex interaction scenarios should be taken in consideration in risk assessment practices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - While transgenerational plasticity may buffer ectotherms to warming and pesticides separately, it remains unknown how combined exposure to warming and pesticides in the parental generation shapes the vulnerability to these stressors in the offspring. We studied the transgenerational effects of single and combined exposure to warming (4 degrees C increase) and the pesticide chlorpyrifos on life-history traits of the vector mosquito Culex pipiens. Parental exposure to a single stressor, either warming or the pesticide, had negative effects on the offspring: parental exposure to both warming and the pesticide resulted in an overall lower offspring survival, and a delayed offspring metamorphosis. Parental exposure to a single stressor did, however, not alter the vulnerability of the offspring to the same stressor in terms of survival. Parental pesticide exposure resulted in larger offspring when the offspring experienced the same stressor as the parents. Within both the parental and offspring generations, warming made the pesticide more toxic in terms of survival. Yet, this synergism disappeared in the offspring of parents exposed to both stressors simultaneously because in this condition, the pesticide was already more lethal at the lower temperature. Our results indicate that transgenerational effects will not increase the ability of this vector species to deal with pesticides in a warming world. Bifactorial transgenerational experiments are crucial to understand the combined impact of warming and pesticides across generations, hence to assess the efficacy of vector control in a warming world.

AB  - This study assessed the effects of refrigerated storage on the suitability of eggs of the glassy-winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca coagulata (Say) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae), as hosts for propagation of the parasitoid Gonatocerus ashmeadi Girault (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae). Development of the host eggs was terminated by chilling at 2 degrees C for 5 d before storage was initiated at 10 degrees C for up to 70 d. Parasitism, adult emergence rate, developmental time, and sex ratio were used to gauge the suitability of the eggs as hosts after storage. In addition to these measures, demographic growth parameters also were used to assess the quality of the wasp progeny through the F-2 generation. Host eggs stored 20 d remained fully acceptable to the wasps for attack. Although the parasitism rate decreased with storage time, > 80% adult parasitoid emergence was realized from eggs stored 30 d. After 70 d storage, adult emergence rate was decreased by 48%, fecundity decreased by 53%, female production by 19%, developmental time was extended 3 d, and female longevity was shortened 5 d. The emergence pattern of F-1 but not F-2 adults varied with storage time of the parental and grand-parental hosts, respectively. For the F-2 generation, emergence rate, development, and sex ratio did not vary with storage time when the F-1 parents parasitized fresh host eggs. Demographic parameters for the F, population showed that net reproductive rate was > 20 although it decreased significantly after their parental host eggs were stored for > 30 d. The intrinsic and finite rates of increase, population doubling time, and mean generation time decreased only after storage for 60 d. Our results show that short-term cold storage could be used for maintaining wasp populations in a mass-rearing program and that the detrimental effects of chilling host eggs in storage for over 30 d do not extend to F-2 generation.

AB  - The exotic egg parasitoid Edovum puttleri Grissell has shown promise for biological control of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say). However, because the activity of currently available populations is decreased at low temperatures, the use of biotypes of E. puttleri adapted to low temperatures may provide more effective control. To determine if there are populations of E. puttleri adapted to low temperatures, the life history characteristics of three populations collected in Honduras were compared at three temperatures (15, 24, and 30 degrees C) over three generations. In general, life history characteristics differed between the first generation and subsequent generations. Among temperatures, parasitoids reared at 24 degrees C mere more reproductively active, lived longer, and survived better than those reared at other temperatures, At the lowest temperature, there was a significant difference in the frequency of total egg production, with females from the "River" collection site producing more eggs than females from the other two sites, Coincidentally, the River area is located at the highest elevation and experiences a cooler climate. Comparison off. puttleri collected in Honduras, Colombia, and Mexico showed differences in life history characteristics. The implications for this study for selection of biotypes of E. puttleri are discussed. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

AB  - Cyphocleonus achates, the knapweed weevil, is an effective biological control agent of the invasive weed, Centaurea maculosa Lam. A meridic diet was developed and tested for the rearing of the larval stage of this insect. Using this diet, C achates was reared for over three generations, with the adults being offered knapweed plants for feeding and oviposition in greenhouse conditions. Slight or no differences were seen between insects reared on a standard meridic diet formulation and one containing knapweed tissues. The following life history parameters were monitored over the three generations: percent egg hatch (ranging from 42.9 to 59.1%), time to egg hatch (20.0-23.2 days), time to adult emergence (52.0-54.1 days), adult weights 3 days post-eclosion (101.9-117.0 mg), percent adult emergence (48.3-58.6%), and percent mortality/deformity in the different stages (with mortality occurring primarily in the early larval stages). Additionally, a study involving low temperature and short day conditions suggested that C achates could be maintained for longer periods of time in larval diet cells when placed in growth-retarding conditions., although percent adult emergence was lower. External morphology was also studied in order to distinguish between the sexes to ensure that each adult cage had a similar ratio of females to males. Abdominal features were found to be the most dependable characteristics for use when determining the sex of adult C achates. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Theoretical models on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity predict a zone of canalization where reaction norms cross, and genetic variation is minimized in the environment a population most frequently encounter. Empirical tests of this prediction are largely missing, in particular for life-history traits. We addressed this prediction by quantifying thermal reaction norms of three life-history traits (somatic growth rate, age and size at maturation)of a Norwegian population of Daphnia magna and testing for the occurrence of an intermediate temperature (T-m) at which genetic variance in the traits is minimized. Size at maturation changed relatively little with temperature compared to the other traits, and there was no genetic variance in the shape of the reaction norm. Consequently, age at maturation and somatic growth rate were strongly negatively correlated. Both traits showed a strong genotype-environment interaction, and the estimated T-m was 14 degrees C for both age at maturation and growth rate. This value of T-m corresponds well with mean summer temperatures experienced by the population and suggests that the population has evolved under stabilizing selection in temperatures that fluctuate around this mean temperature. These results suggest local adaptation to temperature in the studied population and allow predicting evolutionary trajectories of thermal reaction norms under changing thermal regimes.

AB  - While genetic rescue is known to benefit population viability, the duration of that benefit is poorly understood. We document what appears to be the waning benefit of genetic rescue after approximately 2-3 generations for the wolf population in Isle Royale National Park. The fitness benefit of genetic rescue declined because of inbreeding and population abundance declined when the inbred individuals exhibited low reproduction and survival. Only detailed studies of other cases will reveal what aspects of these dynamics represent general features of genetic rescue. We also present evidence indicating that numerous past immigration events have likely gone undetected. This finding is of particular significance because the Isle Royale wolf population has maintained good population viability for decades even though it was small and thought to be isolated from the mainland population of wolves. Past gene flow also suggests that human-assisted gene flow is necessary to conserve the ecosystem services associated with predation, since climate warming has reduced the frequency of ice bridges and with it the only opportunity for unassisted gene flow.

AB  - Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish Acanthaster spp. (COTS) are among the most severe local threats to IndoPacific coral reefs. Despite intensive research, the factors triggering outbreaks remain unclear, though could involve enhanced COTS larval fitness due to ocean warming and acidification. Nevertheless, the effect of these combined stressors has never been tested on larval development and survivorship after parental exposure. We investigated the effects of ocean warming (+2 ? above ambient) and/or acidification (pH 7.75) on early COTS life-history stages of offspring after exposing the parental generation for 20 weeks to the same treatments. We hypothesized that prior adult exposure would modulate the effects measured in previous studies that omitted this phase, providing a more realistic scenario. Our results showed detrimental effects of elevated temperature towards lower gastrulation success and smaller advanced bipinnaria. Both elevated temperature and lower pH produced developmental delay from early to advanced bipinnaria, eventually translating into retarded achievement of mid-late brachiolaria. On average, larvae were significantly bigger in low pH treatments, independent of stages. We suggest a link between developmental delay and larger larvae due to acidification, where larvae could be blocked at a developmental stage but continue growing. Finally, we found that larval mortality was not impacted by treatments, potentially due to prior adult exposure. If adult COTS were able to acclimatize their reproductive physiology in 15 weeks to produce larvae withstanding warming and/or acidification, slow climatic changes might not affect survival at this life stage. However, the developmental delays displayed might elongate their fragile pelagic phase, potentially decreasing their chances to reach recruitment. We specified the natural spawning peak in New Caledonia, and show caution in directly linking high fertilisation rates with high larval success. Our study reinforces the need to include parental exposure when investigating climate change effects on echinoderm larvae, as punctual stress over single-life stages may produce misleading results.

AB  - Starvation resistance is closely associated with fitness in natural populations of many organisms. It often co-varies with longevity and is a relevant target for understanding the evolution of aging. We selected for increased starvation resistance in the seasonally polyphenic butterfly Bicyclus anynana in a warm, wet-seasonal environment over 17 generations. We measured the response to selection for two selected lines compared to that of an unselected stock. Results show an increase in survival under adult starvation of 50%-100%. In addition, selection lines showed an increase in life span under normal adult feeding of 30%-50%. Female reproduction was changed toward laying fewer but larger eggs. The results indicate a sex-specific response to selection: females reallocated resources toward a more durable body, whereas males appeared to increase starvation resistance through changed metabolic rate. The phenotype produced by artificial selection resembles the form that occurs in the cool, dry-season environment, which suggests that selection has targeted the regulatory mechanisms for survival that are also involved in the suite of traits ( including starvation resistance) central to the adaptive plastic response of this butterfly to seasonal conditions. In general, these results imply that the regulation of life span involves mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - Predicting the impacts of ocean warming and acidification on marine ecosystems requires an evolutionary perspective because, for most marine species, these environmental changes will occur over a number of generations. Acclimation through phenotypic plasticity and adaptation through genetic selection could help populations of some species cope with future warmer and more acidic oceans. Coral reef species are predicted to be some of the most vulnerable to climate change because they live close to their thermal limits. Yet, their evolutionary history may indicate that they possess adaptations that enable them to cope with a high CO2 environment. Here, we first explore the evolutionary history of reef fishes and how their history has shaped their physiological adaptations to environmental temperatures and pCO(2). We examine current-day thermal and CO2 environments experienced by coral reef fishes and summarize experimental studies that have tested how they respond to elevated temperatures and pCO(2) levels. We then examine evidence for acclimation and adaptation to projected ocean warming and acidification. Indeed, new studies have demonstrated the potential for transgenerational plasticity and heritable genetic variation that would allow some fishes to maintain performance as the oceans warm and become more acidic. We conclude by outlining management approaches - specifically those that can help preserve genetic variation by maintaining population size - to enhance the potential for genetic adaptation to climate change.

AB  - Pyriproxyfen, a juvenile hormone (JH) mimic, is a biorational insecticide that disrupts insect development. It is one of the principal insecticides being used to control Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) on cotton, and has many environmentally positive attributes that make it compatible with integrated pest management (IPM) programs. In Israel, a high level of resistance to pyriproxyfen has been observed in several isolated regions. Here, tests were conducted to establish whether temporal refuges from exposure to pyriproxyfen could be useful for restoring the effectiveness of the compound. Resistance was found to decrease by a factor of 8 when exposure to pyriproxyfen was ceased for 13 generations. Reversal of resistance was accompanied with increased biotic fitness of the revertant colony. By incorporating experimental estimates of nymph survival, sex ratio, fecundity, egg hatching rate and developmental time, the seasonal cost per generation for resistant insects was estimated to be 25%. A genetic simulation model, optimized by empirical data from bioassays, predicted fitness cost per generation of 19% for resistant homozygous (RR) females and hemizygous (R) males, and produced rates of reversal similar to the experimental results. The model also predicted that, even after 5 years (similar to 55 generations) without pyriproxyfen treatments, the frequency of the resistance allele (R) will still remain high (0.02). It is therefore concluded, on the basis of experimental and modeling results, that the effectiveness of temporal refuges for reversing development of resistance to pyriproxyfen in B. tabaci may be limited.

AB  - The phenotypic sex in Nile tilapia is determined through major and minor genetic factors as well as environmental factors, such as temperature. Temperature treatments at 36 degrees C applied from 10 days post fertilisation for at least 10 days are known to influence the phenotypic sex. Recently a second window of temperature responsiveness was identified. Early rearing temperature (34-36 degrees C) applied from 12-52 h post fertilisation proved to exert an effect on the phenotypic sex in all-female progenies (XX). To study a possible correlation between the effect of early (12-52 h post fertilisation) and late [10-20 days post fertilisation (dpf)] temperature treatments on the phenotypic sex Nile tilapia, the present study investigates the influence of early rearing temperatures using mixed sex (XX/XY) progenies with predefined temperature responsiveness for the period from 10-20 dpf.
   The brood stock which produced the progenies for this experiment was derived from families of selected lines showing a strong or weak responsiveness of the male proportion towards a temperature treatment of 36 degrees C from 10-20 dpf. Sires and dams were chosen for the present experiment if the sex ratio in temperature treated groups showed male percentages of >90% in the high-line and <60% males, in the low-line. Three progenies obtained from each line were subjected to an early temperature treatment at 34 degrees C, 35 degrees C or 36 degrees C starting at 12 h post fertilisation, whereas the corresponding full sib control groups were kept at 28 C throughout the experiment. The experimental temperatures were reached within 5 h and were applied until hatching (52 +/- 3 h). Temperatures above 34 degrees C led to total mortalities in all progenies tested (n = 12 batches), whereas temperatures of 34 degrees C allowed survival rates that were comparable to those of the controls after nine days, except for progenies from the high-line. Irrespective of the line the progenies belonged to, the sex ratios were not affected by the early temperature treatment starting at 12 h post fertilisation. In conclusion, the temperature responsiveness towards early and late temperature treatments seems not to be correlated and might be dependent on the genotypic sex of the progenies. More studies are needed including information on the temperature responsiveness during both stages (before hatching and during sex differentiation), the genetic sex of the offspring, timing of temperature treatments as well as pedigree information to improve our understanding of early larval temperature treatment effects on the phenotypic sex.

AB  - Thermal tolerance range, based on temperatures that result in incapacitating effects, influences species' distributions and has been used to predict species' response to increasing temperature. Reproductive performance may also be negatively affected at less extreme temperatures, but such sublethal heat-induced sterility has been relatively ignored in studies addressing the potential effects of, and ability of species' to respond to, predicted climate warming. The few studies examining the link between increased temperature and reproductive performance typically focus on adults, although effects can vary between life history stages. Here we assessed how sublethal heat stress during development impacted subsequent adult fertility and its plasticity, both of which can provide the raw material for evolutionary responses to increased temperature. We quantified phenotypic and genetic variation in fertility ofDrosophila melanogasterreared at standardized densities in three temperatures (25, 27, and 29 degrees C) from a set of lines of theDrosophilaGenetic Reference Panel (DGRP). We found little phenotypic variation at the two lower temperatures with more variation at the highest temperature and for plasticity. Males were more affected than females. Despite reasonably large broad-sense heritabilities, a genome-wide association study found little evidence for additive genetic variance and no genetic variants were robustly linked with reproductive performance at specific temperatures or for phenotypic plasticity. We compared results on heat-induced male sterility with other DGRP results on relevant fitness traits measured after abiotic stress and found an association between male susceptibility to sterility and male lifespan reduction following oxidative stress. Our results suggest that sublethal stress during development has profound negative consequences on male adult reproduction, but despite phenotypic variation in a population for this response, there is limited evolutionary potential, either through adaptation to a specific developmental temperature or plasticity in response to developmental heat-induced sterility.

AB  - The rapidly increasing rate of urbanization has a major impact on the ecology and evolution of species. While increased temperatures are a key aspect of urbanization ("urban heat islands"), we have very limited knowledge whether this generates differentiation in thermal responses between rural and urban populations. In a common garden experiment, we compared the thermal performance curves (TPCs) for growth rate and mortality in larvae of the damselfly Coenagrion puella from three urban and three rural populations. TPCs for growth rate shifted vertically, consistent with the faster-slower theoretical model whereby the cold-adapted rural larvae grew faster than the warm-adapted urban larvae across temperatures. In line with costs of rapid growth, rural larvae showed lower survival than urban larvae across temperatures. The relatively lower temperatures hence expected shorter growing seasons in rural populations compared to the populations in the urban heat islands likely impose stronger time constraints to reach a certain developmental stage before winter, thereby selecting for faster growth rates. In addition, higher predation rates at higher temperature may have contributed to the growth rate differences between urban and rural ponds. A faster- slower differentiation in TPCs may be a widespread pattern along the urbanization gradient. The observed microgeographic differentiation in TPCs supports the view that urbanization may drive life-history evolution. Moreover, because of the urban heat island effect, urban environments have the potential to aid in developing predictions on the impact of climate change on rural populations.

AB  - Theory maintains that when future environment is predictable, parents should adjust the phenotype of their offspring to match the anticipated environment. The plausibility of positive anticipatory parental effects is hotly debated and the experimental evidence for the evolution of such effects is currently lacking. We experimentally investigated the evolution of anticipatory maternal effects in a range of environments that differ drastically in how predictable they are. Populations of the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei, adapted to 20 degrees C, were exposed to a novel temperature (25 degrees C) for 30 generations with either positive or zero correlation between parent and offspring environment. We found that populations evolving in novel environments that were predictable across generations evolved a positive anticipatory maternal effect, because they required maternal exposure to 25 degrees C to achieve maximum reproduction in that temperature. In contrast, populations evolving under zero environmental correlation had lost this anticipatory maternal effect. Similar but weaker patterns were found if instead rate-sensitive population growth was used as a fitness measure. These findings demonstrate that anticipatory parental effects evolve in response to environmental change so that ill-fitting parental effects can be rapidly lost. Evolution of positive anticipatory parental effects can aid population viability in rapidly changing but predictable environments.

AB  - Climate differences across latitude can result in seasonal constraints and selection on life-history characters. Because Aedes albopictus (Skuse) invaded North America in the mid-1980s, it has spread across a range of approximate to 14 degrees latitude and populations in the north experience complete adult mortality because of cold winter temperatures that are absent in the south. Life-table experiments were conducted to test for differences in the adult survival and reproductive schedules of Ae. albopictus females from three populations from the northern (Salem, NJ; Springfield, IL; Eureka, MO; approximate to 39 degrees N) and southern (Palm Beach, Palmetto, Tampa, FL; approximate to 27-28 degrees N) extremes of the species distribution in North America. There were consistent differences between northern and southern populations in incidence of photoperiodically-induced egg diapause. Under short daylength, diapause eggs constituted twice the proportion of total viable eggs from northern females (81.9-92.1%) than southern females (35.9-42.7%). There were no consistent differences between northern and southern populations in resource allocation between reproduction and maintenance, reproduction over time, and reproductive investment among offspring, and no apparent trade-offs between diapause incidence with reproduction or longevity. Our results suggest that the main response of North American Ae. albopictus to unfavorable winter climates is via the life history strategy of producing diapausing eggs, rather than quantitative variation in reproduction, and that there are no detectable costs to adult survival. Inherent geographic variation in the expression of diapause, consistent with the latitudinal extremes of A. albopictus, indicates evolutionary loss of diapause response in southern populations because of the invasion of A. albopictus in North America.

AB  - Life history variations among 27 populations of the grasshopper Chorthippus brunneus from around the British Isles were examined under laboratory conditions over three generations. Multiple-regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between grasshopper life histories and the climates of their ancestral sites. Grasshoppers from cooler sites were heavier at hatching. Grasshoppers from northern sites grew faster and developed through fewer instars, attaining adulthood earlier, at the expense of adult size. Depending on the measure of adult size used, adults were larger in warmer, sunnier or more southerly locations. Ecotypic differentiation is probably widespread among animals as it is among plants, though it is more rarely demonstrated by zoological studies, especially over the wide geographical scale covered here. Evidence from regression analysis supports the hypothesis that ecotypic differentiation in C. brunneus is an evolutionary response to climatic variation. The existence of intraspecific genetic diversity for climatic adaptations has implications for biodiversity conservation and the understanding of biotic responses to climatic change. It deserves wider recognition.

AB  - Offspring size determines offspring survival rates; thus, understanding factors influencing offspring size variability could elucidate variation in population dynamics. Offspring size variation is influenced through multigenerational adaptation to local environments and within-lifetime plastic responses to environmental variability and maternal effects among individuals. Moreover, offspring size variation may represent trade-offs in energy allocation within individuals that influence lifetime reproductive success. However, the mechanisms whereby environmental conditions influence offspring size, e.g., via inducing adaptive and plastic variation in population-scale maternal effects, remain poorly understood. We evaluated intra-specific variation in maternal effects, egg size, and intra-individual egg size variation in six populations of walleye (Sander vitreus) and related among-and within-population patterns to thermal conditions. Egg size was conserved within populations and negatively related to long-term thermal conditions among populations, while maternal effect strengths were positively related to thermal conditions, suggesting that populations inhabiting warmer environments adapted to produce smaller eggs but stronger maternal effects. Within a population, egg size was positively related to colder winters, suggesting cold winters may alter egg size through effects on maternal condition or as an adaptive maternal effect to improve offspring survival. Intra-individual egg size variation varied little among populations or with female size, but declined with increasing summer and decreasing winter temperatures. Our result suggests that environmental conditions could impact not only short-term offspring production but also spur adaptive changes in offspring phenotypes. Thus, it is necessary to account for adaptive responses to predict population dynamics under environmental changes.

AB  - Spontaneous mutations were allowed to accumulate for 104-161 generations in 113-176 inbred lines, independently maintained by a single brother-sister mating per generation, all of them derived from a completely homozygous population of Drosophila melanogaster. In each of two to three consecutive generations, all lines were scored for fecundity, egg-to-pupa and pupa-to-adult viabilities, both in the standard laboratory culture medium (ST) and in three harsh media differing from the former by a single factor: higher temperature (HT), higher NaCl concentration (HSC), or a much reduced concentration of nutrients (D). Relative to the standard medium, productivity (fecundity x viability) decreased by 25% (HT), 66% (HSC), and 80% (D). In each medium, mutational variances of those traits and mutational covariances between all possible pairs were calculated from the between-line divergence (codivergence). Mutational correlations between character states in different media were also obtained. Because we used inbred lines, those estimates were mainly due to the accumulation of mildly detrimental mutations, deleterious mutations of large effect being underrepresented. For all traits, mutational heritabilities ranged from 1.41 x 10(-4) to 11.24 x 10(-4), and did not increase with intensified environmental harshness. Mutational correlations between character states in different media were usually not large (average absolute value 0.31), reflecting a high degree of environmental specificity of the mutations involved. In our results, mutations quasi-neutral in ST conditions and mildly detrimental in more stressful media were not, as a class, important. Mutational correlations between fecundity and egg-to-pupa viability were small and positive in all media. Those involving pupa-to-adult viability were positive in HT, nonsignificant in HSC, and negative in ST and D, showing how the genetic covariance structure of quantitative traits in populations may change in variable environments.

AB  - Diurnal temperature fluctuations in nature can have a significant effect on many ectodermic traits. However, studies on the effects of diurnal temperature fluctuations on organisms, especially the effects on specific life stages, are still limited. We examined the immediate effects of the same average temperature (25 degrees C) and different temperature amplitudes (+/- 4, +/- 6, +/- 8, +/- 10, +/- 12 degrees C) on the development and survival of Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae). We also assessed carry-over effects on adult longevity, reproduction, development, and survival of offspring across generations. The effect of moderate temperature amplitudes was similar to that of constant temperature. Wide temperature amplitudes inhibited the development of pupae, reduced total reproduction, lowered intrinsic rates of population growth, and slowed the development and survival of eggs on the first day, but the proportion of females ovipositing on the first three days increased. Insects coped with the adverse effects of wide temperature amplitudes by laying eggs as soon as possible. Our results confirmed that a logistic model based on daily average temperature cannot predict development rates under wide temperature amplitudes. These findings highlight the effect of environmental temperature fluctuations at the pupal stage on the development and oviposition patterns of P. xylostella and should be fully considered when predicting field occurrence.

AB  - Despite strong selective pressure to optimize larval life history in marine environments, there is a wide diversity with regard to developmental mode, size, and time larvae spend in the plankton. In the present study, we assessed if adaptive hypotheses explain the distribution of the larval life history of thoracican barnacles within a strict phylogenetic framework. We collected environmental and larval trait data for 170 species from the literature, and utilized a complete thoracican synthesis tree to account for phylogenetic nonindependence. In accordance with Thorson's rule, the fraction of species with planktonic-feeding larvae declined with water depth and increased with water temperature, while the fraction of brooding species exhibited the reverse pattern. Species with planktonic-nonfeeding larvae were overall rare, following no apparent trend. In agreement with the "size advantage" hypothesis proposed by Strathmann in 1977, egg and larval size were closely correlated. Settlement-competent cypris larvae were larger in cold water, indicative of advantages for large juveniles when growth is slowed. Planktonic larval duration, on the other hand, was uncorrelated to environmental variables. We conclude that different selective pressures appear to shape the evolution of larval life history in barnacles.

AB  - 1. Thermodynamic processes increase metabolic rate and decrease longevity at high temperatures in ectotherms. However, how sustained long-term increase in temperature affects the evolution of longevity is poorly understood.
   2. Stress theory of ageing predicts that increased longevity is positively genetically correlated with resistance to different types of environmental stressors implying that evolutionary trajectories of ageing may be mediated by correlative selection for robust phenotypes under thermal stress.
   3. Here, we test this hypothesis by using replicate populations of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, evolving under two thermal environments: ancestral 30 degrees C and incremental increase towards novel 36 degrees C.
   4. Beetles evolving under climate warming became larger, more fecund and lived longer than the beetles evolving under 30 degrees C across both environments. However, the increase in longevity was partly due to parental effects because after two generations of acclimatization it persisted only in males.
   5. Our results support the hypothesis that evolution of stress resistance confers increased longevity through positive pleiotropy but demonstrate that such effects can be sex specific. These findings suggest that sex differences can evolve as correlated responses to selection under environmental change.

AB  - Whole-organism performance of ectotherms depends on body temperature, which is tightly linked to environmental temperatures. Individuals attempting to optimize fitness must thus select appropriate temperatures. The thermal coadaptation hypothesis posits that To for traits closely linked to fitness should match temperatures selected by a species (T-set) and should coevolve with T-set. To may mismatch T-set, if the thermal reaction norm for fitness is asymmetric. In this study, we examined six traits related to fitness in red and in confused flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum and T. confusum, respectively), including longevity, lifetime reproductive success, reproductive rate, and development time at four temperatures between 23 and 32 degrees C. For reproductive traits, To matched Tset whereas for longevity To was lower than T-set Triboliwn species have a strongly r-selected life history strategy, therefore reproductive traits are likely more tightly linked to fitness than longevity due to high predation rates at early life stages. We therefore provide support for the thermal coadaptation hypothesis for reproductive traits that are tightly linked to fitness. Our results highlight the importance of knowing the relationships of traits to fitness when studying thermal physiology.

AB  - Freshwater organisms are increasingly exposed to combinations of stressors. However, because it is time-consuming and costly, research on the interaction of stressors, such as compound toxicity and global warming on vertebrates, is scarce. Studies on multigenerational effects of these combined stressors are almost nonexistent. In the present study, we tested the combined effects of 4 degrees C warming and cadmium (Cd) exposure on life-history traits, biomarkers, bioaccumulation, and multigenerational tolerance in the turquoise killifish, Nothobranchius furzeri. The extremely short life cycle of this vertebrate model allows for assessment of sublethal and multigenerational effects within 4 mo. The applied Cd concentrations had only limited effects on the measured endpoints, which suggests that N. furzeri is more resistant to Cd than fathead minnow and rainbow trout. In contrast, the temperature increase of 4 degrees C was stressful: it delayed female maturation and lowered adult mass and fecundity. Finally, indications of synergistic effects were found on peak fecundity and embryonic survival. Overall, these results indicate the importance of studying chronic and multigenerational effects of combined stressors. Environ Toxicol Chem 2018;37:2361-2371. (c) 2018 SETAC.

AB  - A family-based selection program was initiated at the National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture in 2005 to improve resistance to bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) in rainbow trout. The objective of this study was to estimate response to 2 generations of selection. A total of 14,841 juvenile fish (BW = 3.1 g; SD = 1.1 g) from 230 full-sib families and 3 randomly mated control lines were challenged intraperitoneally with Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the bacterium that causes BCWD, and mortalities were observed for 21 d. Selection was applied to family EBV derived from a proportional-hazards frailty (animal) model while constraining rate of inbreeding to <= 1% per generation. After adjusting for nongenetic effects, survival rate of select-line families increased by 24.6 +/- 6.8 and 44.7 +/- 6.7 (cumulative) percentage points after 1 and 2 generations of selection, respectively (P < 0.01). Genetic trend, estimated from a linear animal model that fit genetic group effects, was 19.0 +/- 4.1 percentage points per generation and approached significance (P = 0.07). Heritability estimates from the proportional-hazards frailty model and linear animal model were similar (0.22 and 0.23, respectively), and family EBV from both models were highly correlated (-0.92). Accuracy of selection, estimated as the correlation between mid-parent EBV and progeny survival rate, was 0.20 (P < 0.01) for the proportional-hazards frailty model and 0.18 (P = 0.01) for the linear animal model. Accuracy estimates were not different (P = 0.81) between the models. This study demonstrates that selective breeding can be effective for improving resistance to experimental BCWD challenge in rainbow trout.

AB  - A comparative study of life history traits of two clones (CDMr01 and CDMr02) of a triploid thelytokous apomictic population of the eutardigrade Macrobiotus richtersi has been carried out. Both clones were reared under the same lab conditions: temperature of 14 degrees C, photoperiod of 12 h/12 h (L/D), and nematodes ad libitum as food. Statistical analysis of the life history traits considered has indicated interclonal variability. The two clones were significantly different in the number of eggs per clutch (fertility), number of eggs laid per female per life span (fecundity), hatching percentage of eggs and hatching time. Similarities between clones have been observed with regard to life span, total number of ovipositions per life span, and age at first oviposition. In addition, significant differences in hatching time, with eggs hatched over a long period, were found within each clone. Interclonal variability in life history traits indicated the effects of genetic factors, whereas intraclonal variability reflected the effects of environmental factors. The evolutionary and adaptive significance of the life history phenotypic variations is discussed.

AB  - The fitness consequences of thermal plasticity of functional traits of insects, and the life stages at which these responses manifest, remain a subject of much debate. Here, we examine whether a short-term exposure to cold, medium or warm fluctuating temperature regimes during development (larval or adult) affects adult performance, thermal tolerance and fitness of the globally invasive harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis. We found plastic responses of a metric of heat stress resistance-critical thermal maximum-and of preferred body temperature after adult temperature exposure, but not in other traits measured. By contrast, exposure of larval stages resulted in plasticity of adult walking performance (height and breadth of the curve) but not tolerance or preference. We found distinct fitness responses between larval and adult treatments, but a composite fitness index revealed negligible effects on reproductive output. These results suggest that the drivers underlying the plasticity of temperature tolerance and temperature selection are different to those shaping the plasticity of walking speed. By testing specific predictions based on current theory of developmental and reversible plasticity, this study contributes novel data to plastic responses of behaviour, stress resistance and fitness to temperature exposure across life stages and thus, provides insights to the broader evolutionary and ecological significance of these responses.

AB  - In Brazil, Eucalyptus grandis is a key species for wood production. However, some genotypes are susceptible to rust (Puccinia psidii), mainly in Sao Paulo State, where climatic conditions are favorable for its development. Rust represents a high economic risk to forest companies because of the high potential of damage to commercial eucalypt plantations. The aims of the present study were (i) to select progenies of E. grandis for stability and adaptability regarding resistance to rust at different locations; (ii) compare the selections under these different climatic conditions; and (iii) compare rust severity in the field with the theoretical model. We observed that climatic conditions were extremely influential factors for rust development, but even under favorable conditions for disease development, we found rust-resistant progenies. In sites unfavorable for rust development, we detected highly susceptible progenies. We found significant correlation among the genetic material, environmental conditions and disease symptoms, however, we observed a simple genotype-environmental interaction and significant genetic variability among the progenies. The average heritability was high among the progenies in all sites, indicating substantial genetic control for rust resistance. We also observed a good relationship between rust severity in the field and the theoretical model that considered annual average temperature and leaf wetness. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Effects of high temperature on insecticide susceptibility and fitness were studied in the field population of Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) (R DBM) and a susceptible field-insectarium population of P. xylostella (S DBM). R DBM displayed 18.3-fold resistance to methamidophos and 74.0-fold resistance to avermectin. The population growth tendency index (1) values were 41.8 (S DBM) and 27.7 (R DBM) at 25 degrees C, and 1.19 (S DBM) and 0.23 (R DBM) at 33.5 degrees C. The level of methamidophos resistance in the progenies of R DBM declined sharply when reared at high temperature for one generation. The increase of susceptibility to methamidophos appeared to pass from generation to generation. S DBM displayed higher up-regulation of Hsp70 expression at high temperature than R DBM. It was suggested that low fitness in R DBM caused by high temperature might be involved in the sharp decline of methamidophos resistance under high temperature conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Local adaptation, an important phenomenon in ecological speciation, occurs in Myzus persicae (Sulzer), with the tobacco-adapted line proposed as a subspecies. Recent studies showed that temperature could alter the selection strength and direction in host-herbivore interactions. To understand the formation of host-adapted speciation and the effects of temperature on host adaptation, the parthenogenetic progeny of an M. persicae egg were conditioned on two hosts for > 10 generations. Then, their life table parameters were studied after reciprocal transfer under a temperature gradient. The results showed that aphids habituated on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and rape (Brassica napus L.) had different optimal temperatures, including different upper thresholds of development and reproduction on original and alternative hosts. After habituation for > 10 generations, local adaptation of aphids on the host of origin was formed, which was observed as the better performance of the native aphids compared with the foreign ones. The M. persicae that habituated on rape appeared more generalized to the host plants than the aphids that habituated on tobacco. The adaptation patterns of green peach aphids on two hosts varied differentially according to temperature, which verified the temperature-mediated effects of host selection on herbivores, implying the presence of a demographic basis of aphid seasonal migration.

AB  - The development of techniques for production of gynogenetic, androgenetic, polyploid, and monosex progenies in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) is described from a chronological perspective. Gynogenetic progenies were obtained either by suppression of the second meiotic division in eggs (meiotic gynogenesis) or by suppression of the first mitotic division in haploid embryos (mitotic gynogenesis). As a rule, gynogenetic progenies of common carp were all-female, revealing female homogamety (females-XX, males-XY) in this species. Induced gynogenesis results in increased homozygosity; the rate of increase depends on the type of gynogenesis. Inbreeding coefficient (F) for one generation of meiotic gynogenesis in common carp is about 0.6, while diploids obtained by mitotic gynogenesis are homozygous for all genes (F = 1.0). Mitotic gynogenesis was used for production of clones in common carp. In androgenetic progenies of common carp, YY males were identified, that after crossing with normal females (XX) produced all-male progenies. Triploids of common carp are characterized by a significant reduction in gonad development (especially ovaries). However, the reduction in gonad development did not result in an increase of somatic growth rate of fish. The procedure for androgen treatment to induce phenotypic sex reversal in genotypic females (XX) was elaborated. All-female progenies of common carp were produced on a large scale by crossing normal females (XX) with hormonally sex-reversed males (XX). Rearing of all-female progenies in conditions when fish normally reach sexual maturity before reaching of market size increased production yield by 7-8%. In a few cases distant hybridization resulted in polyploidy of fish without application of any physical treatment. The ability of hybrid females between crucian carp (Carassius auratus) and common carp to produce diploid (with unreduced chromosome number) gametes resulted in opportunities to produce triploid and tetraploid hybrid progenies.

AB  - Dendroctonus ponderosae (Hopkins) is widely distributed across western North America, feeding in at least 12 native species of Pinus L. (Pinaceae). We investigated the existence of heritable differences in two life-history parameters (adult size and development time) of D. ponderosae from a northern population (central Idaho, Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon) and a southern population (southern Utah, Pinus ponder osa Douglas ex P. and C. Lawson). We attempted to separate heritable from environmental effects by rearing individuals from both populations through two generations (F-1 and F-2) in a common standardized laboratory environment with a constant temperature. Two treatment effects were tested for in the F-2 generation: (I) geographic location (source host) for F-0 D. porderosae; and (2) the F-2 brood host. We hypothesized that, if differences were observed and the F-0 source host and region had a greater effect on F-2 brood development time and adult size than did the host in which F-2 brood were reared, a heritable factor related to the F-0 parents was responsible. Time to emergence was significantly shorter for second-generation offspring of the northern population than for second-generation offspring of the southern population, regardless of the F-2 brood host. Although both the F-2 brood host and F-0 source parents were significant in explaining differences observed in the developmental-time distribution of F-2 brood, the F-0 source effect was round to be much greater. Also, F-2 males and females from southern source parents were sig nificantly larger than F-2 brood from northern source parents when reared in both F-2 brood hosts. Geographic region and original host of F-0 source parents had a significant effect on F-2 offspring size, whereas the immediate food for F-2 brood was not significant in explaining differences. These results suggest genetically based regional differences in D. ponderosae populations.

AB  - Global warming is associated with an increase in sea surface temperature and its variability. The consequences of evolving in variable, fluctuating environments are explored by a large body of theory: when populations evolve in fluctuating environments the frequency of fluctuations determines the shapes of tolerance curves (indicative of habitats that organisms can inhabit) and trait reaction norms (the phenotypes that organisms display across these environments). Despite this well-established theoretical backbone, predicting how trait and tolerance curves will evolve in organisms at the foundation of marine ecosystems remains a challenge. Here, we used a globally distributed phytoplankton, Thalassiosira pseudonana, and show that fluctuations in temperature on scales of 3-4 generations rapidly selected for populations with enhanced trait plasticity and elevated thermal tolerance. Fluctuations spanning 30-40 generations selected for the formation of two stable, genetically and physiologically distinct populations, one evolving high trait plasticity and enhanced thermal tolerance, and the other, akin to samples evolved under constant warming, with lower trait plasticity and a smaller increase in thermal tolerance.

AB  - The selective past of populations is presumed to affect the levels of phenotypic plasticity. Experimental evolution at constant temperatures is generally expected to lead to a decreased level of plasticity due to presumed costs associated with phenotypic plasticity when not needed. In this study, we investigated the effect of experimental evolution in constant, predictable and unpredictable daily fluctuating temperature regimes on the levels of phenotype plasticity in several life history and stress resistance traits in Drosophila simulans. Contrary to the expectation, evolution in the different regimes did not affect the levels of plasticity in any of the traits investigated even though the populations from the different thermal regimes had evolved different stress resistance and fitness trait means. Although costs associated with phenotypic plasticity are known, our results suggest that the maintenance of phenotypic plasticity might come at low and negligible costs, and thus, the potential of phenotypic plasticity to evolve in populations exposed to different environmental conditions might be limited.

AB  - Dams designed for hydropower and other purposes alter the environments of many economically important fishes, including Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We estimated that dams on the Rogue River, the Willamette River, the Cowlitz River, and Fall Creek decreased water temperatures during summer and increased water temperatures during fall and winter. These thermal changes undoubtedly impact the behavior, physiology, and life histories of Chinook salmon. For example, relatively high temperatures during the fall and winter should speed growth and development, leading to early emergence of fry. Evolutionary theory provides tools to predict selective pressures and genetic responses caused by this environmental warming. Here, we illustrate this point by conducting a sensitivity analysis of the fitness consequences of thermal changes caused by dams, mediated by the thermal sensitivity of embryonic development. Based on our model, we predict Chinook salmon likely suffered a decrease in mean fitness after the construction of a dam in the Rogue River. Nevertheless, these demographic impacts might have resulted in strong selection for compensatory strategies, such as delayed spawning by adults or slowed development by embryos. Because the thermal effects of dams vary throughout the year, we predict dams impacted late spawners more than early spawners. Similar analyses could shed light on the evolutionary consequences of other environmental perturbations and their interactions.

AB  - The evolution of 'adaptive' growth rate and its influence on how other life history traits evolve is a neglected topic in biology. Growth rate influences life history because size strongly influences age-specific survival and fecundity, and because growth rate defines the relationship between age and size. Improved predictions about the evolution of life history traits may be possible with a greater understanding of the factors that influence the evolution of growth rate. We experimentally tested the hypothesis that a trade off may exist between growth rate and developmental stability in freshwater threespine sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus. We compared the degree of developmental instability (measured as fluctuating asymmetry = FA) in four lateral plate and two fin traits of fish reared under a high vs. low growth regime in response to food ration and temperature. We found evidence that symmetry was reduced (FA increased) in fast growing compared to slow growing fish, suggesting that a trade off between developmental stability and growth is possible. FA plausibly reflected developmental instability because of significant associations between rank FA levels across traits in individuals. These results are preliminary because of the possible confounding effects of temperature and food ration on asymmetry, and because we do not know if this trade off has fitness or other life history consequences. Our results also do not support the hypothesis of honest signaling sometimes invoked in studies of sexual selection because greater symmetry was found under poorer rather than better resource levels.

AB  - Climate change is a major evolutionary force triggering thermal adaptation in a broad range of species. While the consequences of global warming are being studied for an increasing number of species, limited attention has been given to the evolutionary dynamics of endosymbionts in response to climate change. Here, we address this question by studying the dynamics of Wolbachia, a well-studied endosymbiont of Drosophila melanogaster. D. melanogaster populations infected with 13 different Wolbachia strains were exposed to novel hot and cold laboratory environments for up to 180 generations. The short-term dynamics suggested a temperature-related fitness difference resulting in the increase of clade V strains in the cold environment only. Our long-term analysis now uncovers that clade V dominates in all replicates after generation 60 irrespective of temperature treatment. We propose that adaptation of the Drosophila host to either temperature or Drosophila C virus (DCV) infection are the cause of the replicated, temporally non-concordant Wolbachia dynamics. Our study provides an interesting case demonstrating that even simple, well-controlled experiments can result in complex, but repeatable evolutionary dynamics, thus providing a cautionary note on too simple interpretations on the impact of climate change.

AB  - Latitudinal variation in thermal reaction norms of key fitness traits may inform about the response of populations to climate warming, yet their adaptive nature and evolutionary potential are poorly known. We assessed the contribution of quantitative genetic, neutral genetic and environmental effects to thermal reaction norms of growth rate for populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans. Among populations, reaction norms differed primarily in elevation, suggesting that time constraints associated with shorter growth seasons in univoltine, high-latitude as well as multivoltine, low-latitude populations selected for faster growth rates. Phenotypic divergence among populations is consistent with selection rather than drift as Q(ST) was greater than F-ST in all cases. Q(ST) estimates increased with experimental temperature and were influenced by genotype by environment interactions. Substantial additive genetic variation for growth rate in all populations suggests that evolution of trait means in different environments is not constrained. Heritability of growth rates was higher at high temperature, driven by increased genetic rather than environmental variance. While environment-specific nonadditive effects also may contribute to heritability differences among temperatures, maternal effects did not play a significant role (where these could be accounted for). Genotype by environment interactions strongly influenced the adaptive potential of populations, and our results suggest the potential for microevolution of thermal reaction norms in each of the studied populations. In summary, the observed latitudinal pattern in growth rates is adaptive and results from a combination of latitudinal and voltinism compensation. Combined with the evolutionary potential of thermal reaction norms, this may affect populations' ability to respond to future climate warming.

AB  - Background: Pathogens are a major regulatory force for host populations, especially under stressful conditions. Elevated temperatures may enhance the development of pathogens, increase the number of transmission stages, and can negatively influence host susceptibility depending on host thermal tolerance. As a net result, this can lead to a higher prevalence of epidemics during summer months. These conditions also apply to marine ecosystems, where possible ecological impacts and the population-specific potential for evolutionary responses to changing environments and increasing disease prevalence are, however, less known. Therefore, we investigated the influence of thermal stress on the evolutionary trajectories of disease resistance in three marine populations of three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus by combining the effects of elevated temperature and infection with a bacterial strain of Vibrio sp. using a common garden experiment.
   Results: We found that thermal stress had an impact on fish weight and especially on survival after infection after only short periods of thermal acclimation. Environmental stress reduced genetic differentiation (Q(ST)) between populations by releasing cryptic within-population variation. While life history traits displayed positive genetic correlations across environments with relatively weak genotype by environment interactions (GxE), environmental stress led to negative genetic correlations across environments in pathogen resistance. This reversal of genetic effects governing resistance is probably attributable to changing environment-dependent virulence mechanisms of the pathogen interacting differently with host genotypes, i.e. G(Pathogen)xG(Host)xE or (G(Pathogen)xE)x(G(Host)xE) interactions, rather than to pure host genetic effects, i.e. G(Host)xE interactions.
   Conclusion: To cope with climatic changes and the associated increase in pathogen virulence, host species require wide thermal tolerances and pathogen-resistant genotypes. The higher resistance we found for some families at elevated temperatures showed that there is evolutionary potential for resistance to Vibrio sp. in both thermal environments. The negative genetic correlation of pathogen resistance between thermal environments, on the other hand, indicates that adaptation to current conditions can be a weak predictor for performance in changing environments. The observed feedback on selective gradients exerted on life history traits may exacerbate this effect, as it can also modify the response to selection for other vital components of fitness.

AB  - Background The tomato red spider mite, Tetranychus evansi Baker & Pritchard (Acari: Tetranychidae), is an agricultural pest of solanaceous crops. Although T. evansi is of South American subtropical origin, it has recently expanded its distribution range to many tropical and temperate areas around the world. Its potential distribution range in response to scenarios of global warming was recently modeled, confirming its current and possible future distributions. Here, we experimentally investigated the biological traits of T. evansi in the context of the current and future global warming (2100) scenarios. Using an environmental simulation system, we tested the life-history traits of T. evansi under current summer temperatures (as of June, July, and August 2016) and under expected temperature increases based on two IPCC scenarios: RCP2.6 (+ 1 degrees C) and RCP8.5 (+ 3.7 degrees C). The mites were introduced into each scenario on 1 June and their sequential progeny were used for testing in each following month. Results The mite could develop and reproduce under all scenarios. There was a decrease in the duration of lifespan and female fecundity at RCP8.5 during June and August, but this may be compensated for by the high intrinsic rate of increase, which implies faster population growth and shorter generation time. Conclusion Our study and other reports reveal the high adaptability of T. evansi to a wide range of summer temperatures; this may explain its current distribution. We anticipate that global warming will favor the spread of T. evansi and may further expand its distribution to a large area of the globe. These findings should be of ecological and practical relevance for designing prevention and control strategies.

AB  - Wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are in decline over the entire distribution area, and populations are enhanced by supportive breeding. Parental fish are sampled in rivers, crossed and the offspring reared in hatcheries until smolting when released, ready for ocean migration. Naturally reproducing salmon entering the River Imsa from the ocean were monitored from 1976 through 2013, and since 1982, supportive breeders spawning in the river were also monitored. The supportive breeders were first-generation salmon, reared for 1-2 years in a hatchery before being released at the mouth of the river so they could migrate to sea (i.e., sea-ranching). Wild and sea-ranched salmon live in the ocean for 1-2 years before they return to the river for spawning. In years when only wild adults were present, mean number of smolts produced per 100 m(2) river area and female breeder was 0.47. When there were 5% wild females, the mean production was only 0.088 (19%). The gradual decrease in offspring production with decreasing proportion of wild females (r(2) = .41) indicates that the reduced offspring production was caused by inferior spawning behavior of hatchery females or reduced survival of their offspring in nature. Previous experimental evidence suggests that wild males fertilize the eggs of wild but also hatchery females. It is discussed how epigenetic effects caused by hatchery environments influence the developing juveniles, lead to phenotypic changes that may reduce their fitness in nature even after free ranging for a year or more in the ocean before they return and spawn.

AB  - Populations are permanently evolving and their evolution will influence their survival and reproduction, which will then alter demographic parameters. Several phenotypic, life history and environmental variables are known to be related to fitness measures. The goal of this article was to look into the possible types of those relationships in insects of the subfamily Triatominae, vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. After an exhaustive literature review of 7,207 records of publications referring exclusively to all possible features of the triatomines, using 15 keywords those records were reduced to 2,968 publications, that were analyzed individually; after deleting those publications that did not have the data in quantitative form as needed for the objective of this article, I found that 171 papers were adequate for the present analysis. From them I compiled a dataset of 11 variables and 90 cases from 36 triatomine species. Those variables included four environmental, two life cycle, and four morphological variables, and one demographic parameter: a fitness measure (the population intrinsic rate of natural increase, r(0)), used as dependent variable. However, the relationship between T. cruzi and its vector host was not included in this analysis despite triatomine-T. cruzi interactions constitute an important factor in the evolution of triatomine's life history. I resorted to the Random Forest method as a machine learning approach for the analysis of this dataset, and found that -in addition to the triatomine species themselves- only the two life cycle variables (mean development time from egg to adult, and mean fecundity, expressed as the average number of female eggs laid per female per day) were statistically significant in determining fitness (r(0)). The machine learning approach used in the analysis provided a similar but deeper insight into these relationships than classical regression. Except for an analysis on senescence, this is the first study in triatomines addressing these questions. These results will be useful for other theoretical optimization approaches (frequency-dependence, density-dependence, evolutionary game theory, and adaptive dynamics), thus contributing to the theoretical framework for interpreting the succession of stages in insect adaptations, a framework yet to be constructed.

AB  - Predicting the impact of warming and acidifying on oceans on the early development life history stages of invertebrates although difficult, is essential in order to anticipate the severity and consequences of future climate change. This review summarises the current literature and meta-analyses on the early life-history stages of invertebrates including fertilisation, larval development and the implications for dispersal and settlement of populations. Although fertilisation appears robust to near future predictions of ocean acidification, larval development is much more vulnerable and across invertebrate groups, evidence indicates that the impacts may be severe. This is especially for those many marine organisms which start to calcify in their larval and/or juvenile stages. Species-specificity and variability in responses and current gaps in the literature are highlighted, including the need for studies to investigate the total effects of climate change including the synergistic impact of temperature, and the need for long-term multigenerational experiments to determine whether vulnerable invertebrate species have the capacity to adapt to elevations in atmospheric CO2 over the next century.

AB  - There is growing evidence that fishing causes evolution in life-history traits that affect the productivity of fish stocks. Here we explore the impact of fisheries-induced evolution (FIE) on the productivity of North Sea plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) using an ecogenetic, individual-based model by comparing management scenarios with and without an evolutionary response. Under status-quo management, plaice evolve towards smaller size at age, earlier maturation, and higher reproductive investment. Current reference points of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and corresponding fishing-mortality rate (FMSY) that ignore FIE will decrease and cannot be considered sustainable. The nature and extent of the change through FIE depend on fishing effort and selectivity. The adverse evolutionary effects can be reduced - and even reversed - by implementing a dome-shaped exploitation pattern protecting the large fish. The evolutionarily sustainable maximum yield can be obtained by combining such a dome-shaped exploitation pattern with a reduction in fishing mortality and an increase in mesh size; it is similar to the MSY that would apply if life-history traits were static. Fisheries managers will need to trade off the short-term loss in yield associated with evolutionarily informed management with the long-term loss in yield FIE causes under evolutionarily uninformed management.

AB  - Climate change is increasing weather unpredictability, causing more intense, frequent and longer extreme events including droughts, precipitation, and both heat and cold waves.
   The performance of parasites, and host-parasite interactions, under these unpredictable conditions, are directly influenced by the ability of parasites to cope with extremes and their capacity to adapt to the new conditions. Here, we review some of the structural, behavioural, life history and ecological characteristics of parasitic nematodes that allow them to persist and adapt to extreme and changing environmental conditions. We focus primarily, but not exclusively, on parasitic nematodes in the Arctic, where temperature extremes are pronounced, climate change is happening most rapidly, and changes in host-parasite interactions are already documented. We discuss how life-history traits, phenotypic plasticity, local adaptation and evolutionary history can influence the short and long term response of parasites to new conditions. A detailed understanding of the complex ecological processes involved in the survival of parasites in extreme and changing conditions is a fundamental step to anticipate the impact of climate change in parasite dynamics.

The present study is the first experimental demonstration for the molecular clock of neutral mutations in a fitness-increasing evolutionary process. The dynamics of genome mutation fixation in the thermal adaptive evolution of Escherichia coli were evaluated in a prolonged evolution experiment in duplicated lineages. The cells from the continuously fitness-increasing evolutionary process were subjected to genome sequencing and analyzed at both the population and single-colony levels. Although the dynamics of genome mutation fixation were complicated by the combination of the stochastic appearance of adaptive mutations and clonal interference, the mutation fixation in the population was simply linear over generations. Each genome in the population accumulated 1.6 synonymous and 3.1 non-synonymous neutral mutations, on average, by the spontaneous mutation accumulation rate, while only a single genome in the population occasionally acquired an adaptive mutation. The neutral mutations that preexisted on the single genome hitchhiked on the domination of the adaptive mutation. The successive fixation processes of the 128 mutations demonstrated that hitchhiking and not genetic drift were responsible for the coincidence of the spontaneous mutation accumulation rate in the genome with the fixation rate of neutral mutations in the population. The molecular clock of neutral mutations to the fitness-increasing evolution suggests that the numerous neutral mutations observed in molecular phylogenetic trees may not always have been fixed in fitness-steady evolution but in adaptive evolution.

AB  - Hormesis is a biological phenomenon, whereby exposure to low levels of toxic agents or conditions increases organismal viability. It thus represents a beneficial aspect of adaptive responses to harmful environmental stimuli. Here we show that hormesis effects induced in the parental generation can be passed on to the descendants in Caenorhabditis elegans. Animals subjected to various stressors during developmental stages exhibit increased resistance to oxidative stress and proteotoxicity. The increased resistance is transmitted to the subsequent generations grown under unstressed conditions through epigenetic alterations. Our analysis reveal that the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling effector DAF-16/FOXO and the heat-shock factor HSF-1 in the parental somatic cells mediate the formation of epigenetic memory, which is maintained through the histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylase complex in the germline across generations. The elicitation of memory requires the transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf in somatic tissues. We propose that germ-to-soma communication across generations is an essential framework for the transgenerational inheritance of acquired traits, which provides the offspring with survival advantages to deal with environmental perturbation.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of an organism to express different phenotypes depending on the environment, provides an important mechanism by which an animal population can persist under rapid climate change. We experimentally tested both life-history and transcriptional responses of an ecological model species, the three-spined stickleback, to warm acclimation at the southern edge of its European range. We explored cross-environment genetic correlations of key life-history traits in male sticklebacks exposed to long-term temperature changes to examine whether the plasticity pattern was variable among genotypes by using a character-state approach. We also studied gene expression plasticity by analysing both whole-transcriptome and candidate gene expression in brain and liver. Male sticklebacks that developed under warmer conditions during winter were smaller in size and invested less in nuptial coloration at the beginning of the breeding season, showing similar responses across different genotypes. The lack of genetic variation in life-history responses may limit any future evolution of the thermal reaction norm in the study population. After long-term exposure to increased winter temperatures, genes responsible for several metabolic and oxidation-reduction processes were upregulated, and some hormone genes involved in growth and reproduction were downregulated in the brain. In the liver, there was no significantly represented gene ontology by the differentially expressed genes. Since a higher temperature leads to a higher resting metabolic rate, living in warmer environments may incur higher energetic costs for ectotherms to maintain cellular homoeostasis, resulting in negative consequences for life-history traits. The expression of genes related to metabolism, cellular homoeostasis and regulatory signalling may underlie temperature-induced changes in life history.

AB  - The laboratory fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is used widely in biological research, but the requirement to maintain stocks with a roughly biweekly generation time imposes substantial burdens of labor, potential cross-contamination and mutation accumulation. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of prolonged cold stress or milder cooling on survivorship and fertility. The hypothesis was that cold storage would result in postponement of reproduction and a longer generation time. Flies of several genotypes were maintained continuously at 4-11 degrees C; recovery rates and subsequent yields of adult progeny were recorded. Adults and pupae of a relatively long-lived y w lineage were more resistant to severe cold stress than embryos and larvae. Adults exhibited minimal mortality up to at least 5 d at 4 degrees C, 20 d at 8 degrees C and 12 weeks at 11 degrees C. Reproduction did not occur at these temperatures, but progeny were obtained after recovery at 25 degrees C. At all temperatures, chilling caused a rapid, severe and progressive decrease in fertility during the first 2 d of recovery. The impact on fertility during the subsequent 2-4 d was much milder and it occurred only after prolonged incubation at low temperatures. The total reproductive output during the first 6 d of recovery was sufficient to replace the parental population after 12 weeks at 11 degrees C. Food spoilage had an unexpectedly low impact on survivorship and fertility, and the reproductive output of F1 progeny was not affected by storing parental flies at 11 degrees C for 8-10 weeks. In the case of w(1118) flies, replacement of the parents within 6 d of recovery was possible for up to 60 d at 11 degrees C. Among less fertile genotypes, replacement of the parents was possible within 18 d after 4-10 weeks at 11 degrees C. These results show that the 2-week maintenance interval of stocks of D. melanogaster can be extended 3-7 fold, at least for 1 generation, by storing adult flies at 11 degrees C.

AB  - Many studies have documented the existence of genotype-environment interaction (GEI) for traits closely related to fitness in natural populations. A type of GEI that is commonly observed is changes in the fitness ranking of genetic groups (families, clones, or inbred lines) in different environments. We refer to such changes in ranking as crossing of reaction norms for fitness. A common interpretation of crossing of reaction norms for fitness is that selection favors different alleles in the different environments (i.e., that ''trade-offs'' exist). If this is the case, selection could maintain genetic variation, and even lead to reproductive isolation between subpopulations using different environments. Even if the stunt alleles are favored in every environment, however, deleterious mutations that vary in the magnitude of their effect depending on environment could cause reaction norms for fitness to cross. If deleterious mutations with environment-dependent effects are responsible for maintaining much of the Variation leading to crossing of reaction norms for fitness in natural populations, it should be possible to observe crossing of reaction norms for fitness among otherwise genetically identical lines bearing newly arisen spontaneous mutations. We examined the contribution of new mutations to GEI for fitness in Drosophila melanogaster. Eighteen lines were derived from a common, highly inbred base stock, and maintained at a population size of 10 pairs far over 200 generations, to allow them to accumulate spontaneous mutations. Because of the small population size of the lines, selection against mildly deleterious mutations should have been relatively ineffective. The lines were tested for productivity (number of surviving adult progeny from a standard number of parents) in five different environmental treatments, comprising different food media, temperatures, and levels of competition. The lines showed highly significant GEI for productivity, owing largely to considerable changes in ranking in the different environments. We conclude that mutations that are deleterious on average, but whose quantitative effects depend on environment, could be responsible for maintaining much of the Variation leading to crossing of reaction norms for fitness that has been observed in samples of D. melanogaster from the wild.

AB  - Knowledge of local adaptation and adaptive potential of natural populations is becoming increasingly relevant due to anthropogenic changes in the environment, such as climate change. The concern is that populations will be negatively affected by increasing temperatures without the capacity to adapt. Temperature-related adaptability in traits related to phenology and early life history are expected to be particularly important in salmonid fishes. We focused on the latter and investigated whether four populations of brown trout (Salmo trutta) are locally adapted in early life-history traits. These populations spawn in rivers that experience different temperature conditions during the time of incubation of eggs and embryos. They were reared in a common-garden experiment at three different temperatures. Quantitative genetic differentiation (Q(ST)) exceeded neutral molecular differentiation (F-ST) for two traits, indicating local adaptation. A temperature effect was observed for three traits. However, this effect varied among populations due to locally adapted reaction norms, corresponding to the temperature regimes experienced by the populations in their native environments. Additive genetic variance and heritable variation in phenotypic plasticity suggest that although increasing temperatures are likely to affect some populations negatively, they may have the potential to adapt to changing temperature regimes.

AB  - Predicting the impacts of climate change to biological systems requires an understanding of the ability for species to acclimate to the projected environmental change through phenotypic plasticity. Determining the effects of higher temperatures on individual performance is made more complex by the potential for environmental conditions experienced in previous and current generations to independently affect phenotypic responses to high temperatures. We used a model coral reef fish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus) to investigate the influence of thermal conditions experienced by two generations on reproductive output and the quality of offspring produced by adults. We found that more gradual warming over two generations, +1.5 degrees C in the first generation and then +3.0 degrees C in the second generation, resulted in greater plasticity of reproductive attributes, compared to fish that experienced the same increase in one generation. Reproduction ceased at the projected future summer temperature (31.5 degrees C) when fish experienced +3.0 degrees C for two generations. Additionally, we found that transgenerational plasticity to +1.5 degrees C induced full restoration of thermally affected reproductive and offspring attributes, which was not possible with developmental plasticity alone. Our results suggest that transgenerational effects differ depending on the absolute thermal change and in which life stage the thermal change is experienced.

AB  - Growth, onset of maturity and investment in reproduction are key traits for understanding variation in life-history strategies. Many environmental factors affect variation in these traits, but for fish, hypoxia and size-dependent mortality have become increasingly important because of human activities, such as increased nutrient enrichment (eutrophication), climate warming and selective fishing. Here, we study experimentally the effect of oxygen availability on maturation and growth in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from two different selected lines, one subjected to positive and the other negative size-dependent fishing. This is the first study to assess the effects of both reduced ambient oxygen and size-dependent mortality in fish. We show that reduced ambient oxygen led to stunting, early maturation and high reproductive investment. Likewise, lineages that had been exposed to high mortality of larger-sized individuals displayed earlier maturation at smaller size, greater investment in reproduction and faster growth. These life-history changes were particularly evident for males. The widely reported trends towards earlier maturation in wild fish populations are often interpreted as resulting from size-selective fishing. Our results highlight that reduced ambient oxygen, which has received little experimental investigation to date, can lead to similar phenotypic changes. Thus, changes in ambient oxygen levels can be a confounding factor that occurs in parallel with fishing, complicating the causal interpretation of changes in life-history traits. We believe that better disentangling of the effects of these two extrinsic factors, which increasingly affect many freshwater and marine ecosystems, is important for making more informed management decisions.

AB  - Although temperature is the most important environmental factor regulating arthropod development and reproduction, its influence on sex allocation in haplodiploid arthropods remains largely unexplored. We investigated under laboratory conditions how maternal age and temperature mediate offspring sex ratio of the spider mite Tetranychus mcdanieli (Acari: Tetranychidae). Over nine temperature regimes, female-biased sex ratios were consistently observed, varying from 57 to 87% among progeny produced over lifetime. Spider mite sex ratio was affected by maternal age: more male progeny were produced at both the beginning and the end of the female lifespan, yielding a dome shaped curvilinear relationship. This pattern of variation with age probably results from constraints on using sperm at young ages and sperm depletion or viability at older ages. We found a significant curvilinear relationship between temperature and sex ratio. The proportion of female offspring was lowest at intermediate temperatures and highest at extreme temperatures. We suggest that increased female-biased sex ratio at extreme temperatures is an evolutionary response of spider mites to deteriorating habitats as, in the Tetranychidae, females have better capacities than males to disperse and survive under harsh conditions.

AB  - Mounting research considers whether populations may adapt to global change based on additive genetic variance in fitness. Yet selection acts on phenotypes, not additive genetic variance alone, meaning that persistence and evolutionary potential in the near term, at least, may be influenced by other sources of fitness variation, including nonadditive genetic and maternal environmental effects. The fitness consequences of these effects, and their environmental sensitivity, are largely unknown. Here, applying a quantitative genetic breeding design to an ecologically important marine tubeworm, we examined nonadditive genetic and maternal environmental effects on fitness (larval survival) across three thermal environments. We found that these effects are nontrivial and environment dependent, explaining at least 44% of all parentally derived effects on survival at any temperature and 96% of parental effects at the most stressful temperature. Unlike maternal environmental effects, which manifested at the latter temperature only, nonadditive genetic effects were consistently significant and covaried positively across temperatures (i.e., parental combinations that enhanced survival at one temperature also enhanced survival at elevated temperatures). Thus, while nonadditive genetic and maternal environmental effects have long been neglected because their evolutionary consequences are complex, unpredictable, or seen as transient, we argue that they warrant further attention in a rapidly warming world.

AB  - Different hypotheses attempt to explain how different stages of organisms with complex life cycles respond to environmental changes. Most studies have focused at the among-species level showing similar responses to temperature throughout ontogeny. However, there is no agreement about the pattern expected at the intraspecific scale where a strong selective effect is expected. In this paper, we studied the effects of thermal treatments on a life history trait (developmental rate) and a physiological trait (metabolic rate) during development in the fruitfly Drosophila buzzatii. First, we estimated the rate of development during larval life (LDR) and the pupal stage (PDR) in flies derived from two natural populations exposed to several thermal treatments. Our results showed that the developmental rate ratio, LDR/PDR, did not vary between populations, and that the effects of thermal treatments were stage specific. Second, we studied the relationship between developmental rate (DR) and metabolic rate (MR) in each life cycle stage. We found that allometric relationships between DR and MR varied throughout ontogeny, a pattern that shed light on the mechanisms responsible for thermal plasticity. We conclude that, although different populations may show developmental rate isomorphy; larvae and pupae may choose alternative "decisions" in terms of life-history evolution and physiological traits when confronted to different thermal environments.

AB  - Polyandry, when females mate with more than one male, is theorised to play an important role in successful colonisation of new habitats. In addition to possible benefits from sexual selection, even mild polyandry could facilitate colonisation by protecting against inbreeding and reducing the costs of mating with incompatible or infertile males. Here, we measure the importance of mild polyandry for population viability and reproductive fitness following experimental founder events into a higher-temperature regime. Using colonisation experiments with the model beetleTribolium castaneum, in which females can produce offspring for up to 140 days following a single mating, we founded more than 100 replicate populations using single females that had been given the opportunity to mate with either one or two males and then tracked their subsequent population dynamics. Following population viability and fitness across 10 generations, we found that extinction rates were significantly lower in populations founded by females given polyandrous opportunities to mate with two males (9%) compared to populations founded by monogamous females (34%). In addition, populations founded by females that had been provided with opportunities to store sperm from two different males showed double the median productivity following colonisation compared to monogamous-founded populations. Notably, we identified short-term and longer-term benefits to post-colonisation populations from double-mating, with results suggesting that polyandry acts to both protect against mating with incompatible males through the founder event, and reduce inbreeding depression as the colonisation proceeds for 10 generations. Our results therefore show that even mild polyandry provides both reproductive and genetic benefits for colonising populations.

AB  - Temperature is one of the main environmental cues regulating seasonal plasticity in insects. Global climate change may lead to a change in the predictive value of temperature for seasonal conditions, potentially resulting in a mismatch of phenotypic form and environment. The afrotropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana shows striking seasonal plasticity for wing patterns and life history traits. This polyphenism is an adaptation to contrasting patterns of rainfall over wet and dry seasons, and is mainly determined by temperature. To investigate the extent of local adaptation of the developmental plasticity response to regional climate, we compared the thermal reaction norms for several life history traits and wing pattern of 2 distant populations from regions with different temperature-rainfall associations. We found little to no population differentiation for the life history traits, while wing pattern showed substantially more geographic variation. Broad-sense heritabilities and cross-environment correlations for wing pattern and 2 life history traits indicated a potential for adaptation of the plasticity response of these traits. Our results indicate that thermal plasticity of wing pattern can be population-specific; thus climate change may lead to a mismatch of wing pattern to seasonal environment. Traits that can be further modified by acclimation during the butterfly's adult life span (starvation resistance, resting metabolic rate and egg size) showed no geographic differentiation for their developmental plasticity. This indicates that for these traits, adult acclimation plays an important role in coping with local climate.

Immature M. raptor underwent development at 13degreesC, but not at 10, 5, or 0.5degreesC. Immature M. zaraptor and T sarcophagae did not develop at temperatures ranging from 0.5 to 13degreesC. Parasitoid survival varied among storage temperatures and was lowest at 0.5degreesC for M. raptor and M. zaraptor and highest at 10degreesC. Survival of T.sarcophagae was highest at 5degreesC and was higher than either species of Muscidifurax at temperatures less than or equal to5degreesC. M. raptor had the highest survival at 10 and 13degreesC. A simple model was used to examine the effects of cold storage and stockpiling parasitoids for tip to three generations on parasitoid availability. Storage of M. raptor at 10degreesC for three generations could result in a 3.5-fold increase in availability. Storage of M, zaraptor at 10degreesC could result in a 2.6-fold increase in availability, and storage of T sarcophagae at 5degreesC could result in a 3.2-fold increase in availability. Results suggest that cold storage could be a useful method for increasing the rearing efficiency of these parasitoids.

AB  - Latitudinal variation in life-history traits is often explained by phenotypically plastic responses or local adaptations to different thermal regimes. We compared growth, maturation schedules and reproductive investment of female sole Solea solea between 8 populations, covering much of the species' distribution in northern Europe, with respect to thermal gradients. An energy allocation model was fitted to size-age data, and probabilistic maturation reaction norms were estimated from size-age-maturity data. We found that northern populations from colder environments had higher rates of energy acquisition and reproductive investment, an intrinsic tendency to mature earlier, and had smaller asymptotic sizes than southern populations from warmer environments. Consequently, growth rate was higher before maturation but lower after maturation in the north compared to the south. This is opposite to Bergmann's rule according to which slower growth, delayed maturation and larger asymptotic sizes are usually observed at lower temperatures. The observed patterns could indicate strong countergradient thermal adaptation for rapid growth and development as well as sustained fecundity in the north, or indicate a response to other selection pressures correlated with the thermal gradient. Potentially higher mortality in northern populations during cold winters might be one of the key drivers of the observed geographical variation in growth and maturation of sole.

AB  - Differences in thermal tolerance during embryonic development in Fraser River sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka were examined among nine populations in a controlled common-garden incubation experiment. Forcing embryonic development at an extreme temperature (relative to current values) of 16 degrees C, representing a future climate change scenario, significantly reduced survival compared to the more ecologically moderate temperature of 10 degrees C (55% v. 93%). Survival at 14 degrees C was intermediate between the other two temperatures (85%). More importantly, this survival response varied by provenance within and between temperature treatments. Thermal reaction norms showed an interacting response of genotype and environment (temperature), suggesting that populations of O. nerka may have adapted differentially to elevated temperatures during incubation and early development. Moreover, populations that historically experience warmer incubation temperatures at early development displayed a higher tolerance for warm temperatures. In contrast, thermal tolerance does not appear to transcend life stages as adult migration temperatures were not related to embryo thermal tolerance. The intra-population variation implies potential for thermal tolerance at the species level. The differential inter-population variation in thermal tolerance that was observed suggests, however, limited adaptive potential to thermal shifts for some populations. This infers that the intergenerational effects of increasing water temperatures may affect populations differentially, and that such thermally mediated adaptive selection may drive population, and therefore species, persistence.

AB  - Maternal photoperiodic response is known to influence the percentage of diapausing prepupae in Trichogramma species. However, the influence of several preceding generations has not yet been studied. We have investigated the stability of photoperiod-induced changes in multiple generations of Trichogramma buesi Voegele and Trichogramma principium Sug. et Sor. Short-day conditions during preimaginal development induced an increase in the percentage of diapausing progeny and grand progeny of both Trichogramma species. A similar trend was also detected in the fourth and fifth generations, but the response was weak although statistically significant. This grand-grandmaternal photoperiodic effect (which has not been demonstrated before for Trichogramma or for any other insect parasitoid) is most probably based on the transgenerational transmission of variations in DNA expression. We conclude that in mass rearing, to facilitate diapause induction before cold storage, it is advisable to rear both maternal and grandmaternal generations under the short-day conditions. In scientific studies, several generations preceding the experiment should be kept under equal conditions to exclude multigenerational maternal effects.

AB  - Understanding pest population dynamics and seasonal phenology is a critical component of modern integrated pest-management programs. Accurate forecasting allows timely, cost-effective interventions, including maximum efficacy of, for example, biological control and/or sterile insect technique. Due to the variation in life stage-related sensitivity toward climate, insect pest population abundance models are often not easily interpreted or lack direct relevance to management strategies in the field. I sere we apply a process-based (biophysical) model that incorporates climate data with life stage-dependent physiology and life history to attempt to predict Eldana saccharina life stage and generation turnover in sugarcane fields. Fitness traits are modelled at two agricultural locations in South Africa that differ in average temperature (hereafter a cold and a warm site). We test whether the life stage population structures in the field entering winter and local climate during winter directly affect development rates, and therefore interact to determine the population dynamics and phenological responses of E. saccharina in subsequent spring and summer seasons. The model predicts that: (1) E. saccharina can cycle through more generations at the warm site where fewer hours of cold and heat stress are endured, and (2) at the cold site, overwintering as pupae (rather than larvae) confer higher relative fitness and fecundity in the subsequent summer adult moths. The model predictions were compa red with a large dataset of field observations from scouting records. Model predictions for larval presence (or absence) generally overlapped well with positive (or negative) scout records. These results are important for integrated pest management strategies by providing a useful foundation for future population dynamics models, and are applicable to a variety of agricultural landscapes, but especially the sugarcane industry of South Africa.

AB  - As a pest, in order to complete its life history and reproduces effectively, soybean cyst nematode (SCN) (Heterodera glycines lchinche 1952) must adapt to various environments and conditions for long periods of evolution. The nematode is widely dispersed year after year. Controlling this pest requires understanding characters and adaptability of SCN. Effects of abiotic factors, such as temperature, soil humidity, agrotype, pH value, ions, plant exudates, agricultural chemical and cultivation systems on SCN, are reviewed in this paper. The results show that SCN is able to endure various environmental stresses, especially low temperature. Because of its special life history, cyst stage help SCN over winter, resistance of SCN to environmental stress is strong. A few studies have reported the mechanism of SCN environmental adaptability. We emphasized the importance of studying environmental adaptability of SCN, which would benefit the control of SCN by ecological means.

AB  - Water loss rate, percentage total body water content (%TBW), cuticular permeability (CP), and desiccation tolerance were investigated in adult and immature stages of the invasive kudzu bug, Megacopta cribraria (Fab.) (Hemiptera: Plataspidae), a serious soybean pest and an urban nuisance. Adults and all five nymphal instars were weighed prior to and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 h after desiccated at 30 +/- 1 degrees C and 0-2% RH. Both % initial mass and %TBW loss increased linearly with time of desiccation. Rates of loss ranged from approximately 1-7%/h. Mortality occurred at 10 h after desiccation. Desiccation tolerance (%TBW lost at death) ranged between 25.6% for first-generation adult females and 75% for first-generation fifth-instar nymphs. First-generation first-instar nymphs had significantly greater %TBW (88.9%) than the other generations and instars, whereas second-generation fifth instars had the lowest %TBW (62.4%). The CP value of first-generation adult females (12.3 +/- 1.6 mu g cm(-1) h(-1) mmHg(-1)) was the greatest across generations. First-generation first instars had the greatest mass loss (111.11 mg/g) among all instars and generations, whereas overwintered second-generation adult females had the lowest mass loss (18.39) across generations.This study demonstrated that desiccation stress differentially affected the survival of adult and nymphal kudzu bugs and may imply that environmental stress can affect the relative abundance of this species in the fields and around homes.

AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are emerging as a severe stressor in marine ecosystems. Extreme warm sea surface temperatures during MHWs often exceed the optimal thermal range for more than one generation of tropical coastal zooplankton. However, it is relatively unknown whether transgenerational plasticity (TGP) to MHWs may shape the offspring's fitness, particularly in an ecologically relevant context with biotic interactions such as predation stress. We addressed these novel research questions by determining the survival, reproductive success, and grazing rate of the copepod Pseudodiaptomus incisus exposed to MHW and fish predator cues (FPC) for two generations (F1 and F2). The experiment was designed in a full orthogonal manner with 4 treatments in F1 and 16 treatments in F2 generation. In both generations, MHW reduced P. incisus survival, reproductive parameters, and grazing by 10%-62% in MHW, but these parameters increased by 2%-15% with exposure to FPC, particularly at control temperature. F2 reproductive success and grazing rate as indicated by cumulative fecal pellets were reduced by 20%-30% in F1-MHW, but increased by similar to 2% in F1-FPC. Strikingly, MHW exposure reduced 17%-18% survival, but transgenerational exposure to MHWs fully ameliorated its lethal effect and this transgenerational effect was independent of FPC. Increased survival came with a cost of reduced reproductive success, constrained by reduced grazing. The rapid transgenerational MHW acclimation and its associated costs are likely widespread and crucial mechanisms underlying the resilience of coastal tropical zooplankton to MHWs in tropical coastal marine ecosystems.

AB  - In forest trees, environmental conditions during reproduction can greatly influence progeny performance. This phenomenon probably results from adaptive phenotypic plasticity but also may be associated with genotypic selection. In order to determine whether selective effects during the reproduction are environment specific, single pair-crosses of Norway spruce were studied in two contrasted maternal environments (warm and cold conditions). One family expressed large and the other small phenotypic differences between these crossing environments. The inheritance of genetic polymorphism was analysed at the seed stage. Four parental genetic maps covering 66 to 78% of the genome were constructed using 190 to 200 loci. After correcting for multiple testing, there is no evidence of locus under strong and repeatable selection. The maternal environment could thus only induce limited genotypic-selection effects during reproductive steps, and performance of progenies may be mainly affected by a long-lasting epigenetic memory regulated by temperature and photoperiod prevailing during seed production.

AB  - Pigmentation of the hair, skin, cuticle, feather and eye is one of the most salient and variable attributes of vertebrates. In many species, melanin-based coloration is found to be pleiotropically linked to behavior. We review animal studies that have found darker pigmented individuals average higher amounts of aggression and sexual activity than lighter pigmented individuals. We hypothesize that similar relationships between pigmentation, aggression, and sexuality occur in humans. We first review the literature on non-human animals and then review some of the correlates of melanin in people, including aggression and sexual activity. Both within human populations (e.g., siblings), and between populations (e.g., races, nations, states), studies find that darker pigmented people average higher levels of aggression and sexual activity (and also lower IQ). We conceptualize skin color as a multigenerational adaptation to differences in climate over the last 70,000 years as a result of "cold winters theory" and the "Out-of-Africa" model of human origins. We propose life history theory to explain the covariation found between human (and non-human) pigmentation and variables such as birth rate, infant mortality, longevity, rate of HIV/AIDS, and violent crime.

AB  - The effects of intraspecific and interspecific competition were studied experimentally in Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) and Sitophilus zeamais (Motsch.) in order to predict the outcome of competition. The replacement series (substitutive) approach was used to qualitatively predict the outcome of competitive interactions between the two species bred at 25 and 30-degrees-C on loose maize. The reproduction curves of S. zeamais and P. truncatus were of the ''scramble'' type (humped), though different in form. Both species were adversely affected by competitive interactions. The intensity of competition was dependent on the density of parent populations and temperature. S. zeamais was the dominant competitor at 25-degrees-C and had a significant suppressant effect on P. truncatus at this temperature. This study predicts that S. zeamais would outcompete P. truncatus on loose maize at 25-degrees-C. However, the predictions on the outcome of competition after one generation were uncertain at 30-degrees-C.

AB  - The Bdelloidea rotifer, a kind of asexually microscopic invertebrate, is the largest Metazoan group that reproduces only through parthenogenesis. Here the potential evolutionary species composition was analyzed using a coalescent approach to infer independently evolving entities from a phylogenetic tree obtained from cytochrome oxidase I sequences. Three clones (HX4, HX8 and HX19) of Bdelloidea Rotaria rotatoria were selected to be the representatives of three sympatric putative cryptic taxa for detecting the effects of temperature (24, 28 and 32 ?) on their life history traits. The results showed that the responses of life table parameters to increasing temperature were different among the three evolving entities. Evolutionary species, temperatures and their interaction significantly affected all life history parameters except that evolutionary species did not significantly affect the durations of post-reproductive period and mean lifespan. In addition, the interaction of evolutionary species and temperatures did not significantly affect the durations of post-reproductive period, offspring production or net reproductive rate. No matter what the evolutionary species was, the age-specific survival curves tended to decrease earlier and more quickly, and the peak of age-specific fecundity curves appeared earlier with increasing temperature. The three potential cryptic R. rotatoria taxa adopted variable life history strategies, low reproduction and high survivorship at low temperature, as well as high reproduction and low survivorship at high temperature. The similar adaptation abilities of HX4, HX8 and HX19 to water temperatures could be the best explanation for their coexistence in the subtropical shallow pond at a high temperature.

AB  - The level of HSP70 expression induced by a non-lethal high temperature was examined in lines selected for increased thermal resistance and in corresponding control lines of Drosophila buzzatii, in order to test if selection for high temperature resistance leads to an increased level of HSP70 expression. The lines used were selected for up to 64 generations either as adults or through all larval stages. In adult selection lines, hard selection was implemented every second generation after mild heat hardening. In larval selection lines, larvae were exposed each generation to laboratory "natural" selection. Generally lines selected as adults showed a higher HSP70 expression than did controls, both in third instar larvae and in adults. A strong negative response to selection of HSP70 expression was found in all lines that were selected at cycling temperatures during larval development. The: results suggests that a trade off between heat resistance in form of HSP70 expression and fecundity/fertility lire responsible For the level of HSP70 expression. The effect of the different methods of selection on HSP70 expression suggests that heat resistance constitutes more than one trait.

AB  - Early generations of hybrids can express both genetic incompatibilities and phenotypic novelty. Insights into whether these conflicting interactions between intrinsic and extrinsic selection persist after a few generations of recombination require experimental studies. To address this question, we use interpopulation crosses and recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of the copepod Tigriopus californicus, and focus on two traits that are relevant for the diversification of this species: survivorship during development and tolerance to thermal stress. Experimental crosses between two population pairs show that most RILs between two heat-tolerant populations show enhanced tolerance to temperatures that are lethal to the respective parentals, whereas RILs between a heat-tolerant and a heat-sensitive population are intermediate. Although interpopulation crosses are affected by intrinsic selection at early generational hybrids, most of the sampled F-9 RILs have recovered fitness to the level of their parentals. Together, these results suggest that a few generations of recombination allows for an independent segregation of the genes underlying thermal tolerance and cytonuclear incompatibilities, permitting certain recombinant lineages to survive in niches previously unused by parental taxa (i.e., warmer thermal environments) without incurring intrinsic selection.

AB  - Oncorhynchus mykiss exhibit high plasticity in their life history patterns. Individual life history decisions are hypothesized to result from genetic thresholds shaped by local adaptation, with variation in environmental factors influencing the trajectories of growth and condition (e.g., Fulton's K, lipid content). We compared growth rates and life history patterns in two coastal creeks (Scott and Soquel) and two Central Valley (CV) rivers (American and Mokelumne) in California. The two regions differed markedly in habitat and physical factors, including hydrograph timing and amplitude, temperature regime, and food availability (measured as drift). Growth rates of coastal age-0 fish averaged 0.1 mm/d in summer-fall and 0.2 mm/d in winter-spring. Growth rates of CV fish were up to 10 times faster than those of fish on the coast and had the opposite seasonal pattern, in which growth in summer-fall was faster than that in winter-spring. Fish growth also differed between CV rivers; the mean growth rates were 1.0 mm/d in summer-fall and 0.7 mm/d in winter-spring among American River fish and 0.7 mm/d in summer-fall and 0.5 mm/d in winter-spring among Mokelumne River fish. The life history expression and age structures of O. mykiss in the coastal creeks were similar, with populations being dominated by age-0 fish but including mature residents up to age 6. The two CV populations were strikingly different in life history expression. In the American River, a single cohort was present and nearly all fish emigrated in the spring following their birth year. In the Mokelumne River, a broad diversity of ages (up to 4 years) was present, with a large proportion of presumed residents. The observed variation in life histories aligned with predictions based on state-dependent life history models developed for the four streams, further demonstrating the adaptability of O. mykiss to contrasting rearing environments.

AB  - The thermal biology of ectotherms is often used to infer species' responses to changes in temperature. It is often proposed that temperate species are more cold-tolerant, less heat-tolerant, more plastic, have broader thermal performance curves (TPCs) and lower optimal temperatures when compared to tropical species. However, relatively little empirical work has provided support for this using large interspecific studies. In the present study, we measure thermal tolerance limits and thermal performance in 22 species of Drosophila that developed under common conditions. Specifically, we measure thermal tolerance (CTmin and CTmax) as well as the fitness components viability, developmental speed and fecundity at seven temperatures to construct TPCs for each of these species. For 10 of the species, we also measure thermal tolerance and thermal performance following developmental acclimation to three additional temperatures. Using these data, we test several fundamental hypotheses about the evolution and plasticity of heat and cold resistance and thermal performance. We find that cold tolerance (CTmin) varied between the species according to the environmental temperature in the habitat from which they originated. These data support the idea that the evolution of cold tolerance has allowed species to persist in colder environments. However, contrary to expectation, we find that optimal temperature (T-opt) and the breadth of thermal performance (T-breadth) are similar in temperate, widespread and tropical species and we also find that the plasticity of TPCs was constrained. We suggest that the temperature range for optimal thermal performance is either fixed or under selection by the more similar temperatures that prevail during growing seasons. As a consequence, we find that T-opt and T-breadth are of limited value for predicting past, present and future distributions of species.

AB  - How evolution may mitigate the effects of global warming and pesticide exposure on predator-prey interactions is directly relevant for vector control. Using a space-for-time substitution approach, we addressed how 4 degrees C warming and exposure to the pesticide endosulfan shape the predation on Culex pipiens mosquitoes by damselfly predators from replicated low-and high-latitude populations. Although warming was only lethal for the mosquitoes, it reduced predation rates on these prey. Possibly, under warming escape speeds of the mosquitoes increased more than the attack efficiency of the predators. Endosulfan imposed mortality and induced behavioral changes (including increased filtering and thrashing and a positional shift away from the bottom) in mosquito larvae. Although the pesticide was only lethal for the mosquitoes, it reduced predation rates by the low-latitude predators. This can be explained by the combination of the evolution of a faster life history and associated higher vulnerabilities to the pesticide (in terms of growth rate and lowered foraging activity) in the low-latitude predators and pesticide-induced survival selection in the mosquitoes. Our results suggest that predation rates on mosquitoes at the high latitude will be reduced under warming unless predators evolve toward the current low-latitude phenotype or low-latitude predators move poleward.

AB  - Productivity of forest tree plantations can be maximized by matching genetically adapted planting stock to environments where they perform best. We used multivariate regression tree (MRT) analysis with environmental predictors to quantify and characterize the nature of genotype by environment interactions (G x E) of radiata pine diameter at breast height (DBH) grown in New Zealand. The analysis was carried out for 21 provenance trials, and 48 progeny trials of second-generation selections that are widely used in plantation forestry today. To quantify the maximum variance explained by G x E, we used unconstrained clustering of genotypes based on their performance across all sites. Subsequently, the clustering was constrained by climate and soil variables, i.e. the putative causes for G x E. Unconstrained clustering explained 62% and 58% of the observed G x E variance in provenance and progeny trials, respectively. Constrained clustering explained approximately 50% and 25% of the G x E variance in provenance and progeny trials, respectively. Minimum temperature was identified as an important driver of G x E in both provenance and progeny trials. Environments can be grouped into warm humid sites, where most second-generation selected genotypes performed better, and cold sites, where specific genotypes performed best. Based on the progeny trials, only marginal (ca. 3%) gains can be made by targeted deployment to warm humid sites, but more substantial (approx. 20%) genetic gain can be made on cold sites, compared to current deployment strategies.

AB  - We offer the thesis that environmental physiologists and evolutionary biologists can find fertile common ground in the study of how individual variation in physiological phenotypes originates and develops. The sources of such individual variation are often complex; the consequences affect how natural selection will act on a suite of traits, of which some may seem, at first glance, far removed from the usual domain of environmental physiology, We illustrate our thesis In two ways. First, we offer two examples drawn from studies of thermal tolerance in the poeciliid fish Heterandria formosa, We show how fitness variation can be a complex function of the gestational temperature and ther mal tolerance and how these effects can produce environmentally induced variation among populations in thermal tolerance that mimics a pattern of adaptive variation, Second, we review two case studies that illuminate how environmental effects on a multivariate phenotype can channel the action of natural selection. The phenotypic plasticity of male life history in Poecilia latipinna in response to temperature embraces a spectrum of traits; the effects of each one upon fitness will influence the ability of selection to mold the response of any one of them to temperature. The phenotypic covariances in thermal tolerance and life-history traits in Heterandria formosa differ slightly between populations from different parts of the species range, apparently because of differences between them in thermal sensitivity; this difference insures that the multivariate nature of selection will be correspondingly different in those different populations.

AB  - The Colorado potato beetle (CPB), a serious pest of potato, is currently spreading north in Europe. We investigated the risk of CPB establishment in Finland and control methods for the case when beetle life history characters change due to global warming or as an adaptation to colder climate. Analysis with a spatially explicit simulation model supported the current management policy in Finland (efficient eradication and one year field quarantine) but changes in CPB viability, such as decreased winter mortality or increased number of offspring would render them inefficient. Longer quarantine times would be needed to effectively prevent the CPB establishment and spread. As an option we investigated Bt-potato cultivation integrated to other control methods and found that it was already efficient when used as a sole strategy but its benefits may be reduced by the adaptability of the Colorado potato beetle.

AB  - 1. Thermal tolerance influences the distribution and abundance of many species, but the adaptive capacity of species to increase upper thermal tolerance is poorly understood. Given that patterns of heat tolerance can strongly depend on assay method, it is crucial to get a better understanding of genetic variances and correlations among different heat tolerance components.
   2. This study tests for correlated responses in different heat tolerance assays in Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for increased heat tolerance following exposure to a static high temperature. Traits tested included heat tolerance measured under static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays (using different starting temperatures and ramping rates), with lines exposed to fluctuating conditions (3days of a cycling temperature regime) and a variable food treatment.
   3. Selected lines had higher heat tolerance than control lines in all static and ramping assays. The upper thermal tolerance was up to 0.5 degrees C higher in the selected compared to control lines after ten generations of strong selection.
   4. Selection using a static assay therefore leads to correlated responses in other heat-resistant components, suggesting that traits are genetically correlated and not influenced strongly by assay conditions.
   5. While the D.melanogaster population we studied harboured additive genetic variation to evolve increased upper thermal tolerance, the level detected may be insufficient to keep up with temperature increases predicted under climate change.

AB  - Hybridization within the animal kingdom has long been underestimated. Hybrids have often been considered less fit than their parental species. In the present study, we observed that the Daphnia community of a small lake was dominated by a single D. galeata x D. longispina hybrid clone, during two consecutive years. Notably, in artificial community set-ups consisting of several clones representing parental species and other hybrids, this hybrid clone took over within about ten generations. Neither the fitness assay conducted under different temperatures, or under crowded and non-crowded environments, nor the carrying capacity test revealed any outstanding life history parameters of this hybrid clone. However, under simulated winter conditions (i.e. low temperature, food and light), the hybrid clone eventually showed a higher survival probability and higher fecundity compared to parental species. Hybrid superiority in cold-adapted traits leading to an advantage of overwintering as parthenogenetic lineages might consequently explain the establishment of successful hybrids in natural communities of the D. longispina complex. In extreme cases, like the one reported here, a superior hybrid genotype might be the only clone alive after cold winters. Overall, superiority traits, such as enhanced overwintering here, might explain hybrid dominance in nature, especially in extreme and rapidly changing environments. Although any favoured gene complex in cyclic parthenogens could be frozen in successful clones independent of hybridization, we did not find similarly successful clones among parental species. We conclude that the emergence of the observed trait is linked to the production of novel recombined hybrid genotypes.

AB  - Ocean acidification is an altering marine carbonate chemistry resulting in potential effects to marine life. In this study, we determine the effects of decreased pH on the morphology, growth, and survival of juvenile blue king crab, Paralithodes platypus. Crabs were reared at three pH levels: ambient (control, pH similar to 8.1), pH 7.8, and pH 7.5, for 1 year and monitored for morphological changes, survival, and growth. Exposure to seawater at pH 7.8 had no effect on morphology or mortality and had only a minor effect on growth compared with the ambient treatment. However, exposure to seawater at pH 7.5 substantially increased mortality and decreased growth compared with the ambient treatment. The best fit model of mortality rate at pH 7.5 showed an initially high mortality rate, which dropped to become comparable to the mortality rate in the other treatments. This suggests phenotypic variability or plasticity in juveniles and may indicate acclimation by blue king crab to ocean acidification. As such, blue king crab may have scope for evolutionary adaptation in response to gradually changing pH levels. However, effects on other life-history stages, sub-lethal effects, carryover or transgenerational effects, and interactions with other stressors, such as increased temperature, still need to be investigated.

AB  - We used bacteria to study experimentally the process of genetic adaptation to environmental temperature. Replicate lines of Escherichia coli, founded from a common ancestor, were propagated for 2,000 generations in 4 different thermal regimes as 4 experimental groups: constant 32, 37, or 42-degrees-C (thermal specialists), or a daily alternation between 32 and 42-degrees-C (32/42-degrees-C: thermal generalists). The ancestor had previously been propagated at 37-degrees-C for 2,000 generations. Adaptation of the groups to temperature was measured by improvement in fitness relative to the ancestor, as estimated by competition experiments. All four experimental groups showed improved relative fitness in their own thermal environment (direct response of fitness). However, rates of fitness improvement varied greatly among temperature groups. The 42-degrees-C group responded most rapidly and extensively, followed by the 32 and 32/42-degrees-C groups, whose fitness improvements were indistinguishable. The 37-degrees-C group, which experienced the ancestral temperature, had the slowest and least extensive fitness improvement. The correlated fitness responses of each group, again relative to the common ancestor, were measured over the entire experimental range of temperatures. No necessary tradeoff between direct and correlated responses of fitness was apparent: for example, the improved fitness of the 42-degrees-C group at 42-degrees-C was not accompanied by a loss of fitness at 37-degrees-C or 32-degrees-C. However, the direct fitness responses were usually greater than the correlated responses, judged both by comparing direct and correlated responses of a single group at different temperatures and by comparing direct and correlated responses of different groups at a single temperature. These comparisons indicate that the observed adaptation was, in fact, largely temperature specific. Also, the fitness responses of the generalist group across a range of temperatures were less variable than those of the thermal specialist groups considered as whole.

AB  - The evolutionary potential of any given population is of fundamental importance for its longer term prospects. Modern land-use practices often result in small and isolated populations, increasing the risk of extinction through reduced genetic diversity as a consequence of inbreeding or drift. Such genetic erosion may also interfere with a population's evolutionary potential. In this study, we investigate the consequences of inbreeding on evolutionary potential (the ability to increase cold resistance) in a laboratory population of the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana. To explore constraints on evolution, we applied artificial selection to chill-coma recovery time, starting from three levels of inbreeding (outbred control, one or two full-sibling matings). Ten generations of selection produced highly divergent phenotypes, with the lines selected for increased cold tolerance showing about 28% shorter recovery times after cold exposure relative to unselected controls. Correlated responses to selection in 10 different life-history and stress-resistance traits were essentially absent. Inbred lines showed a weaker response to selection, indicating reduced evolutionary potential and thereby constraints on evolution. Inbreeding depression was still measurable in some traits after the course of selection. Traits more closely related to fitness showed a clear fitness rebound, suggesting a trait-specific impact of purging. Our findings have important implications for the longer term survival of small populations in fragmented landscapes.

AB  - This article attempts to highlight the technical and economical issues related to decentralized power generation in India using biomass gasification. Biomass-based energy has several distinct advantages such as wide availability and uniform distribution that puts it ahead among the renewable energy options for India. The estimated potential of power generation through renewable sources in India is 85 GW with biomass power contributing approximately 20 GW. Especially, in the remote areas and hilly terrains of India, biomass gasification-based power generation offers a highly viable solution for meeting energy demands of small villages and hamlets, which would not only make them independent but will also reduce burden on state electricity boards. This paper reviews various technical options for biomass gasification-based low-, medium- and large-scale power generation. We essentially discuss the merits and demerits (operational and other problems) of different systems. Further, we also deal with economics of these systems and discuss principal factors influencing the viability of the biomass-based power generation. Finally, we review some case studies of biomass-based power generation for meeting energy needs, both thermal and electrical. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - California red scale (CRS) parasitoids of 121 citrus groves belonging to three different Mediterranean-climate ecosystems (inland, coastal and subtropical) of eastern Spain were used as a model to study the effects of climate on composition and distribution of parasitoid communities. Then we evaluate the success of a biocontrol program based on releases of three new CRS parasitoid species. Field surveys were complemented by laboratory trials under simulated common and extreme climate conditions (15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C combined with 25%, 45% and 65% RH) to know parasitoid's life-history traits. In the inland area Aphytis melinus was the only parasitoid present, in the coastal it coexisted with Aphytis chrysomphali and in the subtropical also with Encarsia perniciosi. Comperiella bifasciata established in all inland groves where it was released whereas E. perniciosi and Aphytis lingnanensis only in the groves within the subtropical agroecosystem. In the laboratory, the highest intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) values for C. bifasciata and E. perniciosi were reached at temperature-humidity regimes typical from inland and subtropical areas respectively. The longevity of both species at different temperature-humidity conditions also reflected their adaptability to dry or humid areas. Our results with CRS endoparasitoids, together with previous studies on Aphytis species, demonstrate the validity of r(m) analysis at different extreme temperature-humidity combinations to predict the potential areas of distribution of newly introduced organisms. Slight differences in average winter and summer temperatures or relative humidity between neighbor agroecosystems caused large variation in species composition and introduction success ratio.

AB  - Whiteflies (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) are important insect pests causing serious damage to plants and transmitting hundreds of plant viruses. Climate change is expected to influence life history and trophic interactions among plants, whiteflies and their natural enemies. Here, we review the potential impacts of climate change on whiteflies and the likely consequences for agricultural systems. This review concludes that while climatic stress tends to negatively affect life history traits, the effects differ with the tolerance of the whiteflies and the amount of stress experienced. Whiteflies also differ in their adaptability. Better adapted species will likely experience increased distribution and abundance provided their tolerance limits are not exceeded, while species with lower tolerance and adaptation limits will suffer reduced fitness, which will have overall effects on their distribution and abundance in space and time. The majority of methods used to control whiteflies will still be useful especially if complementary methods are combined for maximum efficacy. Parasitism and predation rates of whitefly natural enemies could increase with temperature within the optimum ranges of the natural enemies, although life history traits and population growth potential are generally maximised below 30 degrees C. Changes in climatic suitability modifying the distribution and abundance of whiteflies, and environmental suitability for plant viruses, will likely affect epidemics of viral diseases. Greater efforts are required to improve understanding of the complex effects of climate change on multi-species and multi-trophic interactions in the agro-ecological systems inhabited by whiteflies, and to use this new knowledge to develop robust and climate-smart management strategies.

AB  - This work presents a design for Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy (HRE), for off grid power generation for remote riverine regions in developing nations. The uniqueness of this technique for power generation using streams and other marine currents to generate electric energy is detailed. The problem of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, rapid increase in human population, industries, modernization and our lifestyle put immense pressure on most power generation plants and infrastructures. Thus, global warming and carbon footprints of using fossil fuels to generate energy has driven the interest for energy generation from renewable sources. The Upper River Benue and Lower River Niger coastal basins, as well as the River Niger Basin on the Lower Niger sub-basin area of southeastern Nigeria was selected as a case study for the design of the hydrokinetic power generation technology. The results show that for a hydrokinetic turbine the level of power output is directly proportional to the flow velocity. Therefore the cost of its installation is reduced drastically from about $7,900 per installed kW to about $2,500 per kW, is easily assessable, less technical and a familiar motor technology for most of these communities. It is also a predictable form of energy in comparison to other emerging renewable energy fields like wind, solar and wave. Also this form of renewable energy is less harmful to the environment, has a lower noise emission and produces no greenhouse gases or any solid waste. HRE will bring energy security that is essential for the riverine dweller and curb rural urban migration and both improves the rural communities' standard of living and enhances their productivity.

AB  - Anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are vulnerable to climate change in both freshwater and marine habitats. I use a qualitative model to assess the cumulative effects of climate change across life stages and generations of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and other salmon species. The effects of climate change most relevant to Fraser River sockeye include warming of freshwater and marine habitats, altered hydrology in spawning rivers, reduced productivity in nursery habitats, and changed distribution and phenology of predator and prey species. The weight of evidence indicates that these changes will negatively affect growth and survival of Fraser River sockeye at all life stages. Effects on one life stage will also carry forward to heighten adverse effects at subsequent life stages and across generations so that the cumulative impact is greater than the impact on individual stages. Salmon can adapt to climate change but probably not enough to sustain productivity. In the south, focus of policy and management on conserving and enhancing resilience is needed to retain some salmon production. At the same time, Arctic habitats are becoming accessible to salmon. Management in the Arctic should protect potentially productive habitats from development and facilitate their colonization by Pacific salmon.

FX  - I began assembling the ideas for this paper more than 15 years ago while conducting research on the bioenergetics of salmon migration and reproduction. The early ideas have benefited considerably from discussion with colleagues, particularly Mike Henderson, Scott Hinch, and Tony Farrell, and from feedback at seminar presentations. At the same time, the effects of climate change have become better understood and the paper's conclusions more firmly supported. The research for the paper was supported in part by discovery and strategic grants to Michael Healey from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

AB  - The possible associations between longevity, early fecundity, and stress-resistance traits were explored using artificial selection on longevity in a laboratory population of Drosophila buzzatii. Three replicated lines were selected for increased lifespan (L lines) and compared with the respective unselected controls (C lines) after the 14th generation of selection. Mean longevity exhibited a significant response to selection. The baseline mortality tended to decrease in the L lines and a negative correlated response to longevity selection was found for early fecundity. Egg-to-adult developmental time increased in L lines. Longevity selection increased stress resistance for both high and low temperatures, as measured by heat knockdown resistance and chill-coma recovery. Starvation resistance also tended to be higher in L than in C lines. The results obtained are consistent with the hypothesis of trade-offs between longevity and early fecundity, and also suggest a trade-off association between adult longevity and developmental time. Correlated selection responses were generally consistent with correlations among the traits previously inferred from altitudinal clines for longevity and stress-resistance phenotypes.

AB  - 1. Features of life history strategies of Antarctic terrestrial invertebrates are reviewed and compared with the predictions of two widely-used general life history models.
   2. Many Features observed are consistent with the predictions of "adversity-" or "stress-selected" life histories, although "ruderal" characteristics are also observed.
   3. Many features are plesiotypic for the taxonomic groups concerned, suggesting a lack of evolved adaptations within the Antarctic biota.
   4. A large degree of flexibility is found in the life histories; this flexibility itself may allow passage of environmentally-imposed selective filters limiting colonisation and development in isolated and extreme terrestrial habitats.
   5. In general. Antarctic terrestrial invertebrates may be regarded as pre-adapted for survival of the various stresses imposed by their extreme environment. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using half-sib analysis, we analysed the consequences of extreme rearing temperatures on genetic and phenotypic variations in the morphological and life-history traits of Drosophila ananassae. Paternal half-sib covariance contains a relatively small proportion of the epistatic variance and lacks the dominance variance and variance due to maternal effect, which provides more reliable estimates of additive genetic variance. Experiments were performed on a mass culture population of D. ananassae collected from Kanniyakumari (India). Two extremely stressful temperatures (18A degrees C and 32A degrees C) and one standard temperature (25A degrees C) were used to examine the effect of stressful and non-stressful environments on the morphological and life-history traits in males and females. Mean values of various morphological traits differed significantly among different temperature regimens in both males and females. Rearing at 18A degrees C and 32A degrees C resulted in decreased thorax length, wing-to-thorax (w/t) ratio, sternopleural bristle number, ovariole number, sex comb-tooth number and testis length. Phenotypic variances increased under stressful temperatures in comparison with non-stressful temperatures. Heritability and evolvability based on among-sires (males), among-dams (females), and the sum of the two components (sire + dam) showed higher values at both the stressful temperatures than at the non-stressful temperature. These differences reflect changes in additive genetic variance. Viability was greater at the high than the low extreme temperature. As viability is an indicator of stress, we can assume that stress was greater at 18A degrees C than at 32A degrees C in D. ananassae. The genetic variations for all the quantitative and life-history traits were higher at low temperature. Variation in sexual traits was more pronounced as compared with other morphometric traits, which shows that sexual traits are more prone to thermal stress. Our results agree with the hypothesis that genetic variation is increased in stressful environments.

AB  - Animals actively select the most suitable habitat in terms of fitness, much of which is mediated by temperature. We reconstructed population abundance, oxygen isotope and temperature chronologies for the Icelandic and the Northeast Arctic (NEA) cod (Gallus morhua) populations to determine if their temperature selectivity over the last 100 years was driven by rising water temperatures and (or) changes in abundance. Individual annual growth increments from immature and mature life history stages of cod collected in southern Iceland and the Lofoten area (Norway) were micromilled from adult otoliths and then assayed for stable oxygen isotopes (delta O-18(oto)lith). Linear mixed effect models were used to identify and quantify the densitydependent temperature exposure of both cod populations. The results indicated that Icelandic cod migrated into warmer waters with increasing abundance (p < 0.05), whereas NEA cod moved into colder waters (p < 0.001). Our results suggest that thermal preferences and density-dependent effects can be used to forecast potential redistribution scenarios of fish as oceans warm.

AB  - We performed truncation selection for increased fitness (r(c)) under conditions of chronic stress from the combined effects of low nutrients and high temperature, representative of extremes likely to be encountered in nature by the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii. We performed selection on geographical parental populations and their hybrids to determine whether hybridization would facilitate or constrain adaptation under our selection protocol. The stressful environment decreased fitness (r(c)) by 54% averaged across all populations relative to near-optimal conditions. After approximate to 10 generations of selection under chronically stressful conditions, exactly one-half of the parental and one-half of the hybrid populations had gone extinct. Thus hybridization had no effect on the likelihood of population persistence. Fitness (r(c)) of the surviving populations did not show any response to selection. Despite initial hybrid vigour under stressful conditions, the fitness (r(c)) of surviving hybrid populations was either equal to, or worse than, the fitness (r(c)) of surviving parental populations after approximate to 10 generations of selection. These results suggest that outcrossing populations to augment genetic variation and facilitate adaptation to a rapidly changing environment may not be useful over longer time scales, even in cases where hybridization does initially increase fitness. Although we detected no direct response to selection for increased fitness (r(c)) under lifetime chronic stress, selected populations showed a strong correlated response for survivorship through transient, acute heat and desiccation shock. In evaluating how organisms might respond to future climate change, biologists must maintain a clear distinction between lifelong performance in chronically stressful environments and short-term survivorship through transient, acute stress.

AB  - It is possible to predict the potential range of a species on the basis of its ecological characteristics and those of the invaded ecosystem. The existence of genetic variation indicates a species' potential to respond to new environmental conditions, thus facilitating its success as an invader. Accordingly, evolutionary and ecological approaches are needed to identify the factors explaining both species' range and their potential to invade new areas. We combined these two approaches and studied whether genetic variation in life-history traits under abiotic (temperature) and biotic (host plant) selection pressures contributes to the potential range expansion of Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). We reared full-sib families of L. decemlineata from the current northernmost European population at 15 degrees C (temperature below that in the current range) and 25 degrees C (optimal temperature) and on three potato varieties. We monitored development time, adult weight and larval-to-adult survival, and estimated the amount of heritable variance. The development time and adult weight of progenies were more variable between than within families. Thus, there was genetic variability in traits relevant to the ability to adapt to a colder environment (i.e., accelerate development and become heavier) allowing range expansion further north in Europe, even though low temperature increased beetle mortality. Temperature strongly affected all traits measured. Potato variety, in turn, did not strongly affect beetles' performance. Beetle ability to adapt to a cool environment was further enhanced by the fact that size was not constrained by fast development. The results showed that beetle populations possess genetic variation allowing a response to temperature and thus have the evolutionary potential to adapt and spread beyond their current range.

AB  - A deterministic model was developed to simulate population growth of the agromyzid fly Liriomyza bryoniae and the parasitoid Diglyphus isaea. The model has two driving variables, ambient temperature and leaf nitrogen content of the tomato plant. Results of a glasshouse experiment were used to validate the model. The timing of successive generations of leafminers was simulated accurately over four generations. Population growth of leafminers was correctly simulated during the first two generations, but overestimated in the third generation. Mortality of leafminers due to parasitism was overestimated in the first generation after introduction of parasitoids: 73% instead of the observed 30%. A nearly 100% mortality of leafminers was correctly simulated in the second generation after introduction of parasitoids. Sensitivity analysis was performed for three types of variables: (1) driving variables, temperature and leaf nitrogen content; (2) parasitoid traits, searching efficiency and allocation of attacks to host feeding and oviposition, and (3) introduction strategies for biological control, timing, number of releases and number of parasitoids per release. Population growth was sensitive to temperature, leaf nitrogen content, searching efficiency of parasitoids and numbers of parasitoids released.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity has the potential to influence environmental adaptation on extremely short evolutionary timescales. Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) allows parents to provision their offspring for rapid environmental shifts in as little as one generation. We hypothesized that organisms that produce multiple generations of offspring each year use TGP to maximize their fitness under predictable fluctuations in seasonal environments. Using the direct-developing bivoltine eelgrass sea hare Phyllaplysia taylori as a test case, we examined the impacts of seasonal thermal variation (i.e. average temperature and acute heat stress) on physiological tolerance, maternal provisioning, and developmental plasticity across multiple generations. In the laboratory, we acclimated seasonally acclimatized adults from successive generations at 13, 17, and 21 degrees C in order to assess plasticity of thermal tolerance limits. We also examined the effects of thermal acclimation and heat stress on reproductive output within a single generation in order to characterize TGP. Physiological plasticity, including but not limited to TGP, successfully maintained the viability of offspring under 2 seasonal conditions regularly experienced in the wild, despite differences in the density of offspring per clutch and large individual differences in offspring numbers under these conditions. These results indicate that warmer conditions (21 degrees C) disrupt current patterns of plasticity and warrant further investigation of the long-term effects of chronic stress on TGP under climate change.

AB  - Insect life cycles are adapted to a seasonal climate by expressing alternative voltinism phenotypes-the number of generations in a year. Variation in voltinism phenotypes along latitudinal gradients may be generated by developmental traits at critical life stages, such as eggs. Both voltinism and egg development are thermally determined traits, yet independently derived models of voltinism and thermal adaptation refer to the evolution of dormancy and thermal sensitivity of development rate, respectively, as independent influences on life history. To reconcile these models and test their respective predictions, we characterized patterns of voltinism and thermal response of egg development rate along a latitudinal temperature gradient using the matchstick grasshopper genus Warramaba. We found remarkably strong variation in voltinism patterns, as well as corresponding egg dormancy patterns and thermal responses of egg development. Our results show that the switch in voltinism along the latitudinal gradient was explained by the combined predictions of the evolution of voltinism and of thermal adaptation. We suggest that latitudinal patterns in thermal responses and corresponding life histories need to consider the evolution of thermal response curves within the context of seasonal temperature cycles rather than based solely on optimality and trade-offs in performance.

AB  - The present paper reviews the effects of water temperature and flow on migrations, embryonic development, hatching, emergence, growth and life-history traits in light of the ongoing climate change with emphasis on anadromous Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta. The expected climate change in the Atlantic is for milder and wetter winters, with more precipitation falling as rain and less as snow, decrease in ice-covered periods and frequent periods with extreme weather. Overall, thermal limits for salmonids are species specific. Scope for activity and growth and optimal temperature for growth increase with temperature to an optimal point before constrain by the oxygen content of the water. The optimal temperature for growth decreases with increasing fish size and varies little among populations within species, whereas the growth efficiency may be locally adapted to the temperature conditions of the home stream during the growth season. Indirectly, temperature influences age and size at smolting through its effect on growth. Time of spawning, egg hatching and emergence of the larvae vary with temperature and selective effects on time of first feeding. Traits such as age at first maturity, longevity and fecundity decrease with increasing temperature whilst egg size increases with temperature. Water flow influences the accessibility of rivers for returning adults and speed of both upstream and downstream migration. Extremes in water flow and temperature can decrease recruitment and survival. There is reason to expect a northward movement of the thermal niche of anadromous salmonids with decreased production and population extinction in the southern part of the distribution areas, migrations earlier in the season, later spawning, younger age at smolting and sexual maturity and increased disease susceptibility and mortality. Future research challenges are summarized at the end of the paper. (C) 2009 The Authors Journal compilation (C) 2009 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles

AB  - Organismal performance in a changing environment is dependent on temporal patterns and duration of exposure to thermal variability. We experimentally assessed the time-dependent effects of thermal variability (i.e., patterns of thermal exposure) on the hatching performance of Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were collected in central Chile and maintained for four generations in laboratory conditions. Fourth generation eggs were acclimated to different thermal fluctuation cycles until hatching occurred. Our results show that the frequency of extreme thermal events has a significant effect on hatching success. Eggs exposed to 24hr cycles of thermal fluctuation had a higher proportion of eggs that hatched than those acclimated to shorter (6 and 12hr) and longer cycles (48hr). Furthermore, eggs subjected to frequent thermal fluctuations hatched earlier than those acclimated to less frequent thermal fluctuations. Overall, we show that, egg-to-adult viability is dependent on the pattern of thermal fluctuations experienced during ontogeny; thus, the pattern of thermal fluctuation experienced by flies has a significant and until now unappreciated impact on fitness.

AB  - Parental environments are regularly shown to alter the mean fitness of offspring, but their impacts on the genetic variation for fitness, which predicts adaptive capacity and is also measured on offspring, are unclear. Consequently, how parental environments mediate adaptation to environmental stressors, like those accompanying global change, is largely unknown. Here, using an ecologically important marine tubeworm in a quantitative-genetic breeding design, we tested how parental exposure to projected ocean warming alters the mean survival, and genetic variation for survival, of offspring during their most vulnerable life stage under current and projected temperatures. Offspring survival was higher when parent and offspring temperatures matched. Across offspring temperatures, parental exposure to warming altered the distribution of additive genetic variance for survival, making it covary across current and projected temperatures in a way that may aid adaptation to future warming. Parental exposure to warming also amplified nonadditive genetic variance for survival, suggesting that compatibilities between parental genomes may grow increasingly important under future warming. Our study Shows that parental environments potentially have broader-ranging effects on adaptive capacity than currently appreciated, not only mitigating the negative impacts of global change but also reshaping the raw fuel for evolutionary responses to it.

AB  - A computer simulation model was used to optimise strategies for marker assisted selection with best linear unbiased prediction (MBLUP) for quantitative traits in a selective breeding program for the southern Australian abalone industry. The simulation model assumed five marker loci associated with genes affecting growth rate explained 50% of the genetic variance for this trait. Use of markers associated with improved disease resistance was also modelled. Parameters and simulation scheme used are described. The simulations accounted for the possibility of early induction of reproductive condition to reduce generation intervals and for selective genotyping. Affects on profitability were calculated using estimates from the industry of income and expenses for a typical farm and accounting for the costs associated with marker testing. While the extra genetic gains from MAS were in the order of 15%, if the cost of genotyping each marker per animal was $10 AUS, then M BLUP for growth was only profitable when 75 progeny per family were genotyped. Early selection (halving the generation interval) was advantageous for MBLUP and BLUP provided the number of progeny per family was greater 5, as the advantage of two generations of selection more than compensated for the decreased accuracy of selection for early growth. However accurate estimates of parameters, such as the genetic correlation between early growth rate and growth and age at first spawning, would need to be obtained before considering implementing this strategy. The advantage of MBLUP was greater for disease resistance than for growth rate. Selective genotyping, which would greatly reduced genotyping costs of implementing MBLUP to improve disease resistance, did not greatly reduce the additional response achieved with marker assisted selection.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation have caused population decline across taxa through impacts on life history diversity, dispersal patterns, and gene flow. Yet, intentional isolation of native fish populations is a frequently used management strategy to protect against negative interactions with invasive fish species. We evaluated the population viability and genetic diversity of 12 isolated populations of Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi located on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana, USA. Length-structured integral projection models (IPMs) were used to project population growth rate (lambda) and its sensitivity to underlying vital rates and parameters. We examined relationships between lambda, genetic diversity, and habitat size and quality. Lambda ranged from 0.68 to 1.1 with 10 of 12 populations projected to be in decline. A sensitivity analysis of lambda with respect to projection matrix elements indicated that lambda was generally sensitive to changes in early life history stages (survival/growth), but patterns differed among populations. Another sensitivity analysis with respect to underlying model parameters showed highly consistent pattern across populations, with lambda being most sensitive to the slope of probability of maturity (estimated from published literature), generally followed by adult survival, and the slope of somatic growth rate (directly measured from each population). Lambda was not correlated with genetic diversity. For populations residing in small isolated streams (<= 5 km of occupied habitat), lambda significantly increased with base flow discharge (r(2) = 0.50, p < 0.02). Our results highlight the potential importance of local adaptation for persistence of small, isolated populations. Specifically we saw evidence for higher probability of maturity at smaller sizes in the smallest, coldest isolated systems, increasing probability of persistence for these populations. Climate change threatens tofurther fragment populations of aquatic organisms and reduce summertime base flows in much of western North America. Insights from studies such as ours will inform management strategies for long-term persistence of species facing these challenges. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Understanding the combined effects of anthropogenic impacts such as climate change and pollution on aquatic ecosystems is critical. However, little is known about how predicted temperature increases may affect the activity of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), particularly in species with plasticity in sex determination. We investigated the effects of a concomitant increase in temperature and exposure to estrogenic EDCs on reproduction and development in an estuarine model organism (Menidia beryllina) across multiple generations. Parents (P) were exposed to environmental levels of the estrogenic insecticide bifenthrin or ethinylestradiol (EE2) at 22 degrees C and 28 degrees C for 14 days prior to the initiation of spawning trials. Embryos in the F1 generation were exposed to EDCs until 21 days post hatch (dph), reared to adulthood in clean water at elevated temperatures, and spawned. F1 sex ratios were significantly influenced by elevated temperature and EDCs, potentially altering adaptive development. We also observed fewer viable offspring and increased developmental deformities in the F1 and F2 generations, with a greater impact on F2 juveniles. These findings enhance our understanding of responses to EDCs in the context of climate change and may demonstrate heritable effects. Our study represents the first multigenerational assessment of elevated temperatures in combination with environmentally relevant concentrations of commonly detected endocrine disruptors in a model vertebrate species.

AB  - Thermo-acoustic systems are being considered as a potential solution for electricity generation. This work describes the construction of a single stage travelling-wave thermo-acoustic generator. Secondly, an experimental investigation into the effect of the heat source on the potential of the device for electricity generation is performed. The magnitude of the sound generated by the engine, the onset time and the magnitude of electricity generated by the linear alternator have been considered as performance indicators for the device developed. This paper provides clarity on the potential for thermo-acoustic system for sound-to-electricity conversion. Clear trends showing the effect of inputs parameters on device performance have been disclosed. The minimum/maximum amount of heat that has produced a sound was 339/634 degrees C corresponding to sound of 114.0/114.13 dB and a voltage of 278/319 mV. Although the efficiency of the sound-to -electricity conversion was low, this work proves the viability of thermo-acoustic as the alternative solution for electricity generation.

AB  - Ecological risk assessment is commonly based on single-generation ecotoxicological tests that are usually performed at one standard temperature. We investigated the effects of nickel (Ni) on Daphnia magna reproduction at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C over 4 generations. Multigenerational Ni effects on D. magna reproduction depended on the magnitude of the effect in the first generation (F0) and showed very different patterns at different temperatures. At low effect level concentrations (<10% effect concentration [EC10] in F0), chronic Ni toxicity at 15 and 20 degrees C did not increase over 4 generations, and the increase in Ni toxicity at 25 degrees C observed in F1 and F2 in some Ni treatments did not persist into F3, where complete recovery of reproduction was observed. At higher effect level concentrations, the multigenerational Ni effects depended on the test temperature. In F0, Ni toxicity was 6.5-fold lower at 25 degrees C than at 15 degrees C (based on the median effect concentration), but the temperature effect on Ni toxicity was not explained by differences in Ni accumulation. At a lower temperature, lower internal Ni concentrations in D. magna were necessary to induce the same Ni toxicity as at a higher temperature. Overall, our results indicate that low single-generation chronic effect concentrations of Ni in D. magna (EC10 in the present study) are also protective in a long-term, multigenerational context and that temperature should be taken into account in the ecological risk assessment of Ni.

AB  - Wild endangered populations can suffer from adverse effects on fitness due to inbreeding and environmental stress. Often, both genetic and environmental stress factors may be present in populations at the same time. Therefore knowledge on the potential interactions between these factors is important for the conservation of wild populations. When measuring fitness (e. g. survival and reproductive potential) of individuals in the laboratory, and in nature, inbreeding by environment interactions are now being reported more often. The increased focus on environmental dependency of inbreeding depression will therefore enable conservation biologists to include this knowledge in the management of endangered populations in the wild. In this study, the effects of environmental stress and inbreeding on fitness are estimated in a laboratory population of Drosophila buzzatii. Random- or full-sib mating were used to generate independent replicate lines of four different inbreeding levels (F = 0, F = 0.25, F = 0.50, F = 0.672) in four different environments. The environments were thermal and dimethoate stress separately and in combination, as well as a non-stressful control environment. Two experiments were carried out to measure productivity (a multiplicative measure of fecundity and viability) using a full factorial design. In the first experiment, productivity was estimated for all lines and inbreeding levels in the environment in which flies were inbred and reared for several generations. In the second experiment, productivity of the lines reared in the control environment was tested in all four environments and for all inbreeding levels. Our results show a significant effect of inbreeding and environmental stress on productivity in both experiments and the effect increased when flies were exposed to novel environmental conditions. Productivity was not affected by the interaction between inbreeding and environmental stress when flies were tested in the environments in which they were reared, whereas there was a tendency towards a stress by inbreeding interaction when flies were exposed to novel environments. The variance and the coefficient of variation in productivity were each affected by environmental stress and inbreeding, indicating that environmental conditions as well as genetic background are important for variation in productivity. However, the two measures of variation often showed opposite trends. The results obtained in this study indicate that the environmental conditions under which inbreeding occurs are important. This is relevant for the maintenance and management of populations in captivity and in relation to reintroduction of endangered species in nature.

It has been reported that the appearance of sexual morphs is suppressed by a transgenerational factor (a seasonal timer) over several generations after hatching from over wintered eggs. The present study examined whether the seasonal timer measures the number of days from hatching or the number of generations from hatching using the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Homoptera: Aphididae). Effects of temperature and photoperiod on the seasonal timer were also examined by successive rearing. The ability to produce sexual morphs was strongly suppressed in stem mothers (the foundress generation), and gradually recovered over successive generations produced during a few months. The duration for which the seasonal timer could function depended on the number of days from hatching and temperature, but not on photoperiod or the number of generations from hatching. We thus showed in a single study that the seasonal timer of the pea aphid has all the physiological characteristics shown in separate studies in different aphid species.

AB  - This study documents divergence in egg size that has occurred over less than 25 generations among sympatric demes of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) from Lake Lesjaskogsvatnet in Norway. A cluster analysis identified two clusters of tributaries: one of small, warm tributaries (SW) and the other of large, cold tributaries (LC). Spawning occurs more regularly and up to 4 weeks earlier in SW tributaries compared with that in LC ones. We explored numerous mixed models predicting egg size from year (random effect), basin and tributary (fixed effects), and female length. The most supported model estimated length-adjusted egg size to be larger in SW tributaries compared with that in LC tributaries. Combinations of density-dependent (competition for food/space) and density-independent (temperature) factors along with phenotypic plasticity and maternal effects are discussed as potential differentiation sources. We suggest high temperatures (increased metabolism) to reinforce the selective advantage of large eggs under conditions with highly density-dependent fry interactions.

AB  - Social aggregation is a common behavioral phenomenon thought to evolve through adaptive benefits to group living. Comparing fitness differences between aggregated and solitary individuals in nature - necessary to infer an evolutionary benefit to living in groups - has proven difficult because communally-living species tend to be obligately social and behaviorally complex. However, these differences and the mechanisms driving them are critical to understanding how solitary individuals transition to group living, as well as how and why nascent social systems change over time. Here we demonstrate that facultative aggregation in a reptile (the Desert Night Lizard, Xantusia vigilis) confers direct reproductive success and survival advantages and that thermal benefits of winter huddling disproportionately benefit small juveniles, which can favor delayed dispersal of offspring and the formation of kin groups. Using climate projection models, however, we estimate that future aggregation in night lizards could decline more than 50% due to warmer temperatures. Our results support the theory that transitions to group living arise from direct benefits to social individuals and offer a clear mechanism for the origin of kin groups through juvenile philopatry. The temperature dependence of aggregation in this and other taxa suggests that environmental variation may be a powerful but underappreciated force in the rapid transition between social and solitary behavior.

AB  - We compared aspects of the thermal sensitivity of replicated lines of Drosophila melanogaster that had been evolving by laboratory natural selection at three selection temperatures: 16.5 degrees C (10+ yr), 25 degrees C (9+ yr), or 29 degrees C (4+ yr). The 16.5 degrees C and 25 degrees C lines are known to have diverged in fitness at 16.5 degrees C versus 25 degrees C and also in heat tolerance. We designed new experiments to explore further possible shifts in thermal sensitivity of these lines. The optimal temperature for walking speed of adults was positively related to selection temperature, but differences among lines in thermal sensitivity of walking speed were small. Performance breadth was inversely related to selection temperature. Tolerance of adults to an acute heat shock was also positively related to selection temperature, but tolerance to a cold shock was not. Thus, fitness at moderately high temperatures is genetically coupled with tolerance of extreme high (but not of low) temperature. Knock-down temperature and walking speed at high temperature, however, were independent of selection temperature. In contrast to adults, eggs from different lines had similar heat and cold tolerance. Thus, long-term natural selection has led to divergence in thermal sensitivity of some (but not of all) traits and may have had more of an impact on adults than on eggs. Attempts to predict evolutionary states in nature are, however, complicated because of the observed genetic correlations and the simple selection scheme.

AB  - The adaptability of organisms to novel environmental conditions depends on the amount of genetic variance present in the population as well as on the ability of individuals to adjust their phenotype through phenotypic plasticity. Here, we investigated the phenotypic plasticity induced by a single generation's exposure to three different temperature regimes with respect to several life-history and stress-resistance traits in a natural population of Drosophila simulans. We studied a constant as well as a predictably and an unpredictably fluctuating temperature regime. We found high levels of phenotypic plasticity among all temperature regimes, suggesting a strong influence of both temperature fluctuations and their predictability. Increased heat tolerance was observed for flies developed in both types of fluctuating thermal environments compared with flies developed in a constant environment. We suggest that this was due to beneficial hardening when developing in either fluctuating temperature environment. To our surprise, flies that developed in constant and predictably changing environments were similar to each other in most traits when compared to flies from the unpredictably fluctuating environment. The unpredictably changing thermal environment imposed the most stressful condition, resulting in the lowest performance for stress-related traits, even though the absolute temperature changes never exceeded that of the predictably fluctuating environment. The overall decreased stress resistance of flies in the unpredictably fluctuating environment may be the consequence of maladaptive phenotypic plasticity in this setting, indicating that the adaptive value of plasticity depends on the predictability of the environment.

AB  - Moonlight mediates trophic interactions and shapes the evolution of life-history strategies for nocturnal organisms. Reproductive cycles and important life-history transitions for many marine organisms coincide with moon phases, but few studies consider the effects of moonlight on pelagic larvae at sea. We evaluated effects of moonlight on growth of pelagic larvae of a temperate reef fish using "master chronologies" of larval growth constructed from age-independent daily increment widths recorded in otoliths of 321 individuals. We found that daily growth rates of fish larvae were enhanced by lunar illumination after controlling for the positive influence of temperature and the negative influence of cloud cover. Collectively, these results indicate that moonlight enhances growth rates of larval fish. This pattern is likely the result of moonlight's combined effects on foraging efficiency and suppression of diel migrations of mesopelagic predators, and has the potential to drive evolution of marine life histories.

AB  - In this paper, the thermodynamic investigation on the use of geothermal water (130 degrees C as maximum) for power generation through a basic Rankine has been presented together with obtained main results. Six typical organic working fluids (i.e., R245fa, R141b, R290, R600, R152a, and 134a) were studied with modifying the input pressure and temperature to the turbine. The results show that there are no significant changes taking place in the efficiency for these working fluids with overheating the inlet fluid to the turbine, i.e., efficiency is a weak function of temperature. However, with the increasing of pressure ratio in the turbine, the efficiency rises more sharply. The technical viability is shown of implementing this type of process for recovering low temperature heat resource.

AB  - An individual-based life history and population dynamic model for the winter-spring dominant copepod of the subarctic North Atlantic, Calanus Finmarchicus, is coupled with a regional model of advection for the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank. Large numbers of vectors, each representing individual copepods with elements for age, stage, ovarian status and other population dynamic variables, are carried in a computation through hourly time steps. Each vector is updated at each time step according to development rate and reproductive functions derived from experimental data. Newly spawned eggs are each assigned new vectors as needed. All vectors are subject to random mortality. Thus, Loch life history progression and population dynamics of C. finmarchius are represented for the temperatures in the Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank region in the active season. All vectors include elements representing depth, latitude and longitude. This allows coupling of the population dynamics to the tide- and wind-driven Dartmouth model of New England regional circulation. Summary data from the physical model are used to advance vectors from resting-stock locations in Gulf of Maine basins through two generations to sites of readiness for return to rest. Supply of Calanus stock to Georges Bank comes from all of the gulf and from the Scotian Shelf. The top of the bank is stocked from western gulf basins; the North-east Peak is stocked from Georges Basin and the Scotian Shelf. All sources contribute to stock that accumulates in the SCOPEX gyre off the north-west shoulder of Georges Bank, explaining the high abundance recurrently seen in that region. There is some return of resting stock to Wilkinson Basin in the western gulf, but other basins must mostly be restocked from upstream sources to the north-east.

AB  - Rapid adaptation will facilitate species resilience under global climate change, but its effects on plasticity are less commonly investigated. This study shows that 20 generations of experimental adaptation in a marine copepod drives a rapid loss of plasticity that carries costs and might have impacts on future resilience to environmental change.
   Adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity will fuel resilience in the geologically unprecedented warming and acidification of the earth's oceans, however, we have much to learn about the interactions and costs of these mechanisms of resilience. Here, using 20 generations of experimental evolution followed by three generations of reciprocal transplants, we investigated the relationship between adaptation and plasticity in the marine copepod, Acartia tonsa, in future global change conditions (high temperature and high CO2). We found parallel adaptation to global change conditions in genes related to stress response, gene expression regulation, actin regulation, developmental processes, and energy production. However, reciprocal transplantation showed that adaptation resulted in a loss of transcriptional plasticity, reduced fecundity, and reduced population growth when global change-adapted animals were returned to ambient conditions or reared in low food conditions. However, after three successive transplant generations, global change-adapted animals were able to match the ambient-adaptive transcriptional profile. Concurrent changes in allele frequencies and erosion of nucleotide diversity suggest that this recovery occurred via adaptation back to ancestral conditions. These results demonstrate that while plasticity facilitated initial survival in global change conditions, it eroded after 20 generations as populations adapted, limiting resilience to new stressors and previously benign environments.

AB  - To assess the trade-offs associated with cold and heat tolerance, selection experiments were conducted on the rate of recovery from chill- and heat-coma using Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were treated with cold and heat to induce coma, and those that showed rapid or slow recovery from coma were selected. The lines selected for rapid (or slow) recovery from chill-coma also showed rapid (slow) recovery from heat-coma, although such a correlation was not observed in the lines selected for the rate of recovery from heat-coma. On the other hand, survival after cold was enhanced in both lines selected for rapid and slow recovery from chill-coma, and survival after heat was enhanced in both lines selected for rapid and slow recovery from heat-coma. It was assumed that cold and heat treatments to induce coma caused some damages to flies and those that were tolerant to cold or heat were unintentionally selected in the present coma-based selection. Only a weak trade-off was observed between survival-based cold and heat tolerance. On the other hand, developmental time was prolonged and desiccation resistance, walking speed, and longevity were reduced in the lines selected for rapid and slow recovery from chill- and/or heat-coma, suggesting that these resistance and life-history traits are under trade-offs with cold and/or heat tolerance.

AB  - A newly established culture method was evaluated for application in mass-propagation of a photoperiod-temperature sensitive genic male sterile rice strain. It was found that the new culture method was very efficient for the regeneration of plants from callus of this strain, and a high concentration of 6-benzyladenine necessary for highly efficient plant regeneration culture did not seem to have negative effects on some agronomic traits investigated of the regenerated plants and their progenies. By the new culture method, a large number of plants could be regenerated in a relatively short time (approximately 8x10(12) plants within 300 days) from one naked seed-explant. Because of this, prominent drift of the PTGMS rice strain, which accumulates gradually during the course of propagation of the seeds through generations, in the response to photoperiod-temperature conditions could be avoided when this in vitro culture protocol is employed instead of seed propagation. Differences in rates of pollen fertility and seed setting were found between regenerated plants and seed-grown plants, and between their respective first and second progenies. These differences are also of important application value in two-line rice production: Higher pollen fertility of the regenerated plants can be applied with higher efficiency for the propagation of the strain seeds because they have much higher seed setting by self-fertilization; lower pollen fertility of the regenerated plant progenies will result in much lower seed setting by self-fertilization and is, therefore, conducive to the production of hybrid seeds of higher purity by natural crossing with the other line in the two-line system.

AB  - This paper analyzes the potential of solar thermal systems for being employed for process heating in cotton-based textile industries. The technological capability of a flat plate collector (FPC) to meet the solar industrial process heating (SIPH) requirement in yarn production is assessed. Moreover, the usability of a parabolic trough collector (PTC) in meeting the technological mandates of SIPH in fabric processing units is critically examined. Further, this paper reports the findings of a study on the potential cost advantage of solar process heating over the conventional process heating practices in cotton-based textile industries. The approach involves the selection of the locations of sample textile industries and the employable solar collector technologies, as well as assessment of financial reward, if any. Eight different cotton-based textile industries located in different geographical domains (in India) are selected. The selected textile industries are situated within the textile hubs existing in different states across India. Analysis of technoeconomic benefit derivable in selected textile industries using FPC for hot water generation and PTC for steam generation is presented. In the case of FPC-based SIPH systems, the maximum value of solar fraction is estimated to be 0.30 and the corresponding estimation for the levelized cost of useful thermal energy (LCUTE) delivered comes out as INR 790/GJ to INR 1020/GJ. On the other hand, in case of parabolic-trough-solar-concentrator-based SIPH systems, LCUTE is estimated in the range of INR 1030/GJ to INR 1610/GJ. From a critical analysis of financial viability in consideration of related factors such as payback time and return on investment in SIPH, it appears that the SIPH systems for hot water generation may be a good choice, whereas SIPH systems for steam generation are seen to have longer payback periods and lower returns on investment, and, therefore, it seems that adequate financial support from central and state governments with additional supports from bilateral or multilateral organizations may enable them to become a sustainable technology option.

AB  - Stressful environments may be considered as those that reduce fitness, sometimes due in part to the increased metabolic expenditure required to sustain life. Direct adaptation to a stressor is expected to increase fitness and reduce maintenance metabolism, with the latter leading to increased biomass production. In this study, we test the general hypothesis that such adaptation to one stressor can preadapt organisms to novel stressful environments. Six lines of Escherichia coli propagated for 2000 generations at 41-42 degreesC (42 group), a stressful temperature, were compared to six control lines propagated for 2000 generations-at 37 degreesC (37 group) and to the common ancestor of both groups. We assayed biovolume yield (a measure of growth efficiency) and competitive fitness in the 42 group's selective high temperature environment as well as five novel stressful environments-acid, alkali, ethanol, high osmolarity and peroxide. As previously reported, at high temperature the 42 group had both higher yield and fitness than the 37 group and ancestor. In the novel environments, the 42 group generally produced yields higher than the 37 group (and marginally higher than the ancestor), but we found no differences in competitive fitness among the 37 and 42 groups and the ancestor. We also found that the performance of lines within groups was not correlated across stressful environments for either yield or relative fitness. Because previous adaptation to one stressor did not improve our measure of Darwinian fitness in novel stressful environments, we conclude that the 42 group shows no useful preadaptation, or cross-tolerance, to these types of environments.

AB  - Intra-specific colour differences in insects may occur as a result of environmental factors such as food type, temperature and humidity, or may be under genetic control. These colour polymorphisms may result in fitness differences through several mechanisms, including mate selection, camouflage from or warning to natural enemies, and heat absorption. Two colour morphs of adult Chrysophtharta agricola ( Chapuis) ( Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Paropsini) are present in the field in mainland Australia and Tasmania: a common green-brown form, and a rare black form. Tasmanian populations were sampled to assess the frequency of each morph at eight localities. The black form represented less than 3% of beetles ( N=1724), with the proportion not significantly different between localities. Crossing tests using the two colour morphs of C. agricola showed that the black form was genetically dominant over the common form. To assess whether colour morphs had any fitness differences, we measured pre-oviposition period, fecundity, longevity, adult size and egg hatch rate, which each showed no significant difference between colour morphs. Field sampling of mating pairs and rearing the offspring of field-collected females showed no evidence of non-random mating. Modelling the population over 100 generations confirmed that for this species, melanism is controlled by a dominant but neutral allele, and, thus, is maintained at a constant low level in the population.

AB  - To predict impacts of ocean acidification and warming on the responses of marine populations, it is important to determine an organism's capacity for phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation. We determined the effects of near-future acidification and warming across the life cycle of Heliocidaris erythrogramma from fertilisation to metamorphosis in the progeny of 16 sire-dam crosses. Sources of variation in tolerance to warming (+3 degrees C) and acidification (-0.3 to -0.5 pH units) were investigated for fertilisation, larvae and juveniles. Across all life stages, maternal legacy was important, with dam identity significantly interacting with stressors. Across the genotypes tested, fertilisation was negatively affected by increased temperature, but not low pH. Larval development was compromised by low pH, but not increased temperature. By the juvenile stage, no impact of warming or acidification was evident, likely due to selective mortality of sensitive individuals, indicating the presence of a subset of resilient progeny. Across all treatments, the juveniles exhibited a similar ability to calcify. The impact of treatments on development was influenced by parental identity, with the offspring of some sire-dam pairs more sensitive than others. That the progeny of some sire-dam pairs showed high stress tolerance indicates the potential for selection of resistant genotypes and adaptation that could facilitate the persistence of H. erythrogramma populations. Performance of progeny was not consistent across development, with the impact of stressors differing depending on developmental stage. This shows the importance of assessing climatic change across multiple stages in the life cycle.

AB  - There is little information on the performance of oyster populations from Louisiana estuaries limiting the ability to choose stocks for hatchery seed production and field grow-out. The objectives of this study were therefore to compare the mortality, growth, dermo (Perkinsus marinus) infection intensity and condition index of the progeny of wild oysters collected from three Louisiana estuaries differing in salinity regime and oysters specifically selected for dermo resistance. Progeny were deployed in cages in the field, along a salinity gradient in coastal Louisiana. Overall, salinity and temperature had major impacts on the mortality, growth, dermo infection intensity and condition index of oysters of all four stocks and a few differences between stocks could be shown at some sites. At the lowest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Sister Lake, a low salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality suggesting enhanced tolerance to low salinity conditions compared to the other stocks. At the highest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Lake Calcasieu, a high salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality during summer concomitant with increasing dermo infection intensities suggesting a better resistance to dermo disease compared to the other wild stocks and confirming an earlier finding. This initial result suggests that the stocks used are genetically differentiated with respect to low salinity tolerance as well as dermo-related mortality at high salinity and that stock selection for aquaculture grow-out or restoration effort will benefit from being site-specific and dependent on the dominant environmental conditions.

AB  - Thermal alteration is associated with ecological change in freshwater systems. Global climate change is likely to amplify thermal stresses on aquatic systems. We used cumulative daily heat units to examine potential impacts of temperature changes on selected aquatic organisms using scenario analyses. We selected two species of aquatic macroinvertebrates to test our hypotheses of thermal effects on life history pattern, viz. a univoltine stenothermic ephemeropteran species of conservation importance, and a multivoltine dipteran pest species. A combination of spreadsheet probability and logistic regression models was used to model probabilities of hatching and breeding success, plus population sizes and generation numbers per month, under current and projected 2 degrees C warmer water temperature scenarios. We propose that cold-adapted Gondwanaland relic species are likely to become increasingly vulnerable and range limited, whereas multivoltine pest species are likely to become more abundant under scenarios of increased water temperatures. We propose management options that include maintaining river connectivity and dam re-operation as potential mitigation measures. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The killifish Nothobranchius furzeri is an emerging model organism in the field of ecotoxicology and its applicability in acute and chronic ecotoxicity testing has been demonstrated. Overall, the sensitivity of the species to toxic compounds is in the range with, or higher than, that of other model species.
   This work describes protocols for acute, chronic, and multigenerational bioassays of single and combined stressor effects on N. furzeri. Due to its short maturation time and life-cycle, this vertebrate model allows the study of endpoints such as maturation time and fecundity within four months. Transgenerational full life-cycle exposure trials can be performed in as little as 8 months. Since this species produces eggs that are drought-resistant and remain viable for years, the on-site culture of the species is not needed but individuals can be recruited when required. The protocols are designed to measure life-history traits (mortality, growth, fecundity, weight) and critical thermal maximum.

AB  - 1. An alarming finding for biodiversity is that global warming and pesticides often interact synergistically. Yet, this synergism may not capture the full picture because two counteracting processes may reduce the higher impact of pesticides under warming: higher pesticide degradation in the environment and thermal adaptation of populations.
   2. We tested for the effects of warming and multiple pulses of the insecticide chlorpyrifos on life history and fitness-related physiological traits in the damselfly Ischnura elegans. To assess whether thermal adaptation is able to mitigate the impact of the pesticide under future warming, we exposed replicated populations from a colder, high latitude and from a warmer, low latitude in a common garden rearing experiment at 20 and 24 degrees C (the respective mean summer water temperatures at both latitudes).
   3. At the higher temperature pesticide degradation was higher, leading to less accumulation after multiple pulses compared to the lower temperature. Accordingly, the pesticide caused less mortality and less oxidative damage at the higher temperature. This contradicts the general belief (based on studies that kept pesticide concentrations constant) of a higher impact of pesticides under warming. Furthermore, the reduction of the impact of the pesticide at the higher temperature was more pronounced in the warm-adapted low-latitude populations, indicating a counteracting role of thermal adaptation.
   4. Policy implications. Our findings provide proof-of-principle for two key insights that will allow improving ecological risk assessment of pesticides under global warming: (i) higher pesticide degradation in the environment under warming may temper the impact of multiple pesticide pulses; (ii) gradual thermal evolution may further reduce the impact of pesticides at high latitudes under global warming. This knowledge can be very important for policy makers to arrive at a more realistic forecasting of the impacts of chemical pollution and climate change interactions on organisms.

AB  - The extent to which dormancy in large freshwater branchiopods is controlled endogenously (diapause) or exogenously (quiescence) is not always clear. It is assumed that both processes occur even within the same brood. Based on the effectiveness of common diapause-deactivating processes such as desiccation, hibernation, and resting, it can be stated that diapause is not a general process controlling responsiveness of large freshwater branchiopod eggs. Only in limited cases unequivocal evidence for the positive influence of these treatments is found.
   With few exceptions, hatching of activated cysts is effected by specific conditions that may even differ among conspecific populations. Generally, each species (or even population) has a specific temperature range or regime for optimal hatching performance. In a suitable thermal environment with sufficient light and oxygen, hatching is invariably invoked by a low osmotic medium.
   The erratic hatching pattern in most species is thought to be an adaptation to the variable temporary habitat. Hatching is generally spread over several days or even weeks, but the highest peak usually occurs on the first or second day of hatching. Low hatching percentages were found only in subtropical/desert species and may be a reflection of the low chances for successful reproduction. Generation carry-over of propagules in the egg bank by dormancy, and hatching at low conductivity, are, together with obligate oviparity and absence of an asexual life cycle phase, thought to be highly adaptive to the temporary environment. This enabled large branchiopods to survive since the Upper Cambrian.

AB  - Ocean warming can alter natural selection on marine systems, and in many cases, the long-term persistence of affected populations will depend on genetic adaptation. In this study, we assess the potential for adaptation in the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma armigera, an Australian endemic, that is experiencing unprecedented increases in ocean temperatures. We used a factorial breeding design to assess the level of heritable variation in larval hatching success at two temperatures. Fertilized eggs from each full-sibling family were tested at 22 degrees C (current spawning temperature) and 25 degrees C (upper limit of predicted warming this century). Hatching success was significantly lower at higher temperatures, confirming that ocean warming is likely to exert selection on this life-history stage. Our analyses revealed significant additive genetic variance and genotype-by-environment interactions underlying hatching success. Consistent with prior work, we detected significant nonadditive (sire-by-dam) variance in hatching success, but additionally found that these interactions were modified by temperature. Although these findings suggest the potential for genetic adaptation, any evolutionary responses are likely to be influenced (and possibly constrained) by complex genotype-by-environment and sire-by-dam interactions and will additionally depend on patterns of genetic covariation with other fitness traits.

AB  - In this study, we quantified intergenerational, demographic variability of Moina macrocopa subjected to cadmium stress. Exposure of M macrocopa to cadmium (0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mg/Las CdCl2) through 4 consecutive generations revealed changes in demographic responses not only in survivorship variables but also in reproductive parameters. Long-term demographic responses varied differently, depending on the demographic trait and the concentration of heavy metal in the medium. With the exception of generation time, all life history traits were significantly and adversely influenced due to increase in Cd concentrations. The average life span of M macrocopa varied up to 40% depending on Cd level and the generation of exposure. The highest gross reproductive rates were recorded in controls, while the lowest (similar to 30% less) were recorded at the highest Cd level. Survival-weighted net reproductive rates were reduced by nearly 50% due to Cd toxicity. The rate of population increase per day of M macrocopa was also significantly affected (similar to 25%) by Cd as compared to controls. This cladoceran showed a dose-response to Cd toxicity with a significance in both magnitude and frequency of offspring production.

AB  - In the existing genetic sexing strains for the medfly, Ceratitis capitata, male recombination leads to breakdown of the sexing mechanism under mass rearing conditions. The rate of breakdown depends on the recombination frequency and on the fitness of the recombinants. We have tested two different sexing genes, white pupa and a temperature sensitive lethal, in combination with the translocation T(Y;5)30C. Both sexing strains broke down, although at very different rates. In the case of the white pupa strain, 3.5% recombinants were observed after rearing the strain for 15 generations. The second strain, utilizing white pupa and the temperature sensitive lethal as selectable markers, already reached a comparable level after six generations and was broken down completely in the ninth generation. In these strains the frequency of recombination is high because the breakpoint of T(Y;5)30C and the sexing gene(s) are far apart. To remedy the situation, we have isolated four new translocations with breakpoints located closer to the sexing genes. Mass rearing was simulated for several generations with strains based on these translocations and no breakdown was observed under the conditions used.

AB  - In marine invertebrates, the environmental history of the mother can influence fecundity and egg size. Acclimation of females in climate change stressors, increased temperature and low pH, results in a decrease in egg number and size in many taxa, with the exception of cephalopods, where eggs increase in size. With respect to spawned eggs, near future levels of ocean acidification can interfere with the egg's block to polyspermy and intracellular pH. Reduction of the extracellular egg jelly coat seen in low pH conditions has implications for impaired egg function and fertilization. Some fast generation species (e.g. copepods, polychaetes) have shown restoration of female reproductive output after several generations in treatments. It will be important to determine if the changes to egg number and size induced by exposure to climate change stressors are heritable. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Altered river flows and fragmented habitats often simplify riverine communities and favor non-native fishes, but their influence on life-history expression and survival is less clear. Here, we quantified the expression and ultimate success of diverse salmon emigration behaviors in an anthropogenically altered California river system. We analyzed two decades of Chinook salmon monitoring data to explore the influence of regulated flows on juvenile emigration phenology, abundance, and recruitment. We then followed seven cohorts into adulthood using otolith (ear stone) chemical archives to identify patterns in time- and size-selective mortality along the migratory corridor. Suppressed winter flow cues were associated with delayed emigration timing, particularly in warm, dry years, which was also when selection against late migrants was the most extreme. Lower, less variable flows were also associated with reduced juvenile and adult production, highlighting the importance of streamflow for cohort success in these southernmost populations. While most juveniles emigrated from the natal stream as fry or smolts, the survivors were dominated by the rare few that left at intermediate sizes and times, coinciding with managed flows released before extreme summer temperatures. The consistent selection against early (small) and late (large) migrants counters prevailing ecological theory that predicts different traits to be favored under varying environmental conditions. Yet, even with this weakened portfolio, maintaining a broad distribution in migration traits still increased adult production and reduced variance. In years exhibiting large fry pulses, even marginal increases in their survival would have significantly boosted recruitment. However, management actions favoring any single phenotype could have negative evolutionary and demographic consequences, potentially reducing adaptability and population stability. To recover fish populations and support viable fisheries in a warming and increasingly unpredictable climate, coordinating flow and habitat management within and among watersheds will be critical to balance trait optimization versus diversification.

AB  - Subsequent to their introduction in the 1950s, Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus have been able to establish a self-sustaining population that has adapted to the unique conditions of the sub-Antarctic Kerguelen Islands. Here, 48 individuals (198-415 mm) were caught with gillnets and their basic biology and feeding ecology were examined using stable isotope analysis. The Lac des Fougeres population split use of littoral and pelagic resources evenly, although larger fish relied more heavily on littoral production and appear to follow the size-dependent life history habitat template seen in many Scandinavian lakes where smaller sized individuals occupy the pelagic zone and larger individuals dominate the littoral habitat. In Kerguelen, Arctic charr mature at the same ages (5.6 years) as Arctic charr in both sub-Arctic and Arctic lakes. Although mortality was average in comparison to comparator sub-Arctic lakes, it was high in comparison to Arctic lakes. Maximal age (>7+) was at the lower end of the range typically seen in sub-Arctic lakes. Although they inhabit a resource-poor environment, Kerguelen Arctic charr showed no evidence of cannibalism. Thus, while Arctic charr can survive and reproduce in the relatively unproductive Kerguelen lake environments, survival and growth nevertheless appear to be traded off against survival and longevity. The uniqueness of the population location and the recency of its introduction suggest that further monitoring of the population has the potential to yield valuable insights into both the adaptability of the species and its likely responses to ongoing large-scale environmental change as represented by climate change.

AB  - The paper reports experimental results concerning the influence of the support nature (TiO2, ZnO, Al2O3 and Al2O3-Fe2O3) of nickel catalysts on their activity, selectivity and coking phenomenon in the steam reforming of ethanol in the range of 570-870 K. The chemical transformations of ethanol occurring on the catalyst support make its chemical nature an important factor affecting the productivity and selectivity of the process. It was found that the most suitable supports in nickel catalysts designed for hydrogen generation in the steam reforming of ethanol are ZnO and TiO2. Taking into consideration both the efficiency of hydrogen generation and the intensity of carbon deposition, the optimum temperature of the process of the steam reforming of ethanol is below 750 K. An improvement in the selectivity of hydrogen generation and diminishing of the formation of undesirable products may be obtained by promoting nickel catalysts with sodium. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Marine intertidal organisms inhabiting different wave exposure regimes can face different abiotic conditions and selection regimes. In this paper, salinity and temperature conditions for the tidepool habitat of the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus (Baker) are described across a wave exposure gradient, and the selective impact of salinity on life-history traits is inferred from laboratory and held studies. I found that desiccation and osmotic stress in the tidepool habitat of T. californicus were higher at an outer coast compared to a protected site in California. In the outer coast area with high wave action, tidepool salinity varied spatially, fluctuated temporally, and was at least two times greater than seawater salinity on average; tidepools frequently dried completely. Conversely, tidepool salinity in the protected area with low wave action was moderate and did not vary spatially or temporally. Culturing females at different salinities and temperatures suggested that there is a trade-off between osmoregulatory maintenance and growth or reproduction. At high salinity age of first reproduction and interclutch interval increased, and reproductive rate decreased. Extreme salinity produced age-specific mortality in the laboratory, where juveniles suffered significantly greater mortality than adults in salinity stress experiments. Hypersaline conditions in seven natural tidepool populations were associated with a decrease in the proportion of the population composed of juveniles, and an increase in the proportion of adult females, suggesting that juveniles experienced higher mortality. Unlike previous studies of benthic organisms outside tidepools, I found that higher osmotic and desiccation stress occurred in T. californicus tidepool habitats in areas exposed to high wave energy, not in protected areas. The effects of abiotic conditions on Life history traits and age-specific mortality suggest the selection exists for local adaptation to different wave exposure regimes.

AB  - Although temperature variation is known to cause large-scale adaptive divergence, its potential role as a selective factor over microgeographic scales is less well-understood. Here, we investigated how variation in breeding pond temperature affects divergence in multiple physiological (thermal performance curve and critical thermal maximum [CTmax]) and life-history (thermal developmental reaction norms) traits in a network of Rana arvalis populations. The results supported adaptive responses to face two main constraints limiting the evolution of thermal adaptation. First, we found support for the faster-slower model, indicating an adaptive response to compensate for the thermodynamic constraint of low temperatures in colder environments. Second, we found evidence for the generalist-specialist trade-off with populations from colder and less thermally variable environments exhibiting a specialist phenotype performing at higher rates but over a narrower range of temperatures. By contrast, the local optimal temperature for locomotor performance and CTmax did not match either mean or maximum pond temperatures. These results highlight the complexity of the adaptive multiple-trait thermal responses in natural populations, and the role of local thermal variation as a selective force driving diversity in life-history and physiological traits in the presence of gene flow.

AB  - Organismal chemical tolerance is often used to assess ecological risk and monitor water quality, yet tolerance can differ between field- and lab-raised organisms. In this study, we examined how tolerance to copper (Cu) and tributyltin oxide (TBTO) in two species of marine copepods, Tigriopus japonicus and T. californicus, changed across generations under benign laboratory culture (in the absence of pre-exposure to chemicals). Both copepod species exhibited similar chemical-specific changes in tolerance, with laboratory maintenance resulting in increased Cu tolerance and decreased TBTO tolerance. To assess potential factors underlying these patterns, chemical tolerance was measured in conjunction with candidate environmental variables (temperature, UV radiation, diet type, and starvation). The largest chemical-specific effect was found for starvation, which decreased TBTO tolerance but had no effect on Cu tolerance. Understanding how chemical-specific tolerance can change in the laboratory will be critical in strengthening bioassays and their applications for environmental protection and chemical management.

AB  - This study aimed to demonstrate that adequate slow heating rate allows two strains of Escherichia coli rapid acclimation to higher temperature than upper growth and survival limits known to be strain-dependent. A laboratory (K12-TG1) and an environmental (DPD3084) strain of E. coli were subjected to rapid (few seconds) or slow warming (1 degrees C 12 h(-1)) in order to (re) evaluate upper survival and growth limits. The slow warming was applied from the ancestral temperature 37 degrees C to total cell death 46-54 degrees C: about 30 generations were propagated. Upper survival and growth limits for rapid warming (46 degrees C) were lower than for slow warming (46-54 degrees C). The thermal limit of survival for slow warming was higher for DPD3084 (50-54 degrees C). Further experiments conducted on DPD3084, showed that mechanisms involved in this type of thermotolerance were abolished by a following cooling step to 37 degrees C, which allowed to imply reversible mechanisms as acclimation ones. Acquisition of acclimation mechanisms was related to physical properties of the plasma membrane but was not inhibited by unavoidable appearance of aggregated proteins. In conclusion, E. coli could be rapidly acclimated within few generations over thermal limits described in the literature. Such a study led us to propose that rapid acclimation may give supplementary time to the species to acquire a stable adaptation through a random mutation.

AB  - Aquatic organisms inhabiting polluted waterways face numerous adverse effects, including physiological disruption by endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). Little is known about how the temperatures associated with global climate change may influence the response of organisms exposed to EDCs, and the effects that these combined stressors may have on molecular endpoints such as gene expression. We exposed Menidia beryllina (inland silversides) to environmentally relevant concentrations (1 ng/L) of two estrogenic EDCs (bifenthrin and 17 alpha-ethinylestradia EE2) at 22 degrees C and 28 degrees C. We conducted this experiment over multiple generations to better understand the potential effects to chronically exposed populations in the wild. We exposed adult parental fish (F0) for 14 days prior to spawning of the next generation. F1 larvae were then exposed from fertilization until 21 days post hatch (dph) before being transferred to clean water tanks. F1 larvae were reared to adulthood, then spawned in clean water to test for further effects of parental exposure on offspring (F2 generation). Gene expression was quantified by performing qPCR on F0 and F1 gonads, as well as F1 and F2 larvae. We did not detect any significant differences in the expression of genes measured in the parental or F1 adult gonads. We found that the 28 degrees C EE2 treatment significantly decreased the expression of nearly all genes measured in the F1 larvae. This pattern was transferred to the F2 generation for expression of the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) gene. Expression of 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta-HSD) and G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) revealed changes not measured in the previous generation. Effects of the bifenthrin treatments were not observed until the F2 generation, which were exposed to the chemicals indirectly as germ cells. Our results indicate that effects of EDCs and their interactions with abiotic factors, may not be adequately represented by singular generation testing. These findings will contribute to the determination of the risk of EDC contamination to organisms inhabiting contaminated waterways under changing temperature regimes.

AB  - Phyllonorycter corylifoliella Hb. is one of the pests which has produced significant damage in Romanian pear orchards during the last few years. For this reason, knowledge of the thermal developmental constants, the determination of the degree day accumulation (DD) necessary for each stage of development and each generation and the role of the biotic factors in the dynamics of populations of this pest are of special importance. The development of P. corylifoliella Hb. occurs according to the formula of Savescu (1965). Thus, the threshold value is T-0=6 degrees C, the thermal constant K=630 degrees C, the prolificacy threshold value O=11 degrees C, the optimum thermal O-1=28,3 degrees C and the upper threshold T=31.1 degrees C. Of practical interest for the control of this pest are the degree day (DD) accumulated to the start of adult flights, the maximum of the flight curve and egg laying period. The medium values of these were: 21.5 degrees C and 157.3 degrees C for the overwintered generation (the 3(rd) generation), 423.7 degrees C, 807.9 degrees C and 37.71C for the 1(st) generation, 979.2 degrees C, 1790.6 degrees C and 46.9 degrees C for the 2(nd) generation. The average degree day (DD) accumulation, corresponding to each point of the insect phenology are: for the Is' generation - egg - 37.70 degrees C, larva 88.35 degrees C, pupa - 286.73 degrees C, adult 423.70 degrees C; for the 2(nd) generation - egg - 469.00 degrees C, larva - 628.98 degrees C, pupa - 850.13 degrees C, adult - 979.20 degrees C; for the 3(rd) generation - pupa 9.53 degrees C, adult - 21.48 degrees C. The main parasitoids identified were the Hymenoptera Apanteles circumscriptus, Holcothroax ss p. and Sympiesis ssp. The parasitism rate varied between 11 and 60%. A. circumscriptus gave the highest rate of parasitism.

AB  - One unit of Sardar Patel Renewable Energy Research Institute (SPRERI's) 1.25GJh(-1) capacity open core down draft gasifier burner system, suitable for thermal application was installed at M/s Dinesh Pharmaceutical Pvt. Ltd., Nandesari, for steam generation. Producer gas burner was used in dual fuel mode (60% LDO (light diesel oil) + 40% producer gas). Gasifier consumed 78-80 kg h(-1) of wood, and replaced 40% (201 h(-1)) LDO. The system was tested for a cumulative period of 600 h using sawmill woody waste as feedstock in test runs of 15-18 h. Financial analysis of the gasifier system showed that user could save about Rs. 221.8 per hour by using dual fuel (60% LDO + 40% producer gas) for steam generation. Economic analysis of the system tested in the field indicated the viability of the gasifier-based operation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Life history events, from mating and voltinism to migration and emergence, are governed by external and historically predictable environmental factors. The ways humans have altered natural environments during the Anthropocene have created myriad and compounding changes to these historically predictable environmental cues. Over the past few decades, there has been an increased interest in the control temperature exerts on life history events as concern over climate change has increased. However, temperature is not the only life history cue that humans have altered. In stream ecosystems, flow and light serve as important life history cues in addition to temperature. The timing and magnitude of peak flows can trigger migrations, decreases in stream temperature may cause a stream insect to enter diapause, and photoperiod appears to prompt spawning in some species of fish. Two or more of these cues may interact with one another in complex and sometimes unpredictable ways. Large dams and increasing impervious cover in urban ecosystems have modified flows and altered the timing of spawning and migration in fish. Precipitation draining hot impervious surfaces increases stream temperature and adds variability to the general pattern of stream warming from climate change. The addition of artificial light in urban and suburban areas is bright enough to eliminate or dampen the photoperiod signal and has resulted in caddisfly emergence becoming acyclical. The resulting changes in the timing of life history events also have the potential to influence the evolutionary trajectory of an organism and its interactions with other species. This paper offers a review and conceptual framework for future research into how flow, temperature, and light interact to drive life history events of stream organisms and how humans have changed these cues. We then present some of the potential evolutionary and ecological consequences of altered life history events, and conclude by highlighting what we perceive to be the most pressing research needs.

However, the mechanisms involved in the physiological responses of copepods to temperature and salinity increases are little understood, and the role of plasticity involved in facing environmental changes has rarely been demonstrated experimentally. In this study, the copepod Eurytemora affinis, widely distributed in the northern hemisphere, was selected as a biological model to test the effect of a 4 degrees C temperature increase at two salinities. In addition to the optimal salinity (15 psu), a stressful condition of salinity 25 psu was also verified. Copepods from the Seine estuary were acclimated in laboratory to their optimal temperature of 15 degrees C at salinity 15 PSU and then they were acclimated during several generations to their upper thermal limit (20 degrees C) at two salinities (15 and 25 PSU), after which the temperature was raised by 4 degrees C. This experiment revealed that after long-term acclimation and under unlimited food conditions, E. affinis maintained good fitness at 20 degrees C and at both optimal and stressful salinities. After temperature increase to 24 degrees C, the population remained viable but copepod size was significantly decreased as well as female's fecundity. The decrease of fitness was accentuated under the additional stressful condition of salinity 25 psu. This study demonstrated that the mechanisms of response to temperature and salinity increases (i.e. global warming) are complex, and should be investigated through experimental studies that consider acclimation and multigenerational factors. Our results will enrich the development of Individual-Based Models (IBMs) capable to test the role of microevolution and plasticity of E. affinis in the framework of future climate scenarios.

AB  - In this study, we use the bacterium Escherichia coli to examine evolutionary responses to environmental acidity fluctuating temporally among pH 5.3, 6.3, 7.0, and 7.8 (5,000-15 nM [H+]). Two experimental protocols of temporal variation were used. One group (six replicate lines) of populations evolved for 2,000 generations during exposure to a cycled regime fluctuating daily between pH 5.3 and 7.8. The other group ( also in six replicate lines) evolved during exposure for 2,000 generations to a randomly shifting regime fluctuating stochastically each day among pH 5.3, 6.3, 7.0, and 7.8. Adaptation to these fluctuating acidity regimes was measured as a change in fitness relative to the common ancestor by direct competition experiments in both constant and fluctuating pH regimes. For comparisons with constant pH evolution, a group evolved at a constant pH of 5.3 and another group evolved at pH 7.8 were also tested. This study initiated the first long-term laboratory natural selection experiment on adaptation to variable acidity and addressed key questions concerning patterns of adaptation (trade-offs, specialists, generalists, plasticity, transitions, and acclimation) in temporally fluctuating environments.

AB  - Trends in abundance of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) of the Nechako River, a tributary of the Fraser River, were analyzed to quantify the ecological effects of water abstraction for electricity generation. In years when the majority of returning chinook adults used the upper Nechako River for spawning, the survival of offspring for the entire river was poorer than in years when spawning was concentrated in the lower reaches. Relative to the historical discharge, the upper Nechako River has experienced the greatest degree of water abstraction, and the lower survival of chinook broods originating from the upper river may be due to early emergence of fry caused by elevated fall and winter water temperatures or to higher rates of predation on juveniles and loss of rearing habitat caused by the elimination of the spring freshet. Poor recruitment resulting from broods spawning predominately in the upper river has caused the trend in the abundance of Nechako River chinook to diverge from the trend of chinook populations of similar life history from unregulated tributaries of the Fraser River. Additional reductions in flow may further affect the capacity of the upper Nechako River to produce chinook salmon.

AB  - In this paper an alternative set-up generation system is developed for a tandem cold mill to be used during emergency operation in case of shut-down of the main operating mode. The system is based on a cost function that evaluates the mill quality and productivity for each set-up. This cost function is minimized using the Nelder and Mead simplex method. Despite to be simpler than the main set-up generation system, it is faster, more accurate and safer than the usual emergency mode, which is based on a set of tables.

AB  - Bet-hedging evolves in fluctuating environments because long-term genotype success is determined by geometric (rather than arithmetic) mean fitness across generations. Diversifying bet-hedging produces different specialist offspring, whereas conservative bet-hedging produces similar generalist offspring. However, many fields, such as behavioral ecology and thermal physiology, typically consider specialist versus generalist strategies only in terms of maximizing arithmetic mean fitness benefits to individuals. Here we model how environmental variability affects optimal amounts of phenotypic variation within and among individuals to maximise genotype fitness, and we disentangle the effects of individual-level optimization and genotype-level bet-hedging by comparing long-term arithmetic versus geometric mean fitness. For traits with additive fitness effects within lifetimes (e.g. foraging-related traits), genotypes of similar generalists or diversified specialists perform equally well. However, if fitness effects are multiplicative within lifetimes (e.g. sequential survival probabilities), generalist individuals are always favored. In this case, geometric mean fitness optimization requires even more within-individual phenotypic variation than does arithmetic mean fitness, causing individuals to be more generalist than required to simply maximize their own expected fitness. In contrast to previous results in the bet-hedging literature, this generalist conservative bet-hedging effect is always favored over diversifying bet-hedging. These results link the evolution of behavioral and ecological specialization with earlier models of bet-hedging, and we apply our framework to a range of natural phenomena from habitat choice to host specificity in parasites.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA), induced by rapid anthropogenic CO2 rise and its dissolution in seawater, is known to have consequences for marine organisms. However, knowledge on the evolutionary responses of phytoplankton to OA has been poorly studied. Here we examined the coccolithophore Gephyrocapsa oceanica, while growing it for 2000 generations under ambient and elevated CO2 levels. While OA stimulated growth in the earlier selection period (from generations similar to 700 to similar to 1550), it reduced it in the later selection period up to 2000 generations. Similarly, stimulated production of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen reduced with increasing selection period and decreased under OA up to 2000 generations. The specific adaptation of growth to OA disappeared in generations 1700 to 2000 when compared with that at 1000 generations. Both phenotypic plasticity and fitness decreased within selection time, suggesting that the species' resilience to OA decreased after 2000 generations under high CO2 selection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A 20-month recapture analysis of 1001 individually marked mesquite lizards (Sceloporus grammicus) suggests that variation in thermal quality across three altitudes influences survival probability. Each additional unit of deviation from the temperature selected by these lizards in previous laboratory experiments (i.e. decreased thermal quality) meant an increase of roughly 1.01% in survival probability. Survival probabilities ranged from 0.80 to 0.90 at the lowest elevation site (2600 m), from 0.76 to 0.87 at the middle elevation site (3100 m) and from 0.90 to 0.94 at the highest elevation site (4150 m). These results suggest that in poor thermal quality environments mesquite lizards may employ thermoregulatory strategies (behavioral, physiological and/or morphological) to decrease their metabolic expenditure and their exposure to predators, maximizing survival. These findings highlight the relevance of thermal quality of the habitat in determining survival probability of ectotherms.

AB  - Solar thermal power cycles assisted multi-stage flash brine recycle (MSF-BR) distillation process are thermo-economically analyzed and evaluated. In this work, the analyses are compared according to three different configurations via two techniques of solar thermal power cycles. The first technique is considered for only desalination process; however, the second is considered for desalination and electric power generation via organic Rankine cycle. Solar parabolic trough concentrator (PTC) field is considered to dominate sufficient thermal power for MSF plant. Water steam working fluid is used for a direct vapor generation (DVG); however, Therminol-VP1 working substance is used for an indirect vapor generation (IDVG) through the PTC field. Moreover, the optimized configuration from the first technique is compared with the power generation and desalination (the second technique). The comparisons are proceeding for the MSF-BR desalination plant with total productivity in the range of 5,000m(3)/d which the gain ratio is increased up to 12 with 40 stages. The thermo-economic results reveal that first technique achieves remarkable results related to the PTC area, the SPC, kWh/m(3), and the thermo-economic product cost, $/GJ.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Most laboratory experiments on insects to date have been conducted using constant temperature settings. Even when the purpose of the study was to investigate effects of temperature, insects have mostly been kept at different but constant temperatures ignoring natural variation in temperature. Here we investigated effects of simple daily temperature fluctuation (22.5/27.5 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C) on some development characteristics in five species of fruit flies (Drosophila) originating from areas with different temperature profiles. We demonstrated how species of the same genus can show substantial differences when developing at fluctuating temperatures not always predictable by development at comparable constant temperature (25 degrees C).
   Temperature has profound effects on biochemical processes as suggested by the extensive variation in performance of organisms across temperatures. Nonetheless, the use of fluctuating temperature (FT) regimes in laboratory experiments compared to constant temperature (CT) regimes is still mainly applied in studies of model organisms. We investigated how two amplitudes of developmental temperature fluctuation (22.5/27.5 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C, 12/12 h) affected several fitness-related traits in five Drosophila species with markedly different thermal resistance. Egg-to-adult viability did not change much with temperature except in the cold-adapted D. immigrans. Developmental time increased with FT among all species compared to the same mean CT. The impact of FT on wing size was quite diverse among species. Whereas wing size decreased quasi-linearly with CT in all species, there were large qualitative differences with FT. Changes in wing aspect ratio due to FT were large compared to the other traits and presumably a consequence of thermal stress. These results demonstrate that species of the same genus but with different thermal resistance can show substantial differences in responses to fluctuating developmental temperatures not predictable by constant developmental temperatures. Testing multiple traits facilitated the interpretation of responses to FT in a broader context.

AB  - Climate change has complex impacts on insect life history traits, biogeography, survival, population dynamics and host-parasitoid seasonal phenologies that affect their synchrony. This is more pronounced in tropical southern Africa, where global warming may be relatively high. While some work on Plutella xylostella (L.) temperature tolerance has been reported, none focussed on African field insect populations and implications of trophic level interaction on biological control. To determine how climate change may affect coevolved trophic level interactions in a host-parasitoid trophic system, we compared the basal thermal tolerance of wild F-1 populations of the parasitoid Cotesia vestalis (Haliday) to two life stages of herbivorous host P. xylostella (L.), a global economic pest of brassicas. Our results showed significantly lower C. vestalis critical thermal limits (P < .001) compared to the host. Similarly, the parasitoid heat knockdown time and chill comma recovery time tolerance were significantly lower than that of the host (P < .001). Lethal temperature assays revealed significantly lower survival rates (P < .001) for C. vestalis at both upper and lower temperature scales. Observed differential basal temperature responses may offset coevolved host-parasitoid synchrony through differences in host-parasitoid phenologies. Hence, future biological control programmes should aim at 'creating' resilience and climate-fitness in natural enemies through enhancing evolutionary potential to buffer them from the changing climate. This is the first report detailing trophic level thermal tolerance of P. xylostella and larval parasitoid, C. vestalis, focussing on ecological service implications of the field-wild parasitoid populations on the herbivore host.

AB  - In order to explain the worldwide latitudinal distribution and seasonal fluctuations in In(2L)t frequencies in Drosophila melanogaster, fitness differences among In(2L)t and Standard (ST) homo-and heterokaryotypes under high-temperature conditions were determined. Viabilities were measured for high-temperature treatment started at different juvenile stages. The capacity to restore fertility after high-temperature treatment was measured for adults and juveniles. Furthermore, genetic adaptation for increased temperature resistance for these traits was determined for strains which were reared at 33 degrees C for 10 generations. Whereas larva-pupa survival rates were high, highest juvenile mortalities and strongest karyotypic effects were observed during the pupal stage when preceding larval stages were reared at 33 degrees C. ST karyotypes showed lowest viabilities. Although mating rate was hardly influenced, sterility was induced for females and males after high-temperature treatment of adults as well as juveniles. Subsequent transfer to 25 degrees C, however, resulted in restored fertility in some of the individuals, depending on the length of the recovery period. Fertility restoration was significantly higher for heterokaryotype males and females. Heterokaryotype superiority for restored fertility as well as for viability was positively correlated with severity of the treatment. Tell generations of selection at 33 degrees C resulted in significant improvement of juvenile survival and fertility restoration for all karyotypes. These fitness components were positively correlated (r = 0.91; P < 0.001), which might suggest pleiotropic effects. It is concluded that the capacity to restore fertility after heat stress is an important fitness component, especially with respect to the In(2L)r polymorphism The observed heterokaryotypic superiority fits with the idea that the latitudinal distribution of In(2L)t frequencies is maintained by balancing selection, with equilibrium values decreasing with latitude.

AB  - The evaluation of utilizing corn cob as a primary energy resource for electricity generation in Northern Thailand was described. Maize is one of the main crops produced in all provinces of the territory. The productivity of maize is over 2,000,000 ton/year. Therefore, more than 9,000 GJ/ of energy can be obtained from this agricultural residue annually. In this study, an equilibrium model was developed for evaluation purposes. The effect of moisture content and gasification temperature was also discussed. Besides, the derating of the engine utilized with producer gas was also calculated.

AB  - The present study explores the thermal adaptability in pathogens and tries to find out a relationship between climate warming and diseases. The phenotypic evolutionary analysis of a multi-pathogen system with temperature dependent disease transmission and virulence leads to a possibility of the bistable behaviour of pathogens on temperature scale. Bistability allows the establishment of low and high temperature specialist pathogen strains in a host population. It is observed that bistability can be realized in a host-pathogen system when survival of host and pathogen is possible on a sufficiently wide range of temperature. On the other hand, if host or pathogen survival remains temperature limited, host is susceptible to only one of the either specialists. For the proposed model with density dependent host mortality, we have observed the dimorphic existence of pathogens on moderately warm temperature range only. An advanced level multivariable time-series plot of malaria epidemic in Manipur (India) confirms the bistable behaviour of malaria infection on the temperature scale. Here, we present a novel investigation about thermal adaptability and diseases. We have tried to test the validity of the theory of range expansion and range shifts about climate and diseases.

AB  - The globally dominant N-2-fixing cyanobacteria Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera provide vital nitrogen supplies to subtropical and tropical oceans, but little is known about how they will be affected by long-term ocean warming. We tested their thermal responses using experimental evolution methods during 2 years of selection at optimal (28 degrees C), supra-optimal (32 degrees C) and suboptimal (22 degrees C) temperatures. After several hundred generations under thermal selection, changes in growth parameters, as well as N and C fixation rates, suggested that Trichodesmium did not adapt to the three selection temperature regimes during the 2-year evolution experiment, but could instead rapidly and reversibly acclimate to temperature shifts from 20 degrees C to 34 degrees C. In contrast, over the same timeframe apparent thermal adaptation was observed in Crocosphaera, as evidenced by irreversible phenotypic changes as well as whole-genome sequencing and variant analysis. Especially under stressful warming conditions (34 degrees C), 32 degrees C-selected Crocosphaera cells had an advantage in survival and nitrogen fixation over cell lines selected at 22 degrees C and 28 degrees C. The distinct strategies of phenotypic plasticity versus irreversible adaptation in these two sympatric diazotrophs are both viable ways to maintain fitness despite long-term temperature changes, and so could help to stabilize key ocean nitrogen cycle functions under future warming scenarios.

AB  - Understanding how marine organisms will be affected by global change is of primary importance to ensure ecosystem functioning and nature contributions to people. This study meets the call for addressing how life-history traits mediate effects of ocean acidification on fish. We built a database of overall and trait-mediated responses of teleost fish to future CO2 levels by searching the scientific literature. Using a meta-analytical approach, we investigated the effects of projected CO2 levels by IPCC for 2050-2070 and 2100 on fish eco-physiology and behavior from 320 contrasts on 42 species, stemming from polar to tropical regions. Moreover, since organisms may experience a mosaic of carbonate chemistry in coastal environments (e.g., in estuaries, upwelling zones and intertidal habitats), which may have higher pCO(2) values than open ocean waters, we assessed responses from additional 103 contrasts on 21 fish species using pCO(2) levels well above IPCC projections. Under mid-century and end-of-century CO2 emission scenarios, we found multiple CO2-dose-dependent effects on calcification, resting metabolic rate, yolk, and behavioral performances, along with increased predation risk and decreased foraging, particularly for larvae. Importantly, many of the traits considered will not confer fish tolerance to elevated CO2 and far-reaching ecological consequences on fish population replenishment and community structure will likely occur. Extreme CO2 levels well above IPCC projections showed effects on fish mortality and calcification, while growth, metabolism, and yolk were unaffected. CO2 exposures in short-term experiments increased fish mortality, which in turn decreased in longer-term exposures. Whatever the elevated CO2 levels considered, some key biological processes (e.g., reproduction, development, habitat choice) were critically understudied. Fish are an important resource for livelihoods in coastal communities and a key component for stability of marine ecosystems. Given the multiple trait-mediated effects evidenced here, we stress the need to fill the knowledge gap on important eco-physiological processes and to expand the number and duration of ocean acidification studies to multi-generational, multiple stressor (e.g., warming, hypoxia, fishing), and species interactions experiments to better elucidate complex ecosystem-level changes and how these changes might alter provisioning of ecosystem services.

AB  - The effects of global warming on the life cycle and life-history traits of the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae), were investigated in Fukui, Japan. Our previous studies showed that the Fukui population had a predominantly bivoltine life cycle, but recently the life cycle has changed. In the present study, the life-history traits of individuals collected in 2002 in Fukui were clarified and compared to those in the previous studies. The lower threshold temperature for development and the thermal constant for one generation were 10.6 degrees C and 724.4 degree days, respectively. Although these developmental parameters were not investigated in the previous studies, the difference of the developmental period between the present and previous results was negligible in the larval and pupal stages at 20 degrees C. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction was 14 h 29 min at 20 degrees C and 14 h 10 min at 25 degrees C. The critical photoperiod at 25 degrees C was shortened to 14 min from that of the previous studies for individuals collected in 1995. The incidence of pupal diapause in the second generation was investigated in individuals that were collected as fourth and fifth instars in the field. Some portion of individuals averted diapause even if they were kept under a short photoperiod of L14:D10 at 25 degrees C after collection. These results, together with climate data and field observations in Fukui, suggest that at least a part of the population has three generations per year at present. This shift of the life cycle occurred within 7 years and is probably related to global warming in recent years.

AB  - Temperature is a critical single factor influencing insect population dynamics, and is foundational for improving our understanding of the phenology of invasive species adapting to new agroecosystems or in the process of range expansion. An age-stage, two-sex life table was therefore developed to analyze fundamental demographic features such as development, survival, and reproduction of a Minnesota-acclimated population of the invasive brown marmorated stink bug (Halyomorpha halys), in the north central USA. All salient life history parameters were estimated to better understand the population growth potential of H. halys at the current limit of its northern range in North America. We examined the effect of selected constant temperatures on immature development and survival (15-39 degrees C), adult reproduction and longevity (17-36 degrees C) of H. halys in the laboratory. The Minnesota population developed faster and survived at higher rates relative to a population that had previously established in Pennsylvania, USA. Mean generation time for the Minnesota population was minimized at 30 degrees C, while survival and fecundity were maximized at 27 and 23 degrees C, respectively. Given these findings, we assessed the effect of temperature on the intrinsic rate of increase (rm), the life table parameter that integrates the effects of temperature on development, survival, and reproduction. A Ratkowsky model predicted rm was maximized (0.0899) at 27.5 degrees C. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding population growth rates for H. halys in the context of a warming climate, and potential to emerge as a serious crop pest in the Midwest U.S. region.

AB  - The effects of climate change on the northern limit of the trivoltine area were clarified in the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae). The Takaoka and Kanazawa populations used in the present study occur in locations to the north of Fukui (36.07 degrees N), where H. cunea has recently shifted from a bivoltine to a predominantly trivoltine life cycle. The life-history traits of these populations were investigated and compared to those in the Fukui population. The lower threshold temperature for development and the thermal constant for one generation were 11.3 degrees C and 674.5 degrees d in the Takaoka population, and 11.2 degrees C and 680.7 degrees d in the Kanazawa population. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction at 25 degrees C was 14 h 34 min in the Takaoka population and 14 h 28 min in the Kanazawa population. These critical photoperiods at 25 degrees C were longer by 24 min and 18 min than the Fukui population, respectively. These results, together with climate data, suggest that the Takaoka population maintains a bivoltine life cycle, and a small part of the Kanazawa population has three generations per year, a predominantly bivoltine life cycle. Thus, the present northern limit of the trivoltine area lies around Fukui in districts along the Japan Sea.

AB  - Temperature and photoperiod regulate key fitness traits in plants and animals. However, with temperature increase due to global warming, temperature cue thresholds are experienced at shorter photoperiods, disrupting the optimal seasonal timing of physiological, developmental and reproductive events in many species. Understanding the mechanisms of adaptation to the asynchrony between temperature and photoperiod is key to inform our understanding of how species will respond to global warming. Here, we studied the transgenerational mechanisms of responses of the cyclical parthenogen Daphnia magna to different photoperiod lengths co-occurring with warm temperature thereby assessing the impact of earlier spring warming on its fitness. Daphnia uses temperature and photoperiod cues to time dormancy, and to switch between sexual and asexual reproduction. Daphnia life cycle offers the opportunity to measure the relative contribution of plastic and genetic responses to environmental change across generations and over evolutionary time. We use transgenerational common garden experiments on three populations 'resurrected' from a biological archive experiencing temperature increase over five decades. Our results suggest that response to early spring warming evolved underpinned by a complex interaction between plastic and genetic mechanisms while a positive maternal contribution at matching environments between parental and offspring generation was also observed.

AB  - To fully comprehend and predict the impact of drivers of global change such as climate warming and pollution, integrated multi-trait approaches are needed. As organismal traits are often correlated, responses to stressors are expected to induce coordinated changes in many traits. A promising framework to study this is the pace of life syndrome (POLS), which predicts the integration of life history, behavioral, and physiological traits along a fast-slow continuum. Using an integrative multi-trait approach, we evaluated the presence of a POLS both within and across latitudes and how POLS patterns are affected by warming and metal pollution. We studied this in Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae of replicated low- and high-latitude populations that strongly differ in voltinism (three to four generations per year vs. one generation every two years) reared in a common-garden experiment at two temperatures. Across latitudes, life history, behavior, and physiology covaried in accordance with the POLS, with the fast-paced low-latitude damselflies characterized by a fast growth rate, high activity, and more explorative and risk-taking behavior, fast metabolic rate, and low investment in immune function (activity of phenoloxidase). This fast POLS strategy was associated with a higher sensitivity to metal exposure and a higher vulnerability to predation. Warming caused opposite responses between the latitudes consistent with differential thermal adaptation in growth rate, behavior, and oxidative stress parameters. Despite this, damselflies of both latitudes showed a consistent pattern in phenotypic correlations among traits that, moreover, was not affected by warming and metal exposure. Within latitudes, there was no full support for the POLS. More active larvae were more explorative and risk taking, which aligned with the fast-slow life history axis, but less strong than at the across-latitude level. Physiological traits were also integrated within latitudes, yet there was no unambiguous coupling with the fast-slow life history continuum. The consistent syndrome structure, if underpinned by genetic correlations, may restrict the independent evolution of individual traits, yet may not necessarily constrain adaptive evolution of integrated trait sets. This is because the covariance pattern was to a large extent similar across latitudes and within latitudes, suggesting adaptive trait integration guiding adaptive evolution of trait sets along the fast-slow continuum.

AB  - Today's electricity generation relies heavily on fossil fuels. Emissions of conventional thermal power plants affect adversely air quality and intensify the greenhouse effect. Renewable energy technologies for electricity generation present perhaps a possible alternative. The purpose of this research is to investigate the viability of electricity generation using agricultural biomass residues from both a techno-economic and an environmental perspective. The biomass residues considered in this work concern tree pruning in nine different geographically dispersed prefectures of the Greek territory. An integrated methodology is proposed for assessing the potential of tree pruning biomass fired power plants. A systematic sensitivity analysis is also carried out in order to examine the effect of various economic parameter values on investment recovery time. It is shown that an increase in energy sale prices and/or a reduction in either the investment cost or the 'bio-fuel' price are crucial for the sustainable operation of biomass fired power plants in the country. Calculated results, based on real-world data, show that the direct combustion of pruning residues for electricity generation is very beneficial not only by economizing fossil fuels and providing new income opportunities, but also by leading to a low CO2 power generation.

AB  - The oviposition rhythm of individual flies of Drosophila melanogaster from a population maintained in an aperiodic environment (with light, temperature, humidity, and other factors which could provide time cues, kept constant) for several hundred generations was assayed in constant light (LL), in light/dark (LD 12:12 hr) cycle, and in constant darkness (DD). More than 50% of the flies assayed exhibited rhythmicity in oviposition in all three light regimes. The results indicate that the phenomenon of egg laying is rhythmic in individual D. melanogaster females and is controlled by an endogenous time keeping mechanism. The persistence of the oviposition rhythm in a large proportion of individuals in the population after several hundred generations of rearing in a constant environment strengthens the view that possessing biological clocks may confer some intrinsic fitness advantage even to organisms living in aperiodic environments.

AB  - Fuzzy-PID controller with derivative filter (Fuzzy-PIDF) is suggested in this article for automatic generation control in a two area multi-unit hydro thermal system. The controller scaling coefficients are tuned with a simple and a new powerful optimization technique called JAYA algorithm. Integral time absolute error (ITAE) is used as a fitness function to achieve the optimal parameters of the Fuzzy-PIDF controller with an abrupt load disturbance of 0.01p.u. applied in area 1. Further, this controller is scrutinized for robustness by increasing the loading in the system. The dynamic responses of this implemented controller being optimized by JAYA algorithm are evaluated and compared with the results of previously published article such as hybrid firefly algorithm and pattern search technique based PID controller in terms of peak undershoot, overshoot and settling time and supremacy is proved.

AB  - Ectotherms are classic models for understanding life-history tradeoffs, including the reproduction-somatic maintenance tradeoffs that may be reflected in telomere length and their dynamics. Importantly, life-history traits of ectotherms are tightly linked to their thermal environment, with diverse or synergistic mechanistic explanations underpinning the variation. Telomere dynamics potentially provide a mechanistic link that can be used to monitor thermal effects on individuals in response to climatic perturbations. Growth rate, age and developmental stage are all affected by temperature, which interacts with telomere dynamics in complex and intriguing ways. The physiological processes underpinning telomere dynamics can be visualized and understood using thermal performance curves (TPCs). TPCs reflect the evolutionary history and the thermal environment during an individual's ontogeny. Telomere maintenance should be enhanced at or near the thermal performance optimum of a species, population and individual. The thermal sensitivity of telomere dynamics should reflect the interacting TPCs of the processes underlying them. The key processes directly underpinning telomere dynamics are mitochondrial function (reactive oxygen production), antioxidant activity, telomerase activity and telomere endcap protein status. We argue that identifying TPCs for these processes will significantly help design robust, repeatable experiments and field studies of telomere dynamics in ectotherms. Conceptually, TPCs are a valuable framework to predict and interpret taxon- and population-specific telomere dynamics across thermal regimes. The literature of thermal effects on telomeres in ectotherms is sparse and mostly limited to vertebrates, but our conclusions and recommendations are relevant across ectothermic animals.

AB  - Life history traits can vary among populations of the same fish species in response to selective pressures exerted by the local environment. Here we used inter-population comparisons to investigate the effects of parasitism and variability in water temperature on life history traits in a New Zealand freshwater fish, the upland bully. Although age and size at maturity varied among populations, they were not significantly related to either temperature regime or average parasite load. Trade-offs between egg size and clutch size were only apparent in one of the seven populations when populations were analyzed separately but became clear when all data were pooled. However, neither average population clutch size or egg size was related to the population's mean parasite load or the local temperature regime. Although the latter two parameters may influence other life history variables, such as the number of clutches produced per season and the partitioning of eggs among clutches, there was no evidence that they influenced life history strategies of the upland bully populations investigated here.

AB  - Artificial selection is a powerful approach to unravel constraints on genetic adaptation. Although it has been frequently used to reveal genetic trade-offs among different fitness-related traits, only a few studies have targeted genetic correlations across developmental stages. Here, we test whether selection on increased cold tolerance in the adult stage increases cold resistance throughout ontogeny in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. We used lines selected for decreased chill-coma recovery time and corresponding controls, which had originally been set up from three levels of inbreeding (outbred control, one or two full-sib matings). Four generations after having terminated selection, a response to selection was found in 1-day-old butterflies (the age at which selection took place). Older adults showed a very similar although weaker response. Nevertheless, cold resistance did not increase in either egg, larval or pupal stage in the selection lines but was even lower compared to control lines for eggs and young larvae. These findings suggest a cost of increased adult cold tolerance, presumably reducing resource availability for offspring provisioning and thereby stress tolerance during development, which may substantially affect evolutionary trajectories.

AB  - The vulnerability of sessile organisms to warming temperatures may depend on their capacity to adaptively alter their expression of genes associated with stress mitigation. We compared the transcriptional profile of 2 populations of Sydney rock oysters Saccostrea glomerata (one that had been selectively bred over 7 generations for fast growth and disease resistance and one wild type that had not been subjected to selection) following exposure to an artificial temperature gradient in the field. Oysters were attached to white, grey or black stone pavers that experienced mean maximum substrate temperatures of approximately 34, 37 and 40 degrees C, respectively, at low tide. Across all pavers, selectively bred oysters suffered 12% higher mortality than wild-type oysters, although this difference was not significant. Expression profiles did not differ between oyster populations on the coolest (white) pavers. However, divergent transcriptional profiles of genes associated with the key intracellular stress mechanisms of antioxidant defence, heat shock re sponse, energy metabolism and the cytoskeleton were detected in oysters on the hottest (black) pavers. Expression of these genes was upregulated at high temperatures by the selectively bred oysters but displayed little change, or was suppressed at high temperature among the non-selected wild-type oysters. One potential explanation is that the selectively bred oysters have traded off rapid growth for a lower thermal maximum. Complementary physiological and ecological studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - Salmon from different locations in a watershed can have different life histories. It is often unclear to what extent this variation is a response to the current environmental conditions an individual experiences as opposed to local-scale genetic adaptation or the environment experienced early in development. We used a mark-recapture transplant experiment in the Shasta River, CA, to test whether life-history traits of juvenile Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha varied among locations, and whether individuals could adopt a new life history upon encountering new habitat type. The Shasta River, a Klamath River tributary, has two Chinook salmon spawning and juvenile rearing areas, a lower basin canyon (river km 0-12) and upper basin spring complex (river km 40-56), characterised by dramatically different in-stream habitats. In 2012 and 2013, we created three experimental groups: (i) fish caught, tagged and released in the upper basin; (ii) fish caught at the river mouth (confluence with the Klamath River, river km 0), tagged and released in the upper basin; and (iii) fish caught at the river mouth, tagged and released in the lower basin. Fish released in the upper basin outmigrated later and at a larger size than those released in the lower basin. The traits of fish transplanted to the upper basin were similar to fish originating in the upper basin. Chinook salmon juvenile life-history traits reflected habitat conditions fish experienced rather than those where they originated, indicating that habitat modification or transportation to new habitats can rapidly alter the life-history composition of populations.

AB  - PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Because not all plant species will be able to move in response to global warming, adaptive evolution matters largely for plant persistence. As prerequisites for adaptive evolution, genetic variation in and selection on phenotypic traits are needed, but these aspects have not been studied in tropical species. We studied how plants respond to transplantation to different elevations on Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, and whether there is quantitative genetic (among-seed family) variation in and selection on life-history traits and their phenotypic plasticity to the different environments.
   METHODS: We reciprocally transplanted seed families of 15 common tropical, herbaceous species of the montane and savanna vegetation zone at Mt. Kilimanjaro to a watered experimental garden in the montane (1450 m) and in the savanna (880 m) zone at the mountain's slope and measured performance, reproductive, and phenological traits.
   RESULTS: Plants generally performed worse in the savanna garden, indicating that the savanna climate was more stressful and thus that plants may suffer from future climate warming. We found significant quantitative genetic variation in all measured performance and reproductive traits in both gardens and for several measures of phenotypic plasticity in response to elevational transplantation. Moreover, we found positive selection on traits at low and intermediate trait values levelling to neutral or negative selection at high values.
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that common plants at Mt. Kilimanjaro express quantitative genetic variation in fitness-relevant traits and in their plasticities, suggesting potential to adapt evolutionarily to future climate warming and increased temperature variability.

AB  - Habitat fragmentation may change local climatic conditions leading to altered selection regimes for life-history traits in small ectotherms, including several insects. We investigated temperature-related performance in terms of fitness among populations of the woodland butterfly Pararge aegeria (L.) originating from populations of a closed, continuous woodland landscape versus populations of an open, highly fragmented agricultural landscape in central Belgium. Female fecundity and longevity were evaluated in a temperature-gradient experiment. As predicted, females of woodland landscape origin reached higher maximum daily fecundity and lifetime number of eggs than did agricultural landscape females at low ambient temperatures, but this reversed at high ambient temperature. Egg weight decreased with temperature, and eggs of woodland butterflies were smaller. Contrary to what is generally assumed, remaining thorax mass was a better predictor of lifetime reproductive output than was abdomen mass. Since we used the F2 generation from wild-caught females reared under common garden conditions, the observed effects are likely to rely on intrinsic, heritable variation. Our results suggest that differential selection regimes associated with different landscapes intervene by intraspecific variation in the response of a butterfly to variation in ambient temperature, and may thus be helpful when making predictions of future impacts on how wild populations respond to environmental conditions under a global change scenario, with increasing temperatures and fragmented landscapes.

AB  - Male and female codling moths, Cydia pomonella (L.), were heated with increasing doses of gamma radiation, and the moths were either inbred or outcrossed with fertile counterparts. Fecundity of untreated females mated with heated males declined slowly with increasing doses of radiation. However, fecundity of treated females declined almost linearly with dose at approximate to 22% per 100 Gy. The minimum dose at which treated females were found to be 100% sterile when mated to untreated males was 100 Gy. This dose was much lower than previously suggested. Fertility of treated males declined almost linearly to approach 0 near 400 Gy. Inherited effects resulting from irradiation of P-1 males at selected doses were recorded for the F-1 generation. As the dose of radiation increased, F-1 fecundity and fertility decreased, mortality increased, and the F-1 sex ratio shifted in favor of male progeny. The effect of releasing partially sterile codling moth males and fully sterile females at a 10:1 overflooding ratio in conjunction with untreated codling moths was examined in field cages each containing a single apple tree. Fruit damage was significantly reduced in all treatments when compared with controls, and production of F-1 progeny were seen in cages containing moths treated with 100 Gy.

AB  - Humidification can suppress water loss from an organism and has great potential for improving the cold storage of short-lived arthropods, such as predatory mites. The effectiveness of humidity-controlled cold storage was recently verified for Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) females but was not examined for males. Combining both males and females in one storage protocol might increase the predator population because it would enhance the opportunity for multiple mating, which is necessary for females to maximize their egg production. Newly emerged adult males were stored at an air temperature of 5 degrees C and relative humidity (RH) of 100% or 80%. The median survival time (LT50) was 32days at 100% RH and 14days at 80% RH; the survival curves differed significantly. Males stored at 100% RH for 0, 10, 20 and 30days were introduced to virgin females for mating at 25 degrees C to evaluate their reproductive ability. The pre-oviposition period was significantly prolonged in the females mated with males stored for 20days. No negative effects of storage were observed on the oviposition period, total number of eggs or net reproduction rate (R0) in the females mated with males stored for 20days or on the mean generation time (T) for those stored for 30days. A slight decrease in the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was observed in the females mated with males stored for 20days. Our storage method can preserve N.californicus males for 20days with only a minor reduction in their survival and reproductive ability.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity plays a key role in modulating how environmental variation influences population dynamics, but we have only rudimentary understanding of how plasticity interacts with the magnitude and predictability of environmental variation to affect population dynamics and persistence. We developed a stochastic individual-based model, in which phenotypes could respond to a temporally fluctuating environmental cue and fitness depended on the match between the phenotype and a randomly fluctuating trait optimum, to assess the absolute fitness and population dynamic consequences of plasticity under different levels of environmental stochasticity and cue reliability. When cue and optimum were tightly correlated, plasticity buffered absolute fitness from environmental variability, and population size remained high and relatively invariant. In contrast, when this correlation weakened and environmental variability was high, strong plasticity reduced population size, and populations with excessively strong plasticity had substantially greater extinction probability. Given that environments might become more variable and unpredictable in the future owing to anthropogenic influences, reaction norms that evolved under historic selective regimes could imperil populations in novel or changing environmental contexts. We suggest that demographic models (e.g. population viability analyses) would benefit from a more explicit consideration of how phenotypic plasticity influences population responses to environmental change.

AB  - Sepia pharaonis, the pharaoh cuttlefish was cultured through multiple generations in the laboratory (5 consecutive generations) using closed, recirculating water filtration systems. The eggs of the original parental generation (G(P)) were spawned by a wild caught Gulf of Thailand female in a local fisheries laboratory, then packed and shipped air cargo to Texas where hatching occurred. The culture temperature ranged 25degrees- 28 degreesC, except for one generation that was chilled intentionally to 21 degreesC and then warmed to 25 degreesC after 9.6 months. Spawning occurred as early as day 161. Spawning output was high in all generations except the group that was cultured at 21 degreesC. Egg fertility was low in captivity (< 20%), but hatchling survival was high (> 70%). The average egg incubation time was 13.6 d at 25-28 degreesC. The largest spawn resulted in 600 viable hatchlings and the smallest resulted in 11 hatchlings. The cuttlefish ate a wide variety of estuarine crustaceans and fishes as well as frozen shrimp. There were no apparent disease problems since survival from hatching to maturity was over 70%. The average life span for cuttlefish cultured at 25-28 degreesC was 8.9 months and 12.3 months at 21 degreesC. Size at hatching was measured for fourth generation (G(4)) hatchlings; the mean weight at hatching was 0.103 g and the mean mantle length was 6.4 mm. The largest cuttlefish cultured was a male 300 mm ML and 3,045 g; the oldest cuttlefish lived 340 d. This cuttlefish species presents an excellent choice for commercial mariculture because of its rapid growth, short life span, tolerance to crowding and handling, resistance to disease and feeding habits.

AB  - Knowledge of the life history of populations at the warm edge of their distributional range can provide a better understanding of how they will adapt to climate warming, including potential poleward redistribution. The range of Gray Snapper Lutjanus griseus has the potential to expand along its northern temperate fringe, but little is known about this species in the warmest portion of its range. We studied the age, growth, reproduction, and mortality of commercially caught Gray Snapper in the Guatemalan Caribbean, where sea surface temperature consistently exceeds 26 degrees C. Longevity was estimated as 10 years, and von Bertalanffy growth parameters that were consolidated through Bayesian estimation incorporating earlier estimates from the Caribbean region were as follows: asymptotic length (L-infinity) was 35 cm, the growth coefficient (K) was 0.56 year(-1), and the theoretical age at zero length (t(0)) was -0.7 year. Gray Snapper grew slowest in April, prior to the rainy season, and at the onset of the reproductive season, which lasted to September. Fifty percent of the Gray Snapper matured at 31 cm and at 3.5 years of age. Gray Snapper had a lower maximum size, longevity, and peak reproductive investment, a protracted spawning season and reproductive life span, and elevated natural mortality at the warm edge of their distribution relative to temperate climates. Despite the plasticity in life history of Gray Snapper observed in this study, their potential to further adapt to warming remains unknown.

AB  - The main results of a theoretical work on the use of a low temperature heat source for power generation through a carbon dioxide transcritical power cycle are reported in this paper. The procedure for analyzing the behaviour of the proposed cycle consisted in modifying the input pressure to the turbine from 66 bar, maintained constant each evaluated temperature (60 degrees C, 90 degrees C, 120 degrees C and 150 degrees C) until the net work was approximately zero. As a result, the maximum exergy efficiency was 50%, while the energy efficiencies obtained were 9.8%, 7.3%, 4.9% and 2.4% and the net specific work was 18.2 kJ/kg, 12.8 kJ/kg, 7.8 kJ/kg and 3.5 kJ/kg, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of the addition of an internal heat exchanger, which obviously supposed an increase in the efficiency, was analyzed. The analysis of the proposed system shows the viability of implementing this type of process as an energy alternative and/or strengthener of non-conventional energy sources in non-provided zones, or for increasing the energy efficiency in the industry.

AB  - The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is one of the most important pests of crucifers worldwide. Susceptibility to insecticides and host plants of P. xylostella vary geographically. To investigate local adaptation, we measured the variation of the biology, life-histories and life-table parameters of P. xylostella populations from five widely ranging geographical regions in China, Beijing (BJ), Shandong (SD), Shaanxi (SX), Yunnan (YN), and Guangdong (GD), using the same variety of cabbage (Brassicae oleracea L. var. capitata; var. "Qingan 80'') as the food plant at the same temperature in the laboratory. Principal components analysis showed the life-history and life-table parameters of P. xylostella differed among the five geographical populations. The first component, including female fecundity and adult longevity and male adult longevity, accounted for the most variation among the five geographical regions, which can be classified into three groups: BJ-SX, YN-GD, and SD. The intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) was greatest in BJ and SX, intermediate for GD and YN, and the lowest for SD, whereas mean generation time (T) was greatest in SD, intermediate for YN and GD, and the lowest for BJ and SX. These variations reflect the importance of local genetic adaptation and should be considered when planning management of P. xylostella in China.

AB  - Heat resistance of ectotherms can be increased both by plasticity and evolution, but these effects may have trade-offs resulting from biotic interactions. Here, we test for predation costs in Drosophila melanogaster populations with altered heat resistance produced by adult hardening and directional selection for increased heat resistance. In addition, we also tested for genetic trade-offs by testing heat resistance in lines that have evolved under increased predation risk. We show that while 35/37 degrees C hardening increases heat resistance as expected, it does not increase predation risk from jumping spiders or mantids; in fact, there was an indication that survival may have increased under predation following a triple 37 degrees C compared to a single 35 degrees C hardening treatment. Flies that survived a 39 degrees C selection cycle showed lower survival under predation, suggesting a predation cost of exposure to a more severe heat stress. There was, however, no correlated response to selection because survival did not differ between control and selected lines after selection was relaxed for one or two generations. In addition, lines selected for increased predation risk did not differ in heat resistance. Our findings suggest independent evolutionary responses to predation and heat as measured in laboratory assays, and no costs of heat hardening on susceptibility to predation.

AB  - The level of phenotypic plasticity displayed within a population (i.e. the slope of the reaction norm) reflects the short-term response of a population to environmental change, while variation in reaction norm slopes among populations reflects spatial variation in these responses. Thus far, studies of thermal reaction norm variation have focused on geographically driven adaptation among different latitudes, altitudes or habitats. Yet, thermal variability is a function of both space and time. For organisms that reproduce at different times of year, such variation has the potential to promote adaptive variability in thermal responses for critical early life stages. Using common-garden experiments, we examined the spatial scale of genetic variation in thermal plasticity for early life-history traits among five populations of endangered Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) that spawn at different times of year. Patterns of plasticity for larval growth and survival suggest that population responses to climate change will differ substantially, with increasing water temperatures posing a considerably greater threat to autumn-spawning cod than to those that spawn in winter or spring. Adaptation to seasonal cooling or warming experienced during the larval stage is suggested as a possible cause. Furthermore, populations that experience relatively cold temperatures during early life might be more sensitive to changes in temperature. Substantial divergence in adaptive traits was evident at a smaller spatial scale than has previously been shown for a marine fish with no apparent physical barriers to gene flow (similar to 200 km). Our findings highlight the need to consider the impact of intraspecific variation in reproductive timing on thermal adaptation when forecasting the effects of climate change on animal populations.

AB  - Additive genetic variation for fitness at vulnerable life stages governs the adaptive potential of populations facing stressful conditions under climate change, and can depend on current conditions as well as those experienced by past stages or generations. For sexual populations, fertilization is the key stage that links one generation to the next, yet the effects of fertilization environment on the adaptive potential at the vulnerable stages that then unfold during development are rarely considered, despite climatic stress posing risks for gamete function and fertility in many taxa and external fertilizers especially. Here, we develop a simple fitness landscape model exploring the effects of environmental stress at fertilization and development on the adaptive potential in early life. We then test our model with a quantitative genetic breeding design exposing family groups of a marine external fertilizer, the tubeworm Galeolaria caespitosa, to a factorial manipulation of current and projected temperatures at fertilization and development. We find that adaptive potential in early life is substantially reduced, to the point of being no longer detectable, by genotype-specific carryover effects of fertilization under projected warming. We interpret these results in light of our fitness landscape model, and argue that the thermal environment at fertilization deserves more attention than it currently receives when forecasting the adaptive potential of populations confronting climate change.

AB  - We have studied the relative fitnesses of three genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster in 50 environments. Two genotypes, the MA lines, had accumulated mutations in the absence of natural selection over 62 generations. The third was a related strain where selection had continued to act. The environments differed in three factors: parental density, dilution of the medium, and the temperature regime and medium composition. Our measure of fitness assessed fecundity and viability relative to a reference genotype. Both MA lines always had lower fitnesses than the selected line, but the difference increased dramatically with dilution of the medium and, especially, crowding. Under the most severe conditions, the performance of the MA lines approached 0. This increased difference in harsh conditions may be caused both by a uniform increase in the magnitude of deleterious effects of all mutations and by the exposure of mutations which are essentially neutral under benign conditions. If the second cause is important, previous experiments are likely to have underestimated the genomic deleterious mutation rate in Drosophila melanogaster more than previously thought.

AB  - Background: Virulence is often coupled with replicative fitness of viruses in vertebrate systems, yet the relationship between virulence and fitness of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) in invertebrates has not been evaluated. Although the interactions between vector-borne pathogens and their invertebrate hosts have been characterized as being largely benign, some costs of arbovirus exposure have been identified for mosquitoes. The extent to which these costs may be strain-specific and the subsequent consequences of these interactions on vector and virus evolution has not been adequately explored.
   Results: Using West Nile virus (WNV) and Culex pipiens mosquitoes, we tested the hypothesis that intrahost fitness is correlated with virulence in mosquitoes by evaluating life history traits following exposure to either non-infectious bloodmeals or bloodmeals containing wildtype (WNV WT) or the high fitness, mosquito-adapted strain, WNV MP20 derived from WNV WT. Our results demonstrate strain-specific effects on mosquito survival, fecundity, and blood feeding behavior. Specifically, both resistance to and infection with WNV MP20, but not WNV WT, decreased survival of Cx. pipiens and altered fecundity and bloodfeeding such that early egg output was enhanced at a later cost.
   Conclusions: As predicted by the trade-off hypothesis of virulence, costs of infection with WNV MP20 in terms of survival were directly correlated to viral load, yet resistance to infection with this virulent strain was equally costly. Taken together, these results demonstrate that WNV MP20 infection decreases the transmission potential of Cx. pipiens populations despite the increased intrahost fitness of this strain, indicating that a virulence-transmission trade-off in invertebrates could contribute significantly to the adaptive and evolutionary constraint of arboviruses.

AB  - We evaluated the effects of constant low-temperature storage on Diaeretiella rapae (McIntosh) (Braconidae, Aphidiinae). Diaeretiella rapae mummies were stored at 5 +/- 1A degrees C for 0-36 days. The percentage of D. rapae emergence varied (100-83%) after 0-32 days of storage. After 32 days, emergence reduced to 55%. According to our Probit analysis, 50% mortality (LT50) of the population of D. rapae was reached after 40 days of storage at 5A degrees C. Storage for up to 32 days did not negatively affect emergence and survival. Cold exposure of D. rapae for 36 days did not influence morphological malformations, sex ratio, and emergence of the F1 generation. After 4-36 days of storage, D. rapae showed a gradual decrease in emergence, longevity, reproductive capacity, and F1 sex ratio. Diaeretiella rapae can be stored for up to 24 days at 5A degrees C, at which time the percentage of parasitism and the F1 sex ratio remain above 38% and at 0.50, respectively.

AB  - Energy restriction increases stress resistance and lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster and other species. The roles of individual nutrients in stress resistance and longevity are largely unknown. The vitamin biotin is a potential candidate for mediating these effects, given its known roles in stress signaling and gene regulation by epigenetic mechanisms, i.e. biotinylation of histones. Here, we tested the hypothesis that prolonged culture of Drosophila on biotin-deficient (BD) medium increases stress resistance and lifespan. Flies were fed a BD diet for multiple generations; controls were fed a biotin-normal diet. In some experiments, a third group of flies was fed a BID diet for 12 generations and then switched to control diets for 2 generations to eliminate potential effects of short-term biotin deficiency. Flies fed a BID diet exhibited a 30% increase in lifespan. This increase was associated with enhanced resistance to the DNA-damaging agent hydroxyurea and heat stress. Also, fertility increased significantly compared with biotin-normal controls. Biotinylation of histones was barely detectable in biotin-deprived flies, suggesting that epigenetic events might have contributed to effects of biotin deprivation.

AB  - A major goal of seasonal biology is to understand how selection on phenology and the physiological niche interact. In oviparous species, fitness variation across the growing season suggests that phenological shifts will alter selective environments experienced by embryos. We hypothesize that physiology could become co-adapted with phenology; such that embryos perform better in the environmental conditions they are adapted to compared to embryos adapted to other environments (temporal matching). Here, we tested for temporal matching to seasonal changes in the environmental temperatures with toad-headed lizard, Phrynocephalus przewalskii, which inhabits the temperate desert steppe of China. We used a split-clutch reciprocal experiment, by incubating eggs from early- and late-breeding females at rising and falling temperature regimes, respectively, to separate the influence of intrinsic (genetic and parental) vs. extrinsic factors (developmental plasticity or acclimatization) on the performance and fitness of offspring. Eggs from early-breeding females were with higher quality than those from late-breeding females, likely due to better maternal provisioning. Offspring from early-breeding females had higher selected body temperatures and metabolic rates than those from late-breeding females. Falling temperatures that may indicate the end of the growing season, reduced incubation duration and increased metabolic rates for both early and late eggs, compared to rising temperatures. Late hatchlings had higher growth rates when incubated at falling compared to rising temperatures, while growth rates of early hatchlings were not sensitive to incubation temperature. Thus, growth and survival rates of late embryos were similar to early embryos under falling temperatures, despite early embryos being of generally higher quality. Overall, our study confirms that "early is higher quality." Intrinsic factors dominate offspring performance and fitness, with a general advantage for early embryos throughout the season. We found some support for temporal matching, demonstrating that late embryos with lower quality have physiological strategies that are specialized to late-season environments, allowing them to attain similar fitness in late-season environments to that of early embryos.

AB  - The southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.), and its congeneric species, Nezara antennata Scott, are major agricultural pests in Japan. Here, I investigated seasonal trends in light trap capture rates, as well as female ovarian development of these two species from 2009 to 2014 in Kumamoto, Japan. Each year, both species first appeared in the traps in May, and large numbers were caught between July and August. Both mature and immature females were caught. For both species, ovarian development followed a similar seasonal pattern in 2009 and 2010, but the patterns differed between the species. The development of reproductive organs was similar to that in previous reports from wild populations, demonstrating the usefulness of light-trapped females in clarifying their life-history traits (e.g., the number of generations per year, the timing of oviposition, and timing of occurrence for each generation). The trap capture data of N. viridula until the end of July and its preceding winter temperatures were positively related. Thus, winter temperature is a useful predictor of the relative abundance of N. viridula in wild populations.

AB  - WC-Co, which is also known as cemented carbide, is widely used in metal cutting industry and wear related application due to their excellent mechanical properties. Manufacturing industries are focusing on improving productivity and reducing operational cost with machining operation is considered as one of the factors. Thus, machining conditions are becoming more severe and required better cutting tool bit with improved mechanical properties to withstand high temperature operation. Numerous studies have been made over the generation for further improvement of cemented carbide properties to meet the constant increase in demand. However, the results of these studies vary due to different process parameters and manufacturing technology. This paper summarizes the studies to improve the properties of WC-Co composite using different consolidation (powder size, mixing method, formulation, etc) and sintering parameters (temperature, time, atmosphere, etc).

AB  - Background: Flow sheet options for integrating ethanol production from spent sulfite liquor (SSL) into the acid-based sulfite pulping process at the Sappi Saiccor mill (Umkomaas, South Africa) were investigated, including options for generation of thermal and electrical energy from onsite bio-wastes, such as bark. Processes were simulated with Aspen Plus (R) for mass- and energy-balances, followed by an estimation of the economic viability and environmental impacts. Various concentration levels of the total dissolved solids in magnesium oxide-based SSL, which currently fuels a recovery boiler, prior to fermentation was considered, together with return of the fermentation residues (distillation bottoms) to the recovery boiler after ethanol separation. The generation of renewable thermal and electrical energy from onsite bio-wastes were also included in the energy balance of the combined pulping-ethanol process, in order to partially replace coal consumption. The bio-energy supplementations included the combustion of bark for heat and electricity generation and the bio-digestion of the calcium oxide SSL to produce methane as additional energy source.
   Results: Ethanol production from SSL at the highest substrate concentration was the most economically feasible when coal was used for process energy. However this solution did not provide any savings in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the concentration-fermentation-distillation process. Maximizing the use of renewable energy sources to partially replace coal consumption yielded a satisfactory economic performance, with a minimum ethanol selling price of 0.83 US$/l, and a drastic reduction in the overall greenhouse gas emissions for the entire facility.
   Conclusion: High substrate concentrations and conventional distillation should be used when considering integrating ethanol production at sulfite pulping mills. Bio-wastes generated onsite should be utilized at their maximum potential for energy generation in order to maximize the GHG emissions reduction.

AB  - The variegated ladybird, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is a newly recorded species in Egypt, as such a little information is available on its biology. Certain reproductive and life history attributes of H. variegata were studied under laboratory conditions on five aphid species, i.e. Aphis fabae Scpoli, A gossypii Glover, A nerii Boyer de Fonscolombe, Brevicoryne brassicae (Linn.) and Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas) (Homoptera: Aphididae). Amongst the tested preys, H. variegata developed and reproduced successfully On all preys except A. nerii. The latter caused high mortality (> 90%) of immature stages. Preimaginal developmental time was the longest (17.62 days), when the beetle was fed on B. brassicae while the shortest (14.88 days) was on A. gossypii. A significant increase in the number of prey consumption by the 3rd and 4th larval instars of H. variegata was observed. Total number of consumed preys during the entire larval stage was highest (279.80 nymphs) for M euphorbiae and lowest (178.16 nymphs) for B. brassicae. The prey species had significant effect on larval and generation survival. As for adult stage, the values of ovipositional periods, male and female longevities, daily and lifetime fecundity as well as number of preys consumed differed significantly at different aphid prey species. However, total number of preys consumed by males did not differ on different prey species. Females of H. variegata that fed on M euphorbiae had the highest net reproductive rate (R-o), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), finite rate of increase (lambda) with subsequent shortest mean generation time (T) and doubling time (DT). However, the life table attributes of H. variegata were lowest, when fed on B. brassicae. Therefore, M euphorbiae and A. gossypii seemed to be the most suitable prey species among the tested aphid species for rearing H variegata.

AB  - BACKGROUNDVariation in response to insecticidal proteins is common upon repetition of insect bioassays. Understanding this variation is a prerequisite to detecting biologically important differences. We tracked neonate Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) susceptibility to Vip3Aa19 over 17 generations using standardized bioassay methods. Five larval pretreatment conditions and one bioassay condition were tested to determine whether susceptibility was affected. These included: storage time; prefeeding; storage at reduced temperature; storage at reduced humidity; colony introgression of field-collected individuals. Extremes of photoperiod during the bioassay itself were also examined.
   RESULTSLC50 values for two strains of S. frugiperda varied 6.6-fold or 8.8-fold over 17 generations. Storage time and humidity had no impact on Vip3Aa19 susceptibility, whereas prefeeding significantly reduced subsequent mortality (by 27%). Storage at reduced temperature increased mortality for one colony (from 45.6 to 73.0%) but not for the other. Introgression of field-collected individuals affected susceptibility at the first generation but not for subsequent generations. A 24 h bioassay photophase significantly reduced susceptibility (by 26%) for both colonies.
   CONCLUSIONCertain pretreatment and bioassay conditions were identified that can affect S. frugiperdaVip3Aa19 susceptibility, but innate larval heterogeneity was also present. Our observations should help to increase the consistency of insecticidal protein bioassay results. (c) 2015 Syngenta Crop Protection, LLC.

AB  - Complex life history behaviours like spawning migrations can complicate population assessments. However, predictable aggregation of populations at certain times of year (e.g. at spawning grounds) presents an effective way to sample species that are otherwise spatially widespread. From 2014 to 2019, a mark-recapture study on Green Bay northern pike (Esox lucius) entering a spawning wetland was used to estimate apparent survival and population size using Bayesian inference and the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model. Population estimates and apparent survival varied from 446 to 1949 and 0.22 (males in 2017) to 0.63 (males in 2015), respectively, among years. Apparent survival also increased with maximum mean daily water temperature. Estimated capture probability was consistently low across years (<30%) despite a sampling method with high capture efficiency of fish present at the wetland, suggesting Green Bay northern pike may be exhibiting low spawning site fidelity or other life history behaviours, like skipped spawning, which reduce their capture probability at a single wetland over time. Further, spawning site selection and timing may respond to water temperatures. Surveying multiple sites could further elucidate important life history traits while refining estimates of population size and structure in large systems.

AB  - Background: Life history traits like developmental time, age and size at maturity are directly related to fitness in all organisms and play a major role in adaptive evolution and speciation processes. Comparative genomic or transcriptomic approaches to identify positively selected genes involved in species divergence can help to generate hypotheses on the driving forces behind speciation. Here we use a bottom-up approach to investigate this hypothesis by comparative analysis of orthologous transcripts of four closely related European Radix species.
   Results: Snails of the genus Radix occupy species specific distribution ranges with distinct climatic niches, indicating a potential for natural selection driven speciation based on ecological niche differentiation. We then inferred phylogenetic relationships among the four Radix species based on whole mt-genomes plus 23 nuclear loci. Three different tests to infer selection and changes in amino acid properties yielded a total of 134 genes with signatures of positive selection. The majority of these genes belonged to the functional gene ontology categories "reproduction" and "genitalia" with an overrepresentation of the functions "development" and "growth rate".
   Conclusions: We show here that Radix species divergence may be primarily enforced by selection on life history traits such as (larval-) development and growth rate. We thus hypothesise that life history differences may confer advantages under the according climate regimes, e.g., species occupying warmer and dryer habitats might have a fitness advantage with fast developing susceptible life stages, which are more tolerant to habitat desiccation.

AB  - The life history of polysphinctine parasitoids is poorly understood. As a result, their effect on their host has not been evaluated. Here, we present the phenology of Zatypota percontatoria, an ectoparasitoid wasp of theridiid spiders, using rich field, semi-field and laboratory investigations of selected life-history parameters. The wasps overwintered as larva attached to the spider abdomen and the imagos of the first generation emerged at the beginning of May. The sex ratio (F/M) of overwintered wasp larvae was 1.4. The wasp spent an average of 6.4 days in the egg stage, 27.67 days in the larval stage and 9.6 days in the pupal stage. Adult longevity was on average 14.34 days. Oviposition occurred on average 8.44 days following maturity. Thewasp laid on average 0.35 eggs/day. The total fecundity was on average 7.4 eggs per wasp and decreased with age (data from unmated females). The developmental rate increased with experimental temperature up to 28 degrees C. The lower developmental threshold for pupae was estimated at 6.6 degrees C. The sum of effective temperatures for pupae was estimated at 157.8 degree days. Using daily temperature records from the Czech Republic over the last 41 years, we estimated an average of 3.5 generations of Z. percontatoria per year. Mortality was 48% in semi-field conditions and 23% in the laboratory. The incidence of mortality was highest during egg and larval stages caused by the detachment of eggs or larvae during spider molting, the mortality of the spider-host and egg deposition on the spider prosoma.

AB  - Garcia-Marques et al. present CLADES, an innovative approach to study neuronal lineages based on CRISPR. Inspired by synthetic biology, CLADES relies on a system of genetic switches to activate and inactivate reporter genes in a predetermined order.
   We present CLADES (cell lineage access driven by an edition sequence), a technology for cell lineage studies based on CRISPR-Cas9 techniques. CLADES relies on a system of genetic switches to activate and inactivate reporter genes in a predetermined order. Targeting CLADES to progenitor cells allows the progeny to inherit a sequential cascade of reporters, thereby coupling birth order to reporter expression. This system, which can also be temporally induced by heat shock, enables the temporal resolution of lineage development and can therefore be used to deconstruct an extended cell lineage by tracking the reporters expressed in the progeny. When targeted to the germ line, the same cascade progresses across animal generations, predominantly marking each generation with the corresponding combination of reporters. CLADES therefore offers an innovative strategy for making programmable cascades of genes that can be used for genetic manipulation or to record serial biological events.

AB  - Ecological factors are known to cause evolutionary diversification. Recent work has shown that evolution in strongly interacting predator species has reciprocal impacts on ecosystems. These divergent impacts of predators may alter the selective landscape and cause the evolution of prey. Yet, this link between intraspecific variation and evolution is unexplored. We compared the life history of a species of zooplankton (Daphnia ambigua) from lakes in New England in which the dominant planktivorous predator, the alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), differs in feeding traits and migratory behaviour. Anadromous alewife (seasonal migrants) exhibit larger gapes, gill-raker spacing and target larger prey than landlocked alewife (year-round freshwater resident). In 'anadromous' lakes, Daphnia are abundant in the spring but extirpated by alewife predation in summer. Daphnia are rare year-round in 'landlocked' lakes. We show that Daphnia from lakes with anadromous alewife grew faster, matured earlier but at the same size and produced more offspring than Daphnia from lakes with landlocked or no alewife across multiple temperature and resource treatments. Our results are inconsistent with a response to size-selective predation but are better explained as an adaptation to colder temperatures and shorter periods of development (countergradient variation) mediated by seasonal alewife predation.

AB  - The present experiments are part of a larger study designed to investigate the influence of husbandry parameters on the life history of the ramshorn snail, Marisa cornuarietis, in order to identify suitable husbandry conditions for maintaining multi-generation populations in the laboratory for use in ecotoxicological testing. In this paper we focus on the effects of a combination of food types and feeding frequencies (i.e., the frequency with which the snails were offered food) on juvenile growth and survival at different temperatures. Offspring produced in the laboratory by wild specimens of M. cornuarietis, from Puerto Rico, were used to test the effects of three types of food (lettuce, alginate with fish food, alginate with snail mix) fed at three frequencies (given ad libitum on 4/4, 2/4, or 1/4 d) on juvenile survival and growth. The 4-d feeding regimens were repeated four times, giving a total of 16 d for the experiments. The experiments were conducted at two temperatures (22 degrees and 25 degrees C) under a 12 h light:12 h dark photoperiod. Juvenile growth rates increased with increasing feeding frequency for all food types. The most rapid growth rates occurred in the high-frequency lettuce treatments and the slowest growth rates in the low-frequency lettuce and alginate with snail mix treatments. Juvenile snails grew faster at 25 degrees than at 22 degrees C, and mortality was about twice as high at the lower temperature. Growth rates were used to provide a rough estimate of time to maturity, which was determined to take about twice as long at 22 degrees than at 25 degrees C. The results showed that lettuce is the best food if supplied in abundance, but effects on growth are very dependent on feeding frequency and temperature. We conclude that 25 degrees C is a more appropriate temperature for maintaining populations than 22 degrees C, that lettuce provides a suitable food source, and that food should be supplied continuously for husbandry and toxicity testing of populations of M. cornuarietis.

AB  - Carbon dioxide concentrations in the surface ocean are increasing owing to rising CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere(1). Higher CO2 levels are predicted to affect essential physiological processes of many aquatic organisms(2,3), leading to widespread impacts on marine diversity and ecosystem function, especially when combined with the effects of global warming(4-6). Yet the ability for marine species to adjust to increasing CO2 levels over many generations is an unresolved issue. Here we show that ocean conditions projected for the end of the century (approximately 1,000 mu atm CO2 and a temperature rise of 1.5-3.0 degrees C) cause an increase in metabolic rate and decreases in length, weight, condition and Survival of juvenile fish. However, these effects are absent or reversed when parents also experience high CO2 concentrations. Our results show that non-genetic parental effects can dramatically alter the response of marine organisms to increasing CO2 and demonstrate that some species have more capacity to - acclimate to ocean acidification than previously thought.

AB  - Background: Local adaptation can drive the divergence of populations but identification of the traits under selection remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Reciprocal transplant experiments are ideal tests of local adaptation, yet rarely used for higher vertebrates because of the mobility and potential invasiveness of non-native organisms. Here, we reciprocally transplanted 2500 brown trout (Salmo trutta) embryos from five populations to investigate local adaptation in early life history traits. Embryos were bred in a full-factorial design and raised in natural riverbeds until emergence. Customized egg capsules were used to simulate the natural redd environment and allowed tracking the fate of every individual until retrieval. We predicted that 1) within sites, native populations would outperform non-natives, and 2) across sites, populations would show higher performance at 'home' compared to 'away' sites.
   Results: There was no evidence for local adaptation but we found large differences in survival and hatching rates between sites, indicative of considerable variation in habitat quality. Survival was generally high across all populations (55% +/- 3%), but ranged from 4% to 89% between sites. Average hatching rate was 25% +/- 3% across populations ranging from 0% to 62% between sites.
   Conclusion: This study provides rare empirical data on variation in early life history traits in a population network of a salmonid, and large-scale breeding and transplantation experiments like ours provide powerful tests for local adaptation. Despite the recently reported genetic and morphological differences between the populations in our study area, local adaptation at the embryo level is small, non-existent, or confined to ecological conditions that our experiment could not capture.

AB  - Longevity is modulated by a range of conserved genes in eukaryotes, but it is unclear how variation in these genes contributes to the evolution of longevity in nature. Mutations that increase life span in model organisms typically induce trade-offs which lead to a net reduction in fitness, suggesting that such mutations are unlikely to become established in natural populations. However, the fitness consequences of manipulating longevity have rarely been assessed in heterogeneous environments, in which stressful conditions are encountered. Using laboratory selection experiments, we demonstrate that long-lived, stress-resistant Caenorhabditis elegans age-1(hx546) mutants have higher fitness than the wild-type genotype if mixed genotype populations are periodically exposed to high temperatures when food is not limited. We further establish, using stochastic population projection models, that the age-1(hx546) mutant allele can confer a selective advantage if temperature stress is encountered when food availability also varies over time. Our results indicate that heterogeneity in environmental stress may lead to altered allele frequencies over ecological timescales and indirectly drive the evolution of longevity. This has important implications for understanding the evolution of life-history strategies.

AB  - Substantial differences in both life-table characteristics and reproductive patterns distinguish bdelloid from monogonont rotifers. Bdelloids reproduce only asexually, whereas most monogononts are cyclical parthenogens. We explore some of the adaptive consequences of these life-history differences using a computer model to simulate the evolutionary acquisition of new beneficial mutations. A one-locus mutation-selection regime based on the life-history characteristics of bdelloids indicates that asexuals can maintain higher levels of both allelic and genotypic diversity over a longer time period than obligate sexuals. These results are produced by differences in the magnitude of random genetic drift (RGD) associated with the different types of reproduction. Cyclical parthenogens have significantly higher evolutionary rates than sexual forms in a single-locus model, but incorporate beneficial mutations more slowly than sexuals in a two-locus simulation. Our results are therefore strongly influenced by the number of loci being evaluated as well as the pattern of reproduction. The asexual life history was found to maintain higher levels of allelic diversity than any pattern including sexual reproduction. This intriguing finding is amplified as the number of loci undergoing selection is increased. We end by considering the adaptive consequences of the remarkably divergent life histories found in typical bdelloid and monogonont rotifers.

AB  - There is considerable evidence for an adaptive role of inversions, but how their genetic content evolves and affects the subsequent evolution of chromosomal polymorphism remains controversial. Here, we track how life-history traits, chromosomal arrangements and 22 microsatellites, within and outside inversions, change in three replicated populations of Drosophila sub-obscura for 30 generations of laboratory evolution since founding from the wild. The dynamics of fitness-related traits indicated adaptation to the new environment concomitant with directional evolution of chromosomal polymorphism. Evidence of selective changes in frequency of inversions was obtained for seven of 23 chromosomal arrangements, corroborating a role for inversions in adaptation. The evolution of linkage disequilibrium between some microsatellites and chromosomes suggested that adaptive changes in arrangements involved changes in their genetic content. Several microsatellite alleles increased in frequency more than expected by drift in targeted inversions in all replicate populations. In particular, there were signs of selection in the O3+4 arrangement favouring a combination of alleles in two loci linked to the inversion and changing along with it, although the lack of linkage disequilibrium between these loci precludes epistatic selection. Seven other alleles increased in frequency within inversions more than expected by drift, but were not in linkage disequilibrium with them. Possibly these alleles were hitchhiking along with alleles under selection that were not specific to those inversions. Overall, the selection detected on the genetic content of inversions, despite limited coverage of the genome, suggests that genetic changes within inversions play an important role in adaptation.

AB  - Transgenerational effects can buffer populations against environmental change, yet little is known about underlying mechanisms, their persistence or the influence of environmental cue timing. We investigated mitochondrial respiratory capacity (MRC) and gene expression of marine sticklebacks that experienced acute or developmental acclimation to simulated ocean warming (21 degrees C) across three generations. Previous work showed that acute acclimation of grandmothers to 21 degrees C led to lower (optimized) offspring MRCs. Here, developmental acclimation of mothers to 21 degrees C led to higher, but more efficient offspring MRCs. Offspring with a 21 degrees C x 17 degrees C grandmother-mother environment mismatch showed metabolic compensation: their MRCs were as low as offspring with a 17 degrees C thermal history across generations. Transcriptional analyses showed primarily maternal but also grandmaternal environment effects: genes involved in metabolism and mitochondrial protein biosynthesis were differentially expressed when mothers developed at 21 degrees C, whereas 21 degrees C grandmothers influenced genes involved in hemostasis and apoptosis. Genes involved in mitochondrial respiration all showed higher expression when mothers developed at 21 degrees and lower expression in the 21 degrees C x 17 degrees C group, matching the phenotypic pattern for MRCs. Our study links transcriptomics to physiology under climate change, and demonstrates that mechanisms underlying transgenerational effects persist across multiple generations with specific outcomes depending on acclimation type and environmental mismatch between generations.

AB  - Studies of broadcast spawning in corals are fundamental to our understanding of early life history characteristics, reproductive biology, restoration etc. Spawning of corals for research is routinely conducted, but this is mostly restricted to sites adjacent to reefs and from broodstock collected from the wild just prior to gamete release. Only recently has it been possible to induce predictable broadcast spawning in an ex situ environment, and nobody has successfully closed the life cycle (i.e., production of an F2 generation) of these corals. Here, for the first time, we closed the life cycle of the broadcast spawning coral Acropora millepora in a fully closed ex situ mesocosm. This breakthrough has numerous implications for our understanding of reproductive biology, specifically it offers potential to deepen our understanding of the genetic influence on adaptive traits such as heat tolerance, growth and disease resistance over multiple generations.

AB  - 1. Parasitoid wasps sting and inject venom into arthropod hosts, which alters host metabolism and development while keeping the host alive for several days, presumably to induce benefits for the parasitoid young. 2. This study investigates the consequences of host envenomation on development and fitness of wasp larvae in the ectoparasitoid Nasonia vitripennis, by comparing wasps reared on live unstung, previously stung, and cold-killed hosts. Developmental arrest and suppression of host response to larvae are major venom effects that occur in both stung and cold-killed hosts, but not in unstung hosts, whereas cold-killed hosts lack venom effects that require a living host. Thus, cold-killed hosts mimic some of the effects of venom, but not others. 3. Eggs placed on live unstung hosts have significantly higher mortality during development; however, successfully developing wasps from these hosts have similar lifetime fecundity to that of wasps from cold-killed or stung hosts. Therefore, although venom is beneficial, it is not required for wasp survival. 4. While wasps developing on both cold-killed and stung hosts have similar fitness levels, rearing multiple generations on cold-killed hosts results in significant fitness reductions of wasps. 5. It is concluded that the largest benefits of venom are induction of host developmental arrest and suppression of host response to larva (e.g. immune responses), although more subtle benefits may accrue across generations or under stressful conditions.

AB  - While fish reproduction has played a critical role in development of life-history theory, the collective effects of a marine-to-freshwater invasion on a clade's reproductive ecology have rarely been explored in a phylogenetic context. We analysed and compared a range of quantitative and qualitative components of reproductive ecology in the Australasian terapontid fishes, a family distributed widely across marine, estuarine and freshwater habitats in the Indo-Pacific region. We specifically tested hypotheses that life-history strategies such as larger egg sizes and reduced fecundities are a key characteristic of freshwater species in comparison with their close marine relatives, and also fit a range of currently available evolutionary models describing the processes of ecomorphological and macrohabitat-related diversification.
   Using recently developed phylogenetic comparative methods, differences in several quantitative reproductive traits were evident between marine and freshwater species, with reductions in average fecundity and increases in average egg size specifically characterising freshwater species. Evolutionary modelling of major trait axes, as well as specific traits across the family, highlighted significant increases in rates of evolutionary diversification across both freshwater lineages and within freshwater subclades. Modelling also supported the evolution of distinctive morpho-ecotype optima between marine and freshwater species over simpler models of random-walk evolution or single morphological optima.
   Review of life-history behaviour identified environmental stimuli related to photoperiod, temperature, and lunar-tidal cycles (and possibly combinations thereof) as playing an important role in stimulating spawning behaviour in most marine-euryhaline species. While some of these variables (temperature and photoperiod) continue to play an important role in some freshwater species, flow regime, particularly streamflow increases, appear more important in stimulating spawning responses, underlining the role of flow regime emerging as a master variable shaping evolutionary trajectories in freshwater clades.
   In this review and meta-analysis, we document that adaptation to an entirely freshwater existence has catalysed significant, and in several cases, relatively rapid adaptive evolution to very different life-history strategies within freshwater species. The invasion of freshwaters has had profound impacts on the trajectory of terapontid life-history evolution, driving significant changes in a range of traits relating to fecundity, egg size, spawning stimuli, and spawning substratum. Collective results suggest a distinct adaptive landscape difference between marine and freshwaters. Terapontids can provide a useful model for assessing the consistency of these outcomes with other freshwater-invading groups.

AB  - Groups of replicated lines of the bacterium Escherichia coli -ere propagated for 2,000 generations at constant 32, 37, or 42-degrees-C, or in an environment that alternated between 32 and 42-degrees-C. Here, we examine the performance of each group across a temperature range of 12-44-degrees-C measuring the temperatures over which each line can maintain itself in serial dilution culture (the thermal niche). Thermal niche was not affected by selection history: average lower and upper limits remained about 19 and 42-degrees-C for all groups. In addition, no significant differences among groups were observed in rate of extinction at more extreme temperatures. Within the thermal niche, we measured the mean fitness of the evolved groups relative to their common ancestor. Increases in mean fitness were temperature specific, with the largest increase for each group occurring near its selected temperature. Thus, the temperature at which mean fitness relative to the ancestor was greatest (the thermal optimum) diverged by about 10-degrees-C for the groups selected at constant 32-degrees-C versus constant 42-degrees-C. Tradeoffs in relative fitness (decrements relative to the ancestor elsewhere within the thermal niche) did not necessarily accompany fitness improvements, although tradeoffs were observed for a few of the lines. We conclude that adaptation in this system was quite temperature specific, but substantial divergence among groups in thermal optima had little effect on the limits of their thermal niches and did not necessarily involve tradeoffs in fitness at other temperatures.

AB  - The physiological mechanisms underpinning adaptations to starvation and cold stresses have been extensively studied in Drosophila, yet the understanding of correlated changes in stress-related and life-history traits, as well as the energetics of stress tolerance, still remains elusive. To answer the questions empirically in this context, we allowed D. melanogaster to evolve for either increased starvation or cold tolerance (24-generations / regime) in an experimental evolution system, and examined whether selection of either trait affects un-selected stress trait, as well as the impacts potential changes in life-history and mating success-related traits. Our results revealed remarkable changes in starvation/cold tolerance (up to 1.5-fold) as a direct effect of selection, while cold tolerance had been dramatically reduced (1.26-fold) in the starvation tolerant (ST) lines compared to control counterparts, although no such changes were evident in cold-tolerant (CT) lines. ST lines exhibited a higher level of body lipids and a reduced level of trehalose content, while CT lines accumulated a greater levels of body lipid and trehalose contents. Noticeably, we found that selection for starvation or cold tolerance positively correlates with larval development time, longevity, and copulation duration, indicating that these traits are among the most common targets of selection trajectories shaping stress tolerance. Altogether, this study highlights the complexity of mechanisms evolved in ST lines that contribute to enhanced starvation tolerance, but also negatively impact cold tolerance. Nevertheless, mechanisms foraging enhanced cold tolerance in CT lines appear not to target starvation tolerance. Moreover, the parallel changes in life history/mating success traits across stress regimes could indicate some generic pathways evolved in stressful environments, targeting life-history and mating suc-cess characteristics to optimize fitness.

AB  - Experiments were undertaken in 1990 and 1992 to prove the effect of consanguinity on diapause and to study its links with sex determinism and possible genetic factors. These experiments were realized on the progenies of colonies collected in Fontainebleau forest. From adult emergences in April different ways of breeding were comparatively carried out during two generations: inbred brother-sister crosses, non-inbred crosses with insects from another origin, in particular with a reference rearing strain reared for many generations; and breedings of virgin females. The progenies of these crossings were reared in the same standard laboratory conditions favourable to development without diapause (16 degrees C, 15 h L-9 h D photoperiod for the young larvae, 20 degrees C, 16 h 30 L-7 h 30 D thereafter). Diapause rates and sex-ratio were simultaneously observed. The results show an important increase in diapause rates and male rates in the progenies of inbred insects. We also found a link between sex and diapause, its rates being higher in males. On the other hand, crossings with the rearing strain corroborate the existence of a genetic factor strengthening diapause which would be eliminated in reared populations if only the without diapause insects are bred from generation to generation. Some hypotheses about the interaction between consanguinity, sex determinisms and the existence of this genetic factor are drawn from these results. It is suggested that these phenomena may have a noticeable importance for population dynamics ofD. pini.

AB  - Mobile ectothermic animals can control their body temperatures by selecting specific thermal conditions in the environment, but embryos-trapped within an immobile egg and lacking locomotor structures-have been assumed to lack that ability. Falsifying that assumption, our experimental studies show that even early stage turtle embryos move within the egg to exploit small-scale spatial thermal heterogeneity. Behavioral thermoregulation is not restricted to posthatching life and instead may be an important tactic in every life-history stage.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Background: Bone graft studies lack standardized controls. We aim to present a quick and reliable method for the intra-operative generation of acellular bone explants.
   Methods: Therefore, ovine cancellous bone explants from the iliac crest were prepared and used to test several methods for the induction of cell death. Over night heat inactivation was used as positive treatment control, methods to be investigated included UV light, or X-ray exposure, incubation in a hypotonic solution (salt-free water) and a short cycle of repeated freezing and thawing.
   Results: Viability of treated and 2 days cultured bone explants was investigated by lactate dehydrogenase assay. Non-treated cultured control explants maintained around 50% osteocyte viability, while osteocyte survival after the positive treatment control was abolished. The most dramatic loss in cell viability, together with a low standard deviation, was a repeated cycle of freezing and thawing.
   Conclusions: To summarize, we present a freeze-thaw method for the creation of acellular bone explants, which is easy to perform, not time-consuming and provides consistent results.

AB  - Freshwater and anadromous populations of a species often differ in life history traits that are associated with their dichotomous migratory pattern. Although regularly used to support life history theory, the relative contributions of environmental and genetic influences to Such intraspecific heterogeneity are not commonly known. We used a "common garden experiment" to examine the influence of these factors on life history differences of freshwater and anadromous inconnu (Stenodus leucichthys) from the Mackenzie River system, northwestern Canada. In the common environment, rate of egg development differed among life history types whereas juvenile growth rates did not, indicating that the former is under a substantial degree of genetic control, but the latter is more strongly influenced by environmental differences in nature. Differences in rates of egg development may have evolved to match different temperature regimes within spawning rivers. In contrast, observed differences in growth rate of freshwater and anadromous inconnu in the wild are probably a result of phenotypic plasticity to different local environments.

AB  - Biological control of spider mites using phytoseiid mites is frequently being disrupted by high temperatures, which results in an important and urgent research topic. We hypothesized that this scenario could be ameliorated if the thermal tolerance of a certain phytoseiid mite is enhanced. In this study, a high temperature adapted strain (HTAS) of the predatory mite Neoseiulus barkeri Hughes was selected from its conventional strain (CS) via a long-term heat acclimation (maintained at 35 degrees C) and frequent heat hardenings (exposed at 45 degrees C for 2 h every 15-25 days) over multiple generations. As expected, heat acclimation greatly improved the survival probabilities of N. barkeri when a single heat stress event occurred, with a median lethal time (e.g., at 45 degrees C) calculated as 15.2 h for HTAS females and 1.9 h for CS ones, respectively. After the heat acclimatory, HTAS showed a faster growth and developmental rate, and a higher immature survival rate than CS did; a significant reduced total fecundity rather than longevity was observed at 35 degrees C; a shifting from larger females to smaller males was observed (about 21% reduced in female ratio). Meanwhile, single heat stress event (e.g., exposed at 42 degrees C for 4 h) had a detrimental effect on the reproductive traits of the newly-emerged females, particularly obvious for mites from CS colony, by delaying the onset of oviposition and reducing reproductive output. This is the first experimental demonstration that the artificially heat acclimatory can shape the intraspecific variations on thermal susceptibility in a phytoseiid mite. It is suggested that HTAS N. barkeri might be a promising strain for the biological control of the high temperature favored spider mites, and more field and greenhouse trials should be evaluated in the future.

AB  - It is considered that extreme environmental temperature, rather than mean temperatures exert a selective pressure in ectotherms. Consequently, it is important to understand how the predicted increase in temperature variance with a higher frequency of extreme events in climate change is likely to impact on organisms. Thermal tolerance traits (i.e. chill-coma, recovery time, Hsp70 expression) are directly linked with performance in ectotherms and have consequences in life-history traits. We examined the effects of temperature variability on thermal tolerance and life-history traits through ontogeny of an insect with a complex life-cycle: the yellow mealworm beetle Tenebrio molitor. We established two common gardens with 100 recently ovoposited eggs each. Larvae were reared from hatching to adult on either a variable (mean=18 degrees C and a variance of 6.8 degrees C) or constant (18 +/- 1 degrees C) thermal environment. Development rate and growth rate were similar between thermal environments. Results indicate that larvae reared in a variable environment are more cold-tolerant than larvae of a constant environment. Interestingly, these results are reversed in the adult stage, outlining an inter-stage physiological cost. Gene expression pattern of an Hsp70 gene was well correlated with larval thermotolerance to cold in the variable environment but higher gene expression in adults is not correlated with individual's thermotolerance. We conclude that chill-coma, recovery time and Hsp70 gene expression are plastic in response to a thermal environment but also change significantly their responses depending on the ontogenetic stage, implying that the response of adult individuals is linked to early stages of the life-cycle.

AB  - Climatic conditions can modify the life history traits, population dynamics and biotic interactions of species. Therefore, adaptations to environmental factors such as temperature are crucial for species survival at different altitudes. These adaptive responses, genetically fixed or plastic (phenotypic plasticity), can be determined by physiological thresholds and might vary between sexes. The objective of this study was to determine whether the life history traits of the European Map butterfly (Araschnia levana) differ at different altitudes. A field experiment was carried out along an altitudinal gradient from 350 to 1010 m a.s.l. in a low mountainous region (Bavaria, Germany). 540 butterfly larvae were placed at different altitudes in 18 planted plots of their larval host plant, the stinging nettle (Urtica dioica). After three weeks the larvae were collected and reared under laboratory conditions. Developmental traits of the butterflies, mortality and percentage parasitism were measured. Larval development was generally slower at higher altitudes and lower temperatures and larval weight decreased with increasing altitude and decreasing temperature. However, there were no significant differences in pupation, adult lifespan and percentage mortality at the different altitudes and temperatures. Female larvae were heavier than those of males, and the pupal and adult lifespans were longer in females than in males. However, male and female butterflies reacted similarly to altitude and temperature (no significant interactions). None of the 188 larvae collected were parasitized. In conclusion, the phenotypic plasticity of European Map butterfly has enabled it to adapt to different temperatures, but the strategies of the sexes did not differ.

AB  - Adaptive phenotypic plasticity provides a mechanism of developmental rescue in novel and rapidly changing environments. Understanding the underlying mechanism of plasticity is important for predicting both the likelihood that a developmental response is adaptive and associated life-history trade-offs that could influence patterns of subsequent evolutionary rescue. Although evolved developmental switches may move organisms toward a new adaptive peak in a novel environment, such mechanisms often result in maladaptive responses. The induction of generalized physiological mechanisms in new environments is relatively more likely to result in adaptive responses to factors such as novel toxins, heat stress, or pathogens. Developmental selection forms of plasticity, which rely on within-individual selective processes, such as shaping of tissue architecture, trial-and-error learning, or acquired immunity, are particularly likely to result in adaptive plasticity in a novel environment. However, both the induction of plastic responses and the ability to be plastic through developmental selection come with significant costs, resulting in delays in reproduction, increased individual investment, and reduced fecundity. Thus, we might expect complex interactions between plastic responses that allow survival in novel environments and subsequent evolutionary responses at the population level.

AB  - Thermal developmental plasticity represents a key organismal adaptation to maintain reproductive capacity in contrasting and fluctuating temperature niches. Although extensively studied, research on thermal plasticity has mainly focused on phenotypic outcomes, such as adult life history, rather than directly measuring plasticity of underlying developmental processes. How thermal plasticity of developmental phenotypes maps into plasticity of resulting final phenotypes, and how such mapping relationships evolve, thus remain poorly understood. Here we address these questions by quantifying thermal plasticity of Caenorhabditis hermaphrodite germline development. We integrate measurements of germline development and fertility at the upper thermal range in isolates of C. briggsae, C. elegans, and C. tropicalis. First, we compare intra- and interspecific variation in thermal germline plasticity with plasticity in reproductive output. Second, we ask whether the developmental errors leading to fertility break-down at upper thermal limits are evolutionarily conserved. We find that temperature variation modulates spermatogenesis, oogenesis and germ cell progenitor pools, yet the thermal sensitivity of these processes varies among isolates and species, consistent with evolutionary variation in upper thermal limits of hermaphrodite fertility. Although defective sperm function is a major contributor to heat-induced fertility break-down, high temperature also significantly perturbs oogenesis, germline integrity, and mitosis-meiosis progression. Remarkably, the occurrence and frequency of specific errors are strongly species- and genotype-dependent, indicative of evolutionary divergence in thermal sensitivity of distinct processes in germline development. Therefore, the Caenorhabditis reproductive system displays complex genotype-by-temperature interactions at the developmental level, which may remain masked when studying thermal plasticity exclusively at the life history level.

AB  - In the context of global changes, the long-term viability of populations of endangered ectotherms may depend on their adaptive potential and ability to cope with temperature variations. We measured responses of Atlantic salmon embryos from four populations to temperature variations and used a Q(ST)-F-ST approach to study the adaptive divergence among these populations. Embryos were reared under two experimental conditions: a low temperature regime at 4 degrees C until eyed-stage and 10 degrees C until the end of embryonic development and a high temperature regime with a constant temperature of 10 degrees C throughout embryonic development. Significant variations among populations and populationxtemperature interactions were observed for embryo survival, incubation time and length. Q(ST) was higher than F-ST in all but one comparison suggesting an important effect of divergent selection. Q(ST) was also higher under the high-temperature treatment than at low temperature for length and survival due to a higher variance among populations under the stressful warmer treatment. Interestingly, heritability was lower for survival under high temperature in relation to a lower additive genetic variance under that treatment. Overall, these results reveal an adaptive divergence in thermal plasticity in embryonic life stages of Atlantic salmon suggesting that salmon populations may differentially respond to temperature variations induced by climate change. These results also suggest that changes in temperature may alter not only the adaptive potential of natural populations but also the selection regimes among them.

AB  - Tree improvement programs often focus on improving productivity-related traits; however, under present climate change scenarios, climate change-related (adaptive) traits should also be incorporated into such programs. Therefore, quantifying the genetic variation and correlations among productivity and adaptability traits, and the importance of genotype by environment interactions, including defense compounds involved in biotic and abiotic resistance, is essential for selecting parents for the production of resilient and sustainable forests. Here, we estimated quantitative genetic parameters for 15 growth, wood quality, drought resilience, and monoterpene traits for Picea glauca (Moench) Voss (white spruce). We sampled 1,540 trees from three open-pollinated progeny trials, genotyped with 467,224 SNP markers using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). We used the pedigree and SNP information to calculate, respectively, the average numerator and genomic relationship matrices, and univariate and multivariate individual-tree models to obtain estimates of (co)variance components. With few site-specific exceptions, all traits examined were under genetic control. Overall, higher heritability estimates were derived from the genomic- than their counterpart pedigree-based relationship matrix. Selection for height, generally, improved diameter and water use efficiency, but decreased wood density, microfibril angle, and drought resistance. Genome-based correlations between traits reaffirmed the pedigree-based correlations for most trait pairs. High and positive genetic correlations between sites were observed (average 0.68), except for those pairs involving the highest elevation, warmer, and moister site, specifically for growth and microfibril angle. These results illustrate the advantage of using genomic information jointly with productivity and adaptability traits, and defense compounds to enhance tree breeding selection for changing climate.

AB  - A diverse laboratory population of Daphnia magna Straus was established by combining individuals from eight sources. Artificial selection for increased resistance to the acute toxic effects of cadmium was performed, and after eight generations, the average median effective concentration increased from 61 to 180 mu g/L. No differences in life span, offspring production, time to first brood. number of offspring in the first brood, or intrinsic rate of population increase (r) were observed between the cadmium-adapted population and the controls under ideal conditions or under conditions of temperature or feeding ration stress, but cadmium-adapted daphnids were smaller. Control and cadmium-adapted populations were equally sensitive to copper and malathion, but the cadmium-adapted population was less sensitive to lead and more sensitive to phenol. Analysis of amplified fragment-length polymorphisms indicated a significant decrease in genetic diversity in the cadmium-adapted population. Although the evolved cadmium resistance would allow adapted populations to exist in areas where cadmium concentrations would be toxic to unadapted populations, the decreased genetic diversity, smaller size, and increased sensitivity to at least one other toxicant could reduce the probability of long-term survival even in the absence of future cadmium exposure.

AB  - Trade-offs may influence both physiological and evolutionary responses to co-occurring stressors, but their effects on both plastic and adaptive responses to climate change are poorly understood. To test for genetic and physiological trade-offs incurred in tolerating multiple stressors, we hybridized two populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus that were divergent for both heat and salinity tolerance. Starting in the F-2 generation, we selected for increased tolerance of heat, low salinity, and high salinity in replicate lines. After five generations of selection, heat-selected lines had greater heat tolerance but lower fecundity, indicating an energetic cost to tolerance. Lines selected for increased salinity tolerance did not show evidence of adaptation to their respective environments; however, hypo-osmotic selection lines showed substantial loss of tolerance to hyperosmotic stress. Neither of the salinity selection regimes resulted in diminished heat tolerance at ambient salinity; however, simultaneous exposure to heat and hypo-osmotic stress led to decreased heat tolerance, implying a physiological trade-off in tolerance to the two stressors. When we quantified the transcriptomic response to heat and salinity stress via RNA sequencing, we observed little overlap in the stress responses, suggesting the observed synergistic effects of heat and salinity stress were driven by competing energetic demands, rather than shared stress response pathways.

AB  - The ability of natural populations to withstand environmental stresses relies partly on their adaptive ability. In this study, we used a subset of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, a population of inbred, genome-sequenced lines derived from a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate whether this population harbors genetic variation for a set of stress resistance and life history traits. Using a genomic approach, we found substantial genetic variation for metabolic rate, heat stress resistance, expression of a major heat shock protein, and egg-to-adult viability investigated at a benign and a higher stressful temperature. This suggests that these traits will be able to evolve. In addition, we outline an approach to conduct pathway associations based on genomic linear models, which has potential to identify adaptive genes and pathways, and therefore can be a valuable tool in conservation genomics.

AB  - We artificially selected on egg size in a butterfly to study the consequences for fecundity, reproductive effort and offspring fitness. Correlated responses in either pupal mass, larval or pupal development time were virtually absent. Offspring size was positively related to fitness, but only partly traded off against fecundity. Rather, total reproductive effort (measured as fresh mass), egg water content and the decline of egg size with female age increased in the large-egg selected lines compared to either small-egg or control lines. Accounting for these effects showed that reproductive investment (in dry mass) was in fact similar across lines. Such mechanisms may enable increased investment in (early) offspring without a reduction in their number, revealing a much more complex picture than a simple trade-off between offspring size and number. Substantial variation among replicates suggests that there are different underlying mechanisms for change, rather than any single, unitary pathway.

AB  - Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha, Pallas, 1771) have had unprecedented success in colonizing European and North American waters under strongly differing temperature regimes. Thus, the mussel is an excellent model of a species which is able to cope with increasing water temperatures expected under global change. We study three principle scenarios for successful survival of the mussel under rising temperatures: (1) no adaptation to future thermal conditions is needed, existing performance is great enough; (2) a shift (adaptation) towards higher temperatures is required; or (3) a broadening of the range of tolerated temperatures (adaptation) is needed. We developed a stochastic individual-based model which describes the demographic growth of D. polymorpha to determine which of the alternative scenarios might enable future survival. It is a day-degree model which is determined by ambient water temperature. Daily temperatures are generated based on long-term data of the River Rhine. Predictions under temperature conditions as recently observed for this river that are made for the phenology of reproduction, the age distribution and the shell length distribution conform with field observations. Our simulations show that temporal patterns in the life cycle of the mussel will be altered under rising temperatures. In all scenarios spawning started earlier in the year and the total reproductive output of a population was dominated by the events later in the spawning period. For maximum temperatures between 20 and 26 degrees C no thermal adaptation of the mussel is required. No extinctions and stable age distributions over generations were observed in scenario 2 for all maximum temperatures studied. In contrast, no population with a fixed range of tolerated temperatures survived in scenario 3 with high maximum temperatures (28, 30, 32 degrees C). Age distributions showed an excess of 0+ individuals which resulted in an extinction of the population for several thermal ranges investigated.

AB  - Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the wMel strain of Wolbachia are being deployed to control the spread of arboviruses around the world through blockage of viral transmission. Blockage by Wolbachia in some scenarios may be affected by the susceptibility of wMel to cyclical heat stress during mosquito larval development. We therefore evaluated the potential to generate a heat-resistant strain of wMel in Ae. aegypti through artificial laboratory selection and through exposure to field temperatures across multiple generations. To generate an artificially selected strain, wMel-infected females reared under cyclical heat stress were crossed to wMel-infected males reared at 26 degrees C. The low proportion of larvae that hatched founded the next generation, and this process was repeated for eight generations. The wMel heat-selected strain (wMel-HS) was similar to wMel (unselected) in its ability to induce cytoplasmic incompatibility and restore compatibility when larvae were reared under cyclical heat stress, but wMel-HS adults exhibited reduced Wolbachia densities at 26 degrees C. To investigate the effects of field exposure, we compared the response of wMel-infected Ae. aegypti collected from Cairns, Australia where the infection has been established for seven years, to a wMel-infected population maintained in the laboratory for approximately 60 generations. Field and laboratory strains of wMel did not differ in their response to cyclical heat stress or in their phenotypic effects at 26 degrees C. The capacity for the wMel infection in Ae. aegypti to adapt to high temperatures therefore appears limited, and alternative strains may need to be considered for deployment in environments where high temperatures are regularly experienced in mosquito breeding sites.

AB  - Beneficial microorganisms shape the evolutionary trajectories of their hosts, facilitating or constraining the colonization of new ecological niches. One convincing example entails the responses of insect-microbe associations to rising temperatures. Indeed, insect resilience to stressful high temperatures depends on the genetic identity of the obligate symbiont and the presence of heat-protective facultative symbionts. As extensively studied organisms, aphids and their endosymbiotic bacteria represent valuable models to address eco-evolutionary questions about the thermal ecology of insect-microbe partnerships, with broad relevance to various biological systems and insect models. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the context-dependent impacts of symbionts on host phenotype in benign or stressful heat conditions, across fitness traits, types of heat stress and symbiont species. We found that warming lowered the benefits (resistance to parasitoids) and costs (development, fecundity) of infection by facultative symbionts, which was overall mostly beneficial to the hosts under short-term heat stress (heat shock) rather than extended warming. Heat-tolerant genotypes of the obligate symbiont Buchnera aphidicola and some facultative symbionts (Rickettsia sp., Serratia symbiotica) improved or maintained aphid fitness under heat stress. We discuss the implications of these findings for the general understanding of the cost-benefit balance of insect-microbe associations across multiple traits and their eco-evolutionary dynamics faced with climate change.

AB  - Much is known about the genetic variance in certain components of metabolism, most notably resting and maximum metabolic rate. This is in stark contrast to the lack of information on genetic variance in the metabolic rate of individuals that feed and express routine activity, and how this rate correlates with other components of the energy budget or life history traits. Here we quantify genetic variance in metabolic rate (MR) under such conditions, as well as food consumption, juvenile somatic growth rate and age at maturation under ad lib food availability in a set of 10 clones of Daphnia magna from a natural population. Broad sense evolvabilities (0.16 0.56%) were on the same order of magnitude as those typically observed for physiological and life history traits, and suggest that all these traits have the potential to evolve within this population. We did not find support for the previously hypothesized positive genetic correlation between metabolic rate and growth rate. Rather, the patterns of genetic correlations suggest that genetic variance in food consumption is the single most influential trait shaping somatic growth rate, but that additional variance in growth can be explained by considering the joint effect of consumption and MR. The genetic variance in consumption and MR also translated into genetic variance in age at maturation, creating a direct link between these energy budget components and a life history trait with strong fitness effects. Moreover, a weak positive correlation between MR and food consumption suggests the presence of substantial amounts of independent genetic control of these traits, consistent with results obtained using genomic approaches.

AB  - In this paper, a novel approach based on General Relativity Search Algorithm (GRSA) for Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of a two area interconnected thermal-thermal power system is described. In the investigated power system, governor dead-band is considered as a nonlinearity. At first, AGC of the power system is analyzed with Proportional Integral (PI) controller and further Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller is also utilized. The parameters of the PI and PID controllers are optimized by GRSA. The gain multiplied Integral Time Absolute Error (g-ITAE) fitness function is employed to find the best solution for the PI and PID based controller design using the novel technique. The superiority of the GRSA optimized PI, and PID controllers are presented by comparing its results with the published results of modern soft computing technique i.e. Craziness based Particle Swarm Optimization(C-PSO) tuned PI controller. Numerical simulation results validate the efficiency of the GRSA for AGC design applications.

AB  - The timing of annual life-history events affects survival and reproduction of all organisms. A changing environment can perturb phenological adaptations and an important question is if populations can evolve fast enough to track the environmental changes. Yet, little is known about selection and evolutionary potential of traits determining the timing of crucial annual events. Migratory species, which travel between different climatic regions, are particularly affected by global environmental changes. To increase our understanding of evolutionary potential and selection of timing traits, we investigated the quantitative genetics of arrival date at the breeding ground using a multigenerational pedigree of a natural great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) population. We found significant heritability of 16.4% for arrival date and directional selection for earlier arrival in both sexes acting through reproductive success, but not through lifespan. Mean arrival date advanced with 6days over 20years, which is in exact accordance with our predicted evolutionary response based on the breeder's equation. However, this phenotypic change is unlikely to be caused by microevolution, because selection seems mainly to act on the nongenetic component of the trait. Furthermore, demographical changes could also not account for the advancing arrival date. Instead, a strong correlation between spring temperatures and population mean arrival date suggests that phenotypic plasticity best explains the advancement of arrival date in our study population. Our study dissects the evolutionary and environmental forces that shape timing traits and thereby increases knowledge of how populations cope with rapidly changing environments.

AB  - 1. Non-Mendelian maternal effects, the effects of maternal phenotype or environment on offspring phenotype, have been documented in numerous taxa. By affecting offspring vital rates (birth, death, and movement), maternal effects have the potential to influence population dynamics. However, relatively few studies have directly linked maternal phenotype or environment to offspring vital rates. Additionally, even fewer studies have compared the magnitude of across-generation effects (i.e. maternal effects) to within-generation effects.
   2. Because of their telescoping generations, aphids can be strongly influenced by maternal effects. The effects of maternal density and maternal host-plant species on offspring survival, fecundity, and alate formation were investigated experimentally in Aphis nerii, the milkweed-oleander aphid.
   3. Additionally, the relative strength of maternal effects were compared with those operating within a generation. Therefore, in another set of experiments, the effects of current density and host-plant species (within-generation effects) on aphid vital rates were examined.
   4. While maternal effects were present, within-generation effects were much stronger and more strongly influenced aphid vital rates. Within a generation, aphids exhibited density-dependent survival, fecundity, and alate formation and these effects varied among host-plant species.
   5. These results indicate that while maternal effects have the potential to affect population dynamics, this potential is not always met. Additionally, the current environment, not the environment of previous generations, more strongly impacts population dynamics.

AB  - Purpose: Detect any deviation in biologic and technologic characters of eight ameiotic-parthenogenetically cloned lines of Bombyx mori L. from different origins from a normal sexually reproduced control line in three generations.
   Methods: Comparative study of the three generations was conducted in SES, Vratza, unit of the National Center for Agrarian Sciences of Bulgaria after fixing all environmental rearing conditions.
   Results: The ameiotic-parthen-clones displayed good parthenogenetic development, although total hatchability was significantly less than the sexually reproducing control populations. Survival rates between clones and control were not significantly different. All clones displayed significantly longer larval periods. Slight decline in second generation, and a steeper one in the third generation were observed for all eight cloned lines in cocoon weight, shell weight, and shell ratio and these differences were statistically significant. Cocoon yield was significantly lower than the control throughout the three generations.
   Conclusions: Our parthen-cloning method has a high rate of success in comparison to other cloning methods, the cloned progeny populations although were weaker technologically (cocoon weight, shell weight, and shell ratio), the biological characters (parthenogenetic development and survival rate) were not compromised. Further study is needed to determine the thermal needs of the cloned embryos and metabolic rate of all stages.

AB  - Morphological, behavioral, and life-history differences between Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) populations are commonly thought to reflect local adaptation, and it is likewise common to assume that salmon populations separated by small distances are locally adapted. Two alternatives to local adaptation exist: random genetic differentiation owing to genetic drift and founder events, and genetic homogeneity among populations, in which differences reflect differential trait expression in differing environments. Population genetics theory and simulations suggest that both alternatives are possible. With selectively neutral alleles, genetic drift can result in random differentiation despite many strays per generation. Even weak selection can prevent genetic drift in stable populations; however, founder effects can result in random differentiation despite selective pressures. Overlapping generations reduce the potential for random differentiation. Genetic homogeneity can occur despite differences in selective regimes when straying rates are high. In sum, localized differences in selection should not always result in local adaptation. Local adaptation is favored when population sizes are large and stable, selection is consistent over large areas, selective differentials are large, and straying rates are neither too high nor too low. Consideration of alternatives to adaptation would improve both biological research and salmon conservation efforts.

AB  - Biomass based electricity generation is now a well-established concept and in Sri Lanka, gliricidia has been accepted as the most suitable biofuel. Considering this and the fertilizer displacement benefits, the Government of Sri Lanka has given prominence for cultivating gliricidia on a large scale by declaring it as the fourth plantation crop.
   The objective of this paper is to discuss the use of cinnamon firewood as a biofuel for electricity generation. Thus, analysing cinnamon wood's heat characteristics, examining its availability and assessing its potentiality for electricity generation are matters of paramount importance.
   Cinnamon wood is the residue left from peeling the cinnamon bark. The villagers in cinnamon growing areas were the first to identify the superior heat generating properties of cinnamon wood as compared to other types of firewood. However, its effectiveness as a biofuel for electricity generation could be best assessed by comparing its heat characteristics and other properties with those of gliricidia.
   Cinnamon grows in most parts of the country and cinnamon wood is available year-round as a by-product. The process is sustainable, and the 32,345ha of cinnamon plantations presently available have the potential to add at least 80GWh annually to the national grid. Hence, there may not be a need to devote land purely for cultivation of biofuels.

AB  - Earth's biodiversity is undergoing mass extinction due to anthropogenic compounding of environmental, demographic and genetic stresses. These different stresses can trap populations within a reinforcing feedback loop known as the extinction vortex, in which synergistic pressures build upon one another through time, driving down population viability. Sexual selection, the widespread evolutionary force arising from competition, choice and reproductive variance within animal mating patterns could have vital consequences for population viability and the extinction vortex: (a) if sexual selection reinforces natural selection to fix 'good genes' and purge 'bad genes', then mating patterns encouraging competition and choice may help protect populations from extinction; (b) by contrast, if mating patterns create load through evolutionary or ecological conflict, then population viability could be further reduced by sexual selection. We test between these opposing theories using replicate populations of the model insectTribolium castaneumexposed to over 10 years of experimental evolution under monogamous versus polyandrous mating patterns. After a 95-generation history of divergence in sexual selection, we compared fitness and extinction of monogamous versus polyandrous populations through an experimental extinction vortex comprising 15 generations of cycling environmental and genetic stresses. Results showed that lineages from monogamous evolutionary backgrounds, with limited opportunities for sexual selection, showed rapid declines in fitness and complete extinction through the vortex. By contrast, fitness of populations from the history of polyandry, with stronger opportunities for sexual selection, declined slowly, with 60% of populations surviving by the study end. The three vortex stresses of (a) nutritional deprivation, (b) thermal stress and (c) genetic bottlenecking had similar impacts on fitness declines and extinction risk, with an overall sigmoid decline in survival through time. We therefore reveal sexual selection as an important force behind lineages facing extinction threats, identifying the relevance of natural mating patterns for conservation management.

AB  - The increased homozygosity due to inbreeding leads to expression of deleterious recessive alleles, which may cause inbreeding depression in small populations. The severity of inbreeding depression has been suggested to depend on the rate of inbreeding, with slower inbreeding being more effective in purging deleterious alleles of smaller effect. The effectiveness of purging is however dependent on various factors such as the effect of the deleterious, recessive alleles, the genetic background of inbreeding depression and the environment in which purging occurs. Investigations have shown inconclusive results as to whether purging efficiently diminish inbreeding depression. Here we used an ecologically relevant inbreeding coefficient (f a parts per thousand 0.25) and generated ten slow and ten fast inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster by keeping the effective population size constant at respectively 32 and 2 for 19 or 2 generations. These inbred lines were contrasted to non-inbred control lines. We investigated the effect of inbreeding and inbreeding rate in traits associated with fitness including heat, cold and desiccation stress resistance, egg-to-adult viability, development time, productivity, metabolic rate and wet weight under laboratory conditions. The results showed highly trait specific consequences of inbreeding and generally no support for the hypothesis that slow inbreeding is less deleterious than fast inbreeding. Egg-to-adult viability and development time were investigated under both benign and heat stress conditions. Reduced viability and increased developmental time were observed at stressful temperatures and inbreeding depression was on average more severe at stressful compared to benign temperatures.

AB  - The clover mite, Bryobia praetiosa Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), is an agricultural pest, as well as a frequent invader of hospitals and homes. However, its adaptability to different temperatures is not well understood. We used age- and stage-specific life tables to investigate the effects of temperature on demographic parameters of B. praetiosa from 15 to 35 degrees C under a long-day photoperiod (16:8 [L:D] h). The clover mite is a thelytokous species (consisting of only females) due to its infection with the symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia. The egg-to-adult development time of female B. praetiosa decreased as the temperature increased from 15 to 32.5 degrees C. At 35 degrees C, females laid eggs, but no eggs hatched. The lower thermal threshold (t(0)) and the thermal constant (K) for egg-to-adult females were 8.7 degrees C and 274.1 degree-days, respectively. The intrinsic optimum temperature (T-O) was 22.4 degrees C. The oviposition period decreased with increasing temperature. Fecundity was highest at 20 degrees C and extremely low at 30 degrees C. The net reproductive rate (R-0) decreased as the temperature increased from 15 to 30 degrees C, but no significant difference was observed between 15 and 20 degrees C. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) varied from 0.0721/d at 15 degrees C to 0.1679/d at 25 degrees C, and then decreased to 0.1203/d at 30 degrees C. These results should be useful in developing management strategies for B. praetiosa.

AB  - Many species of tsetse flies are infected by a virus that causes salivary gland hypertrophy (SGH) and the virus isolated from Glossina pallidipes (GpSGHv) has recently been sequenced. Flies with SGH have a reduced fecundity and fertility. To better understand the impact of this virus in a laboratory colony of G. pallidipes, where the majority of flies are infected but asymptomatic, and to follow the development of SGH in the offspring of symptomatic infected flies, we examined the progeny of tsetse flies reared under different conditions. The results show that the progeny of asymptomatic parents did not develop SGH, while the progeny of symptomatic female flies mated with asymptomatic males developed a high rate of SGH (65% in male and 100% in females) and these flies were sterile. Stress in the form of high fly density in holding cages (180 flies/cage) and high temperature (30 degrees C) in the holding room did not affect the prevalence of the SGH. The virus is excreted in the saliva and there is a strong correlation between the infection status (negative, slight or strong by PCR) and the numbers of virus particles released into the blood on which the flies were fed. On average, around 10(2) and 10(7) virus particles were found in the blood after feeding asymptomatic or symptomatic infected flies respectively. Feeding the flies on new blood at every feed for three generations caused a significant reduction in the virus copy number in these flies when compared with the virus copy number in flies fed under the normal feeding regime. The results of these studies allowed the initiation of colony management protocols that aim to minimize the risk of horizontal transmission and to enable the establishment of colonies with a low virus prevalence or possibly even those that are virus free.

AB  - Many subtropical fishes spawn multiple batches throughout a year. To understand plasticity in their reproductive output, we evaluated variation in oocyte size and batch fecundity for an exploited subtropical cutlassfish, Trichiurus japonicus, between two temperature periods (warm vs. cold) on the NE and SW coasts of Taiwan, northwestern Pacific. Given greater temperature variability on NE compared with SW coast, we hypothesized greater changes between warm and cold periods in oocyte size and fecundity for T. japonicus on the NE coast. We found opposite changes in sizes of ripe oocytes between periods (cold > warm on the NE but warm > cold on the SW coast) but consistent patterns in batch fecundity between coasts (warm > cold). Furthermore, the between-period patterns in female length were consistent on both coasts (warm > cold). The differential between-period patterns in oocyte size were related to potential adaptive responses to differential thermal environments between coasts, whereas the changes in fecundity mainly involved plastic processes (e.g., changes in population demography or movement). Together, our findings suggest that variability of temperature and maternal effects underlie recruitment variability of T. japonicus.

AB  - The relationship between life-history characteristics and population dynamics were investigated in the onuphid polychaete Kinbergonuphis simoni (Santos, Day and Rice) between 1982 and 1987. The studied population is located in Upper Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. This worm attains sexual maturity at 5 to 10 mo of age, depending on temperature. Several consecutive broods are produced during a female's life time, with 7 to 26 young per brood. Adults die in June-July after the breeding season. Generations of breeding individuals do not overlap and the replacement of generations occurs in July-August. Only one extended breeding season is experienced per life time. Life span does not exceed 2 yr. Field population density in 1982 was high in fall and spring (2000 to 9000 individuals/m2), low in summer (1600 individuals/m2), and slightly depressed in winter (2500 to 4000 individuals/m2). Changes in population density may be explained by seasonal, temperature-controlled changes in instantaneous birth and death rates. Birth rates are high in fall and spring, while death rates are high in early summer. Death of juveniles contributes to the winter density decrease.

AB  - Bacteriophages are the most numerous biological entities on Earth. They are on the basis of most ecosystems, regulating the diversity and abundance of bacterial populations and contributing to the nutrient and energy cycles. Bacteriophages have two well differentiated phases in their life cycle, one extracellular, in which they behave as inert particles, and other one inside their hosts, where they replicate to give rise to a progeny. In both phases they are exposed to environmental conditions that often act as selective pressures that limit both their survival in the environment and their ability to replicate, two fitness traits that frequently cannot be optimised simultaneously. In this study we have analysed the evolutionary ability of an RNA bacteriophage, the bacteriophage Q beta, when it is confronted with a temperature increase that affects both the extracellular and the intracellular media. Our results show that Q beta can optimise its survivability when exposed to short-term high temperature extracellular heat shocks, as well as its replicative ability at higher-than-optimal temperature. Mutations responsible for simultaneous adaptation were the same as those selected when adaptation to each condition proceeded separately, showing the absence of important trade-offs between survival and reproduction in this virus.

AB  - The Commonwealth of Dominica is a Small Island Developing State in the eastern Caribbean, that has been subject to a wide variety of natural hazards over the past century, most recently the Category 5-Hurricane Maria on 18-19 September 2017. In Dominica fishing remains important for income generation and for local food security. While there are small-scale reef and demersal fisheries, pelagic fisheries have tended to dominate in recent years and fishers make extensive use of Fish Aggregating Devices. Climate Vulnerability Assessments (CVAs) provide a coherent framework for evaluating potential impacts over a broad range of species, and also socio-ecological systems. These methods assess the "exposure" to a stressor (climate change and/or hurricane events), the "sensitivity" to that stressor, and the "adaptive capacity" within fishing communities faced with potential threats. These three components are then combined to estimate overall "vulnerability". In this study we make use of fisheries catch data from landing ports around Dominica, to assess how each of Dominica's ten parishes differ in terms of climate vulnerability. We examine information on species' temperature preferences and life-history traits as well as data on social vulnerability. We then compare our predictions with observed damage following Hurricane Maria, using the 2017 Post-disaster Needs Assessment.

AB  - With the rapid development of economy, People's living standard is improving and people are also more and more high to the requirement of environmental protection. Now used in most countries is coal-fired power generation way, this way of electricity will be massive emissions of polluting substances into the air, for example: SO2, NO,,which can destroy the self-regulation of nature and cause great damage to our living environment. Use of nuclear power is not only clean, but also, does not produce sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and other toxic gases, and the economy, save resources. From using nuclear power to now, the plant has experienced the change of generation after generation, continuously improving all kinds of equipment and the methods of combustion, to make nuclear power safer. This paper introduces the development history of nuclear power plant from set up to now and the development of nuclear power plant in the future expectations.
   Energy is indispensable to the survival of humans upon earth and necessary conditions. The replacement of energy will cause the progress of human society. With the rapid development of social economy, the social productive forces in the continuously improve and human demand for energy is becoming more and more big. However, coal, oil and natural gas are non-renewable energy, and the earth reserves is limited. And the burning of fossil fuels may cause pollution to the environment, and influence the survival of the human environment. Nuclear energy has advantages of clean, low pollution and high thermal efficiency, and slowing down the temperature [1]. Use of nuclear power, 1 kg 235U all fission releases energy equivalent to 2700 tons of standard coal burning out of energy[2], which has a great development potential. Today, most countries in the world have dedicated to the study in the use of nuclear power. The table below for some countries in the use of nuclear power generation accounts for the total generating capacity of 2016.

AB  - Biological characteristics of corn leaf aphid, Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch), on barley, Hordeum vulgare L., were examined for two generations under four different elevated temperature and CO2 combinations. The developmental duration for each life stage was significantly reduced under the elevated temperature (+4 degrees C). The elevated CO2 (700-750 mu l/liter) reduced only the development time of fourth-instar nymph. The overall duration of nymphal stage was reduced in the second generation. Thus, the temperature was the dominant factor to development duration of corn leaf aphid. The fecundity of corn leaf aphid was significantly increased under the elevated temperature and CO2, as well as in the later generation. Elevated temperature and CO2 increased the number of alate production, which may enhance the aphid migration or dispersal and the spread of plant viruses. Corn leaf aphid had the highest intrinsic rate of increase under the elevated temperature and CO2 combination in the second generation. These results indicate that the combined effects of both elevated temperature and CO2 on aphid biology may exacerbate aphid damage on barley under the climate change in accompany with elevated temperature and CO2 level.

AB  - European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a large, economically important fish species with a long generation time whose longterm resilience to ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) is not clear. We incubated sea bass from Brittany (France) for two generations (>5 years in total) under ambient and predicted OA conditions (PCO2: 650 and 1700 mu atm) crossed with ambient and predicted OW conditions in F1 (temperature: 15-18 degrees C and 20-23 degrees C) to investigate the effects of climate change on larval and juvenile growth and metabolic rate. We found that in F1, OA as a single stressor at ambient temperature did not affect larval or juvenile growth and OW increased developmental time and growth rate, but OAW decreased larval size at metamorphosis. Larval routine and juvenile standard metabolic ratewere significantly lower in cold compared with warm conditioned fish and also lower in F0 compared with F1 fish. We did not find any effect of OA as a single stressor on metabolic rate. Juvenile PO2, crit was not affected by OA or OAW in both generations. We discuss the potential underlying mechanisms resulting in the resilience of F0 and F1 larvae and juveniles to OA and in the beneficial effects of OW on F1 larval growth and metabolic rate, but contrastingly in the vulnerability of F1, but not F0 larvae to OAW. With regard to the ecological perspective, we conclude that recruitment of larvae and early juveniles to nursery areas might decrease under OAWconditions but individuals reaching juvenile phase might benefit from increased performance at higher temperatures.

AB  - It is not known how selection affects mutations in the multiple copies of the mitochondrial genome(1-11). We transferred cytoplasm between D. melanogaster embryos carrying mitochondrial mutations to create heteroplasmic lines transmitting two mitochondrial genotypes. Increased temperature imposed selection against a temperature-sensitive mutation affecting cytochrome oxidase, driving decreases in the abundance of the mutant genome over successive generations. Selection did not influence the health or fertility of the flies but acted during midoogenesis to influence competition between the genomes. Mitochondria might incur an advantage through selective localization, survival or proliferation, yet timing and insensitivity to park mutation suggest that preferential proliferation underlies selection. Selection drove complete replacement of the temperature-sensitive mitochondrial genome by a wild-type genome but also stabilized the multigenerational transmission of two genomes carrying complementing detrimental mutations. While they are so balanced, these stably transmitted mutations have no detrimental phenotype, but their segregation could contribute to disease phenotypes and somatic aging.

AB  - The selection of thermal habitat by fish is strongly regulated by physiology and behaviour. However, delineation of a species lifelong thermal niche remains technically challenging. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) survival and productivity are recognised as being tightly linked to a somewhat restricted thermal habitat. The factors guiding temperature selection during each life stage remain poorly understood.
   In this study, we tested the significant factors controlling the realised thermal niche of lake trout from two southern Quebec small boreal lakes that experienced supplementation stocking during the last 20 years. We used oxygen stable isotope (delta O-18) thermometry of otolith calcium carbonates (aragonite) using secondary-ion mass spectrometry to estimate experienced lifelong temperatures. We investigated the thermal habitat of lake trout with known genotypes (local, hybrid, and stocked).
   Ontogeny and genetic origin influenced temperature selection in both studied lake trout populations. Young-of-the-year consistently used warmer, shallower habitats (10.7 +/- 2.6 degrees C, 7.5 m depth) prior to a juvenile transition to colder and deeper waters (8.5 +/- 3.3 degrees C, 10 m depth). Stocked lake trout, originating from a genetically distinct ecotype, exhibited a more variable thermal niche, with some individuals consistently using warmer habitat (10.4 +/- 1 degrees C) than local fish. Their hybrid progeny also occupied a warmer thermal niche, intermediate to the parental strains. We propose that increased fat content and genetic origin are potential explanatory factors for warmer temperature use.
   This study reiterates that high-resolution otolith delta O-18 thermometry is a uniquely well-suited approach for unravelling the multiple factors that influence lifelong temperature selection in fish. Our results illustrate that the realised thermal niche is influenced by a genetic-environment interaction.

AB  - Genetic differences among muskellunge Esox masquinongy populations are related to residence in major river drainages, suggesting the existence of divergent stocks. By use of radio-telemetry we compared different seasonal and diel temperature selection in a southern Illinois reservoir for three geographically and genetically distinct stocks of age-2 muskellunge from throughout the latitudinal range of the species. Muskellunge from the Upper Mississippi River drainage were represented by the Leech Lake, Minnesota, population and the Ohio River drainage was represented by the Cave Run Lake, Kentucky, population. Progeny from North Spring Lake, Illinois, an interstock, or mixed-origin stock, were also evaluated. No differences in temperature selection were observed among stocks of juvenile muskellunge across seasons or diel periods. The seasonal mean temperatures of the water varied significantly-spring 21.7 degrees C, summer 28.4 degrees C, and fall 14.8 degrees C, with an overall average temperature of 24.1 degrees C, in agreement with previously published values obtained in laboratory trials. This lack of different temperature-selection patterns among stocks is in contrast with other life-history characteristics, for example growth, metabolism, and conversion efficiency, which have been shown to differ among populations and stocks.

AB  - This paper presents genetic algorithm method for unit commitment of thermal power plant. The optimum allocation of generations (for a given plant load) to different units of a plant is called unit commitment (UC). It can be easily shown that the optimal operation of the units at a thermal power station can be achieved when the incremental fuel cost (incremental cost) of all the units are equal.
   A new fitness function is defined in this paper, which combines (i) equal incremental cost (IC) criteria, and (ii) generation and load balance constraint. Generation of each unit is taken as variable. The minimum and maximum generation limits of the units are incorporated with the help of lower and upper bounds of variable. The genetic algorithm (GA) optimization method is employed to estimate the optimum allocation of generations to different units of plant, making use of the fitness function. Computer programs (using MATLAB) have been developed for optimum UC, using GA technique.

AB  - The heat resistance of larvae and their somatic cells was studied in the first generation of Tilapia obtained from females treated with low temperature at the age of 105-121 days. The optimal temperature for development of Tilapia is 26-28-degrees, while the low temperature treatment was effected at 20-22-degrees. No death of fish was recorded after the treatment. The female gonads retained all oocytes of the older generation, while some previtellogenic oocytes died. The heat resistance of 18-20-day old larvae and their muscle to the damaging effect of 40-degrees was determined. The experimental larvae did not differ from the control ones by their heat resistance and that of their cells. We can conclude that there are only few sensitive stages of gem cell development during the proembryonic period (primordial germ cells and gonia), when the low temperature treatment of females determines the heat resistance of the first generation progeny.

AB  - Epigenetic inheritance can result in plastic responses to changing environments being faithfully transmitted to offspring. However, it remains unclear how epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation can contribute to multigenerational acclimation and adaptation to environmental stressors. Brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis), an economically important salmonid, is highly sensitive to thermal stress and is of conservation concern in the context of climate change. We studied the effects of temperature during parental sexual maturation and offspring rearing on whole-genome DNA methylation in brook charr juveniles (fry). Parents were split between warm and cold temperatures during sexual maturation, mated in controlled breeding designs, then offspring from each family were split between warm (8 degrees C) and cold (5 degrees C) rearing environments. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we found 188 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) due to parental maturation temperature after controlling for family structure. By contrast, offspring rearing temperature had a negligible effect on offspring methylation. Stable intergenerational inheritance of DNA methylation and minimal plasticity in progeny could result in the transmission of acclimatory epigenetic states to offspring, priming them for a warming environment. Our findings have implications pertaining to the role of intergenerational epigenetic inheritance in response to ongoing climate change.

AB  - Background: Present-day climate change has altered the phenology (the timing of periodic life cycle events) of many plant and animal populations worldwide. Some of these changes have been adaptive, leading to an increase in population fitness, whereas others have been associated with fitness decline. Representing short-term responses to an altered weather regime, hitherto observed changes are largely explained by phenotypic plasticity. However, to track climatically induced shifts in optimal phenotype as climate change proceeds, evolutionary capacity in key limiting climate-and fitness-related traits is likely to be crucial. In order to produce realistic predictions about the effects of climate change on species and populations, a main target for conservation biologists is thus to assess the potential of natural populations to respond by these two mechanisms. In this study we use a large 15-year dataset on an ectotherm model, the Swedish sand lizard (Lacerta agilis), to investigate how higher spring temperature is likely to affect oviposition timing in a high latitude population, a trait strongly linked to offspring fitness and survival.
   Results: With an interest in both the short-and potential long-term effect of rising temperatures, we applied a random regression model, which yields estimates of population-level plasticity and among-individual variation in the average, as well as the plastic, response to temperature. Population plasticity represents capacity for short-term adjustments whereas variation among individuals in a fitness-related trait indicates an opportunity for natural selection and hence for evolutionary adaptation. The analysis revealed both population-level plasticity and individual-level variation in average laying date. In contrast, we found no evidence for variation among females in their plastic responses to spring temperature, which could demonstrate a similarity in responses amongst females, but may also be due to a lack of statistical power to detect such an effect.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that climate warming may have positive fitness effects in this lizard population through an advancement of oviposition date. This prediction is consistent over shorter and potentially also longer time scales as the analysis revealed both population-level plasticity and individual-level variation in average laying date. However, the genetic basis for this variation would have to be examined in order to predict an evolutionary response.

AB  - Selection for efficient conversion of solar radiation to body heat has favored the evolution of dark coloration in many ectotherms. The thermal melanism hypothesis posits that dark coloration is beneficial under conditions of low ambient temperatures because it results in faster heating rates and higher body temperatures. Fast heating rates, however, may come at a cost of overheating unless compensated for by thermal physiology or behaviour. Pygmy grasshopper (Orthoptera, Tetrigidae) populations that inhabit fire-ravaged areas characterized by blackened backgrounds and hot surface temperatures due to high absorbance of solar radiation show an increased frequency of black phenotypes. I raised the progeny of wild-captured Tetrix undulata in cold and hot temperatures and used data on color patterns and survival in a greenhouse to examine whether a cold thermal environment triggered the development of melanic coloration or differently affected survival of melanic versus non-melanic individuals. My results indicate that melanism was not influenced by rearing temperature but by genes or epigenetic maternal effects. Temperature also did not affect survival. However, melanic individuals produced by melanic mothers survived longer than melanic individuals produced by non- melanic mothers, whereas non-melanic individuals produced by non-black mothers survived longer than melanic individuals produced by non-black mothers. This suggests a mismatch between color and physiology in offspring belonging to a different color morph than their mother. Future investigations into the evolution of melanism should consider conflicting selection pressures on thermal capacity and camouflage as well as the influence of correlated responses to selection on traits associated with coloration.

AB  - Laboratory experiments on Drosophila have often demonstrated increased heritability for morphological and life-history traits under environmental stress. We used parentoffspring comparisons to examine the impact of humidity levels on the heritability of a physiological trait, resistance to heat, measured as knockdown time at constant temperature. Drosophila melanogaster were reared under standard nonstressful conditions and heat-shocked as adults at extreme high or low humidity. Mean knockdown time was decreased in the stressful dry environment, but there was a significant sex-by-treatment interaction: at low humidity, females were more heat resistant than males, whereas at high humidity, the situation was reversed. Phenotypic variability of knockdown time was also lower in the dry environment. The magnitude of genetic correlation between the sexes at high humidity indicated genetic variation for sexual dimorphism in heat resistance. Heritability estimates based on one-parentoffspring regressions tended to be higher under desiccation stress, and this could be explained by decreased environmental variance of heat resistance at low humidity. There was no indication that the additive genetic variance and evolvability of heat resistance differed between the environments. The pattern of heritability estimates suggests that populations of D. melanogaster may have a greater potential for evolving higher thermal tolerance under arid conditions.

AB  - How insects evolve resistance or counter-resistance against antagonists is a basic issue in the study of host-parasitoid coevolution. One of the factors that affect their coevolution is fitness costs of resistance and counter-resistance. Here, we assess fitness costs of resistance against the parasitoid Leptopilina victoriae in Drosophila bipectinata on the basis of selection experiments. We made a base population by mixing three geographic fly populations that differed in resistance. The established base population was divided into four populations, two for selection of resistance against a L. victoriae population and two for control. Resistance increased rapidly in response to selection and reached a very high level within four generations in the selected populations, while resistance of the control populations remained low during 20 generations. High resistance of the selected populations was maintained at least for 10 generations after selection was stopped. Both selected populations had lower female longevity than the control populations, and at least one of the selected populations had shorter thorax length, lower female desiccation tolerance and adult heat tolerance than both or either of the control populations. On the other hand, the selected populations had higher male starvation tolerance and longevity than the control populations. There were no significant differences in resistance against another population of L. victoriae and two other parasitoid species between the selected and control populations. These results suggest that the resistance against the L. victoriae population in D. bipectinata may incur some but not so high costs and act parasitoid-species-and/or parasitoid-population-specifically.

AB  - With global temperatures projected to surpass the limits of thermal tolerance for many species, evaluating the heritable variation underlying thermal tolerance is critical for understanding the potential for adaptation to climate change. We examined the evolutionary potential of thermal tolerance within a population of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) by conducting a full-factorial breeding design and measuring the thermal performance of cardiac function and the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of offspring from each family. Additive genetic variation in offspring phenotypewas mostly negligible, although these direct genetic effects explained 53% of the variation in resting heart rate (f(H)). Conversely, maternal effects had a significant influence on resting f(H), scope for f(H), cardiac arrhythmia temperature and CTmax. These maternal effects were associated with egg size, as indicated by strong relationships between the mean egg diameter of mothers and offspring thermal tolerance. Because egg size can be highly heritable in chinook salmon, our finding indicates that the maternal effects of egg size constitute an indirect genetic effect contributing to thermal tolerance. Such indirect genetic effects could accelerate evolutionary responses to the selection imposed by rising temperatures and could contribute to the population-specific thermal tolerance that has recently been uncovered among Pacific salmon populations.

AB  - Local climate is an important source of selection on thermal reaction norms that has been well investigated in cline studies, where populations sampled along altitudinal or latitudinal gradients are compared. Several biotic factors vary with climate, but are rarely integrated as alternative agents of selection to climatic factors. We tested the hypothesis that habitat may select for thermal reaction norms and magnitude of phenotypic plasticity in a drosophila parasitoid, independently of the climate of origin. We sampled populations of Leptopilina boulardi, a Drosophila parasitoid in two different habitats, orchards and forests. Orchards offer laying opportunities over small distances for parasitoids, with a low variability in the number of hosts per patch, while forests offer more dispersed and more variable patches. The sampling was realized in a temperate and a Mediterranean climate. We measured egg load, volume of eggs, longevity and lipid content for parasitoids reared at two temperatures. Reaction norms were opposite for populations from forests and orchards for investment in reproduction, independently of the climate of origin. The maximal investment of resources in reproduction occurred at the lower temperature in orchards and the higher temperature in forests. Host distribution differences between habitats may explain these opposite reaction norms. We also observed a flatter reaction norm for egg load in forests than in orchards. This relative canalization may have been selected in response to the higher variability in laying opportunities observed in forests. Our results demonstrate the potential role of resource distribution in evolution of thermal plasticity.

AB  - Adaptive evolution and plasticity are two mechanisms that facilitate phenotypic differences between populations living in different environments. Understanding which mechanism underlies variation in fitness-related traits is a crucial step in designing conservation and restoration management strategies for taxa at risk from anthropogenic stressors. Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) have received considerable attention with regard to restoration, however there is limited information on adaptive population structure. Using oysters raised under common conditions for up to two generations (F1s and F2s), we tested for evidence of divergence in reproduction, larval growth, and juvenile growth among three populations in Puget Sound, Washington. We found that the population with the fastest growth rate also exhibited delayed and reduced reproductive activity, indicating a potential adaptive trade-off. Our results corroborate and extend upon a previous reciprocal transplant study on F1 oysters from the same populations, indicating that variation in growth rate and differences in reproductive timing are consistent across both natural and laboratory environments and have a strongly heritable component that cannot be entirely attributed to plasticity.

AB  - The mechanism(s) by which alpha (alpha) particles like those emitted from inhaled radon and radon progeny cause their carcinogenic effects in the lung remains unclear Although direct nuclear traversals by alpha-particles may be involved in mediating these outcomes, increasing evidence indicates that a particles can cause alterations in DNP, in the absence of direct hits to cell nuclei. Using the occurrence of excessive sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) as an index of DNA damage in human lung fibroblasts, we investigated the hypothesis that alpha-particles may induce DNA damage through the generation of extracellular factors. We have found that a relatively low dose of alpha-particles can result in the generation of extracellular factors, which, upon transfer to unexposed normal human cells, can cause excessive SCE to an extent equivalent to that observed when the cells are directly irradiated with the same irradiation dose. A short-lived, SCE-inducing factor(s) is generated in alpha-irradiated culture medium containing serum in the absence of cells. A more persistent SCE-inducing factor(s), which can survive freeze-thaw and is heat labile is produced by fibroblasts after exposure to the alpha-particles. These results indicate that the initiating target for alpha-particle-induced genetic changes can be larger than a cell's nucleus or even a whole cell. How transmissible factors like those observed here in vitro may extend to the in vivo condition in the context of alpha-particle-induced carcinogenesis in the respiratory tract remains to be determined.

AB  - For microorganisms cycling between free-living and host-associated stages, where reproduction occurs in both of these lifestyles, an interesting inquiry is whether adaptation to stress during the free-living stage can impact microbial fitness in the host. To address this topic, the mutualism between the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes) and the marine bioluminescent bacterium Vibrio fischeri was utilized. Using microbial experimental evolution, V. fischeri was selected to low (8 degrees C), high (34 degrees C), and fluctuating temperature stress (8 degrees C/34 degrees C) for 2000 generations. The temperatures 8 degrees C and 34 degrees C were the lower and upper growth limits, respectively. V. fischeri was also selected to benign temperatures (21 degrees C and 28 degrees C) for 2000 generations, which served as controls. V. fischeri demonstrated significant adaptation to low, high, and fluctuating temperature stress. V. fischeri did not display significant adaptation to the benign temperatures. Adaptation to stressful temperatures facilitated V. fischeri's ability to colonize the squid host relative to the ancestral lines. Bioluminescence levels also increased. Evolution to benign temperatures did not manifest these results. In summary, microbial adaptation to stress during the free-living stage can promote coevolution between hosts and microorganisms.

AB  - Relationships between changes of two species of terrestrial chironomids (Smittia cf. aterrima and Bryophaenocladius cf. virgo) and changes of vegetation cover during succession were studied with respect to plant - chironomid interaction in particular stages of chironomid life cycle. Several vegetation types forming vegetation mosaics in suburban fallow were distinguished according to their spatial architecture (height; density etc.). Abundance of chironomid larvae in particular type of vegetation and an area covered by these vegetation types were studied for three years. During one year the effect of vegetation types on density of aerial drift, oviposition habitat preference and adult emergence was studied in detail. Aerial drift was studied using pan traps, oviposition using soil sampling and adult emergence using emergence trap. Main results were similar for both species. Chironomid larvae were abundant in soil in initial years of succession. They were concentrated in patches with open and low height vegetation. Later their abundance decreased corresponding to a reduction of open and low vegetation areas. Greater density of aerial drift and oviposition preference was observed in areas of open and low vegetation. The success of larval development agreed with oviposition preference for winter larval generation only. The less preferred habitats seemed to be more suitable for summer generation. The results indicated that successional changes of terrestrial chironomids can be explained by the effect of vegetation cover on oviposition habitat preference.

AB  - The location of reproduction is a key life history trait, as it influences the bio-physical conditions that offspring experience and, thus, fitness. Capelin Mallotus villosus is a small (< 200 mm), short-lived forage fish that spawns in two habitats in coastal Newfoundland: warm beaches and cool, deep water (15-40 m). From 2009 to 2014, we investigated temperature-dependent spawning habitat use by quantifying hourly temperature at spawning sites during July within each habitat along with population-level spawning site use. Capelin did not spawn at sites with temperatures < 2 degrees C or consistently > 12 degrees C, supporting the estimated suitable spawning temperature range (2-12 degrees C). Spawning typically occurred exclusively at beaches early in July when deep-water habitat was too cold (i.e.< 2 degrees C), and then switched to deep-water habitat later in July when beaches became too warm (i.e.> 12 degrees C). Spawning overlapped for 1-3 d in both habitats when temperatures were within suitable ranges (2011, 2013), but capelin also spawned exclusively in one habitat when temperatures remained suitable in the other. The latter suggests that other factors influence spawning habitat selection, such as conspecific egg densities and other environmental conditions. Overall, the flexible use of spawning habitats, along with wide tolerance ranges of capelin eggs to environmental conditions, are likely key adaptations to maximize fitness and stabilize population dynamics of this important forage fish species in an unpredictable environment.

AB  - Trichogramma ostriniae Pang and Chen (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) was reared continuously for seven generations on its native host, the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia-furnacalis (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). It took 6.7 d at 33degreesC and 20 d at 17degreesC from oviposition to adult emergence with no differences between sexes. Several theoretic models were used to fit the temperature-dependent growth curves of T. ostriniae. A transformed day-degree model and the Hilbert-Logan model were the most reliable for predicting temperature development of T ostriniae. The wasps reared on O. furnacalis at 27degreesC by the seventh generation had a lower level of parasitism than wasps from other generations and at other temperatures (17-33degreesC). The number of wasps emerged from individual parasitized egg, and percentage of females produced did not differ for any generations and temperatures The differences among different generations for the amount and proportion of time female wasp spent drumming host eggs did not show any host-and generation-related trends. The time spent drumming by T ostriniae female wasps reared for three generations on O. furnacalis and then four and six generations on the rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton), differed slightly from the other generations. High variability among the tested wasps indicated that a large number of replicates would be needed to detect the probable differences among generations.

AB  - With increasing global climate change, analyses of stress-inducing conditions have important significance in ecological adaptation and the biological distribution of species. To reveal the difference in temperature-adaptive strategy between Turpan and Beijing populations of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) Middle East Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) under high-temperature stress conditions, we compared thermal tolerance and life history traits between Beijing and Turpan populations of MEAM1 after exposure to different heat shock treatments for different times. The experimental design reflected the nature of heat stress conditions suffered by MEAM1. The results showed that eggs, red-eyed pupae, and adults of the Turpan population were more heat tolerant than those of the Beijing population under the same stress conditions. Additionally, it was found that longevity and F1 adult survival rate were significantly higher in the Turpan population than in the Beijing population after heat shock stress, but egg number and F1 female ratio were not significantly different between Turpan population and Beijing population. Overall, it was suggested that heat tolerance and longevity traits were the most relevant for climate characteristics and not reproductive traits, and improved heat tolerance and prolonged longevity were important adaptive strategies that helped MEAM1 to survive in harsh high-temperature conditions such as Turpan arid desert climate. The present results provided further insight into the modes of heat tolerance and the ways in which survival and longevity traits respond to environmental selection pressures.

AB  - In insects changes in lipid metabolism may underlie a trade-off between cold resistance and starvation resistance. To test this we examined correlated responses in independent sets of Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for increased cold resistance and increased starvation resistance. The starvation lines showed correlated patterns found in other D. melanogaster populations selected for this trait, including higher lipid levels and increased resistance to desiccation, although the selected lines did not show a longer development time as found in some other studies. Consistent with the trade-off hypothesis, selected lines with increased starvation resistance showed decreased resistance to a cold stress as measured by mortality, whereas selected lines with increased cold resistance showed a decrease in starvation resistance. To counter the possibility of inadvertent selection accounting for these patterns, selected and control lines from both selection regimes were crossed to form mass bred populations, which were left for four generations prior to establishing isofemale lines. By scoring starvation and cold resistance in these lines derived from both sets of selection regimes, we confirmed the negative association between resistance to these stresses in females but not in males. Potential implications of this trade-off for surviving cold conditions when food resources are limiting are discussed.

AB  - Infections represent a constant threat for organisms and can lead to substantial fitness losses. Understanding how individuals, especially from natural populations, respond towards infections is thus of great importance. Little is known about immunity in the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). As the larvae live gregariously in family groups, vertical and horizontal transmission of infections could have tremendous effects on individuals and consequently impact population dynamics in nature. We used the Alphabaculovirus type strain Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and demonstrated that positive concentration-dependent baculovirus exposure leads to prolonged developmental time and decreased survival during larval and pupal development, with no sex specific differences. Viral exposure did not influence relative thorax mass or wing morphometric traits often related to flight ability, yet melanisation of the wings increased with viral exposure, potentially influencing disease resistance or flight capacity via thermal regulation. Further research is needed to explore effects under sub-optimal conditions, determine effects on fitness-related traits, and investigate a potential adaptive response of increased melanisation in the wings due to baculovirus exposure.

AB  - Parental effects can prepare offspring for different environments and facilitate survival across generations. We exposed parental populations of the estuarine anemone, Nematostella vectensis, from Massachusetts to elevated temperatures and quantified larval mortality across a temperature gradient. We found that parental exposure to elevated temperatures resulted in a consistent increase in larval thermal tolerance, as measured by the temperature at which 50% of larvae die (LT50), with a mean increase in LT50 of 0.3 degrees C. Larvae from subsequent spawns returned to baseline thermal thresholds when parents were returned to normal temperatures, indicating plasticity in these parental effects. Histological analyses of gametogenesis in females suggested that these dynamic shifts in larval thermal tolerance may be facilitated by maternal effects in non-overlapping gametic cohorts. We also compared larvae from North Carolina (a genetically distinct population with higher baseline thermal tolerance) and Massachusetts parents, and observed that larvae from heat-exposed Massachusetts parents had thermal thresholds comparable to those of larvae from unexposed North Carolina parents. North Carolina parents also increased larval thermal tolerance under the same high-temperature regime, suggesting that plasticity in parental effects is an inherent trait for N. vectensis. Overall, we find that larval thermal tolerance in N. vectensis shows a strong genetic basis and can be modulated by parental effects. Further understanding of the mechanisms behind these shifts can elucidate the fate of thermally sensitive ectotherms in a rapidly changing thermal environment.

AB  - Cold sensitivity of entomopathogenic nematodes severely restricts their biological control potential in some environments. We selected the SN strain of Steinernema feltiae together with its bacterial symbiont, Xenorhabdus bovenii, for improved cold tolerance by repeated passage through the wax moth Galleria mellonella larvae at 15 degrees C. Nematode virulence (total insect mortality and speed of kill) and establishment (initiation of nematode development following penetration) were evaluated after six (=12-24 generations) and 12 passages (=24-36 generations). Cold selection enhanced nematode virulence at the cooler temperatures. Virulence measured as total insect-mortality at 8 degrees C improved by 5.3- and 6.6-fold after six and 12 passages, respectively. Only small improvements (1.2-1.5-fold) were observed in speed of kill. Nematode establishment improved at all temperatures after 12 passages; the highest increase of 9-fold was observed at 8 degrees C. Our results lend support to the hypotheses that functional traits along a continuously distributed environmental variable are genetically correlated and that the area under the fitness function is not always constant. Trade-offs in percentage mortality and speed of kill by the selected nematodes were observed at the warmer extreme after six passages of selection only. The implications of rapid changes in thermal sensitivity for economic mass-production of nematodes are discussed.

AB  - The acute whole sediment bioassay with the estuarine and marine amphipod Corophium volutator (Pallas) is broadly used within Europe. Hitherto, the test is carried out with field-collected animals. In order to provide a more standardized and continuously available test organism reproduction and growth experiments were performed for a period of one year in laboratory under simulated summer conditions (light/dark 16:8 at 15, 19, and 23 degrees C). C. volutator was the first time reproduced successfully in laboratory for several generations and independent from its natural life cycle also in winter. The females produced two to three broods with a mean number of 96 offspring. A mean growth rate of 0.07 mm per day was determined at 15 degrees C. The reproduction and growth experiments provide consequently the essential base for the development of a chronic toxicity test with C. volutator. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The pivotal question in the debate on the ecological effects of climate change is whether species will be able to adapt fast enough to keep up with their changing environment. If we establish the maximal rate of adaptation, this will set an upper limit to the rate at which temperatures can increase without loss of biodiversity.
   The rate of adaptation will primarily be set by the rate of microevolution since (i) phenotypic plasticity alone is not sufficient as reaction norms will no longer be adaptive and hence microevolution on the reaction norm is needed, (ii) learning will be favourable to the individual but cannot be passed on to the next generations, (iii) maternal effects may play a role but, as with other forms of phenotypic plasticity, the response of offspring to the maternal cues will no longer be adaptive in a changing environment, and (iv) adaptation via immigration of individuals with genotypes adapted to warmer environments also involves microevolution as these genotypes are better adapted in terms of temperature, but not in terms of, for instance, photoperiod.
   Long-term studies on wild populations with individually known animals play an essential role in detecting and understanding the temporal trends in life-history traits, and to estimate the heritability of, and selection pressures on, life-history traits. However, additional measurements on other trophic levels and on the mechanisms underlying phenotypic plasticity are needed to predict the rate of microevolution, especially under changing conditions.
   Using this knowledge on heritability of, and selection on, life-history traits, in combination with climate scenarios, we will be able to predict the rate of adaptation for different climate scenarios. The final step is to use ecoevolutionary dynamical models to make the link to population viability and from there to biodiversity loss for those scenarios where the rate of adaptation is insufficient.

AB  - We used experimental evolution to test directly the important and commonplace evolutionary hypothesis that adaptation, increased fitness within the selective environment, is accompanied by trade-off, a loss of fitness in other nonselective environments. Specifically, we determined whether trade-offs at high temperature generally and necessarily accompany genetic adaptation to low temperature. We measured the relative fitness increment of 24 lineages of the bacterium Escherichia coli evolved for 2,000 generations at 20 degrees C and the relative fitness decrement of these lines at 40 degrees C. Trade-offs at the higher temperature were examined for their generality, universality, quantitative relationship, and historical contingency. Considering all 24 lines as a group, a significant decline in fitness was found at 40 degrees C (mean decline = 9.4%), indicating the generality of the trade-off effect. However, in a lineage-by-lineage analysis, only 15 of 24 showed a significant trade-off, and one lineage increased fitness at high temperature. Thus, although general, trade-offs were not universal. Furthermore, there was no quantitative association between the magnitude of adaptive fitness increment at 20 degrees C and fitness decline at 40 degrees C, and no effect of lineages' historical thermal environment on either their improvement at 20 degrees C or the extent of their trade-off at high temperature. We do not yet know the underlying mechanisms responsible for the trade-off, but they are sufficiently prevalent to drive a general effect. However, approximately one-third of the experimental lineages achieved low-temperature adaptation without detectable high-temperature trade-offs; therefore, it cannot be necessary that every change conferring benefit in cold environments has a negative effect on function in warmer environments.

AB  - To examine how the duration of laboratory domestication may affect Drosophila stocks used in studies of thermotolerance, we measured expression of the inducible heat-shock protein Hsp70 and survival after heat shock in D. melanogaster strains recently collected from nature and maintained in laboratory culture for up to 50 or more generations. After an initial increase in both Hsp70 expression and thermotolerance immediately after transfer to laboratory medium, both traits remained fairly constant over time and variation among strains persisted through laboratory domestication. Furthermore, variation in heat tolerance and Hsp70 expression did not correlate with the length of time populations evolved in the laboratory. Therefore, while environmental variation likely contributed most to early shifts in strain tolerance and Hsp70 expression, other population parameters, for example genetic drift, inbreeding, and selection likely affected these traits little. As long as populations are maintained with large numbers of individuals, the culture of insects in the laboratory may have little effect on the tolerance of different strains to thermal stress.

AB  - Most models of thermal adaptation ignore biotic interactions, and those that do consider biotic interactions assume that competitors or predators cannot respond to adaptation by the focal species. Nevertheless, real biotic interactions involve responsive entities, which can be more accurately modelled using evolutionary game theory.
   We present a two-part analysis of a thermal game between prey and predators. First, we model a game in which prey choose patches on the basis of operative temperature and predation risk, whereas predators choose patches on the basis of prey density. Second, we consider how this thermal game influences the evolution of the prey's thermal physiology.
   The solution of the thermal game is an evolutionarily stable Nash equilibrium in which prey divide their time equally among a range of thermal patches while predators bias their hunting efforts toward warmer patches, even though they derive no thermoregulatory benefit from doing so. Furthermore, the optimal range of temperatures selected by prey and predators increases as the lethality of predators increases.
   This thermal game potentially influences the evolution of the prey's thermal physiology. When predators are less lethal, prey should thermoregulate over a narrower range of temperatures, resulting in selection for thermal specialization of physiological performance. But when predators are very lethal, prey should thermoregulate over a broad range of temperatures; in this case, prey pay no fitness cost for being thermal generalists.
   Evolutionary game theory provides a powerful tool for generating hypotheses about the effects of biotic interactions on evolution in heterogeneous environments.

AB  - The effect of temperature on the developmental time, survival, and reproduction of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) reared on sugarcane was studied at seven constant temperatures (16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 degrees C). The developmental threshold temperatures and effective accumulated temperatures for the whole generation were 17.41 degrees C and 1,590.72 DD, respectively. One generation had the highest survival rate (26.67%) at 28 degrees C. The egg failed to survive at 16 and 40 degrees C. The population trend index (I = 38.22) and net reproductive rate (R-o = 38.3) were highest at 28 degrees C. The net reproductive rate (R-o = 3.36), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m) = 0.0028), and finite capacity of increase (lambda = 1.0028) were lowest at 20 degrees C. The mean generation time (T-o = 85.82) was shortest at 36 degrees C. The population double time (PDT = 27.08) was shortest at 32 degrees C. Based on these studies, we concluded that the temperatures from 28 to 32 degrees C were the most suitable temperatures for the development of R. ferrugineus.

AB  - The transition from marine to freshwater habitats is one of the major steps in the evolution of life. In the decapod crustaceans, four groups have colonized fresh water at different geological times since the Triassic, the freshwater shrimps, freshwater crayfish, freshwater crabs and freshwater anomurans. Some families have even colonized terrestrial habitats via the freshwater route or directly via the sea shore. Since none of these taxa has ever reinvaded its environment of origin the Decapoda appear particularly suitable to investigate life-history adaptations to fresh water. Evolutionary comparison of marine, freshwater and terrestrial decapods suggests that the reduction of egg number, abbreviation of larval development, extension of brood care and lecithotrophy of the first posthatching life stages are key adaptations to fresh water. Marine decapods usually have high numbers of small eggs and develop through a prolonged planktonic larval cycle, whereas the production of small numbers of large eggs, direct development and extended brood care until the juvenile stage is the rule in freshwater crayfish, primary freshwater crabs and aeglid anomurans. The amphidromous freshwater shrimp and freshwater crab species and all terrestrial decapods that invaded land via the sea shore have retained ocean-type planktonic development. Abbreviation of larval development and extension of brood care are interpreted as adaptations to the particularly strong variations of hydrodynamic parameters, physico-chemical factors and phytoplankton availability in freshwater habitats. These life-history changes increase fitness of the offspring and are obviously favoured by natural selection, explaining their multiple origins in fresh water. There is no evidence for their early evolution in the marine ancestors of the extant freshwater groups and a preadaptive role for the conquest of fresh water. The costs of the shift from relative r- to K-strategy in freshwater decapods are traded-off against fecundity, future reproduction and growth of females and perhaps against size of species but not against longevity of species. Direct development and extension of brood care is associated with the reduction of dispersal and gene flow among populations, which may explain the high degree of speciation and endemism in directly developing freshwater decapods. Direct development and extended brood care also favour the evolution of social systems, which in freshwater decapods range from simple subsocial organization to eusociality. Hermaphroditism and parthenogenesis, which have evolved in some terrestrial crayfish burrowers and invasive open water crayfish, respectively, may enable populations to adapt to restrictive or new environments by spatio-temporal alteration of their socio-ecological characteristics. Under conditions of rapid habitat loss, environmental pollution and global warming, the reduced dispersal ability of direct developers may turn into a severe disadvantage, posing a higher threat of extinction to freshwater crayfish, primary freshwater crabs, aeglids and landlocked freshwater shrimps as compared to amphidromous freshwater shrimps and secondary freshwater crabs.

AB  - We report the results of two independent selection experiments that have exposed distinct populations of Drosophila melanogaster to different forms of thermal selection. A recombinant population derived from Arvin California and Zimbabwe isofemale lines was exposed to laboratory natural selection at two temperatures (T-AZ: 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C). Microsatellite mapping identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) on the X-chromosome between the replicate "Hot" and "Cold" populations. In a separate experiment, disruptive selection was imposed on an outbred California population for the "knockdown" temperature (T-KD) in a thermal column. Microsatellite mapping of the "High" and "Low" populations also uncovered primarily X-linked QTL. Notably, a marker in the shaggy locus at band 3A was significantly differentiated in both experiments. Finer scale mapping of the 3A region has narrowed the QTL to the shaggy gene region, which contains several candidate genes that function in circadian rhythms. The same allele that was increased in frequency in the High T-KD populations is significantly clinal in North America and is more common at the warm end of the cline (Florida vs. Maine; however, the cline was not apparent in Australia). Together, these studies show that independent selection experiments can uncover the same target of selection and that evolution in the laboratory can recapitulate putatively adaptive clinal variation in nature.

AB  - Small pelagic fishes show spatiotemporal variations in reproductive traits due probably to responses to varying environmental conditions, but potential genetic contributions to such variations have received little attention. This study compared several reproductive traits of Japanese anchovy between two geographically isolated populations, from the central Seto Inland Sea and Omura Bay, western Japan, under common environmental conditions over three generations. There were no significant differences in age and standard length at sexual maturation between populations. Temperature-mediated variation in egg size was found in the two populations with decrease in egg size as temperature increased. However, regression analysis showed that the relationship between egg size and temperature differed significantly between the two populations over three generations. There was also a significant difference in the relative batch fecundity of the F1 and F2 generations between populations. Hence, females from the central Seto Inland Sea could produce a larger number of smaller eggs than females from Omura Bay. Variation in egg size appears to reflect significant differences in larval size at hatch and the onset of feeding in waters of different temperatures. These findings suggest that the thermal reaction norms of egg size observed in the two populations could have genetic contributions and that their egg traits may mediate a possible difference in offspring viability during early life stages.

AB  - Among-population variation in insect thermal performance is important for understanding patterns and mechanisms of evolution and predicting insect responses to altered climate regimes in future or novel environments. Here we review and discuss several key examples of among-population variation in insect thermal performance, including latitudinal gradients in chill coma recovery time, variation in energy consumption and metabolic biochemistry, rapid changes in thermal biology with range expansion in invasive and introduced species, and potential constraints on variation in thermal performance traits. This review highlights that while there is substantial evidence for among-population variation that is generally correlated with local climate regimes, neither the underlying mechanisms nor the implications for whole-animal fitness in the field are well understood. We also discuss the potential limitations of interpreting evolved variation among populations and argue for a genes-to-environment approach to population-level variation in thermal biology of insects.

AB  - There is a global push for harnessing the solar energy for electricity generation and Photovoltaic cell is the leading technology in this endeavour. However, PVCs face an imminent drop in thermal performance at elevated collector plate temperature. To deal with this conundrum, a proposed microchannels based cooling system is integrated into the collector. To this end, a comprehensive 2-D numerical model has been developed using COMSOL Multiphysics. This model has been validated with existing literature. The variation of temperature across the channel is studied under varying conditions of Reynolds number and inlet temperature of microchannel. Cooling efficiency is selected as the parameter to judge the viability of this system.

AB  - The life history traits of blow fly Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius, 1775) was studied under semi-controlled laboratory conditions at 29.14 degrees C temperature, 72.53% relative humidity, and 12-h photoperiod. The raw data were analyzed based on the age-stage, two-sex life table, considering the development rates among individuals of both sexes. Cochliomyia macellaria survival rate was 0.43 (male) and 0.40 (female), while life expectancy was 17.9 (male) and 20.9 (female) days, for adult males and females, respectively. The total fecundity was 681.15 eggs/female, with an average of 3.65 batches/female and 199 eggs/batch. The intrinsic rate of increase (r) was 0.327 days(-1), the finite rate of population increase (lambda) was 3.35 days(-1), the mean generation time (T) was 17.15 days, and the net reproduction rate (R-O) was 272.46 offspring/individual. The population parameters found here corroborates that C. macellaria population act as a r selected species under laboratory conditions. Additionally, development data and accumulated degree days (ADD) for each stage of C. macellaria are provided and its implications for the forensic use are discussed.

AB  - The developmental rate and reproductive biology of Neoseiulus californicus, a generalist predator on spider mites and small insects, was investigated in the laboratory at five constant temperatures: 15, 20, 25, 30, and 34A degrees C. The European red mite, Panonychus ulmi, an important pest in Korean apple orchards, was used as prey. Mean developmental time and adult longevity were inversely related to temperature from 15 to 30A degrees C. Lifetime fecundity was greatest at 25A degrees C, whereas daily fecundity was highest at 30A degrees C. The sex ratio (female to male) was highest (0.77) at 25A degrees C and lowest (0.67) at 34A degrees C. Survivorship during immature development varied from 74.3 to 92.9%, with the lowest rate at 34A degrees C. Life table parameters were analyzed and pseudo-replicates for the generation time (t (G) ), the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r (m)), finite rate of increase (lambda), net reproductive rate (R (0)), and doubling time (t (D) ) were generated using the Jackknife method. Generation time (t (G) ) was lowest (10.7 days) at 34A degrees C, R (0) was highest (49.2) at 25A degrees C, and both r (m) (0.29) and lambda (1.34) were highest at 30A degrees C. In conclusion, the development and adult life-history traits obtained for N. californicus fed on P. ulmi indicated significant potential for biological control.

AB  - Many organisms display phenotypic plasticity as adaptation to seasonal environmental fluctuations. Often, such seasonal responses entails plasticity of a whole suite of morphological and life-history traits that together contribute to the adaptive phenotypes in the alternative environments. While phenotypic plasticity in general is a well-studied phenomenon, little is known about the evolutionary fate of plastic responses if natural selection on plasticity is relaxed. Here, we study whether the presumed ancestral seasonal plasticity of the rainforest butterfly Bicyclus sanaos (Fabricius, 1793) is still retained despite the fact that this species inhabits an environmentally stable habitat. Being exposed to an atypical range of temperatures in the laboratory revealed hidden reaction norms for several traits, including wing pattern. In contrast, reproductive body allocation has lost the plastic response. In the savannah butterfly, B. anynana (Butler, 1879), these traits show strong developmental plasticity as an adaptation to the contrasting environments of its seasonal habitat and they are coordinated via a common developmental hormonal system. Our results for B. sanaos indicate that such integration of plastic traits - as a result of past selection on expressing a coordinated environmental response - can be broken when the optimal reaction norms for those traits diverge in a new environment.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) poses a global threat to marine biodiversity. Notwithstanding, marine organisms may maintain their performance under future OA conditions, either through acclimation or evolutionary adaptation. Surprisingly, the transgenerational effects of high CO2 exposure in crustaceans are still poorly understood. For the first time, the present study investigated the transgenerational effect of OA, from hatching to maturity, of a key amphipod species (Gammarus locusta). Negative transgenerational effects were observed on survival of the acidified lineage, resulting in significant declines (10-15%) compared to the control groups in each generation. Mate-guarding duration was also significantly reduced under high CO2 and this effect was not alleviated by transgenerational acclimation, indicating that precopulatory behaviours can be disturbed under a future high CO2 scenario. Although OA may initially stimulate female investment, transgenerational exposure led to a general decline in egg number and fecundity. Overall, the present findings suggest a potential fitness reduction of natural populations of G. Jocasta in a future high CO2 ocean, emphasizing the need of management tools towards species' sustainability.

AB  - P>1. Temperature is considered one of the most important mediators of phenotypic plasticity in ectotherms, resulting in predictable changes in egg size. However, the fitness consequences of temperature-induced plasticity in egg size are not well understood and are often assessed at mild temperatures, whereas in the field, extreme temperatures will occur.
   2. In this study we investigated egg size plasticity and fitness-linked traits of eggs in response to temperature in the springtail Orchesella cincta. Eggs were oviposited at two temperatures (16 and 20 degrees C), and transplanted to 10, 15 and 20 degrees C for rearing, or exposed to temperature shock (-6 and 38 degrees C) to measure survival, development rate and growth.
   3. Eggs oviposited at 16 degrees C had a greater volume and dry weight than eggs oviposited at 20 degrees C but had similar lipid content. Eggs oviposited at 16 degrees C had high survival at all rearing temperatures, whereas survival of eggs oviposited at 20 degrees C declined at lower rearing temperatures and was significantly lower than survival of large eggs when reared at 10 and 15 degrees C. No difference in egg development rate was found between oviposition temperatures, although development rate increased with rearing temperature. Juveniles were 5-10% larger when hatching from eggs oviposited at 16 degrees C, independent of the temperature at which the eggs were reared.
   4. Eggs oviposited at 16 degrees C were more resistant to thermal stress, as their survival after exposure to cold or heat shock was higher than survival of eggs oviposited at 20 degrees C. However, egg development rate of the eggs that survived temperature shock was not different from the control, independent of egg oviposition temperature.
   5. Our results show that temperature-induced plasticity in O. cincta affects fitness-linked traits of offspring through increased hatchling size and increased thermal tolerance of eggs produced at lower temperatures.
   6. The increased resistance to thermal stress of O. cincta eggs oviposited at lower temperatures may provide a protective strategy in uncertain thermal environments.

AB  - This paper presents a Fractional Order Integral-Proportional Derivative (FOI-PD) controller for Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of two-area Interconnected Power System (IPS) with six multiple generations units in a restructured environment. Further, the two-area IPS is composed of multiple non-linearities with Time Delay (TD), Boiler Dynamic (BD), Governor Dead Zone/Band (GDZ/GDB) and Generation Rate Constraint (GRC). The gains of the proposed controller are optimized by a most recent powerful meta-heuristic algorithm known as Improved-Fitness Dependent Optimizer (I-FDO). The efficiency of the proposed approach is compared with other techniques such as Firefly Algorithm (FA), Fitness Dependent Optimizer (FDO) and Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithms. Further, to enhance the performance of the system, Redox Flow Batteries (RFB) is incorporated in each area and Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) in the tie-line of the power system. Results reveal that our proposed approach performs superior in terms of less Overshoot (Os), Settling time (Ts) and Undershoot (Us). Robustness of the proposed controller is verified by changing system parameters within a range of +/- (25) %.

AB  - In this paper, the productivity of the use of sugarcane bagasse and petroleum derivatives for the generation of electric energy was evaluated using the DEAP and Malmquist indexes. The results show that the total productivity of the factors of the use of bagasse to generate electrical energy registers an interannual decrease. In the case of the use of petroleum derivatives to generate energy, the total factor productivity in general average registered deterioration; however, some of the thermal plants studied registered a growth rate. This means that there is an opportunity for the review of production processes to increase the productivity of the use of bagasse and that oil derivatives are being managed with greater productivity to generate electricity.

AB  - Seasonality is a critically important aspect of environmental variability, and strongly shapes all aspects of life for organisms living in highly seasonal environments. Seasonality has played a key role in generating biodiversity, and has driven the evolution of extreme physiological adaptations and behaviors such as migration and hibernation. Fluctuating selection pressures on survival and fecundity between summer and winter provide a complex selective landscape, which can be met by a combination of three outcomes of adaptive evolution: genetic polymorphism, phenotypic plasticity, and bet-hedging. Here, we have identified four important research questions with the goal of advancing our understanding of evolutionary impacts of seasonality. First, we ask how characteristics of environments and species will determine which adaptive response occurs. Relevant characteristics include costs and limits of plasticity, predictability, and reliability of cues, and grain of environmental variation relative to generation time. A second important question is how phenological shifts will amplify or ameliorate selection on physiological hardiness. Shifts in phenology can preserve the thermal niche despite shifts in climate, but may fail to completely conserve the niche or may even expose life stages to conditions that cause mortality. Considering distinct environmental sensitivities of life history stages will be key to refining models that forecast susceptibility to climate change. Third, we must identify critical physiological phenotypes that underlie seasonal adaptation and work toward understanding the genetic architectures of these responses. These architectures are key for predicting evolutionary responses. Pleiotropic genes that regulate multiple responses to changing seasons may facilitate coordination among functionally related traits, or conversely may constrain the expression of optimal phenotypes. Finally, we must advance our understanding of how changes in seasonal fluctuations are impacting ecological interaction networks. We should move beyond simple dyadic interactions, such as predator prey dynamics, and understand how these interactions scale up to affect ecological interaction networks. As global climate change alters many aspects of seasonal variability, including extreme events and changes in mean conditions, organisms must respond appropriately or go extinct.

AB  - This paper traces the development of a software tool, based on a combination of artificial neural networks (ANN) and a few process equations, aiming to serve as a backup operation instrument in the reference generation for the real-time controllers of a steel tandem cold mill. By emulating the mathematical model responsible for generating the presets under normal operational conditions, the system works as an option to maintain plant operation in the event of a failure in the processing unit that executes the mathematical model. The system, built from the production data collected over six years of plant operation, steered to the replacement of the former backup operation mode (based on a lookup table), which degraded both product quality and plant productivity. The study showed that ANN are appropriated tools for the intended purpose and that, by this instrument, it is possible to achieve virtually all the presets needed by this kind of process. The text characterizes the problem, relates the investigated options to solve it, justifies the choice of the ANN approach, describes the methodology and system implementation and, finally, shows and discusses the attained results.

AB  - The tropical house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus was cultured by feeding the females on an artificial diet, not on live animals or whole blood. This anautogenous strain has been maintained for more than fifty generations. The blood replacement diet for female mosquitoes, designed to simulate the tonicity and density of host blood, was based on ovalbumin, soya infant formula, globulins and adenosine triphosphate.
   Female adults of Cx quinquefasciatus were fed the artificial blood formula from 'Parafilm' wax membrane-covered beakers. The diet was heated by radiant heat from a chamber containing an exothermic chemical reaction. This maintained the diet at a temperature of 33-37 degrees C for a period of up to 6 h, sufficient time to enable all the female mosquitoes to imbibe to satiation. After six generations on the artificial diet, female fecundity stabilized to a satisfactory level: the number of eggs per gonotrophic cycle averaged c. 85% of the 'control' strain fed on whole blood from live anaesthetized guineapigs, i.e. 156 eggs per female from nine feeds on the artificial diet compared with 183 from six feeds of whole blood. Adult weight of Cx quinquefasciatus females was not significantly different, from generation 6 onwards, for strains fed on artificial diet or whole blood. Sex ratio and the rate of egg viability were also equivalent for the two strains.

AB  - Little is known about the natural ecology of European eel during early life history. We extend our understandings on the ecology of this species by studying how early life stages perform under various light regimes. We assessed the effects of intensity, photoperiod (12:12 and 24:0 h light/dark) and spectral composition on embryonic survival, hatch success, larval morphology and survival at 5 days post-hatch. Treatments consisted of low intensity white (full spectrum, 2.2 mu mol m(2) s(-1)), blue (-470 nm, 0.7 mu mol m(2) s(-1)), green (-530 nm, 0.4 mu mol m(2) s(-1)), red (-690 nm, 02 mu mol m(2) s(-1)) and high intensity white (full spectrum, 10.5 mu mol m2 5-1), blue (-470 nm, 3.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), green (-530 nm, 1.5 mu mol m(2) s(-1)), and red light (-690 nm, 1.1 mu mol m(2) s(-1)). Additionally, offspring were reared in continuous darkness (0:24 h light/dark). Results showed that light critically influenced early life stages. In particular, for the 12:12 h photoperiod, embryonic survival, until 26 h post-fertilization was significantly higher when reared under low (62 +/- 13%) than those reared under high intensity light (42 13%). Furthermore, embryos reared in low light had a higher hatch success (16 +/- 7%) than those in high intensity light (12 7%). Larval yolk-sac area was significantly affected by photoperiod and body area was significantly affected by the interaction between intensity x photoperiod. The highest incidence of deformities (75%) occurred when embryos were reared in high intensity white light under a 24:0 h light/dark photoperiod. Larval survival was significantly affected by light regime, such that larvae reared in low light intensity had higher survival (20 +/- 8%) than those reared in high intensity (11 +/- 8%), larvae reared in the 12:12 h photoperiod had higher survival (19 +/- 8%) than those reared in the 24:0 h light/dark photoperiod (13 +/- 8%), and larvae reared in red light (22 +/- 8%) had higher survival than those reared in green (14 +/- 8%) or white light (11 +/- 8%). Under continuous darkness, development and survival of offspring was as high as the best intensity-photoperiod-spectral composition regime. For all early life history traits, a strong maternal effect was evident, such that offspring of 'poorer' quality showed lower adaptability to extrinsic factors than offspring of higher quality. Together, these findings suggest a preference for no or low light during embryogenesis and no or 12:12 h low red light during the pre-leptocephalus stage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Exploitation of rapeseed and sunflower residues for methane generation through anaerobic digestion: the effect of pretreatment
T2  - IBIC2010: 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY
LA  - English
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Industrial Biotechnology
AB  - The present study aimed at assessing the anaerobic digestion process efficiency on rapeseed and sunflower residues. Batch mesophilic biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests were carried out and the methane potential as well as the biodegradability of all feedstocks, were determined. The experimental studies indicated that the biological methane potential of rapeseed and sunflower meal were 0.450 m(3)/kg and 0.481 m(3)/kg, respectively. Moreover, the biological methane potential of rapeseed straws was 0.264 m(3)/kg, while the respective value from sunflower straws was 0.260 m(3)/kg. For both rapeseed and sunflower residues, the methane potential of meal residues is much higher than the respective for straws residues. A possible reason for this could be the different composition of the feedstocks in terms of lignin. various pretreatment methods, such as thermal, chemical (through alkali or acid addition) or combination of the above methods were also tested in the effort to enhance the methane productivity and yield. The experiments showed that the pretreatment methods tested did not enhance the methane potential of the rapeseed and sunflower residues. This could be attributed to the inhibitory compounds which were possibly released during the pretreatment.

AB  - Adaptation to environmental temperature depends on both direct and correlated responses to selection for reproduction and survival at elevated temperature. Sexual selection is one of the most powerful of all evolutionary forces and we tested both fecundity and longevity for their correlated responses to sexual selection on the ability to mate (mating success) at high temperature. Replicated lines selected for 15 generations of mating at 33 degrees C (S lines) were compared to their respective controls (C lines) in D. buzzatii in three thermal regimes: 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C and a cyclic thermal regime for longevity from 17 to 32 degrees C. Previous work showed that S lines successfully responded for the trait selected and the present results show a trade-off in males between mating success at elevated temperature and longevity in all three thermal regimes tested. In addition, inter-sexual relationships of trade-offs were apparent between male longevity and female fecundity as correlated selection responses. In this sex-specific association of trade off, S females exhibited higher fecundity than C females at 30 degrees C only if females were exposed to a limited social environment of a single male. Overall, selection for mating at high temperature increases female fecundity at high temperature but decreases longevity in males. This sex-specific and negative impact on longevity in males could be the result of a genetic correlation between mating success at high temperature and reduced longevity in this sex.

AB  - Microalgae have increased in demand as raw materials for functional biomolecules and biodiesel production. Various physiological and technological approaches have been investigated for maximizing productivity of microalgae. In the present study, we investigated the optimal condition of electrolysis-based water treatment system (EWTS) applicable to mass culture of marine microalgae. The first step was an electrolysis-based chlorination process of seawater for the on-site generation of biocide solution, and the initial total residual oxidants (TROs) of 20 mg/L was sufficient to completely eliminate contaminating aquatic organisms regardless incoming seawater quality such as high total organic carbon within 24 h. The second step was neutralization of residual TRO to prevent toxicity against microalgae culture, and sodium thiosulfate of 36 mg/L was optimum against the highest estimate of TRO 20 mg/L. Tetraselmis suecica cultured in seawater from neutralized EWTS showed similar growth curve with autoclaved seawater both in laboratory and outdoor culture conditions, which suggested that EWTS could be applied as an effective tool for the generation of basic media for biomass production of microalgae in outdoor culture system.

AB  - To better predict how populations and communities respond to climatic temperature variation, it is necessary to understand how the shape of the response of fitness-related rates to temperature evolves (the thermal performance curve). Currently, there is disagreement about the extent to which the evolution of thermal performance curves is constrained. One school of thought has argued for the prevalence of thermodynamic constraints through enzyme kinetics, whereas another argues that adaptation can-at least partly-overcome such constraints. To shed further light on this debate, we perform a phylogenetic meta-analysis of the thermal performance curves of growth rate of phytoplankton-a globally important functional group-controlling for environmental effects (habitat type and thermal regime). We find that thermodynamic constraints have a minor influence on the shape of the curve. In particular, we detect a very weak increase of maximum performance with the temperature at which the curve peaks, suggesting a weak "hotter-is-better" constraint. Also, instead of a constant thermal sensitivity of growth across species, as might be expected from strong constraints, we find that all aspects of the thermal performance curve evolve along the phylogeny. Our results suggest that phytoplankton thermal performance curves adapt to thermal environments largely in the absence of hard thermodynamic constraints.

AB  - A comprehensive experiment was carried out to study the effect of different temperature regimes (18 degrees C for 20 days, 36 degrees C for 10 days or 38 degrees C for 10 days starting on day 10 post fertilization) on sex ratios in two different Nile tilapia populations (Lake Manzala-Egypt, Lake Rudolph-Kenya) and their crosses, as well as to study the repeatability of the obtained results and the effects of mating partners, including temperature-treated males, on temperature responsiveness. In total about 15,000 temperature-treated fish and their corresponding 10,000 fullsib controls were sexed. Results of this study confirmed results from other studies that high temperature treatments could increase the percentage of males in the offspring of Nile tilapia by converting females into functional males (XX neomales). Compared to the 36 degrees C treatment, a further increase in males was not obtained with a treatment of 38 degrees C in the majority of the tested progenies in both populations. The low temperature treatment (18 degrees C) was, in general, not effective in influencing the sex ratios. Significant differences between populations to high temperature responsiveness were observed with regard to the degree and the range of response. In the Lake Manzala population, 66% of the temperature-treated progenies (36 degrees C) showed sex ratios with more than 80% males, while in the Lake Rudolph population, no temperature-treated progeny (36 degrees C) showed such a corresponding surplus of males, neither did the crossbreds. Spawns within the Lake Manzala population were repeated and the percentage of males in the 36 degrees C-treated replicated spawns differed only by 2% to 6%. Temperature-treated progenies derived from genetic males out of temperature-sensitive progenies reflected the sex ratios of the progenies the sires had been taken from and indicated that the sensitivity to temperature treatment is heritable. Data on paternal and maternal half sibs used as experimental fish, showed that the sensitivity of sex ratios to temperature treatment varied between breeding pairs. Both parents, male and female, contributed to the different sex ratios after treatment. It was concluded that the sensitivity of sex determination to temperature treatments is under genetic control and suggests very promising chances for a selection response. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Investigating responses of organisms to stressful or new environments with selection pressure is one of the crucial problems in evolutionary biology, and it is of importance to understand the phenotypic and molecular mechanism underlying thermal tolerance under the context of the climate change. The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, inhabiting the environment with high variation in temperature, is a worldwide aquaculture species. However, summer mortality relevant to the high temperature is one of the problems challenging the oyster industry. An artificial selective breeding program was initiated to select for the thermal tolerance of oysters in an attempt to increase the summer survival rates since 2017 in our study. Parents of thermotolerance oyster selection is are based on acute thermal tolerance under controlled heat stress to strengthen the selection intensity. Furthermore, the phenotypic and the genotypic response to extreme high temperature were investigated based on the comparison of the F-1 progeny of the selected and natural populations in growth, physiology, mortality rate post heat stress, genetic structure, and gene expression. The parameter of growth showed no significant change between the selected and natural populations for the 6-month-old oysters. The selected population exhibited a higher survival rate after exposure to heat stress in the laboratory, which is in line with result of the filed experience that summer mortality of selected population was significantly lower than that of natural population. Further, the respiration rate of the selected population increased at 38 degrees C, while it increased at 35 degrees C in the natural population. Simultaneously, metabolism-related enzymes (PK, SOD) showed higher activity levels in the selected population. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis, population structure, and principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that the selected and natural populations exhibited genetic divergence, with eight genes (IF4A2, IF6, EIF3A, MANBA, DDX43, RECS, CAT2, and BAG4) in the selected regions showing differential expression patterns in response to heat stress in the two populations. This study suggests that artificial selection has a significant effect on phenotype and genome structure for the oyster, our study providing an alternative way to reveal the mechanism underlying thermotolerance that plays an important role to predict the potential adaptation to the climate change.

AB  - Neither the scale of adaptive variation nor the genetic basis for differential population responses to the environment is known for broadcast-spawning marine fishes. Using a common-garden experimental protocol, we document how larval growth, survival and their norms of reaction differ genetically among four populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). These traits, and their plastic responses to food and temperature, differed across spatial scales at which microsatellite DNA failed to detect population structure. Divergent survival reaction norms indicate that warm-water populations are more sensitive to changes in food, whereas cold-water populations are more sensitive to changes in temperature. Our results suggest that neither the direction nor the magnitude of demographic responses to environmental change need be the same among populations. Adaptive phenotypic plasticity, previously undocumented in marine fishes, can significantly influence the probability of recovery and persistence of collapsed populations by affecting their ability to respond to natural and anthropogenic environmental change.

AB  - For ectotherms, temperature modifies the rate of physiological function across a temperature tolerance window depending on thermal history, ontogeny, and evolutionary history. Some adult Antarctic fishes, with comparatively narrow thermal windows, exhibit thermal plasticity in standard metabolic rate; however, little is known about the shape or breadth of thermal performance curves of earlier life stages of Antarctic fishes. We tested the effects of acute warming (- 1 to 8 A degrees C) and temperature acclimation (2 weeks at - 1, 2, 4 A degrees C) on survival and standard metabolic rate in early embryos of the dragonfish Gymnodraco acuticeps from McMurdo Sound, Ross Island, Antarctica. Contrary to predictions, embryos acclimated to warmer temperatures did not experience greater mortality and nearly all embryos survived acute warming to 8 A degrees C. Metabolic performance curve height and shape were both significantly altered after 2 weeks of development at - 1 A degrees C, with further increase in curve height, but not alteration of shape, with warm temperature acclimation. Overall metabolic rate temperature sensitivity (Q (10)) from - 1 to 8 A degrees C varied from 2.6 to 3.6, with the greatest thermal sensitivity exhibited by embryos at earlier developmental stages. Interclutch variation in metabolic rates, mass, and development of simultaneously collected embryos was also documented. Taken together, metabolic performance curves provide insight into the costs of early development under warming temperatures, with the potential for thermal sensitivity to be modified by dragonfish phenology and magnitude of seasonal changes in temperature.

AB  - Across a range of taxa, individuals within a species differ in suites of correlated traits. These trait complexes, known as syndromes, can have dramatic evolutionary consequences as they do not evolve independently but rather as a unit. Current research focuses primarily on syndromes relating to aspects of behavior and life history. What is less clear is whether physiological traits also form a syndrome. We measured 10 thermal traits in the delicate skink, Lampropholis delicata, to test this idea. Repeatability was calculated and their across-context correlations evaluated. Our results were in alignment with our predictions in that individual thermal traits varied consistently and were structured into a physiological syndrome, which we are referring to as the thermal behavior syndrome (TBS). Within this syndrome, lizards exhibited a "thermal type" with each being ranked along a cold-hot continuum. Hot types had faster sprint speeds and higher preferred body temperatures, whereas the opposite was true for cold types. We conclude that physiological traits may evolve as a single unit driven by the need to maintain optimal temperatures that enable fitness-related behaviors to be maximized.

AB  - In order to understand the status of heteroplasmy and its evolution within the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup, cytoplasm microinjections between eggs were performed involving three lineages of Drosophila simulans, carrying the siI, siII or siIII mtDNA type, respectively, and two strains of Drosophila mauritiana carrying the maI or maII mtDNA type. Progeny of eggs from all combinations of injection were analysed. The maII or siI molecules, when provided by the donor, were never detected in the offspring of the hosts, whatever the host's mitochondrial type. Heteroplasmic flies were detected when siII, siIII or maI mitochondria were injected into any of the other cytoplasms. In the majority of cases the percentage of foreign mtDNA increased over generations, leading to a complete replacement of the endogenous mtDNA. In most cases, siII was prevalent. The stochastic processes involved in the evolution of heteroplasmic states are strongly affected by selective values of the different mtDNA types, with a clear hierarchy among them: siII has the most advantage, then siIII and maI, and finally siI and maII. In the siII/maII heteroplasmy case, the loss of maII was more rapid at a high temperature.

AB  - Endosymbiotic bacteria that potentially influence reproduction and other fitness-related traits of their hosts are widespread in arthropods, and their appeal to researchers' interest is growing. In this study, the influence of continuous high temperature conditions on Wolbachia infection frequency and the fitness of Liposcelis tricolor (Psocoptera: Liposcelididae) was studied in a laboratory. The results showed that the Wolbachia infection frequency was gradually decreased when L. tricolor was reared at 33 degrees C; after six generations of treatment, no Wolbachia wsp gene product was detected, suggesting that the Wolbachia infection was completely eliminated. The combined immature development periods and survival rates of L. tricolor did not vary significantly among six generations; however, the female longevities and fecundities dramatically declined from F-1 through F-6, resulting in decreasing values of population intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)). Using r(m) values, the fitness for F-2, F-3, F-4, F-5, and F-6 relative to F-1 was calculated as 0.995, 0.953, 0.811, 0.700, and 0.552, respectively. We realize that it is not possible to distinguish between the effects of high temperature may have on the metabolic processes of the psocids and the effects of temperature-induced reduction in bacterial infection frequencies. Our study confirms that the combined use of antibiotics and heat treatment is a good control measure for psocids.

AB  - There is a general agreement that the climate change, which is the most important challenge facing humanity, is anthropogenic and attributed to fossil fuel consumption. Therefore, deploying more renewable energy resources is an urgent issue to be addressed. Geothermal refers to existing heat energy in deep rock and sedimentary basins. Traditionally, geothermal energy has been exploited in places with plentiful hot water at relatively shallow depth. Unfortunately, the high exploration and drilling costs of boreholes is the main barrier to the commerciality of geothermal worldwide. In oil producing countries, such problems can be overcome by utilizing oil or gas wells. The current study presents thermodynamic and economic analyses of a binary geothermal power generation system for commercial electricity generation. Two different source temperatures (100 and 120 degrees C) and constant sink temperature (29 degrees C) were considered. The optimal working fluid and optimal design that improve the performance of the plant are determined. For the current costs in Qatar, the economical analysis of 5 MW geothermal plant shows that the levelized cost of electricity for the plant varies from 5.6 to 5.2 cent/kW. Whereas, the payback period of such plants lies between 5.8 and 4.8 years. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Analysis of size of offspring reared through three laboratory generations from populations of the field grasshopper Chorthippus brunneus from 27 sites around the British Isles showed that offspring were larger towards the cooler-wetter conditions in the western and northern limits of the range. This variation had a significant genetic component. There was a trade-off between clutch size and offspring size between and within populations. Under favourable thermal and feeding conditions maternal fitness was optimal when individuals produced the largest clutches of the smallest eggs, but under poor conditions maternal fitness was optimal when individuals produced small clutches of very large offspring. Calculation of geometric mean fitness over time indicated that having larger offspring near to the edge of the range could be advantageous as a conservative risk-spreading strategy. As well as geographic variation in egg size, significant environment-genotype interactions in egg size in relation to temperature were observed.

AB  - 1. Phenotypic variation within populations is influenced by the environment via plasticity and natural selection. How phenotypes respond to the environment can vary among traits, populations and life stages in ways that can influence fitness.
   2. Plastic responses during early development are particularly important because they can affect components of fitness throughout an individual's life. Consequently, how natural selection shapes developmental plasticity could be influenced by fitness consequences across different life stages. Moreover, spatial variation in selection pressures could generate differences in plastic responses among populations.
   3. To gain insight into sources of variation in phenotypes and survival, we used a laboratory egg incubation experiment using brown anole lizards Aeolis sagrei from mainland (ancestral) and island (descendent) populations, combined with a markrelease-recapture experiment in the field. Our study was designed to (a) quantify the effects developmental temperature on embryo development and offspring morphology, (b) assess how developmental temperature influences offspring survival across different life stages and (c) quantify how thermal reaction norms vary among ancestral and descendant populations.
   4. Developmental temperature influenced offspring morphology, but thermal reaction norms of embryos showed little variation among populations. Developmental temperature influenced offspring survival, but the patterns differed between embryo and hatchling stages; the optimal temperature for embryos was about 5 degrees C lower than that for hatchlings. High temperatures were thermally stressful to embryos, but they reduced incubation duration and led to early hatching. In turn, earlier hatching increased the probability of survival to adulthood. Moreover, the effect of developmental temperature on hatchling survival was most pronounced for offspring that hatched late in the season.
   5. The difference in optimal developmental temperatures between life stages may be driven by physiological tolerance for embryos and by ecological factors for hatchlings. Moreover, the fitness consequences of the developmental environment depend on the phenology of hatching. Overall, these results highlight how the developmental environment can differentially effect fitness across life stages and show that temporal thermal heterogeneity can influence survival of embryos, but the consequences on post-hatching stages may vary at different times of the season.

AB  - A comparative analysis was carried out of reproductive mode, larval development pattern, and larval growth rate under identical conditions of three members of the Capitella capitata species complex: Capitella sp I from New York, US, Capitella sp M from shallow hydrothermal vents off Milos, Greece, and Capitella sp S from an intertidal flat on Sylt, Germany. In addition, three populations from salmon farms, Capitella K (Kilmelford, Scotland), Capitella Cm and Capitella Ct (Cranford, Ireland), are described for the first time. Three development patterns were observed: planktotrophic (Capitella K and Ct populations), lecithotrophic (Capitella spp I, M and Cm populations), and direct development (Capitella sp S). Experiments with planktotrophic larvae from the Capitella K population at different temperatures, in the presence and absence of light and with several kinds of substrate were not successful in inducing settlement, although differences in the duration of larval survival were observed. Overall, major differences in reproductive modes and larval development patterns were observed among representatives of different species and populations reared under identical culture conditions. In contrast, such modes and patterns are consistent across generations. Whereas larval type and developmental mode appear to be determined largely by genetic factors, environmental conditions have an important influence on the timing of key developmental processes, such as settling and growth.

AB  - For organisms with complex life cycles, processes occurring at the interface between life stages can disproportionately impact survival and population dynamics. Temperature is an important factor influencing growth in poikilotherms, and growth-related processes are frequently correlated with survival. We examined the influence of water temperature on growth-related early life history traits (ELHTs) and differential mortality during the transition from larval to early juvenile stage in sixteen monthly cohorts of bicolor damselfish Stegastes partitus, sampled on reefs of the upper Florida Keys, USA over 6 years. Otolith analysis of settlers and juveniles coupled with environmental data revealed that mean near-reef water temperature explained a significant proportion of variation in pelagic larval duration (PLD), early larval growth, size-at-settlement, and growth during early juvenile life. Among all cohorts, surviving juveniles were consistently larger at settlement, but grew more slowly during the first 6 d post-settlement. For the other ELHTs, selective mortality varied seasonally: during winter and spring months, survivors exhibited faster larval growth and shorter PLDs, whereas during warmer summer months, selection on PLD reversed and selection on larval growth became non-linear. Our results demonstrate that temperature not only shapes growth-related traits, but can also influence the direction and intensity of selective mortality.

AB  - Oviposition site selection is crucial for the reproductive success of a herbivore insect species with relatively sedentary larvae. The optimal oviposition theory, i.e., the preference-performance hypothesis, has thus far mainly been tested with a focus on nutritional quality of the host. This study investigates whether female oriental fruit moth Grapholita (Cyclic) molesta choose a microhabitat for oviposition characterized by a temperature range within which their offspring perform best. Thermal preferences of females during oviposition were assessed in a circular temperature gradient arena. Offspring performance and survival were assessed under different constant temperature conditions. Females preferred oviposition sites of similar to 30 degrees C over lower and higher temperatures. At this temperature, egg, larval, and pupal development was significantly faster than at 22 and 25 degrees C, and larval development was also faster than at 33 degrees C. At 30 degrees C and at the lower temperatures tested, survival of eggs and larvae was significantly higher than at 33 degrees C, whereas development was precluded at 35 degrees C. Furthermore, female pupal weight attained at 30 and 33 degrees C exceeded that reached at the lower temperatures tested. Considering the potentially reduced predation risk caused by the shorter developmental time of eggs and larvae, the laboratory data suggest that this species maximizes its fitness by selecting a thermally optimal environment for its offspring, supporting the optimal oviposition theory. Conversely, it is known that the codling moth (C. pomonella) lacks a mechanism to avoid temperatures lethal to progeny development, which may reflect the differences in geographic ranges of these tortricids.

AB  - Facing climate change (CC), species are prone to multiple modifications in their environment that can lead to extinction, migration or adaptation. Identifying the role and interplay of different potential stressors becomes a key question. Anadromous fishes will be exposed to both river and oceanic habitat changes. For Atlantic salmon, the river water temperature, river flow and oceanic growth conditions appear as three main stressing factors. They could act on population dynamics or as selective forces on life-history pathways. Using an individual-based demo-genetic model, we assessed the effects of these factors (1) to compare risks of extinction resulting from CC in river and ocean, and (2) to assess CC effects on life-history pathways including the evolution of underlying genetic control of phenotypic plasticity. We focused on Atlantic salmon populations from Southern Europe for a time horizon of three decades. We showed that CC in river alone should not lead to extinction of Southern European salmon populations. In contrast, the reduced oceanic growth appeared as a significant threat for population persistence. An increase in river flow amplitude increased the risk of local extinction in synergy with the oceanic effects, but river temperature rise reduced this risk. In terms of life-history modifications, the reduced oceanic growth increased the age of return of individuals through plastic and genetic responses. The river temperature rise increased the proportion of sexually mature parr, but the genetic evolution of the maturation threshold lowered the maturation rate of male parr. This was identified as a case of environmentally driven plastic response that masked an underlying evolutionary response of plasticity going in the opposite direction. We concluded that to counteract oceanic effects, river flow management represented the sole potential force to reduce the extinction probability of Atlantic salmon populations in Southern Europe, although this might not impede changes in migration life history.

AB  - Pinus is a diverse genus of trees widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Understanding pine life history is critical to both conservation and fire management.
   Here I lay out the different pathways of pine life history adaptation and a brief overview of pine evolution and the very significant role that fire has played.
   Pinus originated 150 Ma in the mid-Mesozoic Era and radiated across the northern continent of Laurasia during the Cretaceous Period. Pines have followed two evolutionary strategies interpreted as responses to competition by the newly emerging angiosperms. The Strobus lineage mostly has radiated into stressful sites of low nutrient soils and extremes in cold or heat. The Pinus (subgenus) lineage has radiated into fire-prone landscapes with diverse fire regimes. Examination of life history traits illustrates syndromes associated with fire-avoider, fire-tolerater, fire-embracer, and fire-refuge strategies.
   Understanding the current pattern of pine distribution requires interpreting their evolution in terms of climate, geology, and fire. All three of these factors have played a role since the Mesozoic origin of the genus. All are important to the appropriate management of these resources.

AB  - Diapause represents a major developmental switch in insects and is a seasonal adaptation that evolved as a specific subtype of dormancy in most insect species to ensure survival under unfavorable environmental conditions and synchronize populations. However, the hierarchical relationship of the molecular mechanisms involved in the perception of environmental signals to integration in morphological, physiological, behavioral, and reproductive responses remains unclear. In the bivoltine strain of the silkworm Bombyx mori, embryonic diapause is induced transgenerationally as a maternal effect. Progeny diapause is determined by the environmental temperature during embryonic development of the mother. Here, we show that the hierarchical pathway consists of a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and corazonin signaling system modulating progeny diapause induction via diapause hormone release, which may be finely tuned by the temperature-dependent expression of plasma membrane GABA transporter. Furthermore, this signaling pathway possesses similar features to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling system for seasonal reproductive plasticity in vertebrates.

AB  - Ultraviolet (UV) light is a major cause of stress, mutation, and mortality in microorganisms, causing numerous forms of cellular damage. Nevertheless, there is tremendous variation within and among bacterial species in their sensitivity to UV light. We investigated direct and correlated responses to selection during exposure to UV. Replicate lines of Escherichia coli K12 were propagated for 600 generations, half with UV and half as a control without UV. All lines responded to selection, and we found strong positive and negative correlated responses to selection associated with increased UV resistance. Compared to Control populations, UV-selected populations increased in desiccation and starvation resistance approximately twofold but were 10 times more sensitive to hypersalinity. There was little evidence for a persistent large competitive fitness cost to UV resistance. These results suggest that natural variation in UV resistance may be maintained by trade-offs for resistance to other abiotic sources of mortality. We observed an average twofold increase in cell size by the UV-selected populations, consistent with a structural mode of adaptation to UV exposure having preadaptive and maladaptive consequences to other abiotic stresses.

AB  - From a life history perspective, glucocorticoids secreted by the neuroendocrine system, integrating different sources of stress through an adaptive feedback mechanism, may have important consequences on individual fitness. Although stress responses have been the object of several investigations, few studies have explored the role of proximate mechanisms responsible for the potential trade-offs between physiological stress and life history traits integrating social and environmental stressors. In 2011 and 2012, we collected data on faecal cortisol metabolites (FCM) in a marked male population of Alpine chamois, within the Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy). Using a model selection approach we analysed the effect of potential etho-ecological stressors such as age, social status (territorial vs. non-territorial males), minimum temperature, snow depth and precipitation on FCM variation. To correctly interpret environmentally and socially induced stress responses, we conducted model selections over multiple temporal scales defined a priori: year, cold months, spring, warm months, mating season. Over the year, FCM levels showed a negative relationship with minimum temperature, but altogether, climatic stressors had negligible effects on glucocorticoid secretion, possibly owing to good adaptations of chamois to severe weather conditions. Age was negatively related to FCM during the rut, possibly due to greater experience of older males in agonistic contests. Social status was an important determinant of FCM excretion: while both the 'stress of subordination' and the 'stress of domination' hypotheses received some support in spring and during the mating season, respectively, previous data suggest that only the latter may have detrimental fitness consequences on male chamois.

AB  - A power MOSFET-based push-pull configuration nanosecond-pulse generator has been designed, constructed, and characterized to permeabilize cells for biological and medical applications. The generator can deliver pulses with durations ranging from 80 ns up to 1 mu s and pulse amplitudes up to 1.4 kV. The unit has been tested for in vitro experiments on a medulloblastoma cell line. Following the exposure of cells to 100, 200, and 300 ns electric field pulses, permeabilization tests were carried out, and viability tests were conducted to verify the performance of the generator. The maximum temperature rise of the biological load was also calculated based on Joule heating energy conservation and experimental validation. Our results indicate that the developed device has good capabilities to achieve well-controlled electro-manipulation in vitro.

AB  - Wolbachia can induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in the arrhenotokous two-spotted spider mite between uninfected females and infected males. Cytoplasmic incompatibility is expressed through a male-biased sex ratio and a low hatchability, and can be suppressed by removing Wolbachia from spider mites reared on a diet with antibiotics. Here we investigated whether heat-treatment can elimate Wolbachia from infected mites. Using a PCR assay with a Wolbachia-specific primer pair (ftsZ), and by standard crosses, we were able to show that 71 per cent of the mites had lost the Wolbachia infection after rearing the infected population at 32 +/- 0.5 degrees C for four generations. The infection could be completely removed when mites were reared at 32 +/- 0.5 degrees C for six generations. Curing through high temperatures could be one of the reasons why mixed infected/uninfected populations occur in the field. An additional consequence of rearing mites at 32 +/- 0.5 degrees C was the shortened development time. The effect of environmental temperature on the abundance of Wolbachia and possible behavioural consequences for the spider mite are discussed.

AB  - Growth of Bacillus subtilis cells, normally adapted at Earth-normal atmospheric pressure (similar to 101.3 kPa), was progressively inhibited by lowering of pressure in liquid LB medium until growth essentially ceased at 2.5 kPa. Growth inhibition was immediately reversible upon return to 101.3 kPa, albeit at a slower rate. A population of B. subtilis cells was cultivated at the near-inhibitory pressure of 5 kPa for 1,000 generations, where a stepwise increase in growth was observed, as measured by the turbidity of 24-h cultures. An isolate from the 1,000-generation population was obtained that showed an increase in fitness at 5 kPa when compared to the ancestral strain or a strain obtained from a parallel population that evolved for 1,000 generations at 101.3 kPa. The results from this preliminary study have implications for understanding the ability of terrestrial microbes to grow in low-pressure environments such as Mars.

AB  - This study documents the rearing of two pygmy angelfish species, Centropyge fisheri and Centropyge resplendens, and the early life history and reproduction of their hybrid offspring. A C. fisheri female, collected from Hawaii, and a C. resplendens male, captive-bred from parental stock collected from Ascension Island, were maintained at the hatchery facility for 7 months. Continuous spawning was achieved at a photoperiod cycle of 14L:10D and a water temperature of 26.5 degrees C, range +/- 1 degrees C. Over the 110 day period, the C. fisheri female spawned 102 times, 57% of which resulted in embryos (fertilized eggs). The mean +/- s.d. fecundity per spawn was 730 +/- 459 eggs (range 52-1967). Fertility (% eggs that developed into embryos) of all eggs that were preserved was 22.4 +/- 25.6%. A total of 235 hybrid juveniles were raised through metamorphosis with an average larval survival of 16.4%. Eight F-1 hybrid juveniles isolated for further study began to display signs of reproductive behaviour c. 300 days post-hatch (dph). Spawn resulting in non-fertile eggs were first obtained 319 dph, and fertilized eggs developing into embryos were obtained after 411 dph from at least two female individuals. While no attempt was made at rearing the F-2 larvae, embryo and larval development were normal up to 8 dph. Reproduction and development observed for all hybrid generations in this study were normal, similar to other Centropyge species and indicates a very close phylogenetic relationship between what are currently considered distinct species, e.g. C. fisheri and C. resplendens.

AB  - Pachycrepoideus vindemiae (Rondani) and Trichopria drosophilae (Perkins) are among a few indigenous parasitoids attacking the invasive Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae) in North America. Both parasitoid species occur in California, whereas only P. vindemiae has been reported from Oregon. We compared the thermal performance of the California populations of P. vindemiae and T. drosophilae, and the Oregon population of P. vindemiae at eight constant temperatures (12.6-32.8 degrees C). Both P. vindemiae populations could develop at all tested temperatures. T. drosophilae failed to develop at or above 29.6 degrees C. This species was, however, able to develop at a diurnal temperature regime of 15-32 degrees C, and survival was higher in older developmental stages. T. drosophilae was less tolerant to both low and high temperatures than P. vindemiae, whereas the Oregon P. vindemiae population was more cold-tolerant but less heat-tolerant than the California population in terms of offspring survival, development, and reproduction. To develop storage strategies for mass-cultured parasitoids, we compared the cold tolerance of immature P. vindemiae and T. drosophilae of the California populations at 12 degrees C for 1, 2, or 3 mo, followed by a 23 degrees C holding period. Successful development to the adult stage decreased as cold storage duration increased. Successful development, however, increased when cold storage was initiated during the older developmental stages for 1-mo exposure for both parasitoid species. The results are discussed with regards to parasitoid thermal adaptation and the potential use of P. vindemiae and T. drosophilae for biological control of spotted-wing drosophila.

AB  - A diverse mayfly community (28 species) was found in the Ogeechee River, a blackwater river in the Georgia Coastal Plain.  Quantitative samples of snag habitat, where most species (22) were found, were collected at 2-4 wk intervals in 1982 to investigate life history characteristics, and at monthly intervals in 1983 to determine consistency of seasonal and annual abundance patterns.  Baetidae and Heptageniidae were abundant throughout each year with average densities of 1553-5981/m2 (1982-1983) and 1498-1828/m2 of snag surface, respectively.  Field data for the most common species of Baetidae (Baetis ephippiatus, B. intercalaris) and Heptageniidae (Stenonema exiguum, S. integrum, S. modestum) showed no recognizable pattern of cohort development.  This developmental asynchrony and long emergence periods for S. exiguum and S. modestum are consistent with previously published growth studies indicating multivoltinism.  Ephemerellidae (551-719/m2), Oligoneuriidae (206-469/m2), Tricorythidae (721-1599/m2) and Caenidae (114-110/m2) were also commonly found on snags, but were seasonal in abundance.  The major species of Ephemerellidae (Ephemerella argo, E. dorothea, Eurylophella sp.) showed distinct single cohorts developing primarily during winter/spring.  Isonychia spp. (Oligoneuriidae) also showed a well-defined winter cohort, but had as many as two weakly defined cohorts during warm months.  Caenis spp. (Caenidae) and Tricorythodes sp. (Tricorythidae) occurred primarily in summer months, during which time they were able to pass through multiple generations, as substantiated by either long emergence periods or independent growth studies.  Major differences in life histories occurred between rather than within families.  Relative abundance and seasonality at the family level were very consistent between years.  The high degree of life history overlap in this diverse mayfly assemblage raises questions about the relationship between phenology and community structure, as well as latitudinal patterns of species richness.

AB  - Secondary productivity was estimated for one sexual species of the brine shrimp Artemia (Artemia tunisiana) and for two inland and two coastal parthenogenetic diploid and polyploid strains (Artemia parthenogenectica), reared in semi-intensive cultures under different natural temperature conditions,
   Standing biomass and productivity were affected by temperature conditions, mode of reproduction, ploidy level and habitat temperature characteristics. At high temperatures (24-30 degrees C), diploid and polyploid parthenogenetic Artemia strains attained the highest biomass values and productivity of the coastal parthenogenetic diploid strain was 13 times higher than that of polyploids, Differences between the inland and coastal parthenogenetic diploid strains studied may be due to genetic adaptation to habitat temperature conditions,
   At low temperatures (under 15 degrees C) only the sexual species survived, and its production values were ten times lower than those of polyploid strains during spring and summer,
   Productivity was directly related to standing biomass and inversely related to individual biomass, On the basis of these results, an empirical model to predict Artemia productivity from biomass and individual dry weight data is proposed.
   This study provides useful information for the selection of the most suitable non Artemia franciscana strains to introduce in salterns from the Old World with a given temperature regime and it also supplies practical guidelines for the easy determination of Artemia productivity.

AB  - BackgroundMalaria is still a global health problem and vector control is the cornerstone of disease control strategies using indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated nets. The situation is becoming acute with widespread resistance to the limited arsenal of available insecticide classes. Therefore, new and innovative tools to reduce Plasmodium transmission are in need and this situation raised considerable interest in using sterile insect technique (SIT) against human pest insects, particularly Anopheles malaria vectors. When considering a mosquito release programme, one of the first issues to be addressed is how to eliminate/separate the hematophagous vector females. In this paper, we report the development and evaluation of an Anopheles arabiensis temperature-sensitive lethal (tsl) strain towards its potential use for the development of a genetic sexing strain (GSS).Anopheles arabiensis male mosquitoes originated from North Cameroon were treated with 0.05% ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). The mutagen was added to 10% sucrose solution and mosquitoes fed ad-libitum for 24h and 48h on a cotton wool soaked with sucrose-mutagen solution placed at the top of the cup. Treated males were then allowed to mate with wild virgin females and their progenies were screened for heat sensitivity from F3 to F8, until the isolation and establishment of a tsl strain which was further characterized by assessing its productivity (fecundity and fertility), larval development, adult longevity as well as nature and inheritance pattern of the tsl.ResultsObservations showed that the number of eggs laid and their hatch rate were similar between females that mated with mutagenized males and those from the control suggesting that mutagenesis didn't affect An. arabiensis male fecundity and fertility. At F3, fourteen isofemale families out of 88 tested, which showed mortalities ranged between 50 and 80 %, were selected as lines potentially containing a tsl mutation. From F4 to F8, a tsl strain was isolated and established by screening L1 larvae at 41 degrees C for 3 hours. This strain showed similar life history traits compared to the wild type strain in terms of fertility, larval development time and adult's emergence. Crossing experiments to further assess the nature and inheritance pattern of the tsl phenotype showed that it is due to a recessive allele located on an autosome.ConclusionThe successful establishment of the An. arabiensis tsl strain is a valuable tool towards the development of a GSS for SIT applications against this species. This will be done by induction of a Y-autosome translocation to link the wild-type allele to the Y chromosome in such manner that males are wild-type (temperature resistant) and females are mutant (temperature sensitive).

AB  - The main results of a thermodynamic study on the use of a low temperature heat source (150 degrees C as maximum) for power generation through a basic Rankine are reported in this paper. Different working fluids such as water and some hydrocarbons and coolants are studied. The procedure consisted in modifying the input pressure and temperature to the turbine. The efficiency for these fluids is a weak function of temperature, i.e., overheating the inlet fluid to the turbine does not cause a significant change in the efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio in the turbine increases, much larger values of efficiency are obtained, and also, as the input temperature to the turbine rises, the efficiency increases more sharply. As result, a maximum efficiency of 9% was obtained. It is shown the technical viability of implementing this type of process for recovering residual wastes for very low temperature, as well as an energy alternative and/or strengthener of non-conventional energy sources in non-provided zones.

AB  - Global warming will lead to earlier beginnings and prolongation of growing seasons in temperate regions and will have pronounced effects on phenology and life-history adaptation in many species. These changes were not easy to simulate for actual phenologies because of the rudimentary temporal (season) and spatial (regional) resolution of climate model projections. We investigate the effect of climate change on the regional incidence of a pest insect with nearly worldwide distribution and very high potential for adaptation to season length and temperature - the Codling Moth, Cydia pomonella. Seasonal and regional climate change signals were downscaled to the hourly temporal scale of a pest phenology model and the spatial scale of pest habitats using a stochastic weather generator operating at daily scale in combination with a re-sampling approach for simulation of hourly weather data. Under future conditions of increased temperatures (2045-2074), the present risk of below 20% for a pronounced second generation (peak larval emergence) in Switzerland will increase to 70-100%. The risk of an additional third generation will increase from presently 0-2% to 100%. We identified a significant two-week shift to earlier dates in phenological stages, such as overwintering adult flight. The relative extent (magnitude) of first generation pupae and all later stages will significantly increase. The presence of first generation pupae and later stages will be prolonged. A significant decrease in the length of overlap of first and second generation larval emergence was identified. Such shifts in phenology may induce changes in life-history traits regulating the life cycle. An accordingly life-history adaptation in photoperiodic diapause induction to shorter day-length is expected and would thereby even more increase the risk of an additional generation. With respect to Codling Moth management, the shifts in phenology and voltinism projected here will require adaptations of plant protection strategies to maintain their sustainability.

AB  - Biological invasions provide opportunities to study evolutionary processes occurring over contemporary timescales. To explore the speed and repeatability of adaptation, we examined the divergence of life-history traits to climate, using latitude as a proxy, in the native North American and introduced European and Australian ranges of the annual plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia. We explored niche changes following introductions using climate niche dynamic models. In a common garden, we examined trait divergence by growing seeds collected across three ranges with highly distinct demographic histories. Heterozygosity-fitness associations were used to explore the effect of invasion history on potential success. We accounted for nonadaptive population differentiation using 11 598 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We revealed a centroid shift to warmer, wetter climates in the introduced ranges. We identified repeated latitudinal divergence in life-history traits, with European and Australian populations positioned at either end of the native clines. Our data indicate rapid and repeated adaptation to local climates despite the recent introductions and a bottleneck limiting genetic variation in Australia. Centroid shifts in the introduced ranges suggest adaptation to more productive environments, potentially contributing to trait divergence between the ranges.

AB  - Geographic variation in life history traits and population dynamics of Atlantic croakers Micropogonias undulatus found north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, suggests the possibility of two stocks along the U.S. Atlantic coast. The basis for this variation (i.e., genetic versus ecophenotypic) is unclear. Young-of-the-year Atlantic croakers were collected from three Atlantic coast estuaries (Delaware Bay, Delaware; Cape Fear River, North Carolina; and Indian River Lagoon, Florida) that represent the center and extreme distributional limits of the species' U.S. Atlantic coast range. Intrinsic growth capacity and cold tolerance were measured under common laboratory conditions to test for adaptive genetic variation in these traits. Results were used to evaluate the two stock hypothesis for the Atlantic croaker and to examine the integrity of Cape Hatteras as a possible genetic stock boundary. Growth capacity, feeding rate, growth efficiency, and cold tolerance were similar across geographic locations. Survival curves for Delaware and Florida Atlantic croakers were indistinguishable at each of four low temperatures tested (1, 3, 5, and 7 degreesC), with neither group capable of surviving temperatures of 3 degreesC or less. The suggested lack of adaptive variation we found in these physiological traits supports the hypothesis of a single genetic stock of Atlantic croakers along the Atlantic coast. Although severe winter temperatures may select for fast growth and cold-tolerant genotypes in northern estuaries, gene flow is apparently sufficient to preclude local genetic adaptation.

AB  - Spatial and/or taxonomic bias in thermal tolerance and plasticity data can severely impact projections of climate change responses and limit the understanding of the evolution of thermal performance curves. Thus, further data from under-represented groups and geographical locations are important for synthesizing and predicting the physiological responses of insects to climate variability. For example, the magnitude of rapid cold-hardening (RCH) and seasonal acclimatization of low temperature tolerance are typically poorly documented for nondipteran species from the southern Hemisphere. Moreover, few studies assess RCH responses under different acclimation regimes. To address this paucity of data, the low temperature survival, RCH and acclimation ability of Chauliognathus lugubris (F.) are assessed from an adult aggregation collected in Armidale, New South Wales, Australia. Beetles are acclimated to either 27 or 20 degrees C for 1 week and then tested for their ability to survive cold shock or rapidly cold-harden. There is no effect of acclimation on low temperature survival (mean survival range at -5.4 degrees C for 2 h: 4-52% in 27 and 20 degrees C acclimation groups). In addition, beetles show no significant improvement in survival after acute thermal pretreatments. In conclusion, these data suggest a generally poor acclimation potential of low temperature survival and no RCH responses in adult Australian cantharid beetles, which is accordance with what might be expected given the microclimate experienced, their ability for behavioural regulation and the life history of the species.

AB  - In ectotherms, variation in life history traits among populations is common and suggests local adaptation. However, geographic variation itself is not a proof for local adaptation, as genetic drift and gene flow may also shape patterns of quantitative variation. We studied local and regional variation in means and phenotypic plasticity of larval life history traits in the common frog Rana temporaria using six populations from central Sweden, breeding in either open-canopy or partially closed-canopy ponds. To separate local adaptation from genetic drift, we compared differentiation in quantitative genetic traits (Q(ST)) obtained from a common garden experiment with differentiation in presumably neutral microsatellite markers (F-ST). We found that R. temporaria populations differ in means and plasticities of life history traits in different temperatures at local, and in F-ST at regional scale. Comparisons of differentiation in quantitative traits and in molecular markers suggested that natural selection was responsible for the divergence in growth and development rates as well as in temperature-induced plasticity, indicating local adaptation. However, at low temperature, the role of genetic drift could not be separated from selection. Phenotypes were correlated with forest canopy closure, but not with geographical or genetic distance. These results indicate that local adaptation can evolve in the presence of ongoing gene flow among the populations, and that natural selection is strong in this system.

AB  - The alfalfa weevil, Hypera postica (Gyllenhal), is a univoltine species whose primary period of oviposition is during fall and winter in Oklahoma, with hatching typically occuring in late winter and spring. The objectives of this study were to estimate the total number of eggs laid per generation by the alfalfa weevil, the mortality of eggs through the winter, and reductions in numbers of newly hatched larvae resulting from lethal low temperatures. The study was conducted in alfalfa fields located at Stillwater (northern) and Chickasha (southern), OK, from 1980 to 1990. Population densities of eggs and larvae of the weevil were determined at regular intervals from October to May for each generation. Subsamples of eggs were reared for viability estimates. A summation procedure was used to calculate total eggs laid per generation. Mean total egg production per generation exceeded 900 per 0.1 m2 at each location. Mortality of eggs averaged about 30% resulting from low temperatures (< -15-degrees-C). In most years, hatching began before the last occurrence of temperatures below -6-degrees-C. These temperatures killed most alfalfa top growth and most larvae that were present. Combined mortality of eggs and larvae hatching during winter resulted in an average reduction of 38% in the reproductive potential for the weevil.

AB  - Among the factors limiting species distribution, low temperatures play a key role for tropical invasive species in temperate areas. Susceptibility to cold winter conditions has been recognized as the limiting factor in Europe for Tetranychus evansi, an invasive spider mite feeding on Solanaceous plants originated from tropical South America and now present on every continent except Australia. Two genetically distinct lineages of this species were introduced to Europe; one (lineage 1) is widely distributed, while the other (lineage 2) has a limited distribution. Whether this difference corresponds to differences in cold hardiness is evaluated here by assessing phenotypic response of T. evansi to the winter conditions that the mite encounters in the coldest parts of the current invaded area. We designed the thermal regimes to mimic winter conditions, including temperature fluctuations between day and night (L:D 8:16, 12:4 degrees C) and exposed mites to this regime for 5, 10 or 15 weeks. We tested T. evansi from three locations, one from the tropical native area (Piracicaba, Brazil) and two, corresponding to the two introduced lineages, from the temperate invaded area (lineage 1 from Nice and lineage 2 from Perpignan, France). After 5 weeks of treatment, mites from all the locations showed high survival rates but the two introduced populations grew, producing more than one offspring per female. After 10 weeks, survival rates declined for mites from Brazil and Perpignan, but not Nice. After 15 weeks, only the mites from Nice survived and produced offspring. Thus, mites belonging to the widespread lineage 1 exhibit increased cold tolerance suggesting broader adaptability, helping to explain its current geographical distribution.

AB  - 1. Freshwater ecosystems are especially vulnerable to climate change and pollution. One key challenge for aquatic toxicology is to determine and manage the combined effects of temperature increase and contaminants across species' ranges.
   2. We tested how thermal adaptation and life-history evolution along a natural temperature gradient influence the vulnerability of an aquatic insect to a pesticide under global warming. We applied a space-for-time substitution approach to study the effect of warming on the vulnerability of Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae to the pesticide chlorpyrifos in a common garden warming experiment (20 and 24 degrees C) with replicated populations from three latitudes spanning >1500 km in Europe.
   3. Chlorpyrifos was more toxic to damselfly larvae at the higher temperature: mortality only occurred at 24 degrees C and the reductions in growth rate were stronger at 24 degrees C. This could partly be explained by parallel reductions in food intake but not by the activities of two widespread enzymatic biomarkers, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE).
   4. There was some evidence that the increased toxicity of the high chlorpyrifos concentration at 24 degrees C was stronger in terms of growth reduction in the faster-growing larvae from the low-latitude populations. This is consistent with energy allocation trade-offs between growth rate and pesticide tolerance, but suggests that local thermal adaptation does not play a role in coping with pesticide stress.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Damselfly larvae from populations in lower latitudes were more vulnerable to a common pesticide at higher temperatures and pesticide concentrations, whereas evidence for the influence of local thermal adaptation on the vulnerability of larvae was weak. These results emphasize the need for spatially explicit bioassessment and conservation tools. Management practices aimed at mitigating pesticide run-off into aquatic ecosystems are particularly important in agricultural areas at low latitudes.

However, organisms can develop compensatory strategies in order to reduce the costs of phenological alterations. Here, we examine the extent and limits of compensatory developmental responses in amphibian larvae exposed to variation in hatching timing. Using a common-garden experiment, we analyze how changes in temperature and food conditions alter compensatory responses to hatching delay, paying particular attention at how adverse environmental conditions can constrain these responses. We found that under benign conditions (warm temperature, unrestricted food) larvae fully compensate for the hatching delay, without cost in mass. However, under detrimental conditions (cold temperature and restricted food) these responses were prevented, and the combination of adverse conditions with long hatching delay completely disrupt compensatory responses. This study highlights the need of examining ecological responses to climate variation across a broad spectrum of environmental conditions in order to accurately predict the putative effect that climatic alterations can have on the life-histories and survival of wildlife.

AB  - In the house fly, Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae), sex is usually determined by a dominant factor, M, located on the Y chromosome. However, there are autosomal male (A(M)) populations in which the M factor is located on one or more of the five autosomes (I-V), most commonly on the third chromosome. Herein we report the use of isogenic strains to determine the relative fitness of Y-M versus IIIM males in three different experiments. First, cages were started with 50% Y-M and 50% IIIM males, and the frequencies of Y-M and IIIM males were evaluated across generations. Second, mating competition studies were preformed with these isogenic strains. Third, the relative emergence rates of IIIM versus Y-M male pupae held at three temperatures for 3 d were examined. All three studies indicate that IIIM males have a greater fitness than Y-M males. in the cage competition studies, >90% of the males were IIIM after seven generations. IIIM males were more likely to mate than Y-M males, and a higher percent of IIIM males emerged after being held as pupae at 4, 16, or 28 degrees C for 3 d. The implications of these studies to the distribution of IIIM and Y-M males in field populations are discussed.

AB  - Adverse environmental conditions constrain active flight and thereby limit reproduction in most insects. Butterflies have evolved various adaptations in order to thermoregulate, allowing females to search for nectar and to oviposit under unfavorable thermal conditions. We studied experimentally and with observational data the effect of low ambient temperatures experienced in the morning on the timing of oviposition and clutch size in the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). Comparisons were made between individuals with different forms of the gene Pgi, encoding the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase, since naturally segregating variation at Pgi is known to be correlated with flight metabolic rate, flight performance, and fecundity. Experiencing low temperature in the morning delayed the initiation of oviposition and decreased clutch size. We used a thermal image camera to measure the thoracic surface temperature of butterflies immediately after voluntary flight. Single nucleotide polymorphism at Pgi was associated with thoracic temperature at low ambient temperatures. This has consequences for reproduction because females that are able to fly at lower ambient temperatures generally initiate oviposition earlier in the afternoon, when the environmental conditions are most favorable and the average egg clutch size is generally largest. These results suggest that variation in physiological and molecular capacity to sustain active flight at low ambient temperature has significant fitness-related consequences in insects.

AB  - Abnormal pore pressures in excess of the hydrostatic equilibrium are observed in natural and artificial sediment systems worldwide. Such overpressure exerts a fundamental control over the diagenesis, stability, and productivity of both sedimentary reservoirs. The basin dynamics for overpressure generation involve complex THMC processes during sediment accumulation. In this paper, we develop a generic framework for thermochemical consolidation in natural and artificial sedimentary sequences by extending Biot's classical poroelasticity. The proposed theoretical model is then conveniently recast into an explicit form for one-dimensional sedimentation. The resulting formulation essentially extends the original Gibson's theory by incorporating coupled THMC effects in general sedimentary sequences, and a hierarchical scrutiny of different overpressuring mechanisms thus becomes straightforward. Moreover, a closed-form equation is derived from the new chemothermo-poroelasticity model for accreting sediments, and the critical temperature for pore pressure changes via hydration/dehydration is thus determined. The model demonstrates that overpressuring and depressuring are not mutually exclusive because of the competition between water volume changes and thermal strains induced by chemical reactions. By using evolutive properties of a reactive artificial sediment, our model calculations have highlighted the critical influences of the sediment and environment temperatures and deposition rate on the contribution of each overpressuring mechanism.

AB  - Copepods form the natural prey item for the vast majority of marine fish larvae in the wild. The tropical estuarine calanoid copepod Acartia tropica is a potential live feed for finfish larviculture because of their higher fecundity and wide salinity tolerance. The present study was aimed at identifying the optimal salinity for obtaining maximum production of A. tropica nauplii. Population growth, intrinsic rate of population increase, egg production (eggs female(-1) day(-1)), egg hatching success (EHS) and nauplii survival (%) of A. tropica were assessed at different salinity levels. Similarly, the effect of long term acclimatization on population growth of A. tropica was also studied. The experimental salinity range was set to be 5-30 ppt based on the abrupt salinity change experiment. Highest mean population count (1265 +/- 209) and intrinsic rate of population increase (0.493 +/- 0.01) were recorded at 15 ppt which was significantly higher (p<0.05) than other salinity treatments except for 20 ppt (1005 +/- 129, 0.481 +/- 0.01). The lowest mean population count and intrinsic rate of population increase were recorded at 30 ppt (80.75 +/- 17.86, 0.32 +/- 0.003). The highest mean daily egg production was recorded at 15 ppt (33.42 +/- 5.88) which was significantly different (p<0.05) from all other treatments. Nauplii survival at 15 ppt (79.73 +/- 4.86) was significantly higher (p<0.05) except for 20 ppt (73.81 +/- 5.62). However different salinity conditions did not affect EHS and sex ratio of adults in the present study. Multigenerational acclimatization significantly improved the population growth and mean daily egg production of A. tropica at 30 ppt (558.30 +/- 35, 25.80 +/- 4.00). Hence the present study suggests that the salinity range of 15-20 ppt supports the maximum productivity of A. tropica and it can be well adapted to higher salinity conditions through multigenerational acclimatization.

AB  - Analysis regarding entropy generation has turn out to be a useful approach to address refinements in thermal characteristics since it yields an intuition which cannot be acquired through energy analysis. The rate of entropy generation appropriately computes thermodynamic irreversibilities. Thus a decay of entropy productivity results in more effective energy transport mechanisms. Keeping aforementioned effectiveness in mind we aimed to elaborate entropy generation characteristics in unsteady nonlinear convective nanoliquid flow towards convectively heated permeable surface. Magneto nanomaterial model featuring thermophoretic and Brownian diffusion characteristics is considered. Thermodynamic second relation is utilized for entropy generation analysis. Modeling is arranged for viscous dissipation, heat generation, nonlinear radiation and Joule dissipation. Boundary-layer concept is opted for formulation. Influence of distinct variables velocity, temperature and concentration are discussed In addition rate of total entropy generation is highlighted. Besides, the gradients (velocity, thermal and solutal) are calculated and analyzed. We noted increasing trend for Brinkman number, magnetic and permeability parameters versus entropy generation rate. Further the Bejan number has opposite outcomes versus Brinkman number and radiation parameter. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Temperature, an important factor in the ecological niche, determines the individual fitness, distribution and abundance of many spider species. Typically, spiders from different habitats have different thermal preferences, which vary depending on the season, time of day, and reproductive status. Selected temperatures may also depend on thermal acclimation of animals. The study aimed at determining preferred temperatures of females of two spider species, synanthropic Eratigena atrica and garden Araneus diadematus, exposed to low (14 degrees C) and high (23 degrees C) acclimation temperatures. The mean preferred temperature observed in a thermal gradient varied between the species: E. atrica selected 13.7 +/- 1.0 degrees C, while A. diadematus selected 22.5 +/- 1.5 degrees C, irrespective of the acclimation temperature. Accordingly, thermal niche overlaps between the species were significantly lower than predicted by the random distribution. E. atrica changed their thermal environment on average 12.8 +/- 1.9 times during the test, which made them more mobile than A. diadematus, changing their thermal environment 2.7 +/- 0.5 times. On the other hand, the thermal niche breadth of A. diadematus acclimated to warm temperature was wider than that of E. atrica. The female behaviour may be related to the selection of optimal conditions with regard to food availability (location for web construction), shelter and/or, in the case of E. atrica, embryonic development.

AB  - Background The rice leaf folderCnaphalocrocis medinalisGuenee is a serious insect pest of rice in Asia. This pest occurs in summer, and it is sensitive to high temperature. However, the larvae exhibit heat acclimation/adaptation. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we established a heat-acclimated strain via multigenerational selection at 39 degrees C. After heat shock at 41 degrees C for 1 h, the transcriptomes of the heat-acclimated (S-39) and unacclimated (S-27) larvae were sequenced, using the unacclimated larvae without exposure to 41 degrees C as the control. Results Five generations of selection at 39 degrees C led larvae to acclimate to this heat stress. Exposure to 41 degrees C induced 1160 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the heat-acclimated and unacclimated larvae. Both the heat-acclimated and unacclimated larvae responded to heat stress via upregulating genes related to sensory organ development and structural constituent of eye lens, whereas the unacclimated larvae also upregulated genes related to structural constituent of cuticle. Compared to unacclimated larvae, heat-acclimated larvae downregulated oxidoreductase activity-related genes when encountering heat shock. Both the acclimated and unacclimated larvae adjusted the longevity regulating, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, antigen processing and presentation, MAPK and estrogen signaling pathway to responsed to heat stress. Additionally, the unacclimated larvae also adjusted the spliceosome pathway, whereas the heat-acclimated larvae adjusted the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids pathway when encountering heat stress. Although the heat-acclimated and unacclimated larvae upregulated expression of heat shock protein genes under heat stress includingHSP70,HSP27andCRYAB, their biosynthesis, metabolism and detoxification-related genes expressed differentially. Conclusions The rice leaf folder larvae could acclimate to a high temperature via multigenerational heat selection. The heat-acclimated larvae induced more DEGs to response to heat shock than the unacclimated larvae. The changes in transcript level of genes were related to heat acclimation of larvae, especially these genes in sensory organ development, structural constituent of eye lens, and oxidoreductase activity. The DEGs between heat-acclimated and unacclimated larvae after heat shock were enriched in the biosynthesis and metabolism pathways. These results are helpful to understand the molecular mechanism underlying heat acclimation of insects.

AB  - Life histories for the trichopteran species Agapetus illini, Chimarra aterrima, C. obscura, Helicopsyche limnella, Polycentropus centralis, and Wormaldia moesta were estimated by determining the seasonal occurrence and relative abundance of larval instars and pupae, and from adult collections. Head capsule width measurements revealed that all of the species had five larval instars. Agapetus illini and W. moesta were univoltine, but bivoltine life histories with overlapping generations were observed for C aterrima, C obscura, H. limnella, and P. centralis. Adults of bivoltine species were prevalent from early spring through late autumn, and larval recruitment from reproduction occurred throughout adult flight periods. Adults of univoltine species (A. illini and W. moesta) were collected only during May. Bivoltinism appears to be a common life-history pattern in warmwater streams of southern latitudes in North America.

AB  - The persistence of reef building corals is threatened by human-induced environmental change. Maintaining coral reefs into the future requires not only the survival of adults, but also the influx of recruits to promote genetic diversity and retain cover following adult mortality. Few studies examine the linkages among multiple life stages of corals, despite a growing knowledge of carryover effects in other systems. We provide a novel test of coral parental conditioning to ocean acidification (OA) and tracking of offspring for 6 months post-release to better understand parental or developmental priming impacts on the processes of offspring recruitment and growth. Coral planulation was tracked for 3 months following adult exposure to high pCO(2) and offspring from the second month were reciprocally exposed to ambient and high pCO(2) for an additional 6 months. Offspring of parents exposed to high pCO(2) had greater settlement and survivorship immediately following release, retained survivorship benefits during 1 and 6 months of continued exposure, and further displayed growth benefits to at least 1 month post release. Enhanced performance of offspring from parents exposed to high conditions was maintained despite the survivorship in both treatments declining in continued exposure to OA. Conditioning of the adults while they brood their larvae, or developmental acclimation of the larvae inside the adult polyps, may provide a form of hormetic conditioning, or environmental priming that elicits stimulatory effects. Defining mechanisms of positive acclimatization, with potential implications for carry over effects, cross-generational plasticity, and multi-generational plasticity, is critical to better understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics of corals under regimes of increasing environmental disturbance. Considering environmentally-induced parental or developmental legacies in ecological and evolutionary projections may better account for coral reef response to the chronic stress regimes characteristic of climate change.

AB  - Temperature increment is one of the most visible aspects of climate change. Reservoirs in northern Patagonia are the main location for rainbow trout cage aquaculture activities in Argentina and here, surface water temperature shows an increment that despite leading towards better growth rates, also provokes lack of ovulation, atresia and a partial or total absence of spawning during the breeding season. During the early life history, low survival rates at hatching and first feeding are also observed. The increase in market size (> 2 kg) has changed management practices, minimizing the difference between brood stock and individuals destined for consumption. Thus, the present situation differs deeply from carrying capacities forecasted few years ago and this analysis attempts to contribute to management policies including the idea of adaptation to climate change in the making of decisions.

AB  - Laboratory studies on Drosophila have revealed that resistance to one environmental stress often correlates with resistance to other stresses. There is also evidence on genetic correlations between stress resistance, longevity and other fitness-related traits. The present work investigates these associations using artificial selection in Drosophila melanogaster. Adult flies were selected for increased survival after severe cold, heat, desiccation and starvation stresses as well as increased heat-knockdown time and lifespan (CS, HS, DS, SS, KS and LS line sets, respectively). The number of selection generations was 11 for LS, 27 for SS and 21 for other lines, with selection intensity being around 0.80. For each set of lines, the five stress-resistance parameters mentioned above as well as longevity (in a nonstressful environment) were estimated. In addition, preadult developmental time, early age productivity and thorax length were examined in all lines reared under nonstressful conditions. Comparing the selection lines with unselected control revealed clear-cut direct selection responses for the stress-resistance traits. Starvation resistance increased as correlated response in all sets of selection lines, with the exception of HS. Positive correlated responses were also found for survival after cold shock (HS and DS) and heat shock (KS and DS). With regard to values of resistance across different stress assays, the HS and KS lines were most similar. The resistance values of the SS lines were close to those of the LS lines and tended to be the lowest among all selection lines. Developmental time was extended in the SS and KS lines, whereas the LS lines showed a reduction in thorax length. The results indicate a possibility of different multiple-stress-resistance mechanisms for the examined traits and fitness costs associated with stress resistance and longevity.

AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae, Steinernematidae) are lethal insect parasites that have a symbiotic association with bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae. We evaluated the changes in thermal sensitivity of two nematodes Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema anomali. The nematodes were genetically selected, together with their respective symbiotic bacteria, at nematodes' reproductive thermal niche breadth extremes, 15 degrees and 30 degrees C, by repeated passage through larvae of the wax moth Galleria mellonella. Nematode virulence (rate of insect mortality), establishment, and reproduction were evaluated after 12 passages (equal to 24-36 generations). Direct and correlated responses of the selected strains were compared with the ancestral strains, maintained at 25 degrees C, at the selection and novel temperatures. The thermal limits for virulence and establishment were extended in both species and at both selection regimes. The thermal reproductive niche breadth of H. bacteriophora was extended from 15 degrees-30 degrees C to 12 degrees-32 degrees C after selection at either 15 degrees or 30 degrees C, but that of S. anomali remained unchanged. Virulence of S. anomali was enhanced across the entire thermal niche breadth, but H. bacteriophora improved in one portion of the thermal niche and declined in another portion. Enhanced virulence of S. anomali was most likely due to the improvements in growth rate of the symbiotic bacteria, Xenorhabdus sp. Establishment of both species and reproduction of H. bacteriophora improved at most temperatures. S. anomali reproduction showed no direct response to temperature selection, but decrements and/or improvements were evident at novel temperatures. Our results demonstrate that the temperature-specific virulence and thermal niche breadth of entomopathogenic nematodes are malleable. Adaptation to either cold or warm temperature enhanced fitness in both cold and warm environments. S. anomali adapted to novel temperature by enhancing virulence, whereas H. bacteriophora improved fecundity. Trade-offs in fitness were rarely observed. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Under elevated environmental carbon dioxide (CO2), leaf chewers tend to compensate for decreased leaf nutritional quality with increased consumption; mortality and development times also increase and cause a reduction in the fitness of leaf chewers. However, the effect of elevated CO2 on multiple successive generations of these and other insects is not well understood. Furthermore, information about the direct effects of increased environmental CO2 on developmental time and consumption of herbivores is lacking. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that cascade effects of elevated CO2 through plants, rather than the direct effects of elevated CO2, are the main factors decreasing the fitness of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). We used two series of experiments to quantify the growth, development, and consumption of H. armigera fed on an artificial diet or C-4 plants (maize) grown under two CO2 levels (ambient vs. double ambient). In the first series of experiments, elevated CO2 had no effect on the population abundance or individual consumption for three successive generations of cotton bollworms fed on an artificial diet. In the second series of experiments, elevated CO2 reduced population abundance of cotton bollworm larvae for two successive generations when they were fed maize milky grains. The specific effects were longer larval duration, lower fecundity, and decreased r(m) of cotton bollworms. Furthermore, elevated CO2 increased individual consumption when cotton bollworm was fed maize milky grains for two successive generations and decreased the population's total consumption in the first generation but increased it in the second generation. The results from this study indicate that: (1) The effects of elevated CO2 on three successive generations of cotton bollworm fed on artificial diet were weak, or even non-existent, and (2) elevated CO2 increased the consumption when cotton bollworm were fed maize. Our study also suggests that the damage inflicted by cotton bollworm on maize (a C-4 plant) will be seriously affected by the increases in atmospheric CO2, which is unlike our previous results for spring wheat (a C-3 plant).

AB  - Marine teleost fish species in colder environments generally produce larger eggs than those in warmer environments. This pattern is thought to reflect changes in the optimal strategy of allocation to offspring size and number across temperatures, yet quantitative assessments of this hypothesis are lacking. Here, we model optimal offspring size across temperatures in marine teleost fishes based on the trade-off between offspring survivorship and number. In doing so, we derive quantitative predictions for the relationship of optimal egg size to temperature based on the size and temperature dependences of the growth and mortality, and hence survivorship, of eggs and larvae. Our model shows that smaller eggs are favoured at warmer temperatures largely because egg survivorship declines with both egg size and temperature. The predictions of our model (egg mass in grams = 0.013*e(-0.11*T oC)) were comparable to the observed interspecific relationship (0.0029*e(-0.09*T oC);N = 221 spp.). Thus, our results provide insights into how temperature shapes the evolution of egg size in marine teleost fishes.

AB  - Environmental sex determination implies that sex is defined by environmental factors influencing the maternal organism and/or oocytes. It provides population sex ratios that will maximise the sustainability of the population under incipient environmental conditions. Environmental factors responsible for sex determination include temperature, photoperiod, food availability, and population density. These cues stimulate the release of chemical signalling molecules (i.e. hormones) that determine the sex of newborns.
   We have analysed the responses of three Daphnia pulex clones (I, K, and S), isolated from different natural populations, to juvenile hormone methyl farnesoate (MF) in terms of survivorship, fecundity, production of males and ephippia, and expression of genes involved in sex determination (dsx1) and hormonal regulation (JHAMT, Met, RXR). Clonal individuals were exposed to: (1) high MF concentration (0.8 mu M) combined with stressful conditions; (2) low MF concentration (0.15 mu M) combined with optimal conditions of population density and food availability in two subsequent generations.
   The genetically different clones of D. pulex differed in the propensity for male and ephippia production and in the sensitivity to the stimuli that lead to the switch from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction.
   A significant induction of male production was observed in all three clones when exposed to MF. In conditions mimicking crowding, only clone S produced male offspring even in absence of MF and showed higher expression levels of JHAMT and dsx1 genes. This response suggests that clone S has a high propensity to produce males probably due to a high sensitivity of receptors to environmental stimuli activating the endogenous biosynthesis of MF. However, clone S exposed to high MF concentration produced fewer males than clones I and K, which generally have a low natural propensity to produce males. High MF concentration coupled with conditions mimicking crowding, probably activated a feedback mechanism in clone S via the differential modulation of genes involved in the synthesis as well in the degradation of MF.
   Exposure to low MF concentration for two subsequent generations resulted in a reduction of male progeny production from the first (G1) to the second (G2) generation. All analysed genes were up-regulated in both generations treated with MF, but with lower expression in G2. The reduced up-regulation of the dsx1 gene matched with the lower male production. Based on our results and literature data, we hypothesised that the maternal dsx1 mRNA probably plays some role early in oocyte development, and causes the eggs that receive the dsx1 signal to develop into males.
   Exposure to MF for two generations significantly increased ephippia production. These results suggest that the induction of male and ephippia might have a common root in the MF pathway. The effect of MF on life-history traits (delay in the age at maturity and fecundity reduction), sex ratio, and ephippia production suggests a direct impact of the juvenile hormone on the level of population growth. Thus, as a consequence of the switch from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction, MF influences Daphnia population metrics and in this way probably maximises the sustainability of the population under variable environmental conditions.

AB  - Because key nutritional processes differ in their thermal optima, ectotherms may use temperature selection to optimize performance in changing nutritional environments. Such behaviour would be especially advantageous to small terrestrial animals, which have low thermal inertia and often have access to a wide range of environmental temperatures over small distances. Using the locust, Locusta migratoria, we have demonstrated a direct link between nutritional state and thermoregulatory behaviour. When faced with chronic restrictions to the supply of nutrients, locusts selected increasingly lower temperatures within a gradient, thereby maximizing nutrient use efficiency at the cost of slower growth. Over the shorter term, when locusts were unable to find a meal in the normal course of ad libitum feeding, they immediately adjusted their thermoregulatory behaviour, selecting a lower temperature at which assimilation efficiency was maximal. Thus, locusts use fine scale patterns of movement and temperature selection to adjust for reduced nutrient supply and thereby ameliorate associated life-history consequences.

AB  - After reviewing the literature special breeding experiments in temperature gradients were carried out with mated and virgin females of Schistocerca gregaria under various laboratory conditions. The reproduction activity was calculated from all laid egg-pods and eggs; it was highest in normal mated females. In unmated females egg-pod production increased in the presence of males by means of a male chemical factor. Mislaid egg-pods were highest in females without antennae and in virgin females near to males. Mated females without antennae produced much fewer egg-pods than normal ones; the mean number of eggs was also lower.
   Egg-pods were deposited from the 3rd to the 20th week after emergence, with a mean of about 10-13 weeks in virgin females and 8-9 in mated ones. The weekly number of eggs per pod varied from 28-70; a high number of eggs per pod was correlated to a low production rate of egg-pods.
   The egg-laying interval was shorter in mated than in virgin females; in the latter it was shortened in presence of males.
   The hatching rate of nymphs was higher from fertilized eggs (66.2%) than unfertilized ones (22.2%); from parthenogenetic eggs only females hatched. As adults they can again produce offspring over generations without mating.
   The nymphal development lasted about 1 month. In mated females che adult rate was 64.1% and in virgin ones only 20.8% related to the hopper number at the beginning. Generally the adult female rate of the progeny of virgin females was about 70% lower than chat of the mated females, when the reduced rate of fecundity, fertility and emergence to adults were considered.
   The mean adult lifespan was calculated at about 5 months for virgin females (3 month egg-laying period) and 1 month less for mated ones.

AB  - The life cycle of Musculium lacustre populations in the Saone river at Lyon was studied over a three-years period. Following the growth period which occurs from March to June, adults released larvae, then disappeared during the summer. Only a few newborn of the new generation that appeared in May and June grow and give birth to a second generation at the end of summer or in autumn. Most of the juveniles of the first generation estivate, then hibernate with those of the second generation until the following spring. The individuals of each generation only reproduce once (semelparity). Longevity of M. lacustre is from 13 to 14 months. In 2001, the spring flood disturbed the progress of the life cycle and delayed the appearance of the new generation for one month. In 2003, a large accumulation of dead leaves at the beginning of winter and high spring temperatures led to considerable production of larvae. However, this was not followed by an increase in numbers: high mortality among the newborn occurred during May and June. These observations suggest that M. lacustre populations of the Saone are habitually food-limited. Nonetheless, the life cycle strategy adopted by this bivalve enabled it to withstand the high summer temperatures of 2003 as opposed to other Sphaeriidae (Pisidium) which disappeared in August.

AB  - Ingot chain casthouses are generally confronted with classical problems of productivity and reliability, sometimes difficult to analyze. Pechiney has developed a thermal model adapted to ingot chains in order to quantify the influence of the main process parameters. The PAMCAST/SIMULOR(R) software, dedicated to foundry casting, was used. The model uses industrial measurements and heat transfer coefficients determined in the laboratory. Among the many parameters explored with the model, the calculations show that the main parameters governing the productivity of the ingot chain are the water / mold heat transfer and the coating of the molds. The model is and will be used as a tool for optimizing present chains as well as for designing future generation ingot chains.

AB  - The southern-most nocturnal Gecko Homonota darwini from Patagonia, Argentina, exhibits a long cycle of gametogenesis, and females usually skip a year of reproduction. This annual to biennial cycle for females and a fixed clutch size of one egg results in a mean annual reproductive output of 0.75, which is one of the lowest values found in lizards. The life-history traits, summarized here for H. darwini, are closer to phylogenetically distant species from similar latitudes (Argentina, South Africa, New Zealand, and Tasmania) than with congenerics from lower latitudes in Argentina. We postulate that the affinities found among different reptile lineages living at similar latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere are the result of convergence. The short activity seasons and the low mean temperatures seem to select for prolonged reproductive cycles, low reproductive output, long lifespan, late maturity, and enhanced parental care of fewer offspring.

AB  - 1. Terrestrial ectotherms are likely to face increased periods of heat stress as mean temperatures and temperature variability increase over the next few decades. Here, we consider the extent to which changes in upper thermal limits, through plasticity or evolution, might be constrained, and we survey insect and reptile data to identify groups likely to be particularly susceptible to thermal stress.
   2. Plastic changes increase thermal limits in many terrestrial ectotherms, but tend to have less effect on upper limits than lower limits.
   3. Although comparisons across insect species have normally not taken into account the potential for plastic responses, mid-latitude species seem most prone to experience heat stress now and into the future, consistent with data from lizards and other groups.
   4. Evolutionary adaptive potential has only been measured for some species; there is likely to be genetic variation for heat responses in populations, but selection and heritability experiments suggest that upper thermal limits may not increase much.
   5. Although related species can differ by several degrees in their upper thermal limits, there is strong phylogenetic signal for upper limits. If these reflect evolutionary constraints, substantial molecular changes may be required to increase upper thermal limits.
   6. Findings point to many terrestrial ectotherms having a limited potential to change their thermal limits particularly within the context of an average predicted temperature increase of 2-4 degrees C for mid-latitude populations over the next few decades.

AB  - Increasing temperature and thermal variability generate profound selection on populations. Given the fast rate of environmental change, understanding the role of plasticity and genetic adaptation in response to increasing temperatures is critical. This may be especially true for thermal effects on reproductive traits in which thermal fertility limits at high temperatures may be lower than for survival traits. Consequences of changing environments during development on adult phenotypes may be particularly problematic for core traits such as reproduction that begin early in development. Here we examine the consequences of developmental thermal plasticity on subsequent adult reproductive traits and its genetic basis. We used a panel of Drosophila melanogaster (the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel; DGRP) in which male fertility performance was previously defined as either showing relatively little (status = 'high'-performing lines) or substantial ('low'-performing lines) decline when exposed to increasing developmental temperatures. We used a thermal reaction norm approach to quantify variation in the consequences of developmental thermal plasticity on multiple adult reproductive traits, including sex-specific responses, and to identify candidate genes underlying such variation. Developmental thermal stress impacted the means and thermal reaction norms of all reproductive traits except offspring sex ratio. Mating success declined as temperature increased with no difference between high and low lines, whereas increasing temperature resulted in declines for both male and female fertility and productivity but depended on line status. Fertility and offspring number were positively correlated within and between the sexes across lines, but males were more affected than females. We identified 933 SNPs with significant evolved genetic differentiation between high and low lines. In all, 54 of these lie within genomic windows of overall high differentiation, have significant effects of genotype on the male thermal reaction norm for productivity and are associated with 16 genes enriched for phenotypes affecting reproduction, stress responses and autophagy in Drosophila and other organisms. Our results illustrate considerable plasticity in male thermal limits on several reproductive traits following development at high temperature, and we identify differentiated loci with relevant phenotypic effects that may contribute to this population variation. While our work is on a single population, phenotypic results align with an increasing number of studies demonstrating the potential for stronger selection of thermal stress on reproductive traits, particularly in males. Such large fitness costs may have both short- and long-term consequences for the evolution of populations in response to a warming world.

AB  - The degree-day (DD) is a method of describing the thermal opportunity for growth and development and is becoming increasingly popular when comparing fish growth over large spatial scales (e. g., counter-gradient growth). Temperatures too cold to permit growth are excluded in the DD equation by incorporating a lower temperature threshold (T-o). However, there is no convention for choosing T-o, and unknown is the effect of an incorrect T-o on how growth is perceived. We simulate data to demonstrate how an incorrect T-o may lead to differences in temperature-corrected growth rates among populations. These differences increase with the error in T-o and the thermal range among simulated populations. We then show the same relationships in an analysis of length-at-age data from 81 walleye (Sander vitreus) populations in North America. Together, our results demonstrate that differences in temperature-corrected growth rates among populations can be a statistical artifact rather than a biological phenomenon, especially when populations are distributed over a large thermal gradient.

AB  - Evolutionary transitions in life-history strategies, such as the shift from egg-laying to live birth (viviparity) are of great interest to evolutionary biologists. In squamate reptiles, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain viviparity including the cold climate hypothesis, maternal manipulation hypothesis, hypoxia hypothesis, and several others. We used two approaches: first we studied 45 species of Liolaemus, a genus where nearly 50% of species are viviparous, using a diverse ecophysiological dataset to examine the cold climate and maternal manipulation hypotheses. We collected environmental thermal data (accounting for elevational differences among species), physiological traits including preferred body temperature and its coefficient of variation as an indicator of precision in thermoregulation. Additionally, we collected standard metabolic rates for 23 of the 45 species. In one clade (the darwinii group of species) with both reproductive modes, we ran our second approach. We tested for differences in thermal physiology and metabolic rates between viviparous and oviparous species during pregnancy and non-pregnancy periods. The cold climate hypothesis received strong support because viviparous species occur in sites with colder air temperatures (including areas at both higher elevations and latitudes) compared with oviparous species. Our detailed analysis showed that the maternal manipulation hypothesis also is supported; pregnant viviparous females show lower variation in their selected temperature. Our evidence suggests that the Andean orogeny is likely to have played a key role in the diversification of Liolaemus lizards and the evolution of viviparity in this clade may have been driven by a variety of physiological advantages accrued at different stages of embryogenesis and over evolutionary time. Thus, historical climate changes may have led to egg retention and may have been accompanied by other adaptations such as thermoregulation precision.

AB  - Demonstrating the likelihood of evolution in response to global warming is important, yet challenging. We discuss how three spatial thermal gradients (latitudinal, altitudinal, and urbanization) can be used as natural laboratories to inform about the gradual thermal evolution of populations by applying a space-for-time substitution (SFTS) approach. We compare thermal variables and confounding non-thermal abiotic variables, methodological approaches and evolutionary aspects associated with each type of gradient. On the basis of an overview of recent insect studies, we show that a key assumption of SFTS, local thermal adaptation along these gradients, is often but not always met, requiring explicit validation. To increase realism when applying SFTS, we highlight the importance of integrating daily temperature fluctuations, multiple stressors and multiple interacting species. Finally, comparative studies, especially across gradient types, are important to provide more robust inferences of evolution under gradual global warming. Integrating these research directions will further strengthen the still underused, yet powerful SFTS approach to infer gradual evolution under global warming.

AB  - An in vitro evolution procedure was used to obtain RNA enzymes with a particular catalytic function. A population of 10(13) variants of the, Tetrahynena ribozyme, a group I ribozyme that catalyzes sequence-specific cleavage of RNA via a phosphoester transfer mechanism, was generated. This enzyme has a limited ability to cleave DNA under conditions of high temperature or high MgCl2 concentration, or both. A selection constraint was imposed on the population of ribozyme variants such that only those individuals that carried out DNA cleavage under physiologic conditions were amplified to produce "progeny" ribozymes. Mutations were introduced during amplification to maintain heterogeneity in the population. This process was repeated for ten successive generations, resulting in enhanced (100 times) DNA cleavage activity.

AB  - Mountain pine beetle tree colonization typically occurs in July and August, with completion of a generation one (univoltinism) or two (semivoltinism) years later. In a 2012 publication, Mitton and Ferrenberg suggested that climate change resulted in an unprecedented generation between June and September (a summer generation), with a concomitant shift to two generations in one year (bivoltinism). Although summer generations are not uncommon in this species, completion of a second generation across winter, between September and June, would be required for bivoltinism, a phenomenon not previously observed. Mitton and Ferrenberg showed that a summer generation can occur, but they failed to adequately track cohorts and provided no compelling evidence for bivoltinism. We demonstrate that a winter generationand hence bivoltinismwould have been physiologically impossible at the high-elevation site used in Mitton and Ferrenberg due to lower thermal developmental thresholds. The mountain pine beetle is indeed being influenced by climate change. To address the challenges of future population outbreaks of this significant tree mortality agent, however, it is imperative to consider evolved, thermally dependent traits that serve to maintain seasonality.

AB  - Rumex obtusifolius plants and three generations of the tri-voltine leaf beetle Gastrophysa viridula were simultaneously exposed to elevated CO2 (600 ppm) to determine its effect on plant quality and insect performance. This exposure resulted in a reduction in leaf nitrogen, an increase in the C/N ratio and lower concentrations of oxalate in the leaves than in ambient air (350 ppm). Despite these changes in food quality, the effect of elevated CO2 on larvae of Gastrophysa viridula over three generations was minimal. However, the effect of CO2 did differ slightly between the generations of the insect. For the first generation, the results obtained were different from many of the published results in that elevated CO2 had no measurable effects on performance, except that third instar larvae showed compensatory feeding. Food quality, including leaf nitrogen content, declined over time in material grown in both ambient and elevated CO2. The results obtained for the second generation were similar to the first except that first instar larvae showed reduced relative growth rate in elevated CO2. Development time from hatching to pupation decreased over each generation, probably as a result of increasing temperatures. Measurements of adult performance showed that fecundity at the end of the second generation was reduced relative to the first, in line with the reduction in food quality. In addition at the end of the second generation, but not at the end of the first generation, adult females in elevated CO2 laid 30% fewer eggs per day and the eggs laid were 15% lighter than those in ambient conditions. These lighter eggs, coupled with no effect of elevated CO2 on growth during the third generation, meant that the larvae were consistently smaller in elevated CO2 during this generation. These results offer further insights into the effect that elevated CO2 will have on insect herbivores and provide a more detailed basis for population predictions.

AB  - In this paper, a modified form of the Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller known as the Integral- Proportional Derivative (I-PD) controller is developed for Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of the two-area multi-source Interconnected Power System (IPS). Fitness Dependent Optimizer (FDO) algorithm is employed for the optimization of proposed controller with various performance criteria including Integral of Absolute Error (IAE), Integral of Time multiplied Absolute Error (ITAE), Integral of Time multiplied Square Error (ITSE), and Integral Square Error (ISE). The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been assessed on a two-area network with individual source including gas, hydro and reheat thermal unit and then collectively with all three sources. Further, to validate the efficacy of the proposed FDO based PID and I-PD controllers, comprehensive comparative performance is carried and compared with other controllers including Differential Evolution based PID (DE-PID) controller and Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) hybridized with Local Unimodal Sampling (LUS-PID) controller. The comparison of outcomes reveal that the proposed FDO based I-PD (FDO-I-PD) controller provides a significant improvement in respect of Overshoot (Osh), Settling time (Ts), and Undershoot (Ush). The robustness of an I-PD controller is also verified by varying parameter of the system and load variation.

AB  - Cinara sp. nov., previously identified as Cinara cupressi (Buckton) (Homoptera: Aphididae), is an important alien aphid pest of cypresses and junipers, and invaded Africa in the late 1980s. The work reported here was carried out as part of a larger programme aimed at the classical biological control of the aphid in Africa. Basic life history attributes including life table statistics of the aphid were quantified in order to facilitate the development of efficient aphid culturing methods and essential baseline information necessary for the culturing of potential parasitoid biological agents prior to selection for introduction to Africa. Developmental rates and fecundity were studied under four constant temperatures (10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 25 degrees C). The effects of several plant nutrients (nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus) supplied at different dose levels on life history attributes of Cinara sp. nov. were also studied.
   Unlike most other aphids, the apterous morph of Cinara sp. nov. developed through only three instars, and the alate four instars. The aphid is highly aggregative and exploits a wide range of feeding sites from young green branches to woody stems. The developmental period of Cinara sp. nov. ranged from 9.3 days at 25 degrees C to 22.3 days at 10 degrees C and the developmental threshold was 0.61 degrees C. Reproduction was delayed, because of the longer duration of development, and nymph production decreased with decreasing temperature. The intrinsic rate of increase ranged between 0.117 at 25 degrees C and 0.060 at 10 degrees C. Aphid size increased significantly as temperature was lowered. Wing formation was not induced when apterae were reared for up to three generations at each constant temperature but continuous crowding in the supply cultures held at 21 degrees C resulted in a high number of alates being formed. No appreciable effects of the different plant nutrients, supplied either singly or in combination, on the duration of instars or overall survival could be detected.

AB  - Life-history theory predicts some cost to be associated with short development time, the most frequently assumed being small adult size. Alternatively, insects may increase developmental rates and grow fast to a larger size. Seasonal environments should select for phenotypic plasticity in growth and development, based on the need to complete development up to the diapausing stage before the onset of unfavourable season. Nevertheless, there must be some limit beyond which a compensation for a shorter development cannot be achieved. By comparing three geographically isolated populations of Lycaena hippothoe in common environments we show that in the Hungarian population development time seems to be traded off against size at maturity. This population is the only bivoltine one within this principally monovoltine species. Thus, realization of an additional generation per year, achieved through largely reduced development times, appears to carry the cost of substantially lower adult weights compared with other populations. In contrast, differences in development time in two monovoltine populations were not accompanied by a trade-off between development time and size. These results suggest that clear trade-offs are restricted to stressful situations, when compensation by an increase in growth rates is no longer feasible. We suggest the particularly short development time in the Hungarian population (facilitating a second generation), as well as the shorter development in an alpine (short vegetation period) compared with a western German population, to be adaptations to local climatic conditions.

AB  - Population dynamics and production of the calanoid copepod Paracalanus sp. were studied from November 1986 to November 1987 in Fukuyama Harbor, a eutrophic inlet of the Inland Sea of Japan. This species was perennial, with a large abundance peak in June/July and small peaks in September/October and November/December. During a year of investigation, 15 generations could be detected. For each generation, the mean population egg production rate and the mean daily midstage abundance from NIII to CV were determined to obtain a survival curve from egg to CV. The mortality was extremely high during the early life stages: on average only 7.1% of the eggs produced might survive into NIII. This high mortality might be caused by predation by sympatric omnivorous copepods, in addition to sinking loss of eggs from the water column. The biomass of Paracalanus sp. showed marked seasonal variations largely in parallel with numerical abundance. The instantaneous growth rate of each developmental stage increased exponentially with temperature up to 20 degrees C, above which the rate was constant. The annual integrated production rate was 734 mg C m(-3) yr(-1) or 5.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1).

AB  - The modulation of fitness by single mutational substitutions during environmental change is the most fundamental consequence of natural selection. The antagonistic tradeoffs of pleiotropic mutations that can be selected under changing environments therefore lie at the foundation of evolutionary biology. However, the molecular basis of fitness tradeoffs is rarely determined in terms of how these pleiotropic mutations affect protein structure. Here we use an interdisciplinary approach to study how antagonistic pleiotropy and protein function dictate a fitness tradeoff. We challenged populations of an RNA virus, bacteriophage W6, to evolve in a novel temperature environment where heat shock imposed extreme virus mortality. A single amino acid substitution in the viral lysin protein P5 (V207F) favored improved stability, and hence survival of challenged viruses, despite a concomitant tradeoff that decreased viral reproduction. This mutation increased the thermostability of P5. Crystal structures of wild-type, mutant, and ligand-bound P5 reveal the molecular basis of this thermostabilization-the Phe207 side chain fills a hydrophobic cavity that is unoccupied in the wild-type-and identify P5 as a lytic transglycosylase. The mutation did not reduce the enzymatic activity of P5, suggesting that the reproduction tradeoff stems from other factors such as inefficient capsid assembly or disassembly. Our study demonstrates how combining experimental evolution, biochemistry, and structural biology can identify the mechanisms that drive the antagonistic pleiotropic phenotypes of an individual point mutation in the classic evolutionary tug-of-war between survival and reproduction.

AB  - Aquaculture produces more than 50% of fish for human consumption and, in spite of major improvements since the adoption of injectable vaccines in the 1990s, bacterial diseases still account for considerable losses, particularly in tropical and warm temperate species. Streptococcosis, caused predominantly by Streptococcus iniae and S. agalactiae, manifests as a generalised septicaemia and meningitis followed by rapid mortality. Vaccination against streptococcal infections is difficult as a result of multiple, poorly defined serotypes and consequent vaccine escape (reinfection of previously vaccinated animals). However, genomics applied to reverse vaccinology is providing novel insights into diversity among these aquatic pathogens and is identifying cross-serotype targets that may be exploited for new generation streptococcal vaccines for aquaculture.

AB  - Predation by the phytoseiid mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis, is considered a major threat to the effectiveness of biological control of gorse, Ulex europaeus, using Tetranychus lintearius. To assess this threat and to determine if the impact of P. persimilis on T. lintearius populations is comparable to its impact on T. urticae populations, its development and predator : prey generation time ratios were assessed. The pre-adult mortality and development time of two populations of P. persimilis fed on two diets, T. urticae and T. lintearius, were determined at two temperatures, 14 and 24A degrees C. There were no significant differences in either mortality or development time between the two populations of P. persimilis at these temperatures. There is therefore no evidence that the two tested populations of P. persimilis are behaving as different strains. Similarly, diet had no significant effect on either mortality or development time at these temperatures. At 14A degrees C the mortality of P. persimilis was significantly higher and development was significantly longer than at 24A degrees C. Using pre-adult development as a surrogate for generation times, predator : prey generation time ratios were calculated between P. persimilis and both T. urticae and T. lintearius using data from this and other studies. The predator : prey generation time ratios between P. persimilis and T. lintearius were lower than those between P. persimilis and T. urticae. These results indicate that the impact of P. persimilis on T. lintearius populations is likely to be comparable to its impact on T. urticae populations. This provides further evidence that predation by P. persimilis is having a deleterious effect on T. lintearius populations and therefore reducing its effectiveness as a biological control agent for gorse.

AB  - Small-scale distributed power generation offers environmental benefits through the improvement of global energy efficiency, in addition to increasing the reliability of the power supply. In this study, the technical and economic viability of the implementation of micro-cogeneration technology in the manufacturing sector was studied in light of the Brazilian regulatory situation. The thermal efficiency potential for the manufacturing sector is introduced for further exploration by decision-makers. This study also investigated the behavior of micro-cogeneration in distributed generation through the Brazilian Energy Compensation System. The technical viability was studied by simulating a Brayton cycle with the operation parameters of a 100 kW micro-turbine. This simulation allowed an estimation of the avoided cost of natural gas compared to an industrial process without cogeneration. Rate projections were performed by linear regression during the system's depreciation period. The economic evaluation was performed using the following indicators: net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and discounted payback. Finally, a sensitivity study was performed to project how the micro-cogeneration efficiency and the Brazilian regulations can address future variations of natural gas and electricity rates. Given the conditions of this study, the increase in energy prices favors micro-cogeneration; however, the economic viability is affected if the system operates below 70% of heat use in industrial processes, which reduces the effect of public policies toward the incentive to cogenerate.

AB  - Eleven provenance/progeny tests of Pinus greggii Engelm. were assessed for survival and height at 3 years of age in Brazil, Colombia and South Africa. Trees of P. greggii from sources in northern Mexico (approximate to 25 degrees N latitude) were less than half as tall as trees from provenances in central Mexico (approximate to 21 degrees N latitude) when established in warm climates of Brazil and Colombia, (4.2 m vs. 1.6 m, respectively). The differences in height growth diminished between southern and northern sources in more temperate climates in South Africa (2.9 m vs. 2.1 m, respectively). External morphological differences in foliage were also pronounced between trees of the two regions when grown as an exotic. Trees from northern sources had shorter, stiffer, needles of darker green color than those from southern provenances. The most promising of the southern provenances across all sites were El Madrono (Queretaro) and Laguna Seca (Hidalgo). La Tapona (Nuevo Leon) and Los Lirios (Coahuila) performed well among the northern sources. Pinus greggii should be tested where low rainfall and cold are considered limiting factors for good growth of P. patula.

AB  - The effect of inbreeding on longevity and viability (intervals of 0-30, 30-60, 60-90, and 90-120 days of birth) in three consecutive generations of full sibs of escargot Helix aspersa raised under laboratory conditions (20-25 degrees C temperature; 70-90% relative humidity) was studied. Inbreeding effects decreased the viability for all the studied intervals. The longevity means were 314 and 306 days, respectively to the first and third generations. Hibernating animals were not observed. Population size of at least 100 non-related mating escargots replaced after 10 generations to avoid inbreeding effect is recommended.

AB  - The inheritance of heat-stable resistance to the root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid and White) Chitwood, was studied in crosses between different accessions and clones of Lycopersicon peruvianum L. F1, F2 and BC1 generations were evaluated for their index of resistance based on numbers of eggs and infective second-stage juveniles (J2) per gram of root, and the segregation ratios were determined in experiments carried out at constant soil temperatures of 25-degrees-C and 30-degrees-C. L. peruvianum P.I. 270435 clones 3 MH and 2 R2 and P.I. 126443 clone 1 MH, all heat-stable resistant, were crossed with L. peruvianum P.I. 126440 clone 9 MH, which is susceptible at both 25-degrees-C and 30-degrees-C. All F1 progeny were resistant at 25-degrees-C and 30-degrees-C; F2 and BC1 generations at 25-degrees-C gave resistant: susceptible (R:S) ratios of 15:1 and 3:1, respectively, which suggests that resistance is conditioned by two independently assorting genes. However, at 30-degrees-C, R:S ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 were observed for the F2 and BC1 generations, respectively. These results indicate that heat-stable resistance is conferred by a single dominant gene expressed at 30-degrees-C, while the second resistance gene is heat unstable and not expressed at 30-degrees-C. P.I. 270435 clones 2 R2 and 3 MH and P.I. 126443 clone 1 MH were crossed with P.I. 128657 clone 3 R4 (source of gene Mi), which is resistant at 25-degrees-C but susceptible at 30-degrees-C. All of the F1 progeny were resistant at 25-degrees-C and 30-degrees-C. TC1 progeny of 270435-2 R2 x 128657-3 R4, 270435-3 MH x 128657-3R4 and 126443-1 MH x 128657-3 R4 crossed with susceptible 126440-9 MH were all resistant at 25-degrees-C and segregated in a 1:1 ratio at 30-degrees-C. These results also suggest that the heat-stable resistance is monogenic and that it is non-allelic to gene Mi. The non-segregation of TC1 progenies at 25-degrees-C, suggests that the heat-unstable resistance factor in L. peruvianum P.I. 270435 clones 2 R2 and 3 MH and in P.I. 126443 clone 1 MH is allelic to or the same as gene Mi. We propose the symbol Mi-2 for the gene in P.I. 270435 that confers heat-stable resistance to M. incognita.

AB  - The effects of salinity on the growth rate and survival of juvenile Littorina scabra gastropods reared in the laboratory from the young of young females collected in estuarine, intermediate, and marine habitats were studied. The optimum growth conditions of juveniles were dependent on the salinity regime in their original habitat. The young group of females from the marine site showed maximum survival at a salinity of 40 parts per thousand, the value corresponding to the normal salinity in their native habitat during the breeding period, while at 30 parts per thousand, the growth of juveniles from this population was strongly suppressed. Juveniles originating from the estuarine habitat were able to maintain equally high growth rates at 40 and 30 parts per thousand; however, at 30 parts per thousand, they grew significantly faster than juveniles from the marine site. The progeny of females from the intermediate habitat showed intermediate growth rates at 30 parts per thousand. Fluctuating salinity (40-10-40 parts per thousand) had an adverse effect on the growth of juvenile Littorina, irrespective of the parental habitat. The differences in survival, size, and growth rates of the progeny of L. scabra in habitats with different salinity regimes are discussed in relation to their potential adaptive significance to life in estuaries

AB  - Microbial evolution experiments offer a powerful approach for coupling changes in complex phenotypes, including fitness and its components, with specific mutations. Here we investigate mutations substituted in 15 lines of Escherichia coli that evolved for 1000 generations under freeze-thaw-growth (FTG) conditions. To investigate the genetic basis of their improvemens, we screened many of the lines for mutations involving insertion sequence (IS) elements and identified two genes where multiple lines had similar mutations. Three lines had IS150 insertions in cls, which encodes cardiolipin synthase, and 8 lines had IS150 insertions in the uspA-usB intergenic region, encoding two universal stress proteins. Another line had an 11-bp deletion is beneficial under the FTG regime in its evolved genetic background. Futher experiments showed that this cls mutation helps maintain membrane fluidity after freezing and thawing and improves freeze-thaw (FT) survival. Reconstruction of isogenic strains also showed that the IS150 insertions in uspA/B are beneficial under the FTG regime. The evolved insertions reduce uspB transcription and increase both FT survival and recovery, but the physiological mechanism for this fitness improvement remains unknown.

AB  - Global climate change will affect the abundance, distribution, and life history timing of many exploited marine populations, but specific changes are difficult to predict. Management systems in which harvest strategies and tactics are flexible in responding to unpredictable biological changes are more likely to succeed in maintaining productive populations. We explore the adaptability of fisheries management systems in relation to oceanic warming rates by asking how two important management characteristics vary with temperature changes for > 500 stocks. (1) Harvest control rules, a framework for altering fishing pressure in response to changes in the abundance of targeted species (primarily due to fishing), may provide the capacity for harvest policies to change in response to climate-driven abundance declines also. (2) Seasonal openings with flexible dates that involve in-season monitoring may allow managers to better respond to possible changes in the timing of life-history periods like spawning to prevent fishing seasons falling out of sync with species' phenology. Harvest control rules were widely used across industrialized fisheries including in regions that experienced relatively high oceanic warming rates, but after controlling for regional factors we found no association between ocean warming and the use of harvest control rules. Flexible-date seasonal openings were rare compared to fixed-date seasonal openings, but tended to occur in areas with the greatest warming rates while fisheries without seasonal closures tended to occur in areas with the least observed temperature changes. We found no consistent evidence of recent ocean warming effects on the current biomass or exploitation rates relative to management targets of 241 assessed marine populations. Together, these results suggest that the oceanic areas expected to have the greatest climate impacts on populations do at least tend to contain fisheries that demonstrate the potential for adaptability to unpredictable climate impacts.

AB  - Establishing water quality criteria using bioassays is complicated by variation in chemical tolerance between populations. Two major contributors to this variation are acclimation and adaptation, which are both linked to exposure history, but differ in how long their effects are maintained. Our study examines how tolerance changes over multiple generations of exposure to two common marine pollutants, copper (Cu) and tributyltin oxide (TBTO), in a sexually reproducing marine copepod, Tigriopus californicus. Lines of T. californicus were chronically exposed to sub-lethal levels of Cu and TBTO for 12 generations followed by a recovery period of 3 generations in seawater control conditions. At each generation, the average number of offspring produced and survived to 28 d was determined and used as the metric of tolerance. Lines exposed to Cu and TBTO showed an overall increase in tolerance over time. Increased Cu tolerance arose by generation 3 in the chronically exposed lines and was lost after 3 generations in seawater control conditions. Increased TBTO tolerance was detected at generation 7 and was maintained even after 3 generations in seawater control conditions. It was concluded from this study that tolerance to Cu is consistent with acclimation, a quick gain and loss of tolerance. In contrast, TBTO tolerance is consistent with adaptation, in which onset of tolerance was delayed relative to an acclimation response and maintained in the absence of exposure. These findings illustrate that consideration of exposure history is necessary when using bioassays to measure chemical tolerance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Theory about the role of constraints in evolution is abundant, but few empirical data exist to describe the consequences a bias in phenotypic variation has for micro evolution. Responses to natural selection can be severely hampered by a genetic correlation among a suite of traits. Constraints can be studied using antagonistic selection experiments, that is, two-trait selection in opposition to this correlation. The two traits studied here were development time and wing pattern (eyespot size) in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana, both of which have a clear adaptive significance. Rates of response were higher for eyespot size than for development time, but were independent of the concurrent selection (either in the same direction as the correlation or perpendicular to it), Regimes differed in both traits in all directions after I I generations of selection. The uncoupling lines had higher relative responses than the synergistic lines in development time and equal relative responses in eyespot size. The patterns for eyespot size (reaction norms) were consistent across different rearing temperatures. Differences in lines selected for fast and slow development time were more pronounced at lower temperatures, irrespective of the direction of joint wing pattern selection. Furthermore, correlated responses in pupal weight and growth rate were observed; lines selected for a slower development had higher pupal weights, especially at lower temperatures. The response of the uncoupling lines was not hampered by a lack of selectable genetic variation, and the relative response in the development time was larger than expected based on response in the coupled direction and quantitative genetic predictions. This suggests that the structure of the genetic architecture does not constrain the short-term, independent evolution of both wing pattern and development time.

AB  - While pollution due to nano- and micro-sized plastics (NMPs) and hypoxic conditions both occur in coastal areas, the deleterious potential of co-exposure to hypoxia and NMPs (hypoxia and micro-sized plastics, HMPs; hypoxia and nano-sized plastics, HNPs) is largely unclear. Here, we provide evidence for multigenerational effects of HMP and HNP in the marine rotifer Brachionus plicatilis by investigating changes in its life traits, antioxidant system, and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway using an orthogonal experimental design, with nanoscale and microscale particles measuring 0.05 mu m and 6.0 mu m in diameter, respectively, and hypoxic conditions of 0.5 mg/L for six generations. Combined exposure to NMPs and hypoxia caused a significant decrease in fecundity and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The HIF pathway and circadian clock genes were also significantly upregulated in response to HMP and HNP exposure. In particular, synergistic deleterious effects of HNP were evident, suggesting that size-dependent toxicity can be a major driver of the effects of hypoxia and NMP co-exposure. After several generations of exposure, ROS levels returned to basal levels and transcriptomic resilience was observed, although rotifer reproduction remained suppressed. These findings help eluciating the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in responses to plastic pollution in hypoxic conditions.

AB  - We studied two species of neotropical parasitoids that occur naturally in northeastern Brazil and are associated with Liriomyza sativae (Blanchard): Opius (Gastrosema) scabriventris Nixon (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and Chrysocharis vonones (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). We evaluated the influence of seven temperatures on the duration of the egg-adult period and on the survivorship of the immature stages of the parasitoids. A temperature increase from 15 to 30 degrees C shortened the egg-adult period of O. scabriventris and C. vonones. However, at 32 degrees C, the developmental time for the braconid was prolonged, and no difference was observed for the eulophid, compared with 30 degrees C. The highest temperature, 35 degrees C, proved to be lethal for both species. At 15 degrees C, C. vonones pupal survivorship was drastically reduced, whereas that of O. scabriventris was unaffected. At most temperatures, the eulophid had an egg-adult period shorter than or similar to the braconid, except at 15 degrees C. The threshold temperature (Tt) of the egg-adult period for O. scabriventris was 7.3 degrees C with a thermal constant (K) of 257.1 degree days (DD). For C. vonones the Tt was 7.4 degrees C for the total cycle and 6.2 degrees C for the pupal stage, with a thermal constant of 246.3 and 140.3 DD, respectively. These data allow an estimate of 29.4 annual generations for O. scabriventris and 30.5 for C. vonones in a melon production region in northeastern Brazil, values that are equivalent to 4.9 and 6.0 more generations than the host. These results demonstrate that both species have potential for application in biological control programs against the leafminer fly L. sativae.

AB  - Piezodorus guildinii (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is an important soybean pest, and one of its main natural enemies is Telenomus podisi (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae). Rearing of the parasitoid is constrained by the hosts' egg quality, which deteriorates after few generations in laboratory, therefore, cold-stored host eggs utilization could be a useful tool for augmentative biological control. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the quality of P. guildinii cold-stored eggs, on the performance of parental and F-1 generation of T. podisi. Host eggs 24 hour old were stored at -18 degrees C for one (N=53), two (N=28) or three months (N=29), and approximately 40 host eggs were offered to a T. podisi female per treatment, for 48 hours. The control treatment consisted of 24-hour-old non-frozen host eggs, obtained and kept at 24 degrees C (N=55). Parental generation parasitism and progeny's emergence on frozen eggs was significantly lower than on non-frozen eggs, even for the shorter storage period. Male proportion and preimaginal development time of the progeny increased with freezing period. However, parasitism proportion caused by adults of F-1, and emergence, male proportion, and preimaginal development time of F-2 were not affected. Although the performance of T. podisi on frozen P. guildinii eggs was significantly lower than on nonfrozen ones, host eggs storage for up to two months allowed obtaining a parasitism rate of 40% with a high emergence rate. This could be helpful enough to maintain mass rearings, mainly during the host hibernation period, and to enhance field parasitism when host is scarce.

AB  - Rare species are frequently genetically depauperate compared with widespread species, but the degree to which low genetic variation affects short-term viability is still unresolved. We examined the relationship between population-level genetic variation and fitness in small, experimental populations of Brassica rapa ( a Eurasian annual) in a stable, mild environment. We used allozyme and morphological markers to create populations with either high or low levels of genetic variation. We then grew three high-variation and three low-variation populations for six generations under benign growing conditions, with consistent levels of light, nutrients, and water. We measured fitness components and genetic variation throughout the experiment. All populations were maintained at equal sizes (n = 100 seeds to start each generation), and plants were mass-pollinated to avoid differential inbreeding. Under mild conditions, high-variation plants did not have consistently higher fitness than low-variation plants. In generation three, plants in low-variation populations outperformed high-variation plants. In generation four, however, which was subjected to unplanned heat stress, high-variation plants had higher values for many of the fitness components measured, suggesting that, under stress, genetic variation may be associated with a fitness advantage. No differences in multiplicative fitness were found in any generation, indicating that high-and low-variation populations did not differ significantly in overall population viability. Our results indicate that when degree of inbreeding and population size are held constant, genetic variation per se does not increase fitness under benign conditions. As theory predicts, the role of population-level genetic variation may instead be in enhancing the ability of small populations to remain viable under fluctuating, stressful, or novel conditions.

AB  - Tropical coastal areas are increasingly exposed to temperature extremes from marine heatwaves and contaminants from anthropogenic activities. The interactive effects of these environmental changes on marine life are understudied. We investigated the direct and cross-generational effects of copper (Cu) on F0 and F1 generations of the common tropical copepod Pseudodiaptomus annandalei under extreme temperatures (30 and 34 degrees C). In F0, Cu exposure reduced survival and nauplii production; these patterns were more pronounced at 34 degrees C and in females. F0 Copepods produced more faecal pellets at 34 degrees C than 30 degrees C, indicating a higher energetic demand. In F1, the number of F1 adults was lower in CueF0 and at 34 degrees C. Cu-exposed F0 produced larger adult F1, while exposure to 34 degrees C resulted in smaller adult F1. Our results show that tropical copepods are highly vulnerable to the interactive effects of contaminants and extreme temperatures.

AB  - This paper reports on enhancing the thermal performance of multiple-chip modules (MCMs) that contain a number of chips under natural convection by optimizing the chip placement layout. To attain this goal, an innovative hybrid optimization approach (HOA) incorporating a genetic algorithm (GA) into an algorithm based on a response surface method (RSM) is introduced for improving the performance of both these algorithms. The GA in the proposed HOA is responsible for not only evolving the population toward better fitness value but also, based on the newly evolved populations at each GA generation, for continuously updating the RS mathematical model for better approximation of the chip junction temperature. The sum of the mathematical expressions representing the total system temperature defines the objective of the optimization problems. For each GA generation, a constrained quadratic optimization subproblem is formed, based on the newly updated approximate RS mathematical model as the objective function along with the specified constraints. The solution of the optimization subproblem is sought through a mathematical programming model. As the genetic RS optimization progresses, a sequence of approximate solutions associated with the continuously updated RS mathematical models is constructed. The iterative process continues until convergence of the approximate solutions is attained. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed algorithm, several thermal design problems associated with two types of MCMs with equal/unequal power are performed. The obtained results are compared with those derived using two conventional approaches-the GA-based and the RSM-based optimization techniques. Results show that the developed algorithm can provide good optimal solutions with much less computational effort, and the larger the scale of the design problems, the more significant the improvement in the computation cost.

AB  - In viviparous ectotherms, the interval between reproductive bouts is often extended by long gestation times, preventing multiple reproductive events per annum. We assessed the potential roles of physiological adaptation and environmental constraints in driving an unusual case of geographic variation in life history, in the viviparous lizard (Eulamprus quoyii), which has either one or two reproductive bouts per annum, depending on the geographic location of the population. Using dynamic energy budget theory, we developed an integrated model of the energetics of growth and reproduction in this lizard, and applied it in conjunction with biophysical calculations of body temperature and activity time across its geographic range to predict reproductive frequency. Our model indicated that geographic variation in body temperature alone (i.e. environmental constraints) explained the observed pattern of litter frequency, suggesting that differences in energy allocation among populations were unlikely to be a major cause of differences in litter frequency in E.quoyii. It also suggested that natural selection should favour fixation of litter size in the transition zone.

AB  - Background: Previously, we showed that adaptive substitutions in one of the three promoters of the bacteriophage phi X174 improved fitness at high-temperature by decreasing transcript levels three-to four-fold. To understand how such an extreme change in gene expression might lead to an almost two-fold increase in fitness at the adaptive temperature, we focused on stages in the life cycle of the phage that occur before and after the initiation of transcription. For both the ancestral strain and two single-substitution strains with down-regulated transcription, we measured seven phenotypic components of fitness (attachment, ejection, eclipse, virion assembly, latent period, lysis rate and burst size) during a single cycle of infection at each of two temperatures. The lower temperature, 37 degrees C, is the optimal temperature at which phages are cultivated in the lab; the higher temperature, 42 degrees C, exerts strong selection and is the condition under which these substitutions arose in evolution experiments. We augmented this study by developing an individual-based stochastic model of this same life cycle to explore potential explanations for our empirical results.
   Results: Of the seven fitness parameters, three showed significant differences between strains that carried an adaptive substitution and the ancestor, indicating the presence of pleiotropy in regulatory evolution. 1) Eclipse was longer in the adaptive strains at both the optimal and high-temperature environments. 2) Lysis rate was greater in the adaptive strains at the high temperature. 3) Burst size for the mutants was double that of the ancestor at the high temperature, but half that at the lower temperature. Simulation results suggest that eclipse length and latent period variance can explain differences in burst sizes and fitness between the mutant and ancestral strains.
   Conclusions: Down-regulating transcription affects several steps in the phage life cycle, and all of these occur after the initiation of transcription. We attribute the apparent tradeoff between delayed progeny production and faster progeny release to improved host resource utilization at high temperature.

AB  - This paper examines the optimum conditions for edible snails Helix aspersa to be cultured indoors successfully in successive generations (originating from the crossing of snails coming from different clutches of a previous generation), and the effect of crowding on growth and reproduction in fast-, medium-, and slow-growing snails coming from the same clutches. The time needed for the snails to reach marketable size (25-32 mm) varied from 2.5 to 5 months up to the 7th generation. The time needed for the snails to mature and reproduce from 4 to 7 months until the fifth generation. After the F5 x F5 generation, the final size of the snails decreased. The number of eggs did not differ statistically among the different generations but the reproductive success (how many snails reproduced/cage) increased from F1 = F1 generation onwards to F5 X F5. In F6 x F6 only three (out of 26) snails reproduced and in F7 X F7 none, although the snails remained under controlled conditions for 15 more months. Mortality in the different generations varied from 0-10% up to F5 x F5 but from F6 x F6 onwards increased and reached 25%. Concerning the origin of snails, it was found that larger snails (originating from Kyparissia, Peloponnesos) lay statistically more eggs (138.40 +/- 29.60, N = 5) than smaller ones (77.38 +/- 40.42, N = 4) (originating from Hania, island of Crete). Hatching success was greater, too.

AB  - The final preferred temperatures (FPTs) of adult premigratory and migratory life-history phases of American eels, Anguilla rostrata, were determined by chronic tests in a horizontal thermal gradient.  Mean FPTs were between 17 and 20-degrees-C and were not significantly different between life-history phases, acclimation temperatures, illumination regimes, photoperiods or sexual maturation states.  Thermal behavior of eels was highly variable, both among individuals of the various test groups and among repeated tests of single individuals.  Light inhibited behavioral thermoregulation by promoting shelter-seeking.  The following inferences are drawn from the laboratory findings and observations of migrating A. rostrata and A. anguilla (European eels) in the North Atlantic:  (1) decreasing temperatures may initiate downstream migration of silver eels, (2) eels may select temperatures close to their FPT in thermally stratified environments, but will tolerate higher and lower temperatures depending on illumination or other physical constraints, (3) the oceanic phase of the migration to the Sargasso Sea may take place at relatively shallow depths in the open ocean, probably within the upper 1000 meters.  The strong eurythermality observed in eels may facilitate their occupation of and migration through thermally diverse and unpredictable habitats.

AB  - In terrestrial ectotherms, body temperatures have a pronounced effect on their physiological processes and life history traits. This study was conducted to determine what the thermal preferences of adult female scorpions, Paruroctonus marksi, are and whether their body temperature influences their escape behavior. There was a significant difference between the mean diurnal (26.11 +/- 0.317 degrees C) and nocturnal (28.55 +/- 0.439 degrees C) body temperatures. Furthermore, each P. marksi sprint speed was tested at 18, 22, 28, 37 degrees C respectively. Ideal sprint speed fell within the range of chosen body temperatures. The highest sprint speed (8.42 +/- 0.483 cm/s) recorded in this study was at 28 degrees C; however, their sprint speed was slower at the higher temperature range (37 degrees C). We can conclude that these scorpions select temperatures that maximize their survival chances when it comes to sprinting abilities.

AB  - This synthesis focuses on the estuarine and ocean ecology of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) across their southern ranges in North America. General life history and ecology share many common traits including iteroparity, duration of freshwater (0-3 years) and marine (2-5 years) rearing, ocean emigration at relatively large sizes and strong surface orientation compared to other salmonids. Despite parallels in life history and anthropogenic pressures, several differences emerged for these species. First, steelhead have greater life history diversity and a broader geographic distribution. Generally, estuary habitats serve as short-term migration corridors for both species. However, some steelhead populations used lagoon habitat in south-coast watersheds. While both species are epipelagic, Atlantic salmon exhibit more vertical migration. Atlantic salmon tend to follow migratory highways-relatively narrow bands along the coastal shelf, then crossing the Atlantic to feed inshore and in fjords of West Greenland. Conversely, steelhead exit the coastal shelf quickly, dispersing across the Pacific, and rarely use coastal environments. Despite inhabiting rivers in warm dry Mediterranean climates, the extended range and stability of southern steelhead distribution is likely buffered by cool upwelled waters of the California Current. Whereas Atlantic salmon populations are restricted by warmer Northwest Atlantic circulation patterns lacking cool upwelling with greater susceptibility to warming associated with climate change. Determining the rate of marine habitat changes in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is important to the conservation of these species, including subtleties of temporal and spatial habitat use, and adaptability to ocean ecosystems under climate change.

AB  - Five Lotus tenuis genotypes showing 2n pollen production greater than 5% and producing 4x progenies in 4x(male sterile Lotus corniculatus) x 2x crosses were found in different natural populations. Meiotic analyses of these plants showed some second metaphases with disoriented spindles, i.e. parallel and tripolar spindles which resulted in diads and triads, respectively. Because useful genes for winter growth and resistance to powdery mildew from L. tenuis can be introgressed into L. corniculatus via 2n gametes, a programme of selection was started to increase the occurrence of 2n gamete production in L. renuis. Controlled crosses were performed between genotypes producing 2n gametes and the progenies were checked for 2n pollen production and meiotic aberration, following the same methodologies as used for the parental plants. Although in some progeny plants the frequency of 2n gamete production increased remarkably, the overall progeny level of 2n gamete production remained unchanged. This suggested that different genes for meiotic aberration exist in natural populations and/or differential seed-setting ability exists between genotypes. Diallel crosses between selected genotypes confirmed this hypothesis. Evaluation of 2n pollen production of clones grown under different temperature regimes (warm vs. temperate) showed that, in L. tenuis, the effects of genotype, temperature and genotype x temperature interaction are significant. In particular, high temperature increases the level of 2n gamete production in L. tenuis.

AB  - Montane populations of the Australian allodapine bee, Exoneura bicolor, are characterized by high levels of cooperative nesting and strongly female-biased sex ratios. A conspecific population from heathland shows much lower levels of cooperative nesting and lower levels of female bias. In both habitats, sex-ratio bias is greatest in the smallest brood sizes and becomes successively less biased in larger broods. Parity is approached in the largest heathland colonies, but not for any brood-size category in montane areas. Adult intracolony relatedness is moderately high for colonies in both reused and newly founded nests in the montane habitat, but probably low or zero for newly founded nests in heathland. Colony efficiency, measured as the number of brood per adult, increases with colony size in both habitats, suggesting that cooperation between females increases mean female fitness. It is argued that patterns of sex allocation are consistent with nonlinear fitness-return models, in which the mean reproductive value of daughters increases with the number of daughters produced in a brood. Such increases probably arise from a number of social interactions, including cooperative brood defense, increased task efficiency, and lower per capita costs in nest construction. The term ''local fitness enhancement'' is introduced here to describe these effects collectively. The female-biased ratios should lower selective thresholds for sib-directed altruism, at least in the earlier stages of colony development. It is argued that local fitness enhancement facilitates eusociality in allodapine bees and could also play a role in other haplodiploid taxa, provided cooperative nesting largely involves sisters, colony efficiency increases with colony size, and optimal colony sizes are only achieved after two or more generations after founding.

AB  - It is notoriously difficult to test hypotheses about the selective forces responsible for major phylogenetic transitions in life-history traits, but the evolution of viviparity (live bearing) in reptiles offers an ideal model system. Viviparity has arisen in many oviparous reptile lineages that have invaded colder climates. Thermal advantages (eggs retained within the mother's body will be warmer than those laid in the nest) are almost certainly important, but the actual selective pressures remain controversial. For example, the benefit to retention might involve faster development, protection against freezing, predation, or desiccation, or modification of hatchling phenotypes. I experimentally manipulated incubation regimes of a montane scincid lizard (Bassiana duperreyi, Scincidae) to test these ideas. Eggs maintained in cooler "nests" in the laboratory developed more slowly, were more likely to die before hatching, and produced inferior (small, slow) hatchlings. A 2-wk initial period of higher-temperature incubation (simulating uterine retention, an intermediate step toward viviparity) ameliorated these effects. In the field, I placed eggs in artificial nests at the upper elevational limit of natural nests and also extending a further 100 m higher on the mountain. The results mirrored those in the laboratory: retention at maternal body temperatures accelerated hatching, enhanced hatching success, and increased locomotor speeds of hatchlings. This selective advantage of uterine retention was greater at higher elevations and increased with longer retention. The causal process responsible was prolonged low-temperature incubation rather than freezing, desiccation, or predation, and both hatching success and hatchling viability were affected. Field experiments that directly re-create selective regimes may thus provide robust tests of adaptationist hypotheses.

AB  - Large numbers of rotifer eggs from sediment resting egg banks may hatch simultaneously under appropriate conditions; therefore, natural populations are likely to be multiclonal in a growing season. A recent field investigation showed that subordinate and ephemeral clones were able to establish populations in an environment with several strongly dominant clone populations. However, it was not clear how the subordinate populations maintained their growth under these conditions where the crowding signal would induce high levels of sexual reproduction in the dominant clone populations. In the present study, we conducted a continuous passage to 60 generations for new populations at three different temperatures (15A degrees C, 25A degrees C, and 35A degrees C). These populations emerged from resting eggs produced by a clone population. At the first, 30th, and 60th generations, the populations were sampled and fitness was assayed using the life-table method. We found a significant short-term fitness advantage for populations newly emerged from resting eggs produced by a clone population of the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, followed by a significant decrease in relative fitness with long-term continuous passage. Our results suggested that the early short-term fitness advantage was important for later-hatched and subordinate clone populations in an environment with multiple sympatric clones. The early short-term fitness might also promote the coexistence of sympatric clones because it could help to offset the cost of early sexual reproduction.

AB  - Thermal plasticity can help organisms coping with climate change. In this study, we analyse how laboratory populations of the ectotherm species Drosophila subobscura, originally from two distinct latitudes and evolving for several generations in a stable thermal environment (18 degrees C), respond plastically to new thermal challenges. We measured adult performance (fecundity traits as a fitness proxy) of the experimental populations when exposed to five thermal regimes, three with the same temperature during development and adulthood (15-15 degrees C, 18-18 degrees C, 25-25 degrees C), and two where flies developed at 18 degrees C and were exposed, during adulthood, to either 15 degrees C or 25 degrees C. Here, we test whether (1) flies undergo stress at the two more extreme temperatures; (2) development at a given temperature enhances adult performance at such temperature (i.e. acclimation), and (3) populations with different biogeographical history show plasticity differences. Our findings show (1) an optimal performance at 18 degrees C only if flies were subjected to the same temperature as juveniles and adults; (2) the occurrence of developmental acclimation at lower temperatures; (3) detrimental effects of higher developmental temperature on adult performance; and (4) a minor impact of historical background on thermal response. Our study indicates that thermal plasticity during development may have a limited role in helping adults cope with warmer - though not colder - temperatures, with a potential negative impact on population persistence under climate change. It also emphasizes the importance of analysing the impact of temperature on all stages of the life cycle to better characterize the thermal limits.

AB  - Adaptation of natural populations to variable environmental conditions may occur by changes in trait means and/or in the levels of plasticity. Theory predicts that environmental heterogeneity favors plasticity of adaptive traits. Here we investigated the performance in several traits of three sympatric Drosophila species freshly collected in two environments that differ in the heterogeneity of environmental conditions. Differences in trait means within species were found in several traits, indicating that populations differed in their evolutionary response to the environmental conditions of their origin. Different species showed distinct adaptation with a very different role of plasticity across species for coping with environmental changes. However, geographically distinct populations of the same species generally displayed the same levels of plasticity as induced by fluctuating thermal regimes. This indicates a weak and trait-specific effect of environmental heterogeneity on plasticity. Furthermore, similar levels of plasticity were found in a laboratory-adapted population of Drosophila melanogaster with a common geographic origin but adapted to the laboratory conditions for more than 100 generations. Thus, this study does not confirm theoretical predictions on the degree of adaptive plasticity among populations in relation to environmental heterogeneity but shows a very distinct role of species-specific plasticity.

AB  - We investigated the diversity and thermal response of a fitness related trait, juvenile growth rate, in seasonal population samples of Daphnia magna from two temperate ponds. Both populations were intermittent, i.e. they disappeared from the water body and recolonized seasonally by hatching from resting eggs in the sediment.
   Temporally isolated clones of Daphniamagna showed the typical asymmetric response for growth rate with temperature and a sharp decline after the maximum response at 26degreesC (TMR). There was no evidence for genetically adapted seasonal groups. Despite significant genetic variation among clones and for phenotypic plasticity (GxE interactions without genetic correlations), seasonal groups of clones showed no shift in TMR and mean temperature reaction norms were similar among groups and both populations. Heritabilities remained similar among temperatures despite a large increase in genetic variance at stressfully high temperatures of 29degreesC and 32degreesC, due to simultaneous increase in environmental variance. Further, heritabilities remained high among sample periods and were not eroded during several months of asexual reproduction.
   Regular diapause, an intrinsic feature of intermittent Daphnia populations, may replace the need for physiological temperature adaptation and promote maintenance of diversity through phenotypic similarity by reducing the time over which competitive interactions occur. Such populations are unlikely to be directly affected by elevated temperatures. They have a large potential for phenotypic plasticity as their TMR is higher than the temperature normally encountered.

AB  - I present a dynamic bioenergetic model that couples individual energetics and population dynamics to predict current lizard ranges and those following climate warming. The model predictions are uniquely based on first principles of morphology, life history, and thermal physiology. I apply the model to five populations of a widespread North American lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, to examine how geographic variation in traits and life histories influences ranges. This geographic variation reflects the potential for species to adapt to environmental change. I then consider the range dynamics of the closely related Sceloporus graciosus. Comparing predicted ranges and actual current ranges reveals how dispersal limitations, species interactions, and habitat requirements influence the occupied portions of thermally suitable ranges. The dynamic model predicts individualistic responses to a uniform 3 degrees C warming but a northward shift in the northern range boundary for all populations and species. In contrast to standard correlative climate envelope models, the extent of the predicted northward shift depends on organism traits and life histories. The results highlight the limitations of correlative models and the need for more dynamic models of species' ranges.

AB  - Energy crops are expected to greatly develop in a very short-term bringing to significant social and environmental benefits. Nevertheless, a significant number of studies report from very positive to negative environmental implications from growing and processing energy crops, thus great uncertainty still remains on this argument. The present study focused on the cradle-to-grave impact assessments of alternative scenarios including annual and perennial energy crops for electricity/heat or first and second generation transport fuels, giving special emphasis to agricultural practices which are frequently surprisingly neglected in Life Cycle Assessment studies despite a not secondary relevance on final outcomes. The results show that cradle-to-farm gate impacts, i.e. including the upstream processes, may account for up to 95% of total impacts, with dominant effects on marine water ecotoxicity. Therefore, by increasing the sustainability of crop management through minimizing agronomic inputs, or with a complementary use of crop resides, can be expected to significantly improve the overall sustainability of bioenergy chains, as well as the competitiveness against fossil counterparts. Once again, perennial crops resulted in substantially higher environmental benefits than annual crops. It is shown that significant amount of emitted CO2 can be avoided through converting arable lands into perennial grasslands. Besides, due to lack of certain data, soil carbon storage was not included in the calculations, while N2O emission was considered as omitted variable bias (1% of N-fertilization). Therefore, especially for perennial grasses, CO2 savings were reasonably higher that those estimated in the present study. For first generation biodiesel, sunflower showed a lower energy-based impacts than rapeseed, while wheat should be preferred over maize for first generation bioethanol given its lower land-based impacts. For second generation biofuels and thermo-chemical energy, switchgrass provided the highest environmental benefits. With regard to bioenergy systems, first generation biodiesel was less impacting than first generation bioethanol; bioelectricity was less impacting than first generation biofuels and second generation bioethanol by thermo-chemical hydrolysis, but highly impacting than Biomass-to-Liquid biodiesel and second generation bioethanol through enzymatic hydrolysis.

AB  - Over the past two decades, numerous ecosystem surveys and process studies have emerged to monitor and assess the large marine ecosystems of Alaska. Several regional collaborative integrated ecosystem research projects (IERPs) were conducted to gain understanding of fish population fluctuations in relation to the surrounding environment. The Gulf of Alaska (GOA) IERP is one example of such an effort. Products of this program include a suite of in situ observations from fully integrated ecosystem surveys, laboratory experiments of physical thresholds for fish condition, and high-resolution oceanographic, planktonic, and habitat distribution models. When coupled, the synthesis products of this program can be utilized to understand system connectivity and highlight the primary ecosystem drivers of the GOA. Much of this information was included in annual GOA ecosystem status reports through individual indicator contributions. However, assimilation of these data into single-species stock assessments has remained limited. We provide a clear and direct avenue for including the products of these IERPs through the new ecosystem and socioeconomic profile (ESP) framework that identifies mechanistic relationships and tests ecosystem linkages within the stock assessment process. We present a case study using a data synthesis of the five commercially and ecologically valuable focal species of the GOAIERP (sablefish, pollock, Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, and Pacific ocean perch). Information was organized along the categories of distribution, phenology, and condition by life history stage to develop life history narratives for each species. These narratives identified critical ecosystem processes that could impact survival of each species. We then used habitat distribution models, seasonal phenology, and energy allocation strategies to sequentially reduce two gridded temperature datasets to reflect the life experience of the stock. This method essentially aligns ecosystem information at a spatial and temporal scale relevant to a stock and creates informed indicators that could then be related to a stock assessment parameter of interest, such as recruitment. Informed temperature indicators differed in magnitude and variability when compared to non-informed indicators and demonstrating species and stage-specific thermal preferences. The difference between the informed indicators and the non informed indicators can also highlight thresholds and trends in habitat preference that could be further investigated with targeted process studies or laboratory experiments. The coordinated nature of the IERP allowed for the creation of these informed indicators that would not be possible with the results of any one process study. Both the stock-specific narratives and the informed indicators can be included into the ESPs for further monitoring and development. This integration ensures that the identified ecosystem linkages are evaluated concurrently with the stock assessment and ultimately transferred to fishery managers in an efficient and effective format for informing management decisions.

AB  - The longevity of adult codling moth (Cydia pomonella (L.) Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and obliquebanded leafroller (Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris) Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) held in shaded vials in the tree canopy was measured during the normal flight periods during 2004 and 2005. In both years all codling moths were dead by 130 degree-days (DD) (21 d) in the spring and 121 DD (8 d) in the summer. On a degree-day basis, data were similar across sex, generation, and year, and a common curve adequately predicted the survival distribution. For the obliquebanded leafroller, there were longevity differences between the sexes, but not between generations or years. Use of empirical quantile-quantile plots showed that the female obliquebanded leafroller lived an average of 32% longer than males. Maximum longevity observed in these studies for obliquebanded leafrollers was 117 DD (11 d) across both generations. The implications of these data for population biology studies and quarantine requirements are discussed.

AB  - The ability to deal with temperature-induced changes in interactions with contaminants and predators under global warming is one of the outstanding, applied evolutionary questions. For this, it is crucial to understand how contaminants will affect activity levels, predator avoidance and antipredator responses under global warming and to what extent gradual thermal evolution may mitigate these effects. Using a space-for-time substitution approach, we assessed the potential for gradual thermal evolution shaping activity (mobility and foraging), predator avoidance and antipredator responses when Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae were exposed to zinc in a common-garden warming experiment at the mean summer water temperatures of shallow water bodies at southern and northern latitudes (24 and 20 degrees C, respectively). Zinc reduced mobility and foraging, predator avoidance and escape swimming speed. Importantly, high-latitude populations showed stronger zinc-induced reductions in escape swimming speed at both temperatures, and in activity levels at the high temperature. The latter indicates that local thermal adaptation may strongly change the ecological impact of contaminants under global warming. Our study underscores the critical importance of considering local adaptation along natural gradients when integrating biotic interactions in ecological risk assessment, and the potential of gradual thermal evolution mitigating the effects of warming on the vulnerability to contaminants.

AB  - Ocean warming and acidification (OA) may alter the fitness of species in marine pelagic ecosystems through community effects or direct physiological impacts. We used the zooplanktonic appendicularian, Oikopleura dioica, to assess temperature and pH effects at mesocosm and microcosm scales. In mesocosms, both OA and warming positively impacted O. dioica abundance over successive generations. In microcosms, the positive impact of OA, was observed to result from increased fecundity. In contrast, increased pH, observed for example during phytoplankton blooms, reduced fecundity. Oocyte fertility and juvenile development were equivalent under all pH conditions, indicating that the positive effect of lower pH on O. dioica abundance was principally due to increased egg number. This effect was influenced by food quantity and quality, supporting possible improved digestion and assimilation at lowered pH. Higher temperature resulted in more rapid growth, faster maturation and earlier reproduction. Thus, increased temperature and reduced pH had significant positive impacts on O. dioica fitness through increased fecundity and shortened generation time, suggesting that predicted future ocean conditions may favour this zooplankton species.

AB  - We expect the structure and functioning of marine ecosystems to change over this century in response to changes in key ocean variables associated with a changing climate. Organisms with generation times from years to decades have the capacity to adapt to changing environmental conditions over a few generations by selecting from existing genotypes/phenotypes, but it is unlikely that evolution through mutation will be a major factor for organisms with generation times of years to decades. However, phytoplankton and other microbes, with generation times of days or less, experience hundreds of generations each year, allowing the possibility for favorable mutations (i.e., those that produce organisms with fitness maxima nearer to the environmental conditions at that time) to dominate existing genotypes and survive in a changing climate. Several laboratories have grown phytoplankton cultures for hundreds to thousands of generations and demonstrated that they have changed genetic makeup. In particular Schluter et al. (2014) grew replicates derived from a single cell of Emiliania huxleyi, a coccolithophorid with broad geographical and thermal range, for 3 years (similar to 1250 generations) at 15 degrees C, and then for a year at 26.3 degrees C, near their upper thermal limit. During the last year the intrinsic growth rate increased more or less linearly, which the authors attribute to genetic mutation. Here we simulate genetic mutation of a single trait (intrinsic growth rate), both for the control phase and the warm phase of their study. We consider sensitivities to frequency of mutation, changes with temperature in intrinsic growth rate, and use the experimental setup and results to place constraints on the way mutations occur. In particular, all numerical experiments with mutation result in a lag time similar to 30-140 generations before a significant increase in realized growth rate occurs. This lag after a favorable mutation results from the number of generations required for a single favorable mutant cell to reach a significant fraction of the similar to 10(5 )cells in the culture. A numerical experiment that includes a simple plastic response formulation shows that plasticity could remove this lag and yield results more in agreement with those observed in the laboratory study.

AB  - Precocious pubertal development has been observed among girls in single parent families and among girls exposed to family conflict. One explanation for their precocious puberty is that it is evolutionarily adaptive (called here the "life history theory" view). Another explanation is that mothers simply pass on genes for precocious puberty. Thus, family environmental circumstances are not causally determinative of rates of pubertal development. The evidence for these two views was evaluated using the genetically-informative sibling pairs from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Both menarcheal age and pubertal timing were heritable (h(2) = .44 and .40, respectively), with negligible shared environmental variation. However, in White girls, greater parental warmth delayed puberty, as did living in two parent families. A test of genetic influences underlying the correlation of warmth and pubertal timing was negative, however. Although some of these findings were inconsistent with the evolutionary life history theory, they did not disprove it decisively.

AB  - Insecticide resistance is inevitable if an insecticide is widely used to control insect pests. Fortunately, the resistance-associated fitness costs often give chances to manage resistances. In most cases, the fitness cost in resistant insects is often evaluated under laboratory conditions for insect development, which limits its practical application in pest control in the field. In a laboratory population R9 with 253-fold resistance to chlorpyrifos after nine-generation selection with chlorpyrifos, the relative fitness was only 0.206 under laboratory conditions (25 degrees C, humidity 70%-80% and 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod), when compared to S9, a susceptible counterpart (resistance ratio = 2.25-fold) from the same origin as R9 but without any selection with insecticides. Temperatures varied the resistance-associated fitness costs, with enhanced costs at high temperatures and reduced costs at low temperatures, such as 0.174 at 32 degrees C and 0.527 at 18 degrees C. The copulation rate and fecundity were two key factors for the reduced costs at low temperatures. Another finding was that R9 individuals needed much more time to recover from heat shock than that of S9, but R9 and S9 individuals were similarly sensitive to cold shock. The low fitness cost at low temperatures would increase the overwintering population, which might further increase risks of rapid development and widespread distribution of chlorpyrifos resistance in Nilaparvata lugens.

We used experimental evolution to test whether this display trait is maintained through adaptive female selection because it indicates heritable male quality for thermal stress tolerance. We used non-displaying, outbred populations of D. melanogaster (nub 1) mutants and measured their rate of adaptation to a new, thermally stressful environment, relative to wild-type control populations that retained courtship song. This design retains sexually selected conflict in both treatments. Thermal stress should select across genomes for newly beneficial alleles, increasing the available genetic and phenotypic variation and, therefore, the magnitude of female benefit derived from courtship song. Following introduction to the thermally stressful environment, net reproductive rate decreased 50% over four generations, and then increased 19% over the following 16 generations. There were no differences between the treatments. Possible explanations for these results are discussed.

AB  - Understanding how environmental stress alters the consequences of hybridization is important, because the rate of hybridization and the likelihood of hybrid speciation both appear elevated in harsh, disturbed or marginal habitats. We assessed fitness, morphometrics and molecular genetic composition over 14 generations of hybridization between two highly divergent populations of the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus. Replicated, experimental hybrid populations in both control and high-salinity conditions showed a decline in fitness, followed by a recovery. Recovery was faster in the salinity stress treatment, returning to parental levels up to two generations earlier than in the control. This recovery was stable in the high-salinity treatment, whereas in the control treatment, fitness dropped back below parental levels at the final time point. Recovery in the high-salinity treatment was also stronger in terms of competitive fitness and heat-shock tolerance. Finally, consequences of hybridization were more repeatable under salinity stress, where among-replicate variance for survivorship and molecular genetic composition was lower than in the control treatment. In a system with low effective population sizes (estimates ranged from 17 to 63), where genetic drift might be expected to be the predominate force, strong selection under harsh environmental conditions apparently promoted faster, stronger and more repeatable recovery from depressed hybrid fitness.

AB  - Increases in phenotypic variation under extreme (e.g. novel or stressful) environmental conditions are emerging as a crucial process through which evolutionary adaptation can occur. Lack of prior stabilizing selection, as well as potential instability of developmental processes in these environments, may lead to a release of phenotypic variation that can have important evolutionary consequences. Although such patterns have been shown in model study organisms, we know little about the generality of trait variance across environments for non-model organisms. Here, we test whether extreme developmental temperatures increase the phenotypic variation across diverse reptile taxa. We find that the among-individual variation in a key life-history trait (post-hatching growth) increases at extreme cold and hot temperatures. However, variations in two measures of hatchling morphology and in hatchling performance were not related to developmental temperature. Although extreme developmental temperatures may increase the variation in growth, our results suggest that plastic responses to stressful incubation conditions do not generally make more extreme phenotypes available to selection. We discuss the reasons for the general lack of increased variability at extreme incubation temperatures and the implications this has for local adaptation in hatchling morphology and physiology.

AB  - Experimental evolution has provided novel insight into a wide array of biological processes. Species in the genus Tetrahymena are proving to be a highly useful system for studying a range of questions using experimental evolution. Their unusual genomic architecture, diversity of life history traits, importance as both predator and prey, and amenability to laboratory culture allow them to be studied in a variety of contexts. In this paper, we review what we are learning from experimental evolution with Tetrahymena about mutation, adaptation, and eco-evolutionary dynamics. We predict that future experimental evolution studies using Tetrahyemena will continue to shed new light on these processes.

AB  - Life history theory attempts to account for how organisms lead their lives, balancing the conflicting demands of reproduction and survival. Here, we track the genomic and phenotypic evolution of the bacteriophage virus T7 across a postulated fecundity/longevity constraint. We adapted T7 to a challenging survival environment (6M urea). Our evolved strain displayed a significant improvement in propagule survival, coupled with a significant loss of fecundity (reduced growth rate on host cells). However, the increased resistance to urea did not generalise to increased resistance against temperature stress, highlighting that propagule durability is environment dependent. Previous comparative studies predicted that changes in propagule resistance would be mediated by changes in capsid proteins or gene deletions. In contrast, we found that point mutations in internal core protein genes (6.7 and 16) were responsible for the increased urea resistance of our evolved strain. Prior to the emergence of the 6.7 and 16 mutations, a distinct set of 5-point mutations peaked at over 20% prevalence before attenuating, suggestive of negative epistatic interactions during adaptation. Our results illustrate that parasites can adapt to specific transmission environments, and that this adaptation can impose costs on the subsequent ability to exploit host cells, potentially constraining durable parasites to lower virulence.

AB  - Understanding whether populations can adapt to new environmental conditions is a major issue in conservation and evolutionary biology. Aquatic organisms are increasingly exposed to environmental changes linked with human activities in river catchments. For instance, the clogging of bottom substratum by fine sediments is observed in many rivers and usually leads to a decrease in dissolved oxygen concentrations in gravel beds. Such hypoxic stress can alter the development and even be lethal for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) embryos that spend their early life into gravel beds. In this study, we used a common garden experiment to compare the responses to hypoxic stress of four genetically differentiated and environmentally contrasted populations. We used factorial crossing designs to measure additive genetic variation of early life-history traits in each population. Embryos were reared under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and we measured their survival, incubation time and length at the end of embryonic development. Under hypoxic conditions, embryos had a lower survival and hatched later than in normoxic conditions. We found different hypoxia reaction norms among populations, but almost no population effect in both treatments. We also detected significant sire x treatment interactions in most populations and a tendency for heritability values to be lower under stressful conditions. Overall, these results reveal a high degree of phenotypic plasticity in salmon populations that nevertheless differ in their adaptive potential to hypoxia given the distinct reaction norms observed between and within populations.

AB  - Direct selection for increased resistance to a heat shock (41.9 degrees for 90 min) was carried out using two replicate lines of Drosophila buzzatii that were derived from a large base population. Selected individuals were first acclimated to high temperature before selection, while control individuals were acclimated but not selected, and selection was performed every second generation. Resistance to heat shock with acclimation increased in selected lines. Without acclimation, a correlated smaller increase in heat-shock resistance was suggested. Survival of males was higher than that of females in all lines when tested with acclimation, but with direct exposure to high temperatures, survival of females was greater than that of males both in selection and control lines but not in the base population. From analysis of reciprocal cross progeny between lines, one selection line was found to possess a dominant autosomal factor that significantly increased resistance of males much more than resistance of females. Also suggestive was recessive traits on the X chromosome in both selection lines that increased thermotolerance. No cytoplasmic effects were found. After accounting for other effects, survival of F-1 flies was intermediate, suggesting that additive variation is present for one or more of the autosomes.

AB  - We investigate, numerically and experimentally, the effect of thermo-optical (TO) chaos on soliton generation dynamics in microresonators. Numerical simulations that include the thermal dynamics show that the generated solitons can either survive or annihilate when the pump laser is scanned from blue to red and then stop at a fixed wavelength; the outcome is stochastic and is strongly related to the number of solitons generated. The random fluctuations of the cavity resonance occurring under TO chaos are also found to trigger delayed spontaneous soliton generation after the laser scan ends, which could enable soliton excitation with slow laser tuning speed. Stochastic soliton annihilation/survival, as well as delayed spontaneous soliton generation, is observed experimentally in a siliconnitride microresonator. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

AB  - Cold storage of parasitoids to be used in biological control programs is desirable but risky for the performance of the stored parental generation as well as for its offspring. We studied the performance of cold stored and unstored parasitoids after release at different temperature regimes in the laboratory at the level of two subsequent generations in Hyssopus pallidus (Askew) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae). This gregarious ectoparasitoid is a candidate biocontrol agent of Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) and Cydia molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) larvae, two fruit pests of high economic significance in apple cultivation. Cold storage for 14 days at 4 degrees C imposed to the pupal stage of the parasitoid did not reduce the parasitism capacity of the parental generation, nor did it alter the female biased sex ratio of the progeny. Remarkably, this short-term storage of the parental generation exhibited a significant and consistently positive effect on offspring weight throughout all ambient temperature regimes, resulting in an increased offspring weight. Furthermore, offspring number was only reduced after release at low ambient temperatures, but not at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Irrespective of whether the parasitoids originated from the stored or unstored group, highest parasitism rate was achieved at temperatures above 20 degrees C. In conclusion, this candidate biocontrol agent can be cold stored for short periods without any measurable quality loss after release at most except at low ambient temperatures. Our findings suggest that H. pallidus is a thermophilous parasitoid that will perform best when applied at warm ambient temperatures in fruit orchards.

AB  - People seek reliable natural resources despite climate change. Diverse habitats and biologies stabilize productivity against disturbances like climate, prompting arguments to promote climate-resilient resources by prioritizing complex, less-modified ecosystems. These arguments hinge on the hypothesis that simplifying and degrading ecosystems will reduce resources' climate resilience, a process liable to be cryptically evolving across landscapes and human generations, but rarely documented. Here, we examined the industrial era (post 1848) of California's Central Valley, chronicling the decline of a diversified, functional portfolio of salmon habitats and life histories and investigating for empirical evidence of lost climate resilience in its fishery. Present perspectives indicate that California's dynamic, warming climate overlaid onto its truncated, degraded habitat mosaic severely constrains its salmon fishery. We indeed found substantial climate constraints on today's fishery, but this reflected a shifted ecological baseline. During the early stages of a stressor legacy that transformed the landscape and -- often consequently -- compressed salmon life history expression, the fishery diffused impacts of dry years across a greater number of fishing years and depended less on cool spring-summer transitions. The latter are important given today's salmon habitats, salmon life histories, and resource management practices, but are vanishing with climate change while year-to-year variation in fishery performance is rising. These findings give empirical weight to the idea that human legacies influence ecosystems' climate resilience across landscapes and boundaries (e.g., land/sea). They also raise the question of whether some contemporary climate effects are recent and attributable not only to increasing climate stress, but to past and present human actions that erode resilience. In general, it is thus worth considering that management approaches that prioritize complex, less-modified ecosystems may stabilize productivity despite increasing climate stress and such protective actions may be required for some ecological services to persist into uncertain climate futures.

AB  - Context: Water treatment as an industrial process requires energy for its operation, so, in order to supply the electrical energy that requires the heating of the room in which the dosing process of chemical products is performed, the exploration of alternative energies was proposed through the determination of the environmental and financial viability of a heating system, which uses the heat of the thermal water from the Nevado del Ruiz volcano that reaches the Luis Prieto Gomez Plant.
   Method: A mixed type research was conducted by means of a field study to characterize the context of its use, a specialized advice to determine the heating system, and a bibliographic review to perform the financial analysis by cash flow, the environmental analysis by carbon footprint, and the sustainability of the proposal.
   Results: The context of the heat use was determined, and the thermal load required inside the room was characterized. Based on this characterization, it was established that a circuit system of tubular heat exchangers generated operational viability with an economic saving projection of 78 %, in comparison with a conventional system and a reduction of environmental impacts represented by a decrease of 3,25 annual tons of CO 2 emitted into the atmosphere.
   Conclusions: The incorporation of energy sustainability for the generation of operating conditions for water treatment was achieved, starting from the conception of the use of thermal water as a renewable resource, together with the production of heat through a closed lifecycle, thus demonstrating a dialogue between the economic, environmental, and social spheres as required by sustainable development.

AB  - Acclimation to a particular environment may provide organisms with advantages in that environment. In species with multiple generations per year, acclimation may cause life-history traits to vary with season and between generations. We investigated flight performance, lifetime egg production, and longevity in relation to the temperature experienced during development and adulthood in the invasive moth pest Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). We found that females that developed at low temperature had good flight abilities when they were flown at low, intermediate, and high temperatures. At high temperature, females that developed at high temperature did not outperform females that developed at low temperature. Flight performance was generally poor at low ambient temperature. Our findings suggest a beneficial acclimation effect, occurring at low temperature. Nonetheless, there were potential costs of development at low temperature: development took longer, resulting in smaller females, which laid fewer eggs. Given temporal and spatial temperature variability in the field, dispersal potential should not be considered homogeneous within populations or across generations. Our results suggest that the most favourable time periods for female dispersal are at the beginning and towards the end of the host crop growing season, which has potential implications for monitoring the occurrence and range expansion of this invasive pest species.

AB  - We determined the thermal biology of the oviparous Liolaemus boulengeri and the viviparous Liolaemus lineomaculatus populations localised at high and low latitude sites in Patagonia, Argentina. We present data of body temperatures in the field (T-b) and preferred temperature in the laboratory (T-pref), micro-environmental and operative temperatures and the effectiveness of thermoregulation. Liolaemus boulengeri and L. lineomaculatus choose different heat sources for active selection of suitable thermal micro-environments for thermoregulation, and the oviparous L. boulengeri is a more effective thermoregulator (E=0.55) than the viviparous L. lineomaculatus (E=0.43). Even when L. boulengeri is a better thermoregulator and both species show identical timing in the reproductive cycles, there are constraint factors that impose limitations on the southernmost distribution of the oviparous L. boulengeri.

AB  - Agent-based, spatially-explicit models that incorporate movement rules are used across ecological disciplines for a variety of applications. However, appropriate movement rules may be difficult to implement due to the complexity of an individual's response to both proximate and ultimate cues, as well as the difficulty in directly assessing how organisms choose to move across their environment. Environmental cues may be complex and dynamic, and therefore, movement responses may require tradeoffs between preferred levels of different environmental variables (e.g., temperature, light level, and prey availability). Here, we present an approach to determine appropriate movement rules by setting them as heritable traits in an eco-genetic modeling framework and allowing movement rules to evolve during the model rather than setting them a priori. We modeled yellow perch, Perca flavescens, movement in a simulated environment and allowed perch to move in response to high-resolution vertical gradients in temperature, dissolved oxygen, light, predators, and prey. Evolving movement rules ultimately increased fish growth and survival over generations in our model, indicating that evolving movement rules led to improved individual performance. We found that emergent movement rules were consistent across trials, with evolved movement rules incorporating different weights of these environmental factors and the most rapid selection on temperature preference. This case study presents a flexible method using ecogenetic modeling to determine appropriate movement rules that can be applied to diverse scenarios in spatially-explicit ecological modeling.

AB  - We explore the effects of probabilistic RNA partitioning during cell division on the normalized variance of RNA numbers across generations of bacterial populations. We first characterize these effects in model cell populations, where gene expression is modeled as a delayed stochastic process, as a function of the synchrony in cell division, the rate of division, and the RNA degradation rate. We further explore the additional variance that arises if the partitioning is biased. Next, in Escherichia coli cells expressing RNA tagged with MS2d-GFP, we measured the normalized variance of RNA numbers across several generations, with cell divisions synchronized by heat shock. We show that synchronized cell populations exhibit transient increases in normalized variance following cell divisions, as predicted by the model, which are not observed in unsynchronized populations. We conclude that errors in partitioning of RNA molecules generate diversity between the offspring of individual bacteria and thus constitute a form of reproductive bet-hedging.

AB  - A new multiobjective simulated annealing algorithm for continuous optimization problems is presented. The algorithm has an adaptive cooling schedule and uses a population of fitness functions to accurately generate the Pareto front. Whenever an improvement with a fitness function is encountered, the trial point is accepted, and the temperature parameters associated with the improving fitness functions are cooled. Beside well known linear fitness functions, special elliptic and ellipsoidal fitness functions, suitable for the generation on non-convex fronts, are presented. The effectiveness of the algorithm is shown through five test problems. The parametric study presented shows that more fitness functions as well as more iteration gives more non-dominated points closer to the actual front. The study also compares the linear and elliptic fitness functions. The success of the algorithm is also demonstrated by comparing the quality metrics obtained to those obtained for a well-known evolutionary multiobjective algorithm.

AB  - Background: Beneficial mutations play an essential role in bacterial adaptation, yet little is known about their fitness effects across genetic backgrounds and environments. One prominent example of bacterial adaptation is antibiotic resistance. Until recently, the paradigm has been that antibiotic resistance is selected by the presence of antibiotics because resistant mutations confer fitness costs in antibiotic free environments. In this study we show that it is not always the case, documenting the selection and fixation of resistant mutations in populations of Escherichia coli B that had never been exposed to antibiotics but instead evolved for 2000 generations at high temperature (42.2 degrees C).
   Results: We found parallel mutations within the rpoB gene encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. These amino acid substitutions conferred different levels of rifampicin resistance. The resistant mutations typically appeared, and were fixed, early in the evolution experiment. We confirmed the high advantage of these mutations at 42.2 degrees C in glucose-limited medium. However, the rpoB mutations had different fitness effects across three genetic backgrounds and six environments.
   Conclusions: We describe resistance mutations that are not necessarily costly in the absence of antibiotics or compensatory mutations but are highly beneficial at high temperature and low glucose. Their fitness effects depend on the environment and the genetic background, providing glimpses into the prevalence of epistasis and pleiotropy.

AB  - Accumulating evidence has indicated that many fish populations are responding to climate change through shifts in migration time, but genetic data identifying the role of evolution in these shifts are rare. One of the first demonstrations of evolution of migration time was produced by monitoring allozyme alleles that were experimentally manipulated to genetically mark late- migrating pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). Here, we extend that research by using observations of the marker alleles in fry to demonstrate that these changes in migration time were caused by directional selection against the late- migrating phenotype during the oceanic phase of the salmonid life cycle. The selective event, which appeared to be driven by early vernal warming of the nearshore marine environment and consequent decreased survival of late- migrating fry relative to early-migrating fry, decreased the late-migrating phenotype from more than 50% to approximately 10% of the total fry abundance in only one generation. These demographic changes have persisted over the subsequent 13 generations and suggest that a larger trend toward earlier migration time in this population may reflect adaptation to warming sea-surface temperatures.

AB  - The aquatic ecotoxic profile of the fungicide pyrimethanil and its acute and chronic thermal dependence in two aquatic invertebrates Chironomus riparius and Daphnia magna were investigated. The ecotoxicity of pyrimethanil at optimal thermal conditions did not depend on the trophic level, but was species-specific. The acute pyrimethanil-toxicity on C. riparius increased with higher temperature. The chronic response of Daphnia magna to the NOEC of the fungicide was examined in a multigenerational experiment under three near-natural temperature regimes. A pyrimethanil-induced increase of total mortality was buffered by the strongly related increase of the general reproductive capacity, while population growth was stronger influenced by temperature than by the fungicide. At a LOEC, however, a second generation could not be established with D. magna at all thermal regimes. This clearly shows that thermal and multigenerational effects should be considered when appraising the ecotoxicity of pesticides and assessing their future risk for the environment.

AB  - Negative genetic correlation between performance at different temperatures or temperature-dependent mutations may promote evolution of thermal specialization in ectotherms. The first hypothesis implies that a selective change in performance at one temperature simultaneously results in change in performance at others, while the second implies a delay before observing such indirect responses. Comparison of the direction of evolution among Trichogramma lines selected for improvement of parasitization capacity at low, medium, or high temperatures indicated that a change in performance at one temperature concurrently resulted in opposite changes at distant temperatures. Unexpectedly, selection at high temperatures resulted in a decrease in adult fitness components, while adult performance expressed at cold temperatures simultaneously increased. The relationship between maternal fecundity and offspring fitness components varied across the thermal range. No correlation between these traits was present at cold or medium temperatures, but negative relationships appeared at high temperatures. We show that maternal selection resulting from a conflict between adult and offspring fitness components may have resulted in reversed evolution of the adult traits at the high end of the thermal range. Thus, genetic trade-offs in performance at different temperatures and phenotypic plasticity in maternal selection may constrain evolution of the thermal niche in Trichogramma.

AB  - Background: As ectothermic animals, temperature influences insects in almost every aspect. The potential disease spreading Asian bush mosquito (Aedes japonicus japonicus) is native to temperate East Asia but invasive in several parts of the world. We report on the previously poorly understood temperature-dependence of its life history under laboratory conditions to understand invasion processes and to model temperature niches.
   Results: To evaluate winter survival, eggs were exposed between 1 day and 14 days to low temperatures (5 degrees C, 0 degrees C, -5 degrees C and -9 degrees C). Hatching success was drastically decreased after exposure to 0 degrees C and -5 degrees C, and the minimal hatching success of 0% was reached at -9 degrees C after two days. We then exposed larvae to 14 temperatures and assessed their life trait parameters. Larval survival to adulthood was only possible between 10 degrees C and 31 degrees C. Based on this, we modelled the optimal (25 degrees C), minimal (7 degrees C) and maximal (31 degrees C) temperature for cumulative female survival. The time to adult emergence ranges from 12 days to 58 days depending on temperature. We used an age-at-emergence-temperature model to calculate the number of potential generations per year for the Asian bush mosquito in Germany with an average of 4.72 potential generations. At lower temperatures, individuals grew larger than at higher temperatures with female R1 length ranging from 3.04 +/- 0.1 mm at 31 degrees C to 4.26 +/- 0.2 mm at 15 degrees C.
   Conclusions: Reduced egg hatch after exposure to sub-zero temperatures prohibits the establishment of the Asian bush mosquito in large parts of Germany. Larval overwintering is not possible at temperature <= 5 degrees C. The many potential generations displayed per year may contribute to the species' invasion success. This study on the thermal ecology of the Asian bush mosquito adds to our knowledge on the temperature dependence of the species and data could be incorporated in epidemiological and population dynamic modelling.

AB  - The control of the solidification process of energetic materials is important to prevent manufacturing defects in high explosive ammunitions. The present work aims to propose an optimisation procedure to determine the value of the model parameter, avoiding the traditional trial and error approach. In this work, the solidification of TNT has been numerically modelled employing apparent heat capacity method and the model parameter was optimised using genetic algorithm. One dimensional numerical model has been solved in Comsol Multiphysics Modeling Software and the genetic algorithm code was written in Matlab. The Neumann's analytical solution of the solidification front was used as a reference to build the fitness function, following the inverse problems concepts. The optimum model parameter has been predicted after 20 generations and among 30 candidate solutions for each generation. The numerical solution performed with the optimised model parameter has agreed with the analytical solution, indicating the feasibility of the proposed procedure. The discrepancy was 3.8 per cent when maximum difference between analytical and numerical solutions was observed.

AB  - Artificially selected lines are widely used to investigate the genetic basis of quantitative traits and make inferences about evolutionary trajectories. Yet, the relevance of selected traits to field fitness is rarely tested. Here, we assess the relevance of thermal stress resistance artificially selected in the laboratory to one component of field fitness by investigating the likelihood of adult Drosophila melanogaster reaching food bait under different temperatures. Lines resistant to heat reached the bait more often than controls under hot and cold conditions, but less often at intermediate temperatures, suggesting a fitness cost of increased heat resistance but not at temperature extremes. Cold-resistant lines were more common at baits than controls under cold as well as hot field conditions, and there was no cost at intermediate temperatures. One of the replicate heat-resistant lines was caught less often than the others under hot conditions. Direct and correlated patterns of responses in laboratory tests did not fully predict the low performance of the heat selected lines at intermediate temperatures, nor the high performance of the cold selected lines under hot conditions. Therefore, lines selected artificially not only behaved partly as expected based on laboratory assays but also evolved patterns only evident in the field releases.

AB  - The utilization of renewable biomass and the conversion of renewable energy are promising strategies for providing clean energy and meeting energy needs. In this work, a ternary phase change material gels (PCMGs) composed of octadecanol (OD), styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) and hydroxylated carbon nanotubes (HCNTs) are proposed to realize the biomass utilization and solar energy harvesting. As a kind of biomass, OD possesses the characteristics of high phase change latent heat, low cost, renewability, environmental friendliness and biosafety. SEBS provides the crosslinked network to load the OD and introduce the free-standing feature. The HCNTs can realize the highly-efficient solar harvesting through the solar-thermal conversion. The Van der Waals force between SEBS and OD, the 7C -7C interaction between SEBS and HCNTs and the hydrogen bond between OD and HCNTs enable the excellent form-stability. Taking advantages of the synergistic effect of the functional components, the proposed biomass-based PCMGs demonstrate high thermal energy storage capacity of 183.04 Jg(-1), high solar absorbance of 95.68%, high cost-effectiveness of 3.92 x 10-5$J(-1) and high cell viability of 117.9%. The biomass-based PCMGs are effectively applied in the thermoelectric power generation and personal thermal management. This work creates a state-of-the-art alternative for the next-generation solar-thermal materials devices.

AB  - Environmental temperature is a key driver of variation in developmental physiological rates in reptiles. Cooler temperatures extend development time and can increase the amount of energy required to achieve hatching success, which can pose fitness consequences later in life. Yet, for locally-adapted populations, genetic variation can oppose environmental variation across ecological gradients, known as countergradient variation (CnGV). Biologists often seek to understand the presence of phenotypic variation, yet the absence of such variation across environmental gradients can also reveal insights into the mechanisms underlying local adaptation. While evidence for genetic variation opposing environmental variation in physiological rates has been summarized in other taxa, the generality of CnGV variation in reptiles is yet unknown. Here I present a summary of studies measuring development time and metabolic rates in locally-adapted populations across thermal clines for 15 species of reptiles across 8 families. CnGV in development time is found to be common, while no clear pattern emerges for the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rates across locally-adapted populations. CnGV in development time may be an adaptive response in order to decrease the costly development in cool climates, however, empirical work is needed to disentangle plastic from genetic responses, and to uncover potentially general mechanisms of local thermal adaptation in reptiles.

AB  - Population dynamics and production of the egg-carrying calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus marinus were studied for a year in Fukuyama Harbor, a eutrophic inlet of the Inland Sea of Japan. This species was perennial, with a large numerical peak in June and small peaks in September/October and November/December. During the study period, at least 11 generations could be detected. For each generation, the stage-specific survival from egg to Copepodite Stage (C) V was determined; it was very high during early life stages (egg to NIII), and gradually decreased beyond. On average, 94% of eggs recruited into NIII, which is strongly contrasted with very high (>ca. 90%) mortality during the corresponding stages for free-spawning copepods, i.e. Acastia omorii, Centropages abdominalis and Paracalans sp. This demonstrates that the egg-carrying strategy has a great advantage to reduce mortality in egg stage. The biomass of this species showed marked seasonal variations largely in parallel with numerical abundance. The instantaneous somatic growth rate increased linearly with temperature. The population production rate was estimated as the sum of somatic growth of larval stages and egg production of adult females; the annual integration was 51.0 mg C m(-3) yr(-1) or 0.38 g C m(-2) yr(-1).

AB  - We analyzed variation in phenotypic plasticity of life history traits between two Cardamine flexuosa populations based on differences in plasticity of age and size at maturity. C. flexuosa (Cruciferae) is a facultative, vernalization-sensitive, long-day annual, and its phenology and the phenotypic expressions of many life history traits are largely controlled by photoperiod and vernalization in natural populations. We used plants from two populations which differed in their responses to chilling and photoperiod treatments. The timing of developmental processes was changed by controlling temperature and photoperiod regimes in growth chambers. Plasticity in size at maturity was analyzed as changes in a growth trajectory using two parameters, age at maturity (Delta t) and growth rate (k). Both traits showed plasticity, but differences between the populations were found mostly for Delta t. Distinctive differences in size at maturity of individuals in the two populations were mainly due to different amounts of plasticity in Delta t. Variations in plasticity of nine other life history traits and their associations to age and size at maturity were also analyzed. Variation for eight of the traits can be described, at least in part, as a function of age and size at maturity for both populations, and most of the variation in the total number of seeds was explained by age and size at maturity. Only age at maturity had any effect on changes in resource allocation. The nine life history traits were integrated through associated character expressions with age and size at maturity. Changes in the association between a trait and age and/or size at maturity were rather conservative compared to changes in the plasticity of a trait between the two populations. Associations with age and size at maturity are mostly explicable in terms of inherent relationships in the developmental processes, and they may limit the ecological range expansion and the adaptive evolution of plasticity in C. flexuosa. The negative correlation between reproductive allocation and age at maturity can be a cost of delaying maturation in C. flexuosa.

AB  - Reproductive traits of the land snail Helix aspersa Muller were investigated under artificial conditions from two samples, one collected from a population exposed to unpredictable human pressures in its natural environment, i.e. a recently created polder area with intensive agriculture, and the other from a snail farm in which animals were reared under constant conditions defined as 'optimal' for growth and reproduction. Results were compared with data collected from natural populations of the same region (Brittany) and from habitats spanning the environmental heterogeneity of the range of the species. A large part of the variation among populations could be explained by different phenotypic covariances between shell size, clutch size and egg size, but not by the number of clutches per snail. Thus, the higher egg production of snails from the polders was related to (i) a strong correlation between clutch size and shell size, shell size being in the upper limit of the overall range for the region concerned; (ii) an uncommonly low egg weight in comparison with the 'norm' of Helix aspersa, this trait seeming to be involved in a trade-off with clutch size. Second clutches were smaller than the first ones, but their eggs were significantly heavier. This difference may be linked to a size-dependent mortality of juveniles during winter which arises in all populations in which hibernation occurs as an adaptation to low temperatures. In addition to the selective regime usually involved for populations of helicid snails from Western Europe, several unpredictable mortality factors occurred in the polders area: herbicide and pesticide treatments (lethal for young snails), human predation (lethal for adults) and burning (lethal for all snails). Life-history patterns of Helix aspersa are discussed in relation to its ability to successfully colonize a large range of habitats modified by humans, to such an extent that it can become a pest.

AB  - Clethra alnifolia L., a native deciduous shrub cultivated as an ornamental, was recently hybridized with C. pringlei S. Wats. The purpose of this hybridization was to combine the cold hardiness and adaptability of C. alnifolia with the ornamental foliage of C. pringlei. While most of the C. alnifolia x C. pringlei hybrids more closely resembled C. alnifolia than the paternal species, a 'Hokie Pink' x C. pringlei hybrid (NA71586) with foliage that flushes red like C. pringlei was recovered. The objectives of this study were to analyze cytologically the F-1 and produce a F-2 population from NA71586. Chromosome counts from root tips cells indicated that NA71586 has 32 chromosomes. Since the chromosome number of C. alnifolia is 2n = 32 and that of C. pringlei was found to be 2n = 169 NA71586 appears to have developed following fertilization of a C. alnifolia egg with an unreduced male gamete from C. pringlei. Both 'Hokie Pink' and C. pringlei exhibited primarily bivalent pairing in pollen mother cells (PMCs). Over half of the PMCs from NA71586 contained 16 bivalents, indicating substantial homology within the C. alnifolia genome. It was theorized that C. alnifolia is either an autotetraploid that exhibits bivalent pairing or a segmental allotetraploid produced from hybridization of species with similar genomes. More than 700 F-2 progeny were obtained from self-pollination of NA71586. Although many of the F-2 progeny resembled NA71586, variation in foliage color, size and shape was apparent in the population.

AB  - Forecasts of rapid climate change raise the question how quickly species can evolutionarily adapt to future climates. The adaptability of forest trees to environmental changes is generally promoted by high levels of genetic diversity and gene flow, but it can also be slowed down by long generation times and low mortality of established trees. Here, we investigate the adaptation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Silver birch (Betula pendula) to climate change induced prolongation of the thermal growing season. We use quantitative genetic individual-based simulations to disentangle the relative roles of mortality, dispersal ability and maturation age for the speed of adaptation. The simulations predict that after 100 years of climate change, the genotypic growth period length of both species will lag more than 50% behind the climatically determined optimum. This lag is reduced by increased mortality of established trees, whereas earlier maturation and higher dispersal ability had comparatively minor effects. The evolutionary lag behind environmental change shown in our simulations stresses the importance of accounting for evolutionary processes in forecasts of the future dynamics and productivity of forests. Sensitivity of the adaptation speed to mortality suggests that species experiencing high mortality rates as well as populations subject to regular disturbances such as storms or fires might be the quickest to adapt to a warming climate.

AB  - Ectothermic body temperatures affect organismal performances and presumably fitness, and are strongly influenced by the thermal environment. Therefore, the processes of colonization of novel thermal habitats by lizards might involve changes in thermal preferences, performance curves (reaction norms) and field activity temperatures. According to theory based on optimality analysis, diverse aspects of the thermal biology of vertebrate ectotherms should co-evolve as to maximize performance at the temperature range more often experienced by animals in the field. One corollary of this premise is that derived lizard clades that experienced a significant shift in thermal ecology, in comparison with the ancestral condition, should prefer and select temperatures in a thermal gradient similar to those experienced in nature. Here we report an analysis of the premise stated before. Specifically, we verify whether or not Tropidurinae species from three major Brazilian habitats (the Rainforests, the semi-arid Caatingas and the Cerrados, a Savannah-like biome) differ in thermal ecology and thermoregulatory behavior. The Caatinga is believed to be the ancestral habitat of this sub-family, and differences are expected because species from semi-arid habitats usually exhibit high body temperatures for lizards, whereas forest specialists might be thermoconformers and active at low temperatures. We also compared selected temperatures in the laboratory by species from the two open habitats (Caatingas and Cerrados). Data were analyzed using both conventional and phylogenetic analysis tools. Although species from Caatingas exhibited higher activity temperatures in nature than those from Cerrados, mean selected temperatures were similar between ecological groups. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed these findings and evidenced large evolutionary divergence in field activity temperatures between sister species from different open habitats without coupled divergence in selected temperatures. Therefore, thermoregulatory behavior and ecological parameters did not evolve similarly during the colonization of contrasting open habitats by Tropidurinae.

AB  - The expression of three putative QTL for upper thermal tolerance (UTT) was examined in two strains of outbred rainbow trout unselected for this trait using simple-sequence repeat (SSR; microsatellite) markers associated with UTT in backcrosses of lines selected on this trait. Two-way diallel lots in the third generation of an outbred pedigree were exposed to an acute thermal challenge. QTL detection was performed separately by each second-generation parent within each diallel lot, incorporating the effects of full sib families and correlated traits. Inheritance of different alleles at the SSR Ssa20.19NUIG from the sire 93-32-1 was strongly associated with the thermal tolerance of his half sib progeny, explaining 7.5% of their phenotypic variance in this trait. A hierarchical linear model incorporating allelic inheritance from all four grandsires of the experimental diallels (in addition to family specific and covariate trait effects) was also used to detect associations between the SSR and thermal tolerance in their third-generation grandprogeny. Ssa20.19NUIG was strongly associated with thermal tolerance in the grandprogeny of the grandsire G(0)SVM2. The generally stronger marker-trait associations found in male parents may be partially due to reduced chromosomal recombination rates in male salmonids compared to females. These results indicate the effects of a QTL on a fitness-related trait in unselected populations of rainbow trout.

AB  - This study shows a comparative techno-economic analysis of the integration of biomass gasification for generation of producer gas to be used in electricity production and to replace natural gas in the lime kilns of the pulp and paper industry. Three study cases with alternative configurations of the energy system integrating biomass gasification were analysed, including or not the co-generation of electricity and thermal energy, namely: i) Case I, for generation of electricity from residual forest biomass (RFB) in an integrated gasification combined cycle system, ii) Case II, generation of producer gas by RFB gasification for replacement of natural gas in the burners of a lime kiln, and iii) Case III, as an integration of Cases I and II for combined production of electricity and heat. Residual forest biomass from eucalyptus logging activities for feedstock processing for the pulp and paper industry was considered as fuel for direct (air) gasification in bubbling fiuidized bed. The analysis made is supported on review reports, namely, the evaluation of the existing literature on investment projects in biomass power plants, and on experi-mental investigation for determining the composition of the producer gas from gasification of the selected feedstock. An economic model was developed that combines the net present value, internal rate of return and payback period. The main results of the energy system analysis show that the net electricity generation is between 72 and 83 GWh/year, while the production of CaO in the lime kiln supported by combustion of producer gas, is 82.12 kt/year, and a global energy efficiency between 21.70 and 34.17 % is achieved for the analysed configurations of the energy system. The results of the economic analysis show a positive NPV, an IRR greater than the discount rate and a PBP less than the useful life of the plant. The sensitivity analysis shows quite favorable investment projections given the low probability that the NPV will reach negative values and compromise the economic viability of the project.

AB  - Costs of phenotypic adaptation to changing environments have often been studied in morphological structures. Such structures typically are irreversible for at least some stage in the organism's life. In this study we investigated whether recurrent and reversible adaptation to changes in the thermal environment incurs a cost in terms of some key life-history traits in the collembolan Orchesella cincta. We exposed juvenile O. cincta to two treatments differing in the frequency of temperature fluctuation but with equal total temperature sums. In the high frequency treatment temperature fluctuated daily between 10 and 20 degrees C, while in the low frequency treatment temperature fluctuated on a weekly schedule. During the treatments we measured juvenile growth rate and juvenile mortality, and after six weeks the animals were transferred to constant 15 degrees C and adult starvation resistance was assessed. We found no significant differences between the treatments in juvenile growth rate or juvenile survival. Also, adults that had grown up under high frequency temperature fluctuations did not suffer from reduced starvation resistance compared to animals growing under low frequency temperature fluctuations. This finding supports the hypothesis that selection minimizes the production costs of inducible phenotypes and suggests that the development of optimal phenotypes and evolution of temperature reaction norms are not constrained by such costs.

AB  - 1Environmental variability and perturbations can influence population persistence. It is therefore important to understand whether and how animals can compensate for environmental variability and thereby increase resilience of natural populations. Evolutionary theory predicts that in fluctuating environments, selection should favour developmental modifiers that reduce phenotypic expression of genetic variation. The expected result is that phenotypes are buffered from environmental variation across generations. Our aim was to determine whether phenotypes of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) remain stable across generations in which individuals were born into different thermal environments. We predicted that the spring generation (cool environment) would acclimate by increasing the concentration of regulatory transcription factor mRNA and activities of rate-limiting enzymes (hierarchical regulation) to compensate for the negative thermodynamic effects of lower temperatures on metabolic and locomotor performance. In contrast, the summer-born generation (warm environment) would show less capacity for acclimation and hierarchical regulation. We show that fish from both generations acclimated, but that there were significant differences in the phenotypic consequences of acclimation. The overall result was that burst performance, metabolic scope, and the activities of cytochrome c oxidase and lactate dehydrogenase were buffered from environmental change and did not differ between spring and summer fish at their natural water temperatures of 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. However, there were differences between generations in sustained swimming performance and citrate synthase activity. We used metabolic control analysis to show that modes of regulation of metabolic scope and locomotor performance differed between generations. Spring-born fish relied to a greater extent on rate-limiting enzymes and transcriptional regulator (PGC-1 and ) mRNA concentrations than summer-born fish. We suggest that developmental modifiers are favoured in fluctuating environments to maximize phenotypic fitness of each generation. We show that the interaction between developmental and reversible acclimation can increase the resilience of physiological performance in a natural population to climate variation.

AB  - Few studies have investigated the effects of ocean warming and acidification on marine benthic organisms over ecologically relevant time scales. We used an environmentally controlled coral reef mesocosm system to assess growth and physiological responses of the sea urchin species Echinometra sp. A over 2 generations. Each mesocosm was controlled for temperature and pCO(2) over 29 mo under 3 climate change scenarios (present day and predicted states in 2050 and 2100 under RCP 8.5). The system maintained treatment conditions including annual temperature cycles and a daily variation in pCO(2). Over 20 mo, adult Echinometra exhibited no significant difference in size and weight among the treatments. Growth rates and respiration rates did not differ significantly among treatments. Urchins from the 2100 treatment had elevated ammonium excretion rates and reduced O-2:N ratios, suggesting a change in catabolism. We detected no difference in spawning index scores or oocyte size after 20 mo in the treatments, suggesting that gonad development was not impaired by variations in pCO(2) and temperature reflecting anticipated climate change scenarios. Larvae produced from experimentally exposed adults were successfully settled from all treatments and raised for 5 mo inside the mesocosm. The final size of these juveniles exhibited no significant difference among treatments. Overall, we demonstrated that the mesocosm system provided a near natural environment for this urchin species. Climate change and ocean acidification did not affect the benthic life stages investigated here. Importantly, in previous short-term (weeks to months) experiments, this species exhibited reductions in growth and gonad development, highlighting the potential for short-term experiments with non-acclimated animals to yield contrasting, possibly erroneous results.

AB  - Loligo vulgaris is the most abundant and commercially important species of squid in Portuguese waters. The species presents a complex population structure clue to a short life-cycle, highly variable growth rates and a long spawning period. The latter characteristics combined with the marked seasonality of the Portuguese coast results in individuals that are born in different seasons being influenced by different environmental conditions, notably water temperature, as has previously been shown.
   In the present study, we have taken animals belonging to each of two temperature-based hatching cohorts (cold and warm cohorts - CC and WC) and determined the fecundity and egg size of individuals on either one, in order to determine whether animals in different cohorts followed different reproductive strategies.
   Significant differences were found between the cohorts regarding reproductive investment, fecundity and size of oocytes. Individuals of the CC (larger and older when reaching maturity) had lower fecundity than individuals of the WC, but presented larger oocytes. WC females (smaller and younger at maturity) present higher fecundities and higher GSIs. Such differences further demonstrate the high plasticity and adaptability of these organisms to environmental conditions and highlight the advantage of integrating environmental variables in fisheries assessment.

AB  - Life history characteristics of Lygus elisus Van Duzee were studied at 10, 15,20, 25, 30, and 35degreesC in the laboratory. The egg incubation period, instar-specific nymphal development, survivorship, and longevity of L. elisus were influenced by temperature. Eggs did not hatch at 10degreesC. For the five remaining selected temperature treatments, the incubation period was longest at 15degreesC and decreased nonlinearly with an increase in temperature. Temperature influenced the developmental period differently for different instars, with the second stadium being the shortest at 10, 20, 25, and 30degreesC, whereas first and third stadia were the shot-test at 15 and 35degreesC, respectively. The final stadium was longest across all six temperatures. The relationships between temperature and total durations were described by the same equation for both males and females. Total nymphal duration was not significant with sexes. Sex ratio (proportion of males) of emerging adults of L. elisus did not deviate from 1:1. Both instar-specific and total nymphal survivorship varied significantly with temperature. Total nymphal survivorship was highest at 15degreesC and lowest at 10degreesC. Adult longevity ranged from 16 (35degreesC) to 122 d (15degreesC), with a curvilinear response to temperature. Females survived approximate to10 d longer than males at 20degreesC, but survivorship of males and females was similar at other temperatures. These life history data will be useful in developing a computer model simulating L. elisus population dynamics in the field.

AB  - The diversity and infection dynamics of the endosymbiont Wolbachia can be influenced by many factors, such as transmission rate, cytoplasmic incompatibility, environment, selection and genetic drift. The interplay of these factors in natural populations can result in heterogeneous infection patterns with substantial differences between populations and strains. The causes of these heterogeneities are not yet understood, partly due to the complexity of natural environments. We present experimental evolution as a new approach to study Wolbachia infection dynamics in replicate populations exposed to a controlled environment. A natural Drosophila melanogaster population infected with strains of Wolbachia belonging to different clades evolved in two laboratory environments (hot and cold) for 1.5years. In both treatments, the rate of Wolbachia infection increased until fixation. In the hot environment, the relative frequency of different Wolbachia clades remained stable over 37 generations. In the cold environment, however, we observed marked changes in the composition of the Wolbachia population: within 15 generations, one Wolbachia clade increased more than 50% in frequency, whereas the other two clades decreased in frequency, resulting in the loss of one clade. The frequency change was highly reproducible not only among replicates, but also when flies that evolved for 42 generations in the hot environment were transferred to the cold environment. These results document how environmental factors can affect the composition of Wolbachia in D.melanogaster. The high reproducibility of the pattern suggests that experimental evolution studies can efficiently determine the functional basis of habitat-specific fitness among Wolbachia strains.

AB  - Climate change is expected to have profound, partly unforeseeable effects on the composition of functional traits of complex ecosystems, such as coral reefs, and some ecosystem properties are at risk of disappearing. This study applies a novel spatially explicit, individual-based model to explore three critical life history traits of corals: heat tolerance, competitiveness and growth performance under various environmental settings. Building upon these findings, we test the adaptation potential required by a coral community in order to not only survive but also retain its diversity by the end of this century under different IPCC climate scenarios. Even under the most favourable IPCC scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP 2.6), model results indicate that shifts in the trait space are likely and coral communities will mainly consist of small numbers of temperature-tolerant and fast-growing species. Species composition of coral communities is likely to be determined by heat tolerance, with competitiveness most likely playing a subordinate role. To sustain similar to 15% of current coral cover under a 2 degrees C temperature increase by the end of the century (RCP 4.5), coral systems would have to accommodate temperature increases of 0.1-0.15 degrees C per decade, assuming that periodic extreme thermal events occurred every 8 years. These required adaptation rates are unprecedented and unlikely, given corals' life-history characteristics.

AB  - Despite numerous releases for biological control purposes during more than 20 years in Europe, Harmonia axyridis failed to become established until the beginning of the 21st century. Its status as invasive alien species is now widely recognised. Theory suggests that invasive populations should evolve toward greater phenotypic plasticity because they encounter differing environments during the invasion process. On the contrary, populations used for biological control have been maintained under artificial rearing conditions for many generations; they are hence expected to become specialised on a narrow range of environments and show lower phenotypic plasticity. Here we compared phenotypic traits and the extent of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in two invasive populations and two populations commercialized for biological control by (i) measuring six phenotypic traits related to fitness (eggs hatching rate, larval survival rate, development time, sex ratio, fecundity over 6 weeks and survival time of starving adults) at three temperatures (18, 24 and 30 degrees C), (ii) recording the survival rate and quiescence aggregation behaviour when exposed to low temperatures (5, 10 and 15 degrees C), and (iii) studying the cannibalistic behaviour of populations in the absence of food. Invasive and biocontrol populations displayed significantly different responses to temperature variation for a composite fitness index computed from the traits measured at 18, 24 and 30 degrees C, but not for any of those traits considered independently. The plasticity measured on the same fitness index was higher in the two invasive populations, but this difference was not statistically significant. On the other hand, invasive populations displayed significantly higher survival and higher phenotypic plasticity when entering into quiescence at low temperatures. In addition, one invasive population displayed a singular cannibalistic behaviour. Our results hence only partly support the expectation of increased adaptive phenotypic plasticity of European invasive populations of H. axyridis, and stress the importance of the choice of the environmental parameters to be manipulated for assessing phenotypic plasticity variation among populations.

AB  - The outcome of hybridization can be impacted by environmental conditions, which themselves can contribute to reproductive isolation between taxa. In crosses of genetically divergent populations, hybridization can have both negative and positive impacts on fitness, the balance between which might be tipped by changes in the environment. Genetically divergent populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus have been shown to differ in thermal tolerance at high temperatures along a latitudinal gradient. In this study, a series of crosses were made between pairs of genetically divergent populations of T. californicus, and the thermal tolerance of these hybrids was tested. In most cases, the first-generation hybrids had relatively high thermal tolerance and the second-generation hybrids were not generally reduced below the less-tolerant parental population for high temperature tolerance. This pattern contrasts with previous studies from crosses of genetically divergent populations of this copepod, which often shows hybrid breakdown in these second-generation hybrids for other measures of fitness. These results suggest that high temperature stress could either increase the positive impacts of hybridization or decrease the negative impacts of hybridization resulting in lowered hybrid breakdown in these population crosses.

AB  - Overwintering is a serious challenge for insects, and winters are rapidly changing as climate shifts. The capacity for phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptation will determine which species profit or suffer from these changes. Here we discuss current knowledge on the potential and evidence for evolution in winter-relevant traits among insect species and populations. We conclude that the best evidence for evolutionary shifts in response to changing winters remain those related to changes in phenology, but all evidence points to cold hardiness as also having the potential to evolve in response to climate change. Predicting future population sizes and ranges relies on understanding to what extent evolution in winter-related traits is possible, and remains a serious challenge.

AB  - As a species of major interest for aquaculture, the sex determination system (SDS) of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, has been widely investigated. In this species, sex determination is considered to be governed by the interactions between a complex system of genetic sex determination factors (GSD) and the influence of temperature (TSD) during a critical period. Previous studies were exclusively carried out on domestic stocks with the genetic and maintenance limitations associated. Given the wide distribution and adaptation potential of the Nile tilapia, we investigated under controlled conditions the sex determination system of natural populations adapted to three extreme thermal regimes: stable extreme environments in Ethiopia, either cold temperatures in a highland lake (Lake Koka), or warm temperatures in hydrothermal springs (Lake Metahara), and an environment with large seasonal variations in Ghana (Kpandu, Lake Volta). The sex ratio analysis was conducted on progenies reared under constant basal (27 degrees C) or high (36 degrees C) temperatures during the 30 days following yolk-sac resorption. Sex ratios of the progenies reared at standard temperature suggest that the three populations share a similar complex GSD system based on a predominant male heterogametic factor with additional influences of polymorphism at this locus and/or action of minor factors. The three populations presented a clear thermosensitivity of sex differentiation, with large variations in the intensity of response depending on the parents. This confirms the presence of genotype-environment interactions in TSD of Nile tilapia. Furthermore the existence of naturally sex-reversed individuals is strongly suggested in two populations (Kpandu and Koka). However, it was not possible here to infer if the sex-inversion resulted from minor genetic factors and/or environmental influences. The present study demonstrated for the first time the conservation of a complex SDS combining polymorphic GSD and TSD components in natural populations of Nile tilapia. We discuss the evolutionary implications of our findings and highlight the importance of field investigations of sex determination. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The joint effect of increasing temperature and pollution on aquatic organisms is important to understand and predict, as a combination of stressors might be more noxious when compared to their individual effects. Our goal was to determine the sensitivity of a model organism (Daphnia spp.) to contaminants at increasing temperatures, allowing prior acclimation of the organisms to the different temperatures. Prior to exposure, two Daphnia genotypes (Daphnia longispina species complex) were acclimated to three temperatures (17, 20, and 23 A degrees C). Afterwards, a crossed design was established using different exposure temperatures and a range of concentrations of two common fungicides (tebuconazole and copper). Daphnia life history parameters were analysed in each temperature x toxicant combination for 21 days. Temperature was the most influencing factor: Daphnia reproduced later and had lower fecundity at 17 A degrees C than at 20 and 23 A degrees C. Both copper and tebuconazole also significantly reduced the fecundity and survival of Daphnia at environmentally-relevant concentrations. Temperature-dependence was found for both toxicants, but the response pattern was endpoint- and genotype-specific. The combination of contaminant and high temperature often had severe effects on survival. However, unlike some literature on the subject, our results do not support the theory that increasing temperatures consistently foment increasing reproductive toxicity. The absence of a clear temperature-dependent toxicity pattern may result from the previous acclimation to the temperature regime. However, a proper framework is lacking to compare such studies and to avoid misleading conclusions for climate change scenarios.

AB  - As environmental temperatures increase and become more seasonally variable, the ability of individuals to plastically alter their physiological responses to temperature (=acclimatize) may affect the potential for species persistence. Among marine organisms, the larval stage is often the most physiologically sensitive; larvae are also often the main dispersal stage in the life history. However, studies that address the acclimatization of marine larvae are rare. We investigated whether larvae of the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes elegans from two temperate populations, one from the Northern Hemisphere (Mexico) and one from the Southern Hemisphere (Peru), show patterns of seasonal acclimatization to temperature. We compared the effects of temperature on swimming activity, oxygen consumption, and mortality of larvae from the two populations in both warm and cold seasons. Larvae from Mexico had higher thermal tolerances when collected in the boreal summer compared to the boreal winter, while no similar indication of seasonal acclimatization was seen in larvae from Peru. The lack of acclimatization in larvae of P. elegans from Peru may be related to recent thermal history, low selection for acclimatization due to irregular patterns of seasonal temperature change during ENSO events, or to different phylogeographic histories of Northern-and Southern-hemisphere populations.

AB  - What is already known about this topic?
   An increasing number of studies have projected temperature-related mortality, but few consider the change of population's adaptability to future temperature and mortality burden from cold and heat effects.
   What is added by this report?
   This study offers a comprehensive characterization of human adaptability and excess mortality burden of temperature across various regions of China.
   What are the implications for public health practice?
   The temperature-related excess mortality was projected to increase in the 2050s and decrease in the 2080s. Heat adaptability was projected to increase in the future, but along with the rising temperatures, the heat-related excess mortality continuously rose, except for the low-speed rising scenario. Although the excess mortality of cold was projected to decrease in the nearer future, it might not keep declining in the long run, due to the decreasing cold-adaptability, which deserves more attention.

AB  - Hirame (Paralichthys olivaceus) is an important cultured flatfish species in Japan, Korea and China. Because females grow faster, methods of feminized culture were developed. Sex ratios were examined in gynogenetic diploids and normal diploids and their progenies in order to clarify genetic sex-determination and enable its artificial manipulation. It was revealed that this species has male heterogametic sex-determination. However, sex-differentiation of genetic females (XX) seems to be so unstable that spontaneous sex-reversal to physiological males can be caused by exogenous factors, especially high water temperature. Manipulating techniques for physiological as well as genetic sex were established using sex-steroids and/or controlling rearing water temperature. Homozygous clones were produced by the combination of inducing mitotic gynogenetic diploids and meiotic gynogenetic diploids over two generations. More vigorous heterozygous clones were produced by hybridization between different clones. These appear to be good material for fish breeding and commercial fish culture.

AB  - Thermal tolerance was studied in a rainbow trout strain successively selected through high temperature breeding at 20-2 degrees C since 1966 in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan. The hatching rate and fry mortality at high temperatures were examined in the selected strain along with normal strains cultured at water temperature of 9-17 degrees C. The hatching rate of embryos fertilized at either 10 or 14 C and subsequently subjected to high temperatures in the blastula or neurula stage of the selected strain, was marginally higher than that of the normal strain counterparts. The upper 50% lethal temperatures (LT50) for embryos in the early segmentation, blastula and neurula stages of the selected strain were also higher than those of the normal strain counterparts. Death temperatures and LT50 of fries acclimated to 20 degrees C of the selected strain were significantly higher than those of the normal strains. However, no difference in the critical thermal maximum was detected between the different strains. These results suggest that the selected strain of rainbow trout established by selecting successively for many generations at high temperatures acquired a degree of thermal tolerance.

AB  - Tropical marine ecosystems are highly vulnerable to pollution and climate change. It is relatively unknown how tropical species may develop an increased tolerance to these stressors and the cost of adaptations. We addressed these issues by exposing a keystone tropical marine copepod, Pseudodiaptomus annandalei, to copper (Cu) for 7 generations (F1-F7) during three treatments: control, Cu and pCu (the recovery treatment). In F7, we tested the "contaminant-induced climate change sensitivity" hypothesis (TICS) by exposing copepods to Cu and extreme temperature. We tracked fitness and productivity of all generations. In F1, Cu did not affect survival and grazing but decreased nauplii production. In F2-F4, male survival, grazing, and nauplii production were lower in Cu, but recovered in pCu, indicating transgenerational plasticity. Strikingly, in F5-F6 nauplii production of Cu-exposed females increased, and did not recover in pCu. The earlier result suggests an increased Cu tolerance while the latter result revealed its cost. In F7, extreme temperature resulted in more pronounced reductions in grazing, and nauplii production of Cu or pCu than in control, supporting TICS. The results suggest that widespread pollution in tropical regions may result in high vulnerability of species in these regions to climate change.

AB  - We investigated three aspects of adaptation to variable environments in Daphnia pulex (Cladocera: Crustacea): (1) effects of temporal variation on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity; (2) plasticity in sexual versus asexual lineages; (3) maintenance of genetic variation in variable environments. We performed a 72-day quasi-natural selection experiment comparing three patterns of variation: constant temperatures, varying but predictable temperature change, and unpredictable temperature change. All populations were begun with an identical array of 34 clones. During selection clonal variation declined in all populations and different patterns of environmental variation had little effect on amounts of genetic variation. Sexual and asexual lineages differed in size and growth rate, but did not differ in amounts of plasticity or in adaptation to variable environments. The primary target of selection was the Malthusian parameter (r) and life history traits of development time, offspring size and offspring number. The heritability of plasticity was generally lower than trait heritability. Because of this difference, the selection response on the mean of the traits overwhelmed the selection response on plasticity. Lower heritabilities of plasticity are very typical, suggesting that our results will be typical of responses to selection in nature. Our results suggest that selection will act mostly on trait means within environments and that plasticity will evolve often as a correlated trait. Because selection on plasticity is based on its across-deme, global fitness, this process will usually be slow. Comparative studies need to shift from closely related, local population differences to those of more distantly related populations or even different species.

AB  - 1. Species with distributions that span a broad range of latitudes may have populations that exhibit distinct life history traits associated with environmental gradients. The majority of previous studies have indicated a strong association between spawning site selection by brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and the presence of upwelling groundwater, but does this generalisation extend to the thermal regimes experienced at northern sites? 2. We investigated the role of hyporheic flow in redd site selection by brook trout in a relatively high-latitude boreal system. Hyporheic flows through streambed substratums can be dominated by groundwater or surface water and may be influenced by the presence of morphological features. For autumn spawners such as brook trout, embryos situated in microhabitats where hyporheic flow in the shallow substratum is groundwater dominant (i.e. warmer in winter) are likely to experience accelerated development rates relative to embryos in redds where there is downwelling surface water (i.e. colder in winter). 3. We measured vertical hydraulic gradients (VHG) at the microhabitat scale and spatial and temporal variation in upwelling/downwelling flow and thermal regimes in brook trout spawning/incubation habitats. Additionally, we noted the proximity of redd sites to stream morphological features (e.g. riffle crests). 4. Our results indicate that upwelling flow was not a decisive cue in redd site selection at the microhabitat scale (100 m) as an approximately equal number of redds were situated in microhabitats with upward flow as compared to microhabitats with downward flow through the redd. Redds situated on bedforms with convex longitudinal profiles (e.g. riffle crests, log steps) were associated with downward flow, whereas redds not immediately adjacent to these bedform features were associated with upward flow. Winter streambed temperatures confirmed that both sites with steady upwelling (i.e. warm incubation regime) and downwelling (i.e. cold incubation regime) were indeed selected by spawners. 5. Our observations that spawners utilised both cold-regime and warm-regime sites suggests the existence of distinct reproductive tactics related to hyporheic flow patterns in this boreal system. As temperature is the dominant factor controlling rates of embryonic development, the use of spawning microhabitats with distinct thermal regimes implies substantial differences in the timing of hatching and the phenology of emergence.

AB  - Population persistence has been studied in a conservation context to predict the fate of small or declining populations. Persistence models have explored effects on extinction of random demographic and environmental fluctuations, but in the face of directional environmental change they should also integrate factors affecting whether a population can adapt. Here, we examine the population-size dependence of demographic and genetic factors and their likely contributions to extinction time under scenarios of environmental change. Parameter estimates were derived from experimental populations of the rainforest species, Drosophila birchii, held in the lab for 10 generations at census sizes of 20, 100 and 1000, and later exposed to five generations of heat-knockdown selection. Under a model of directional change in the thermal environment, rapid extinction of populations of size 20 was caused by a combination of low growth rate (r) and high stochasticity in r. Populations of 100 had significantly higher reproductive output, lower stochasticity in r and more additive genetic variance (V(A)) than populations of 20, but they were predicted to persist less well than the largest size class. Even populations of 1000 persisted only a few hundred generations under realistic estimates of environmental change because of low V(A) for heat-knockdown resistance. The experimental results document population-size dependence of demographic and adaptability factors. The simulations illustrate a threshold influence of demographic factors on population persistence, while genetic variance has a more elastic impact on persistence under environmental change.

AB  - Selection may reduce the deleterious consequences of inbreeding. This may be due to purging of recessive deleterious alleles or balancing selection favouring heterozygote offspring. Such selection is expected to be more efficient at slower compared to at faster rates of inbreeding. In this study we tested the impact of inbreeding and the rate of inbreeding on fitness related traits (egg productivity, egg-to-adult viability, developmental time and behaviour) under cold and benign semi-natural thermal conditions using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. We used non-inbred control and slow and fast inbred lines (both with an expected inbreeding level of 0.25). The results show that contrary to expectations the slow inbred lines do not maintain higher average fitness than the fast inbred lines. Furthermore, we found that stressful environmental conditions increased the level of inbreeding depression but the impact of inbreeding rate on the level of inbreeding depression was not affected by the environmental conditions. The results do not support the hypothesis that inbreeding depression is less severe with slow compared to fast rates of inbreeding and illustrate that although selection may be more efficient with slower rates of inbreeding this does not necessary lead to less inbreeding depression.

AB  - 1. Evolutionary theory predicts that intergenerational environmental fluctuations lead to transgenerational effects where offspring phenotypes are matched to conditions experienced by previous generations. However, in fluctuating environments, transgenerational effects can be detrimental by causing mismatches between ancestral and offspring environments. Acclimation in offspring could alleviate these negative effects.
   2. We determined whether the interaction between transgenerational effects and acclimation affects locomotor performance and dispersal in guppies (Poecilia reticulata). In a fully factorial experiment, we tested the interaction between ancestral (22 or 30 degrees C for six to eight generations), acclimation (22 or 30 degrees C for 4weeks) and acute test temperatures (two to five temperatures across 18-34 degrees C). We predicted that matching ancestral and acclimation temperatures to acute environmental temperature maximises physiological capacities (swimming performance [U-crit] and metabolic enzyme activities), and dispersal in an artificial stream. Alternatively, when ancestral and acute temperatures were mismatched, we predicted that thermal acclimation compensates for this mismatch by shifting performance curves. Finally, we hypothesised that physiological capacities are positively related to dispersal. We measured dispersal as a combination of traits characterising the departure and transient phases of dispersal (time taken to leave the introductory pool, voluntary speed against the current, number of dispersal decisions taken) in an 8-m artificial stream.
   3. As hypothesised, U-crit was greatest when ancestral, acclimation and acute temperatures matched. Cold acclimation reduced the decrement in U-crit resulting from a mismatch between ancestral and acute test temperatures. In both sexes, the interaction between ancestral and acclimation temperatures determined U-crit, but not metabolic enzyme activities, and it affected the number of dispersal decisions in males only. Contrary to our hypothesis, physiological capacities did not constrain dispersal. Males were more likely to initiate dispersal when the acute temperatures mismatched their ancestral temperature. After initiating dispersal, males moved at a greater voluntary speed and made more dispersal decisions in environments matching their ancestral environment.
   4. Our findings imply that although the interaction between transgenerational effects and acclimation modulates locomotor capacities, these relationships do not necessarily translate to all ecologically relevant locomotor tasks. Instead, sex-specific life-history traits such as life span are more likely to influence dispersal, and males in particular may initiate dispersal to escape suboptimal conditions.

AB  - The use of solar energy in thermal desalination processes is one of the most promising applications of the renewable energies. Solar desalination can either be direct; use solar energy to produce distillate directly in the solar collector, or indirect; combining conventional desalination techniques, such as multistage flash desalination (MSF), vapor compression (VC), reverse osmosis (RO), membrane distillation (MD) and electrodialysis, with solar collectors for heat generation. Direct solar desalination compared with the indirect technologies requires large land areas and has a relatively low productivity. It is however competitive to the indirect desalination plants in small-scale production due to its relatively low cost and simplicity. This paper describes several desalination technologies in commercial and pilot stages of development. The primary focus is on those technologies suitable for use in remote areas, especially those which could be integrated into solar thermal energy systems.

AB  - A high temperature stress of 44.5 degreesC for 10 minutes on the larval stages was found to affect the susceptibility of adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to chikungunya virus. At this temperature, the mortality of the mosquito larvae was found to be approximately 95%, whereas a temperature greater than 45 degreesC for to minutes was found to be lethal. A temperature tolerant (TT) strain was developed by exposing the larvae to a temperature of 44.5 degreesC for 10 minutes at every generation for five generations. This strain was established to determine whether increase in the susceptibility was due to any selection pressure of higher temperature or to the influence of other intrinsic factors such as expression of immunoresponsive (IR) genes. Other studies on these mosquito strains showed that when maintained at 28 +/- 1degreesC, there was no difference in the larval duration and mortality in the immature stages, but the mean survival of female mosquitoes in the TT strain was 5-6 days longer. Conversely, when mosquitoes were maintained throughout at 37 degreesC the mean survival of' the mosquitoes decreased drastically in both strains, but the mean survival of females in the TT strain was 5-6 days longer compared with the unstressed controls. This increases the probability of at least one more blood meal. Fecundity of the TT strain was found to be lower than that of the control mosquitoes. Data suggest that expression of certain IR genes was affected by the heat shock. Sonic of these genes were up-regulated and down-regulated, which may have affected the susceptibility of mosquitoes to the virus. Although there was some selection in the temperature-tolerant individuals in the TT strain. when stressed by heat they showed expression of IR genes in a pattern similar to that in the normal controls. It appears that an increase in temperature above the average temperature of an area might help increase the proportion of virus-susceptible mosquitoes in the population. Such in increase in temperature in an endemic area would not only enhance the selection of temperature-tolerant individuals in a population having more longevity, but would also affect both intrinsic and extrinsic factors by reducing the extrinsic incubation period and increasing susceptibility of mosquitoes to viruses due to affected expression of IR genes.

AB  - Understanding climate-induced range shifts is crucial for biodiversity conservation. However, no general consensus has so far emerged about the mechanisms involved and the role of phylogeny in shaping species responses has been poorly explored. Here, we investigate whether species traits and their underlying phylogenetic constraints explain altitudinal shifts at the trailing and leading edges of stream fish species ranges. We demonstrate that these shifts are related to dissimilar mechanisms: whereas range retractions show some support for phylogenetic clustering due to a high level of conservatism in thermal safety margins, range expansions are underpinned by both evolutionarily conserved and labile traits, notably trophic position and life-history strategy, hence decreasing the strength of phylogenetic signal. Therefore, while climate change brings many difficulties in establishing a general understanding of species vulnerability, these findings emphasize how combining trait-based approaches in light of the species evolutionary history may offer new opportunities in facing conservation challenges.

AB  - Selection can be divided into sexual and nonsexual components. Some work finds that a component of sexual selection, adaptive female selection for good genes, can promote nonsexual fitness. Less studied is the benefit from sexual selection in tote, that is, when intra- and intersexual selection are both present and able to affect females directly and indirectly. Here an upper bound for the net benefit of sexual selection is estimated for Drosophila melanogaster. Replicate populations were allowed to adapt to low-grade thermal stress, with or with out the operation of sexual selection. Because proteins and lipids are highly sensitive to temperature, low-grade thermal stress will select broadly across the genome for alternative alleles. Such broad, directional selection for thermal tolerance should increase the measurable benefits of sexual selection far beyond that available under stabilizing selection. Sexual selection was removed by enforced monogamy without mate choice and retained by enforced polyandry (four males per female). After 36 generations of thermal stress exposure, there was substantial adaptation to the new environment (the net reproductive rate increased six standard deviations relative to thermal controls). However, sexual selection did not affect the rate of adaptation. Therefore, adaptive female selection for thermal tolerance either was insignificant or negated by other aspects of sexual selection, for example, male-induced female harm, which has been shown to diminish under monogamy. This experiment employed two parameters that reduced the opportunity for divergence in such harm: a truncated intersexual interaction period and strong directional selection for thermal tolerance. No divergence in male-induced harm was observed.

AB  - The timing of migration from feeding to breeding areas is a critical link between the growth and survival of adult animals, their reproduction, and the fitness of their progeny. Commercial fisheries often catch a large fraction of the migrants (e.g., salmon), and exploitation rates can vary systematically over the fishing season. We examined daily records of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in the Egegik and Ugashik management districts in Bristol Bay, Alaska (USA), for evidence of such temporally selective fishing. In recent years, the early migrants have experienced lower fishing rates than later migrants, especially in the Egegik district, and the median migration date of the fish escaping the fisheries has been getting progressively earlier in both districts. Moreover, the overall runs (catch and escapement) in the Egegik district and, to a lesser extent the Ugashik district, have been getting earlier, as predicted in response to the selection on timing. The trends in timing were not correlated with sea surface temperature in the region of the North Pacific Ocean where the salmon tend to concentrate, but the trends in the two districts were correlated with each other, indicating that there may be some common environmental influence in addition to the effect of selection. Despite the selection, both groups of salmon have remained productive. We hypothesize that this resilience may result from representation of all component populations among the early and late migrants, so that the fisheries have not eliminated entire populations, and from density-dependent processes that may have helped maintain the productivity of these salmon populations.

AB  - The current work aimed to enlarge freshwater production and improve tubular solar still (TSS) performance via pure and nano-coated (with carbon black nanoparticles) mushrooms. Pure mushrooms were used due to their structure that allows effective vapor generation through achieving good solar absorptivity, capillary effect, and heat localization on the surface. In addition, carbon black coating was proposed to improve surface absorptivity, heat localization, and thermal conductivity. The performance of the developed TSS (DTSS) was evaluated, compared to conventional TSS (CTSS), through a series of tests: first using pure mushrooms, and then via three quantities of carbon black (CB) nanocoating (25, 50, and 75 g/m2). Besides, the thermal performance was analyzed from the heat transfer coefficients, energy and exergy efficiencies points of view. Finally, a feasibility study was conducted by calculating the cost per liter of the yield for all cases. The results revealed that, compared to CTSS, the productivity increased by 59.05%, achieving a saving in production cost by 33.85 % using nanocoated mushrooms (DTSS with 50 g/m2). Besides, the thermal performance was enhanced by 55.38 and 129.95% for energy, and exergy efficiencies, respectively. Hence, the proposed work introduced an effective and feasible improvement in the field of TSSs.

AB  - Signals of selection on quantitative traits can be detected by the comparison between the genetic differentiation of molecular (neutral) markers and quantitative traits, by multivariate extensions of the same model and by the observation of the additive covariance among relatives. We studied, by three different tests, signals of occurrence of selection in Prosopis alba populations over 15 quantitative traits: three economically important life history traits: height, basal diameter and biomass, 11 leaf morphology traits that may be related with heat-tolerance and physiological responses and spine length that is very important from silvicultural purposes. We analyzed 172 G1-generation trees growing in a common garden belonging to 32 open pollinated families from eight sampling sites in Argentina. The multivariate phenotypes differ significantly among origins, and the highest differentiation corresponded to foliar traits. Molecular genetic markers (SSR) exhibited significant differentiation and allowed us to provide convincing evidence that natural selection is responsible for the patterns of morphological differentiation. The heterogeneous selection over phenotypic traits observed suggested different optima in each population and has important implications for gene resource management. The results suggest that the adaptive significance of traits should be considered together with population provenance in breeding program as a crucial point prior to any selecting program, especially in Prosopis where the first steps are under development.

AB  - There are two kinds of relationships between magmatism and the generation of hydrocarbons from source rocks in petroliferous basins, namely: (I) simultaneous magmatism and hydrocarbon generation, and (2) magmatism that occurs after hydrocarbon generation. Although the influence of magmatism on hydrocarbon source rocks has been extensively studied, there has not been a systematic comparison between these two relationships and their influences on hydrocarbon generation. Here, we present an overview of the influence of magmatism on hydrocarbon generation based on the results of simulation experiments. These experiments indicate that the two relationships outlined above have different influences on the generation of hydrocarbons. Magmatism that occurred after hydrocarbon generation contributed deeply sourced hydrogen gas that improved liquid hydrocarbon productivity between the mature and overmature stages of maturation, increasing liquid hydrocarbon productivity to as much as 451.59% in the case of simulation temperatures of up to 450 degrees C during modelling where no hydrogen gas was added. This relationship also increased the gaseous hydrocarbon generation ratio at temperatures up to 450 degrees C, owing to the cracking of initially generated liquid hydrocarbons and the cracking of kerogen. Our simulation experiments suggest that gaseous hydrocarbons dominate total hydrocarbon generation ratios for overmature source rocks, resulting in a change in petroleum accumulation processes. This in turn suggests that different exploration strategies are warranted for the different relationships outlined above. For example, simultaneous magmatism and hydrocarbon generation in an area means that exploration should focus on targets likely to host large oilfields, whereas in areas with magmatism that post-dates hydrocarbon generation the exploration should focus on both oil and gas fields. In addition, exploration strategies in igneous petroliferous basins should focus on identifying high-quality reservoirs as well as determining the relationship between magmatism and initial hydrocarbon generation.

AB  - The southwestern Norwegian Sea is characterized by an inflow of warm and saline Atlantic water from the southwest and cold and less saline East IcelandicWater (EIW), of Arctic origin, from the northwest. These two water masses meet and form the Iceland-Faroe Front (IFF). In this region, the copepod Calanus finmarchicus plays a key role in the pelagic ecosystem. Time-series of C. finmarchicus and Calanus hyperboreus in May and September, extending back to the early 1990s, were studied in relation to phytoplankton bloom dynamics and hydrography. The main reproductive period of C. finmarchicus started consistently earlier south of the IFF, resulting in different life cycles and stage compositions in the twowater masses. In 2003, a sudden shift occurred north of the IFF, resulting in a similar phenology pattern to south of the IFF. Before this, only one generation of C. finmarchicus was produced in the Arctic water, but the earlier reproduction enabled the species to produce two generations after 2003. Simultaneously, C. hyperboreus, an expatriate in the EIW, largely disappeared. Food availability is unlikely the reason for the phenological differences observed across the front, as the typical pattern of the phytoplankton spring bloom showed an earlier onset north of the IFF. Temperature and salinity peaked at record high values in 2003 and 2004, and therefore possible links to oceanography are discussed. The dominant role of Calanus spp. and the potential linkages to water mass exchanges may herald strong effects on the ecosystem and pelagic fish in this subpolar Atlantic region under expected climate change.

AB  - Additive variation in adaptive traits is a prerequisite for selection and adaptation to future environmental changes, but distribution of adaptive genetic variability between and within populations is poorly known in most forest trees. Owing to this deficiency, life history traits such as geographic range, pollination vector and seed dispersal capability, which significantly affect gene flow and thus the distribution of genetic variability, were used to evaluate the genetic resources in 23 Norwegian native forest tree species. Based on the combination of life history traits the species' genetic resources were classified either as viable, potentially vulnerable or vulnerable, assuming a decrease in within-population variability in this sequence. Twelve widely distributed species with generally effective dispersal of pollen and seeds were considered viable (Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies, Juniperus communis, Betula pubescens, B. pendula, Alnus incana, A. glutinosa, Salix caprea, Populus tremula, Corylus avellana, Sorbus aucuparia, Prunus padus) and have as such no particular conservation needs. Effective seed dispersal of these species, as inferred from post-glacial migration rates, may be partly responsible for their generally early post-glacial appearance, and may, in combination with the wide ranges and relatively large evolutionary potential, indicate that viable species are best able to cope with climatic change. Among species with restricted ranges and more limited gene flow eight were considered potentially vulnerable (Quercus petraea, Q. robur, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer platanoides, Taxus baccata, Ilex aquifolium, Fagus sylvatica, Ulmus glabra) and three were considered vulnerable (Tilia cordata, Malus sylvestris, P. avium). Application of different intensities of a multiple population breeding system (MPBS) is considered the most appropriate mode of conserving genetic resources in these species.

AB  - Rising river temperatures in western North America have increased the energetic costs of migration and the risk of premature mortality in many Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) populations. Predicting and managing risks for these populations requires data on acute and cumulative thermal exposure, the spatio-temporal distribution of adverse conditions, and the potentially mitigating effects of cool-water refuges. In this study, we paired radiotelemetry with archival temperature loggers to construct continuous, spatially-explicit thermal histories for 212 adult Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha) and 200 adult steelhead (O. mykiss). The fish amassed -500,000 temperature records (30-min intervals) while migrating through 470 kilometers of the Columbia and Snake rivers en route to spawning sites in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Spring- and most summer-run Chinook salmon migrated before river temperatures reached annual highs; their body temperatures closely matched ambient temperatures and most had thermal maxima in the lower Snake River. In contrast, many individual fall-run Chinook salmon and most steelhead had maxima near thermal tolerance limits (20-22 degrees C) in the lower Columbia River. High temperatures elicited extensive use of thermal refuges near tributary confluences, where body temperatures were similar to 2-10 degrees C cooler than the adjacent migration corridor. Many steelhead used refuges for weeks or more whereas salmon use was typically hours to days, reflecting differences in spawn timing. Almost no refuge use was detected in a similar to 260-km reach where a thermal migration barrier may more frequently develop in future warmer years. Within population, cumulative thermal exposure was strongly positively correlated (0.88 <= r <= 0.98) with migration duration and inconsistently associated (-0.28 <= r <= 0.09) with migration date. All four populations have likely experienced historically high mean and maximum temperatures in recent years. Expected responses include population-specific shifts in migration phenology, increased reliance on patchily-distributed thermal refuges, and natural selection favoring temperature tolerant phenotypes.

AB  - Widespread use of pesticides has resulted in the evolution of resistance in many insect pests worldwide limiting their use in pest control. Effective pest and resistance management practices require understanding of the genetics of resistance and of the life history of the pest. Most models for pesticide resistance assume that resistance is monogenic, conferred by a single gene. However, resistance could evolve as a polygenic quantitative trait resulting from the action of several genes, especially when pesticide dose is low. Further, fitness of the pest could be density-dependent and might depend upon abiotic factors such as temperature. It is not known how these factors affect the evolution of polygenic resistance or pest population dynamics when resistance evolves. We use the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, as a case study and use data on density-dependent survival, heritability and survival rates on the transgenic Cry3Bb1 toxin and corresponding LC50 values, to model polygenic resistance to Cry3Bb1. We found that LC50 increased rapidly even at doses that produced a mortality of less than 99.9%. However, survival reached 100% only when mortality was as high as 99.9%. Fast response to high selection pressure produced cyclical larval densities while lower selection pressures produced equilibrium densities. Interestingly we found that a relatively low density observed in a population may not be evidence for a low survival to the pesticide. As a consequence we found that larger refuges might not necessarily help in reducing pest densities especially when pesticide mortality is low. This effect, arising from the tradeoff between response to selection and density dependence, calls for careful assessment of the evolution of resistance based on change in survival as well as on pest densities. When selection pressure is low a lower initial density resulted in a larger response to selection. Finally, we showed that populations with shorter developmental times developed resistance faster initially irrespective of selection pressure. However, when selection pressure is low survival eventually became higher in populations with longer developmental times. Since developmental time depends on degree days spatio-temporal variation in temperature could be an important factor in polygenic resistance evolution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A rearing technique was developed for two species of fruit fly, Bactrocera melanotus (Coquillett) and B. xanthodes (Broun), and key life-cycle parameters were determined. The technique included developing a novel larval diet with no bulking agent. The mean life-cycle parameters for B. melanotus and B. xanthodes, respectively, at 26 +/- 1 degrees C were: egg hatch, 40 h and 44 h; egg to pupa, 10 days for both species; preoviposition period, 21 days and 12 days; egg to egg, 44 days and 35 days. Colonies were maintained in the laboratory for over 20 consecutive generations. Results are discussed in relation to production of eggs and various larval instars for postharvest disinfestation research.

AB  - We analyze numerically properties of small-size infrared photovoltaic devices based on complex two-dimensional Hg1-xCdxTe heterostructures. An original iteration scheme was used to solve the system of nonlinear continuity equations and the Poisson equation. All quantities are expressed as functions of electric potential and Fermi quasi-levels. The results of calculations are presented as the maps showing spatial distribution of sensitivity and density of noise generation for 4 types of heterostructures. In addition, resulting parameters of the devices are summarized in the table. This approach may help to understand specific features of the heterostructural devices and optimize their performance. The simulations show viability of constructing devices with active region buried inside a wide gap material where existing potential barriers prevent adverse effects of both recombination of photogenerated carriers and thermal generation at surfaces, interfaces and contacts.

AB  - This paper traces the development of a software tool, based oil a combination of artificial neural networks (ANN) and a few process equations. aiming to serve as a backup operation instrument in the reference generation for real-time controllers of a steel tandem cold mill By emulating the mathematical model responsible for generating presets under normal operational conditions, the system works as ail option to maintain plant operation in the event of a failure in the processing unit that executes the mathematical model. The system, built from the production data collected over six years of plant operation, steered to the replacement of the former backup operation mode (based oil a lookup table). which degraded both product quality and plant productivity. The study showed that ANN are appropriated tools for the intended purpose and that by this instrument it is possible to achieve nearly the totality of the presets needed by this land of process. The text characterizes the problem, relates the investigated options to solve it. justifies the choice of the ANN approach, describes the methodology and system implementation and, finally, shows and discusses the attained results.

AB  - Geographical variation in traits related to fitness is often the result of adaptive evolution. Stress resistance traits in Drosophila often show clinal variation, suggesting that selection affects resistance traits either directly or indirectly. Multiple stress resistance traits were investigated in 45 natural populations of Drosophila ananassae collected from all over India. There was significant positive correlation between starvation resistance and lipid content. Significant negative correlations between desiccation and lipid content and between desiccation and heat resistance were also found. Flies from lower latitudes had higher starvation resistance, heat resistance and lipid content but the pattern was reversed for desiccation resistance. These results suggest that flies from different localities varied in their susceptibility to starvation because of difference in their propensity to store body lipid. Multiple regression analysis provided evidence of climatic selection driven by latitudinal variation in the seasonal amplitude of temperature and humidity changes within the Indian. Finally, our results suggest a high degree of variation in stress resistance at the population level in D. ananassae.

AB  - The growing understanding of the link between carbon emissions and global warming has been promoting a discussion on the environmental and safety viability of nuclear power generation. Current open fuel cycle reactors, however, result in low energy efficiency and produce large volumes of nuclear waste. More advanced nuclear reactors, which are currently under investigation, are expected to allow more efficient and safer use of nuclear energy. In all these cases, the fuel cladding is the most important safety barrier in fission nuclear reactors, as it restrains most of the radioactive fission products within its volume. The selection of fuel cladding material is based on many design constraints, such as neutron absorption cross section, service temperature, mechanical strength, toughness, neutron radiation resistance, thermal expansion, thermal conductivity, and chemical compatibility. The present paper reviews the selection of nuclear fuel cladding materials since the early reactors, illustrating some of the main failure modes and briefly discussing the challenges facing the development of fuel cladding materials for generation IV reactors.

AB  - The sustainability of a small-scale self-consumption wood-energy chain for heat generation in central Italy was analyzed from a technical, economic and energetic point of view. A micro-chain was developed within the CRA-ING farm at Monterotondo (Rome, Italy): The purpose of this system was to produce biomass for supplying a heating plant within the CRA-ING property as a substitute for diesel fuel. A poplar short rotation coppice, established with clones AF2, AF6 and Monviso, fed the micro-chain. The rotation was biennial. The average plantation production (Mg-d.m.center dot ha(-1)center dot year(-1)) was 10.2, with a maximum of 13.53 for the twin-rows AF2 and a minimum of 8.00 for the single-row Monviso. The economic assessment was based on the Net Present Value (NPV) method and the equivalent annuity cost, and found an average saving of 15.60 euro center dot GJ(-1) of heat generated by the wood chips heating system in comparison with the diesel heating system over a 10 year lifetime of the thermal power plant. The energy assessment of the poplar plantation, carried out using the Gross Energy Requirements method, reported an energy output/input ratio of 12.3. The energy output/input ratio of the whole micro-chain was 4.5.

AB  - Central ideas from thermal biology, including thermal performance curves and tolerances, have been widely used to evaluate how changes in environmental means and variances generate changes in fitness, selection and microevolution in response to climate change. We summarize the opportunities and challenges for extending this approach to understanding the consequences of extreme climatic events. Using statistical tools from extreme value theory, we show how distributions of thermal extremes vary with latitude, time scale and climate change. Second, we review how performance curves and tolerances have been used to predict the fitness and evolutionary responses to climate change and climate gradients. Performance curves and tolerances change with prior thermal history and with time scale, complicating their use for predicting responses to thermal extremes. Third, we describe several recent case studies showing how infrequent extreme events can have outsized effects on the evolution of performance curves and heat tolerance. A key issue is whether thermal extremes affect reproduction or survival, and how these combine to determine overall fitness. We argue that a greater focus on tails-in the distribution of environmental extremes, and in the upper ends of performance curves-is needed to understand the consequences of extreme events.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'Behavioural, ecological and evolutionary responses to extreme climatic events'.

AB  - The evolutionary speed hypothesis (ESH) proposes a causal mechanism for the latitudinal diversity gradient. The central idea of the ESH is that warmer temperatures lead to shorter generation times and increased mutation rates. On an absolute time scale, both should lead to an acceleration of selection and drift. Based on the ESH, we developed predictions regarding the distribution of intraspecific genetic diversity: populations of ectothermic species with more generations per year owing to warmer ambient temperatures should be more differentiated from each other, accumulate more mutations and show evidence for increased mutation rates compared with populations in colder regions. We used the multivoltine insect species Chironomus riparius to test these predictions with cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequence data and found that populations from warmer regions are indeed significantly more differentiated and have significantly more derived haplotypes than populations from colder regions. We also found a significant correlation of the annual mean temperature with the population mutation parameter 0 that serves as a proxy for the per generation mutation rate under certain assumptions. This pattern could be corroborated with two nuclear loci. Overall, our results support the ESH and indicate that the thermal regime experienced may be crucially driving the evolution of ectotherms and may thus ultimately govern their speciation rate.

TI  - Experience from ABB's PFBC technology and its application to utility size power plants

CP  - 60th Annual Meeting of the American-Power-Conference
AB  - Almost 95,000 hours of operation have been accumulated on widely different coals in Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combined Cycle (PFBC) plants in Sweden, Spain, USA and Japan. Valuable feedback has been obtained from these P200 plants, in the 70-150 MWe range, and has been subsequently incorporated into the design of the world's first P800 PFBC plant. This 360 MWe plant is currently under construction at Karita in Japan for Kyushu Electric Power Co. by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy industries (IHI), one of ABB's licensees in Japan.
   The combined experience from ABB's existing PFBC plants has demonstrated the viability of ABB's PFBC technology and the general simplicity of the concept, as well as plant control principles and serviceability. As a result, this technology is now commercially offered worldwide by ABB Carbon, together with its licensees and partners, and PFBC is being recognized as a competitive solution for generation of power and for combined heat and power applications.
   The combined cycle feature makes PFBC highly efficient for power generation. When compared with conventional power plants, and for the same steam conditions, a PFBC plant typically produces 10% more electricity from the same amount of coal.
   Fuel flexibility is also a keystone of the PFBC technology. Even with a standard plant, PFBC can use a wide range of coals, and other solid fuels. This was a prerequisite for the Karita plant, which is designed to use any coal from a broad spectrum.
   This paper summarizes the operation experiences from the first P200 plants, Vartan in Sweden, Tidd in USA, Escatron in Spain and the next, improved design in Wakamatsu, Japan. The design principles used and risk mitigation for the utility sized P800 power plant are also discussed.

AB  - Temperature profoundly affects species' geographic ranges, but the extent to which it limits contemporary range edges has been difficult to assess from laboratory experiments of thermal tolerance. The persistence of populations depends on temperature-mediated outcomes of ecological and demographic processes across all stages of a species' life history, as well as any adaptation to local temperature regimes. We assessed the relationships between sea temperature and observed distributional ranges for 1,790 shallow-water marine species from 10 animal classes and found remarkable consistencies in trends in realized thermal limits among taxa and ocean basins, as well as general agreement with previous laboratory findings. Realized thermal niches increase from the Equator towards cold-temperate locations, despite an opposite trend in geographic range size. Species' cool distribution limits are best predicted by the magnitude of seasonality within their range, while a relatively firm thermal barrier exists on the equatorward range edge for temperate species. Our findings of consistencies in realized thermal limits indicate potential limits to adaptation among common marine species and highlight the value of realized thermal niches for predicting species' distributional dynamics in warming seas.

AB  - contrast to previous studies of rapid cold-hardening (RCH), which have investigated the responses of insects maintained under 'summer conditions' (20 degrees to 25 degrees C), this study focuses on the ability of low-temperature acclimated insects to undergo RCH. When the grain aphid Sitobion avenae Fabricus was low-temperature acclimated by rearing for three generations at 10 degrees C, the discriminating temperatures (temperature that results in approximately 20% survival after direct transfer from the rearing temperature to a sub-zero temperature for a period of 3 h), of first instar nymphs and adult aphids were -11.5 degrees and -12 degrees C, respectively. Maximum rapid cold-hardening was induced by cooling aphids at 0 degrees C for 2 h (nymphs) or 30 min (adults), resulting in survival at the respective discriminating temperatures increasing from 26% to 96% (nymphs) and 22% to 70% (adults). Cooling from 10 degrees to 0 degrees C at 1 degrees, 0.1 degrees and 0.05 degrees C min(-1) significantly increased survival of nymphs at the discriminating temperature, but not of adults. There were no 'ecological costs' associated with rapid cold-hardening at 0 degrees C, or with exposure of rapidly cold-hardened aphids to the discriminating temperatures; fecundity and longevity, in both nymphs and adults were either similar to control aphids or significantly increased. The study demonstrates that rapid cold-hardening ability is retained in aphids that have already undergone cold-acclimation, as would be the case in overwintering aphids. Both rapid cold-hardening and subsequent exposure at previously lethal temperatures can enhance fitness in surviving individuals.

AB  - Environmental impact due to power generation through coal combustion sector is well known because inevitably interferes with the environment. Today, especially in the EU climate protection policies and the environment, especially trough measure to reduce CO2, are becoming more radical making the use of coal more difficult. This even more because in December 2015 was signed Paris Agreement which aims reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, especially CO2 as a measure to combat climate change and global warming so that global warming be below 2 degrees C. One of the possibilities to achieve this target is use of biomass to electrical energy production. Biomass resource neutral in terms of carbon dioxide can be an important element of diversification of energy sources because it is very accessible and includes, apart from waste biomass and energy crops with high productivity calorific interesting that can also be used to restore degraded industrial land. The aim of the present study is to present a possibility of co-combustion biomass with lignite in large boiler of thermal power plants.

AB  - Studies explaining the choice of model structure for population viability analysis (PVA) are rare and no such study exists for butterfly species, a focal group for conservation. Here, we describe in detail the development of a model to predict population viability of a glacial relict butterfly species, Boloria eunomia, under climate change. We compared four alternative formulations of an individual-based model, differing in the environmental factors acting on the survival of immature life stages: temperature (only temperature impact), weather (temperature, precipitation, and sunshine), temperature and parasitism, and weather and parasitism. Following pattern-oriented modeling, four observed patterns were used to contrast these models: one qualitative (response of population size to habitat parameters) and three quantitative ones describing population dynamics during eight years (mean and variability of population size, and magnitude of the temporal autocorrelation in yearly population growth rates). The four model formulations were not equally able to depict population dynamics under current environmental conditions; the model including only temperature was selected as the most parsimonious model sufficiently well reproducing the empirical patterns. We used all four model formulations to test a range of climate change scenarios that were characterized by changes in both mean and variability of the weather variables. All models predicted adverse effects of climate change and resulted in the same ranking of mean climate change scenarios. However, models differed in their absolute values of population viability measures, underlining the need to explicitly choose the most appropriate model formulation and avoid arbitrary usage of environmental drivers in a model. We conclude that further applications of pattern-oriented modeling to butterfly and other species are likely to help in identifying the key factors impacting the viability of certain taxa, which, ultimately, will aid and speed up informed management decisions for endangered species under climate change.

AB  - Effects of different combinations of stressors (viz. temperature, food level) on growth, developmental and survival rates of Rana temporaria tadpoles from two geographically widely (approximate to 1500 km) separated populations were studied in a common garden experiment. In both populations, low temperature and low food level lead to lowered growth rates and delayed metamorphosis, whereas high temperature and high food level had the opposite effect. Tadpoles from north metamorphosed earlier and exhibited higher growth rates than tadpoles from south, suggesting local adaptation to shorter growth period and cooler ambient temperature in north. Size at metamorphosis did not differ between the two populations, but when the differences in metamorphic age were accounted for, then the tadpoles from north were larger than those from south. These results suggest considerable adaptive genetic differentiation in growth rates, size and timing of metamorphosis between northern and southern R. temporaria populations. In both populations, high food levels tended to reduce tadpole survival rates and there was a negative correlation between growth and survival rates across different treatments in both populations. In general, tadpoles from north experienced high mortality rates in high food level - low temperature treatments, whereas southern tadpoles experienced high mortality in high food level-high temperature treatments. This suggest that there may be genetic differences among different populations as how they would be influenced by high nutrient loads, such as brought along for example by fertilization of forest or agricultural soils.

AB  - Climate change will impact coral-reef fishes through effects on individual performance, trophic linkages, recruitment dynamics, population connectivity and other ecosystem processes. The most immediate impacts will be a loss of diversity and changes to fish community composition as a result of coral bleaching. Coral-dependent fishes suffer the most rapid population declines as coral is lost; however, many other species will exhibit long-term declines due to loss of settlement habitat and erosion of habitat structural complexity. Increased ocean temperature will affect the physiological performance and behaviour of coral reef fishes, especially during their early life history. Small temperature increases might favour larval development, but this could be counteracted by negative effects on adult reproduction. Already variable recruitment will become even more unpredictable. This will make optimal harvest strategies for coral reef fisheries more difficult to determine and populations more susceptible to overfishing. A substantial number of species could exhibit range shifts, with implications for extinction risk of small-range species near the margins of reef development. There are critical gaps in our knowledge of how climate change will affect tropical marine fishes. Predictions are often based on temperate examples, which may be inappropriate for tropical species. Improved projections of how ocean currents and primary productivity will change are needed to better predict how reef fish population dynamics and connectivity patterns will change. Finally, the potential for adaptation to climate change needs more attention. Many coral reef fishes have geographical ranges spanning a wide temperature gradient and some have short generation times. These characteristics are conducive to acclimation or local adaptation to climate change and provide hope that the more resilient species will persist if immediate action is taken to stabilize Earth's climate.

AB  - The colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri is a cosmopolitan, marine filter feeder, introduced as a laboratory research organism in the 1950s. Currently, it is widely used in many laboratories to investigate a variety of biological questions. Recently, it has become a species of concern, as it is an invasive species in many coastal environments. Here, we review studies on the geographical distribution of the species, sexual and asexual reproduction in the field, tolerance to temperature, salinity and anthropogenic activity, polychromatism, enzymatic polymorphism, and the genetic basis of pigmentation. Studying the relationship between genetic polymorphism and the adaptation of B. schlosseri to environmental stress is a challenge of future research and will improve our understanding of its evolutionary success and invasive potential.

AB  - This work introduces a novel hybrid system which uses the cooling water of a concentrated PV/T as a preheated water for lithium bromide-water-based Kalina cycle. The PV/T is a combination between solar photovoltaic cells and solar thermal collector. The solar cells convert the sunlight into electricity, and the remaining heat gets absorbed by the collector for additional power generation. As well as, extracting the excess heat from PV cells enhances its electrical efficiency. The Kalina power cycle is mainly driven by concentrated solar parabolic collectors (CSP). The advantage of combining these 2 systems is to employ the heat rejected from the concentrated solar-based PV cells for further electricity generation, thus increasing the system overall efficiency. The system of concentrated solar collectors is divided into 2 parts to avoid getting very high temperature for the PV cells: concentrated solar collectors with PV cells and without PV cells. Due to the high temperature of water which returns from the Kalina cycle, a cooling tower is employed to cool the water before entering the concentrated PV/T system. The mathematical model of the proposed system has been presented and simulated to investigate the effect of the main controlling variables on the proposed system performance: generator temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and the ambient temperature. The results show that the amount of solar radiation is the primary variable for the investigated system energy productivity, while the design temperature of generator is found to be the most parameter that affects the system overall efficiency. While the overall efficiency is around 18% to 23%, combining PV/T with the proposed solar Kalina cycle increases the system overall efficiency by 22% to 27%. The electrical conversion efficiency of the proposed system is 40% to 68% much more compared to PV/T alone system.

AB  - Physiological limits determine susceptibility to environmental changes, and can be assessed at the individual, population or species/lineage levels. Here I discuss these levels in Drosophila, and consider implications for determining species susceptibility to climate change. Limits at the individual level in Drosophila depend on experimental technique and on the context in which traits are evaluated. At the population level, evidence from selection experiments particularly involving Drosophila melanogaster indicate high levels of heritable variation and evolvability for coping with thermal stresses and aridity. An exception is resistance to high temperatures, which reaches a plateau in selection experiments and has a low heritability/evolvability when temperatures are ramped up to a stressful level. In tropical Drosophila species, populations are limited in their ability to evolve increased desiccation and cold resistance. Population limits can arise from trait and gene interactions but results from different laboratory studies are inconsistent and likely to underestimate the strength of interactions under field conditions. Species and lineage comparisons suggest phylogenetic conservatism for resistance to thermal extremes and other stresses. Plastic responses set individual limits but appear to evolve slowly in Drosophila. There is more species-level variation in lower thermal limits and desiccation resistance compared with upper limits, which might reflect different selection pressures and/or low evolvability. When extremes are considered, tropical Drosophila species do not appear more threatened than temperate species by higher temperatures associated with global warming, contrary to recent conjectures. However, species from the humid tropics may be threatened if they cannot adapt genetically to drier conditions.

AB  - We present a novel hybrid membrane system that operates as a heat engine capable of utilizing low-grade thermal energy, which is not readily recoverable with existing technologies. The closed-loop system combines membrane distillation (MD), which generates concentrated and pure water streams by thermal separation, and pressure retarded osmosis (PRO), which converts the energy of mixing to electricity by a hydro-turbine. The PRO-MD system was modeled by coupling the mass and energy flows between the thermal separation (MD) and power generation (PRO) stages for heat source temperatures ranging from 40 to 80 degrees C and working concentrations of 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mol/kg NaCl. The factors controlling the energy efficiency of the heat engine were evaluated for both limited and unlimited mass and heat transfer kinetics in the thermal separation stage. In both cases, the relative flow rate between the MD permeate (distillate) and feed streams is identified as an important operation parameter. There is an optimal relative flow rate that maximizes the overall energy efficiency of the PRO-MD system for given working temperatures and concentration. In the case of unlimited mass and heat transfer kinetics, the energy efficiency of the system can be analytically determined based on thermodynamics. Our assessment indicates that the hybrid PRO-MD system can theoretically achieve an energy efficiency of 9.8% (81.6% of the Carnot efficiency) with hot and cold working temperatures of 60 and 20 degrees C, respectively, and a working solution of 1.0 M NaCl. When mass and heat transfer kinetics are limited, conditions that more closely represent actual operations, the practical energy efficiency will be lower than the theoretically achievable efficiency. In such practical operations, utilizing a higher working concentration will yield greater energy efficiency. Overall, our study demonstrates the theoretical viability of the PRO-MD system and identifies the key factors for performance optimization.

AB  - This paper attempts to apply a one dimensional model on four source rocks (Belayim, Lower Rudeis, Thebes, and Brown Limestone formations), in East Warda concession, October oil field, throughout the different geological times. Moreover, the fundamental aspects of the petroleum system in the study area is evaluated through studying maturation and hydrocarbon potential in order to gain an understanding of onset of oil generation and expulsion. The position of three wells (syn. or pseudo wells) is proposed based on the available geological and thermal data. Also, the existing temperature database is enhanced by using the available temperature data for 220 wells in the Gulf of Suez and the Red Sea, 53 wells in the Mediterranean Sea, 29 wells in the Nile delta, 7 wells in Sinai. 2 wells in Upper Egypt and 39 wells in the Western desert. Finally, the timing of oil generation for Belayim, Thebes, Lower Rudeis and Brown Limestone source rocks in the Northern Gulf of Suez area is updated. From this study we conclude that, the cumulative yield of the Belayim and Lower Rudeis formations is lower than that of the Thebes and Brown Limestone formations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - 1. Understanding the conditions that allow for the occurrence of an additional generation in populations that are usually univoltine is important under the present climate warming. In temperate areas, a second generation is enabled through the emergence of a time window that opens when first-generation individuals are ready to reproduce and closes when second-generation individuals cannot complete development before the onset of winter. 2. The conditions that limit the width of this window were studied inPyrrhocoris apterus(Heteroptera: Pyrrhocoridae), a ground-inhabiting heteropteran overwintering in facultative adult diapause, whose populations in Central Europe have typically been univoltine until the 1980s. 3. The frequency of females of the first generation that started to lay eggs decreased from 70% in June to zero in early August, but oviposition of these females continued until the end of August. Using thermal constants for egg-adult development and temperature data, this study found that the development of most second-generation individuals could only be completed before the start of winter if hastened through behavioural thermoregulation. 4. Consequences of temperature increase on the width of the thermal window were calculated. Increasing temperature causes the time window to open earlier and close later by accelerating maturation of first-generation females and improving conditions for maturing of the second-generation individuals in late summer and autumn. 5. Climate warming will create conditions that facilitate the occurrence of a second generation in a year in typically univoltine populations of this species.

AB  - Microplastics are sometimes considered not harmful at environmentally relevant concentrations. Yet, such studies were conducted under standard thermal conditions and thereby ignored the impacts of higher mean temperatures (MT), and especially daily temperature fluctuations (DTF) under global warming. Moreover, an evolutionary perspective may further benefit the future risk assessment of microplastics under global warming. Here, we investigated the effects of two generations of exposure to an environmentally relevant concentration of polystyrene microplastics (5 mu g L-1) under six thermal conditions (2 MT x 3 DTF) on the life history, physiology, and behaviour of Daphnia magna. To assess the impact of thermal evolution we thereby compared Daphnia populations from high and low latitudes. At the standard ecotoxic thermal conditions (constant 20 degrees C) microplastics almost had no effect except for a slight reduction of the heartbeat rate. Yet, at the challenging thermal conditions (higher MT and/or DTF), microplastics affected each tested variable and caused an earlier maturation, a higher fecundity and intrinsic growth rate, a decreased heartbeat rate, and an increased swimming speed. These effects may be partly explained by hormesis and/or an adaptive response to stress in Daphnia. Moreover, exposure to microplastics at the higher mean temperature increased the fecundity and intrinsic growth rate of cold-adapted high-latitude Daphnia, but not of the warm-adapted low-latitude Daphnia, suggesting that thermal evolution in high-latitude Daphnia may buffer the effects of microplastics under future warming. Our results highlight the critical importance of DTF and thermal evolution for a more realistic risk assessment of microplastics under global warming.

AB  - Due to ongoing climate change, short-term extreme heat waves in the summer are expected to be more frequent. Insect eggs are sensitive to thermal stress. This raises the question of whether herbivore insects' thermal adaptability would be changed after a single extreme heat wave at the egg stage. In this study, we examined the developmental performance of Ostrinia fumacalis Guenee at 25 degrees C, 27 degrees C, 29 degrees C or 31 degrees C after a single extreme heat wave (42 degrees C) for 0 h (control), 1 h, 2 h, or 3 h at the egg stage. The results showed that O. furnacalis at the egg or larval stage was more sensitive to a single heat wave than it was at the pupae or adult stage. After a single heat wave, O. furnacalis showed a reduced egg-hatching rate or reduced larval survival rate, but the optimum temperature for egg hatching and larval survival was higher than that in the control. The upper temperature threshold and optimum temperature for larval development in the control were higher than that after a single extreme heat wave. Both male and female pupal weight decreased with increasing temperature, and pupal weight decreased faster in females than in males. The Cox proportional hazard model showed that when O. furnacalis developed at 25 degrees C, the instantaneous death risk of adults with a 3 h heat wave at the egg stage was higher than that of the control, but when O. furnacalis developed at 29 degrees C and 31 degrees C, the instantaneous death risk of adults after a heat wave was significantly lower than that of the control. Our study highlights the effect of a single heat wave on O. fumacalis eggs and the subsequent development of survival individuals.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) leads to significant changes in seawater carbon chemistry, broadly affects marine organisms, and considered as a global threat to the fitness of marine ecosystems. Due to the crucial role of copepods in marine food webs of transferring energy from primary producers to higher trophic levels, numerous studies have been conducted to examine the impacts of OA on biological traits of copepods such as growth and reproduction. Under OA stress, the copepods demonstrated species-specific and stage-dependent responses. Notably, different populations of the same copepod species demonstrated different sensitivities to the increased pCO(2). In copepods, the deleterious effects of OA are also reinforced by other naturally occurring co-stressors (e.g., thermal stress, food deprivation, and metal pollution). Given that most OA stress studies have focused on the effects of short-term exposure (shorter than a single generation), experiments using adults might have underestimated the damaging effects of OA and the long-term multigenerational exposure to multiple stressors (e.g., increased pCO(2) and food shortage) will be required. Particularly, omics-based technologies (e.g., genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) will be helpful to better understand the underlying processes behind biological responses (e.g., survival, development, and offspring production) at the mechanistic level which will improve our predictions of the responses of copepods to climate change stressors including OA.

AB  - Whole person adaptive comfort is discussed with reference to recent findings in molecular scale systems biology. The observations are upscaled to hypotheses relating to less traditional interpretations of thermal processes, which have new implications for indoor climate management and design. Arguments are presented for a revision of current focus, model and paradigm. The issue is seen as a problem of integrating theoretical development, conceptual modeling and as an investigation of the extent to which environments and acclimatization can be used to achieve individual fitness and health, not only at the subjective comfort level, as hitherto promoted. It is argued that there are many questions yet to be asked about adaptability before celebrating a particular adaptive state.

AB  - Sex allocation theory predicts that mothers should adjust their sex-specific reproductive investment in relation to the predicted fitness returns from sons versus daughters. Sex allocation theory has proved to be successful in some invertebrate taxa but data on vertebrates often fail to show the predicted shift in sex ratio or sex-specific resource investment. This is likely to be partly explained by simplistic assumptions of vertebrate life-history and mechanistic constraints, but also because the fundamental assumption of sex-specific fitness return on investment is rarely supported by empirical data. In short-lived species, the time of hatching or parturition can have a strong impact on the age and size at maturity. Thus, if selection favors adult sexual-size dimorphism, females can maximize their fitness by adjusting offspring sex over the reproductive season. We show that in mallee dragons, Ctenophorus fordi, date of hatching is positively related to female reproductive output but has little, if any, effect on male reproductive success, suggesting selection for a seasonal shift in offspring sex ratio. We used a combination of field and laboratory data collected over two years to test if female dragons adjust their sex allocation over the season to ensure an adaptive match between time of hatching and offspring sex. Contrary to our predictions, we found no effect of laying date on sex ratio, nor did we find any evidence for within-female between-clutch sex-ratio adjustment. Furthermore, there was no differential resource investment into male and female offspring within or between clutches and sex ratios did not correlate with female condition or any partner traits. Consequently, despite evidence for selection for a seasonal sex-ratio shift, female mallee dragons do not seem to exercise any control over sex determination. The results are discussed in relation to potential constraints on sex-ratio adjustment, alternative selection pressures, and the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination.

AB  - Natural populations respond to selection pressures like increasing local temperatures in many ways, including plasticity and adaptation. To predict the response of ectotherms like lizards to local temperature increase, it is essential to estimate phenotypic variation in and determine the heritability of temperature-related traits like average field body temperature (T-b) and preferred temperature (T-p). We measured T-p of Uta stansburiana in a laboratory thermal gradient and assessed the contribution of sex, reproductive status and throat color genotype to phenotypic variation in T-b of adult lizards. Females had higher T-p than males. However, they temporarily preferred lower temperature when gravid than when nongravid. Using a nested half-sib design for genetic crosses in the laboratory, we estimated relative contributions of additive genetic variation and maternal effects to T-p of hatchlings. Our results show that maternal effects, but not additive genetic variation, influence T-p of hatchlings in U. stansburiana. Maternal T-p and the presence or absence of blue throat color alleles significantly influenced T-p of hatchlings. We discuss ecological and evolutionary consequences of these maternal effects in the context of rapid climate change and natural selection that we measure on progeny survival to maturity as a function of maternal T-p.

KW  - LOW-TEMPERATURE
AB  - Using multilocus individual heterozygosity, a method is developed to estimate the outcrossing rates of a population over a few previous generations. Considering that individuals originate either from outcrossing or from n successive selfing generations from an outbred ancestor, a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator is described that gives estimates of past outcrossing rates in terms of proportions of individuals with different n values. Heterozygosities at several unlinked codominant loci are used to assign n values to each individual. This method also allows a test of whether populations are in inbreeding equilibrium. The estimator's reliability was checked using simulations for different mating histories. We show that this ML estimator can provide estimates of outcrossing rates for the final generation outcrossing rate (t(0)) and a mean of the preceding rates (t(p)) and can detect major temporal variation in the mating system. The method is most efficient foe low to intermediate outcrossing levels. Applied to nine populations of wheat, this method gave estimates of t(0) and t(p). These estimates confirmed the absence of outcrossing (t(0) = 0) in the two populations subjected to manual selling. For free-mating wheat populations, it detected lower final generation outcrossing rates (t(0) = 0-0.06) than those expected from global heterozygosity (t = 0.02-0.09). This estimator appears to be a new and efficient way to describe the multilocus heterozygosity of a population, complementary to Fis and progeny analysis approaches.

AB  - Low temperature and desiccation stress are thought to be mechanistically similar in insects, and several studies indicate that there is a degree of cross-tolerance between them, such that increased cold tolerance results in greater desiccation tolerance and vice versa. This assertion is tested at an evolutionary scale by examining basal cold tolerance, rapid cold-hardening (RCH) and chill coma recovery in replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster selected for desiccation resistance (with controls for both selection and concomitant starvation) for over 50 generations. All of the populations display a RCH response, and there is no effect of selection regime on RCH or basal cold tolerance, although there are differences in basal cold tolerance between sampling dates, apparently related to inter-individual variation in development time. Flies selected for desiccation tolerance recover from chill coma slightly, but significantly, faster than control and starvation-control flies. These findings provide little support for cross-tolerance between survival of near-lethal cold and desiccation stress in D. melanogaster.

AB  - Biodiesel was generated through whole cell catalyzed transesterification of acid oil, to the extent of up to 92%. The fuel properties of biodiesel (B100) and its blend (B20) were determined and compared with standard biodiesel as per American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard (ASTM D6751). B100 and B20 showed good pour point of -26 degrees C and -29 degrees C, respectively, indicating their operation viability in colder environment. Other properties of biodiesel are quite similar to petroleum diesel and ASTM standard. The results of this study reveal the potential use of acid oil as feedstock for generation of fuel grade biodiesel through biocatalyzed transesterification.

AB  - This study examined the effects of two selection treatments (elevated water temperature and air exposure) on the genetic and physiological characteristics of the juvenile marine mussel, Mytilus edulis (< 10 mm). Genetic effects were measured on five allozymes and fitness assessed using physiological tests to estimate energy balance (scope for growth) as well as size, growth and survival. The in vitro treatments resulted in 48% mortality from an air exposure of 11 h at 27 degrees C and 76% mortality from a 6-h exposure to 33 degrees C water. Survivors (n = 1,152) of each treatment along with controls (n = 2,304) were measured and randomly placed in compartmentalized cages. Mussels were deployed to three bays in Prince Edward Island, Canada and monitored over a 10-month period. Initially, both of the treatments had an effect on mussel size and increased the heterozygosity of the surviving mussels. Physiological analyses after 3 months in the field showed that the two treated mussels showed lower metabolic rate that the control group. After 10 months in the field, the treated mussels were larger and had lower mortality than the untreated control mussels. Unexplained environmental interaction in each of the bays had an effect on allelic frequencies and heterozygosity. Overall, the results demonstrate that simple husbandry techniques can be used to increase the productivity of mussel seed and heterozygosity measures can be used to assess fitness. However, more field data is needed to determine the consistency of the increased productivity and if the increased productivity justifies the costs of a selective treatment. Furthermore, because the level of heterozygosity in juvenile mussel populations can vary considerably, both spatially and temporally, it may be effective as a warning of future natural mass mortality when overall heterozygosity levels are found to be low.

AB  - Contemporary evolution of thermal physiology has the potential to help limit the physiological stress associated with rapidly changing thermal environments; however it is unclear if wild populations can respond quickly enough for such changes to be effective. We used native Canadian Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) sunfish, and non-native Pumpkinseed introduced into the milder climate of Spain 100 years ago, to assess genetic differences in thermal physiology in response to the warmer non-native climate. We compared temperature performance reaction norms of two Canadian and two Spanish Pumpkinseed populations born and raised within a common environment. We found that Canadian Pumpkinseed had higher routine metabolic rates when measured at seasonally high temperatures (15 degrees C in winter, 30 degrees C in summer), and that Spanish Pumpkinseed had higher critical thermal maxima when acclimated to 30 degrees C in the summer. Growth rates were not significantly different among populations, however Canadian Pumpkinseed tended to have faster growth at the warmest temperatures measured (32 degrees C). The observed differences in physiology among Canadian and Spanish populations at the warmest acclimation temperatures are consistent with the introduced populations being better suited to the warmer non-native climate than native populations. The observed differences could be the result of either founder effects, genetic drift, and/or contemporary adaptive evolution in the warmer nonnative climate.

AB  - Forty-one range-wide Callitropsis nootkatensis (D. Don) Orsted (syn. Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Spach) populations were tested at 12 geographically and ecologically diverse sites throughout British Columbia, Canada. There were significant region and population within region effects for 15-year height at most sites but not for adaptability, a binary trait combining survival and cold hardiness. Across-site analysis revealed significant site by population within region interaction for both traits. These interactions were less pronounced when just the core sites were analysed and without two southern disjunct populations. Based on a productivity index that combined height, survival, and cold hardiness, populations were adapted to broad temperature gradients compared with most temperate tree species and were relatively insensitive to moisture. Only the northern California population from the extreme southernmost part of the species' range had consistent and significant adaptive differentiation, showing maladaptation characterized by severe cold damage and mortality at all test sites. Northern populations grew slowly but survived well. Productivity of this montane species is likely to increase in situ with projected warming across the range of tested sites. Transfer to sites warmer than the population origin increases productivity. Currently and in the long term, populations from the core of the species' range can be widely transferred for reforestation with minimal risk of maladaptation, provided highly inbred sources from isolated, small populations and sites at risk for yellow cypress decline are avoided.

AB  - The 2022 World Cup creates great opportunities for the country of Qatar, but also poses significant challenges. In this study the main challenge of maintaining thermal comfort conditions within the football arenas is presented, with respect to the heat stress index (HSI) and the aero-thermal comfort thresholds established for opened stadiums. Potential cooling strategies for delivering tolerant comfort levels are introduced, followed by their functional strengths and limitations for the hot-humid climate of Qatar. An estimation of the cooling load for semi-outdoor stadiums in Qatar is also presented. The results, produced by dynamic thermal modelling, indicated that a load of 115 MW h per game should be at least consumed in order to provide both indoor and outdoor thermal comfort conditions. Finally, the use of solar energy technologies for the generation of electricity and cooling are evaluated, based on their viability beyond the 2022 World Cup event, towards the nation's targets for sustainability and lasting legacy.

AB  - Oviposition-site choice has profound fitness consequences for both a mother and her offspring. The adaptive significance of oviposition behaviour for both generations depends on two rarely considered assumptions: (1) the fit of maternal oviposition preferences with local phenotypic optimum (adaptive accuracy) and (2) the predictability of future conditions for developing offspring based on conditions at the time of oviposition. We examined both assumptions using temperature oviposition preferences (T (p,o)) previously measured under laboratory conditions in the alpine newt, Ichthyosaura (formerly Triturus) alpestris. Analyses of temperature time series in the newt natural environment revealed, in agreement with oviposition-site choice of female newts, that T (p,o) were closer to phenotypic optima at the water surface than at the maximal depth (bottom). Temperature time series in both depths contained a high proportion of predictable variation, though bottom thermal conditions were more predictable than those at the water surface. We concluded that female newts have to trade the adaptive accuracy of T (p,o) for the predictability of future thermal conditions at the time of oviposition.

AB  - 1. In Drosophila melanogaster, the cold-shock tolerance of adult flies at -7-degrees-C increased 22% after a prior 2 h exposure to 4-degrees-C as measured by LD50, the dose (degree minutes of exposure to subzero temperature) which resulted in 50% mortality.
   2. Cold-shock tolerance was further significantly increased by selecting cold resistant lines by exposure of adults (1) to 4-degrees-C for 2 h (short-term chilling), or (2) to -7-degrees-C for 80-120 min (cold shock), or (3) to short-term chilling followed by cold-shock.
   3. After ten generations of selection, the greatest increase in cold-shock tolerance was found in flies selected using the combined exposure of short-term chilling and cold shock. LD50s increased 33% in comparison with the unselected control strain when no chilling pre-treatment was given prior to cold shock at -7-degrees-C.
   4. The rapid cold-hardening response increased 82% in the line selected by the short-term chilling and cold-shock regime.
   5. The enhanced cold-shock tolerance was relatively stable since no decrease was observed after four generations without selection.
   6. This report shows the role of short-term adaptation as well as selection in the capacity to survive low temperatures in non-diapausing stages of insects.

AB  - Integrating long-term ecological observations with experimental findings on species response and tolerance to environmental stress supports an understanding of climate effects on population dynamics. Here, we combine the two approaches, laboratory experiments and analysis of multi-decadal time-series, to understand the consequences of climate anomalies and ongoing change for the population dynamics of a eurythermal littoral species, Carcinus aestuarii. For the generation of cause and effect hypotheses we investigated the thermal response of crab embryos at four developmental stages. We first measured metabolic rate variations in embryos following acute warming (16-24 degrees C) and after incubation at 20 and 24 degrees C for limited periods. All experiments consistently revealed differential thermal responses depending on the developmental stage. Temperature-induced changes in metabolic activity of early embryonic stages of blastula and gastrula suggested the onset of abnormal development. In contrast, later developmental stages, characterized by tissue and organ differentiation, were marginally affected by temperature anomalies, indicating enhanced resilience to thermal stress. Then, we extended these findings to a larger, population scale, by analyzing a time-series of C. aestuarii landings in the Venice lagoon from 1945 to 2010 (ripe crabs were recorded separately) in relation to temperature. Landings and extreme climatic events showed marked long-term and short-term variations. We found negative relationships between landings and thermal stress indices on both timescales, with time lags consistent with an impact on crab early life stages. When quantitatively evaluating the influence of thermal stress on population dynamics, we found that it has a comparable effect to that of the biomass of spawners. This work provides strong evidence that physiological responses to climatic anomalies translate into population-level changes and that apparently tolerant species may be impacted before the ontogeny of eurythermy. These ontogenetic bottlenecks markedly shape population dynamics and require study to assess the effects of global change.

AB  - Seed mass is a central plant life history trait that varies and evolves due to selection by biotic or abiotic factors. To determine the factors affecting seed mass variation among species and phylogeny, we used linear and regression tree analyses of three biotic traits and four niche traits to quantify the relative importance of each trait on seed mass for 1340 angiosperm species from the eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Dispersal mode was the strongest predictor of both species and phylogenetic seed mass variation, whereas life form only had a small impact. These results suggest that seed mass has responded to dispersers rather than the life history or available stored resources. Moreover, in both inter-specific and phylogenetic comparisons, species with similar light, moisture and disturbance niche positions tended to have similar seed mass, indicating that adaptation to local environments is a second force driving species-level seed mass variation. The lack of any relationship between thermal niche and seed mass in the phylogenetic analysis implies that seed mass variation along thermal gradients may be a result of regional species sorting, or alternatively, a plastic response to the variation in plant size. All species and phylogenetic multivariate models showed that both dispersal mode and species light/ moisture niche explain seed mass variation, suggesting the importance of coevolution or covariation between seeds and vertebrates and the selection or filter effect of habitats on early life-history stages of plants in affecting individual seed development. Lastly, our results imply that phylogenetic constraints and niche conservatism may operate simultaneously in determining regional patterns of seed mass variation.

AB  - The development and reproduction, and maximum number of generations across seasons were ascertained for populations of Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in Central Europe. Number of generations was calculated using the thermal characteristics of development and summation of daily average air temperatures, in 2007-2016. This species can produce 2-3 generations per year. However, there is insufficient time for it to achieve its full reproductive potential. Delayed emigration from hibernacula (late April) shortened the period of seasonal activity by 1-6%. Breeding occurred from May to mid September. Oviposition continued into late summer, which left insufficient time for the late-hatching immatures to complete their development before the onset of winter. A high mobility, opportunistic use of prey patches and weak tendency to enter dormancy provide the potential for population increase by extending the period of development of immatures at the risk of failure if the cold period comes early.

AB  - Overfishing has changed the life histories of commercially harvested marine fishes worldwide. The Jamaican weakfish, Cynoscion jamaicensis, which has been caught by trawl fisheries off southern Brazil since the 1950s, was sampled in two periods (1977-80 and 2016-17) to study its life history and changes in growth and sexual maturation and assess its spawning potential ratio. The annual formation of one opaque band on the otoliths was validated, and the oldest sampled fish was a 9-year-old male. Growth patterns did not differ between sexes. The von Bertalanffy growth parameter L-infinity increased with time, and the growth curves were significantly different between periods. Fish of the same age classes were significantly larger, heavier and had higher allometric condition factors in the most recent period than those in the first period. Reproduction occurs seasonally from late spring to early autumn, and the length and age at first maturity decreased between periods. Based on the length distributions obtained in 2016-17, the spawning potential ratio was between 57 and 62%, suggesting a moderate decrease in the abundance of the species in the region. The changes in growth are likely due to density-dependent processes because of the intense fishing that decreased the abundance of the species and of its main competitors. The changes in maturation parameters are more difficult to explain since there are three possible drivers: density-dependent processes and increasing water temperatures for the changes in the age at first maturity and increasing water temperatures and genotypic responses to differential selection for the changes in the size at first maturity. Although C. jamaicensis can be considered a resilient species due to its life history characteristics, the intense biomass removal by fishing in southern Brazil has changed its population dynamics and reduced its spawning potential.

AB  - Global warming and contamination represent two major threats to biodiversity that have the potential to interact synergistically. There is the potential for gradual local thermal adaptation and dispersal to higher latitudes to mitigate the susceptibility of organisms to contaminants and global warming at high latitudes. Here, we applied a space-for-time substitution approach to study the thermal dependence of the susceptibility of Ischnura elegans damselfly larvae to zinc in a common garden warming experiment (20 and 24 degrees C) with replicated populations from three latitudes spanning >1500 km in Europe. We observed a striking latitude-specific effect of temperature on the zinc-induced mortality pattern; local thermal adaptation along the latitudinal gradient made Swedish, but not French, damselfly larvae more susceptible to zinc at 24 degrees C. Latitude-and temperature-specific differences in zinc susceptibility may be related to the amount of energy available to defend against and repair damage since Swedish larvae showed a much stronger zinc-induced reduction of food intake at 24 degrees C. The pattern of local thermal adaptation indicates that the predicted temperature increase of 4 degrees C by 2100 will strongly magnify the impact of a contaminant such as zinc at higher latitudes unless there is thermal evolution and/or migration of lower latitude genotypes. Our results underscore the critical importance of studying the susceptibility to contaminants under realistic warming scenarios taking into account local thermal adaptation across natural temperature gradients.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is frequently assumed to be an adaptive mechanism by which organisms cope with rapid changes in their environment, such as shifts in temperature regimes owing to climate change. However, despite this adaptive assumption, the nature of selection on plasticity within populations is still poorly documented. Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of selection on thermal plasticity. Although there is a large literature on thermal plasticity, we found very few studies that estimated coefficients of selection on measures of plasticity. Those that did do not provide strong support for selection on plasticity, with the majority of estimates of directional selection on plasticity being weak and non-significant, and no evidence for selection on plasticity overall. Although further estimates are clearly needed before general conclusions can be drawn, at present there is not clear empirical support for any assumption that plasticity in response to temperature is under selection. We present a multivariate mixed model approach for robust estimation of selection on plasticity and demonstrate how it can be implemented. Finally, we highlight the need to consider the environments, traits and conditions under which plasticity is (or is not) likely to be under selection, if we are to understand phenotypic responses to rapid environmental change.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of plasticity in phenotypic adaptation to rapid environmental change'.

AB  - Strong ecological selection can erode genetic variation and render populations unable to deal with changes in ecological conditions. In the adaptation of the phoretic mite Poecilochirus carabi to its host, the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, the timing of reproduction is crucial. Safe mite development is only possible during the beetles' brood care; mites that develop too slowly will have virtually zero fitness. If the strong specialisation in development time leaves no room for standing genetic variation to remain, changes in beetle brood care are disastrous. Beetle brood care depends on temperature and is thus vulnerable to changing climate. Accidental host switches to another beetle species with shorter brood care would also have negative effects on the mites. Only sufficient standing genetic variation could allow mismatched mite lines to survive and adapt. To test whether such rapid adaptation is possible in principle, we artificially selected on mite generation time. We were able to speed up, but not to slow down, mite development. We conclude that there is enough standing genetic variation in development time to allow P. carabi to quickly adapt to new host species or climate conditions, which could potentially lead to the evolution of new mite species.

AB  - In the present research, an air-suspension fluidized-bed technique for generation of core and shell microcapsules containing probiotic Lactobacillusparacasei cells was evaluated. The air-suspension process was performed in a Wurster coater system with a bottom-spraying atomizer. In the first stage, a solution containing trehalose, maltodextrin, and probiotic cells was spray-coated onto and absorbed by the inert carrier microcrystalline cellulose to produce nonagglomerating dry coated particles with high probiotic cell viability (10 9 colony-forming units [cfu]/g particles). The effect of inlet air temperature, spray flow rate, solids concentration, cell concentration, and encapsulation formulation on survival was investigated. The inlet air temperature had the most pronounced effect; a 15 degrees C increase in inlet air temperature led to a 250-fold decrease in survival percentage. There was no agglomeration of the coated adsorbed particles at spray flow rates of 1 to 3.5 mL/min. Spray-coating was performed with both laboratory-and pilot-scale Wurster systems. Scaling up the equipment from the lab scale to the pilot scale did not affect cell survival percentage. Low solids concentration (<20%) and low probiotic cell concentration (6%) resulted in a fair survival percentage (35-40). Spraying a solution formulation of trehalose-maltodextrin with dextrose equivalent (DE) 3 at a 1: 1 ratio provided the best protection in terms of cell viability during the spray-coating process as well during storage. Layering with ethylcellulose (ETHOCEL) provided some protection in a low acidic environment (12%); however, the nonuniform coating and cracks detected by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging were the main reasons for the layering's relatively poor protection of the cells against humidity, oxygen, and acid environment.

AB  - Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is a common pest in soybeans in China. Though the pest has been studied extensively for many yr, there is little information regarding life history traits of A. glycines autumnal morphs on buckthorn in autumn. Life tables were constructed of A. glycines gynoparae, males, and oviparae reared at 13, 18, 23, 28, and 33 degrees C with a photoperiod of 12:12 h (L:D). Our results showed that gynoparae nymphs of A. glycines could survive well at temperatures from 13 to 33 degrees C, but male and oviparae nymphs could not develop into adults at 33 degrees C. Development time of nymphal gynoparae, males, and oviparae all gradually decreased when temperatures increased from 13 to 28 degrees C. Adult longevity of gynoparae and virgin males also decreased gradually when temperatures increased from 13 to 28 degrees C. Fecundity of A. glycines gynoparae was the greatest at 23 degrees C, with a value of 15.87 +/- 0.33 oviparae per gynoparae. Males and oviparae of A. glycines mated only at 13 and 18 degrees C in the laboratory. Oviparae fecundity at 18 degrees C was greater than at 13 degrees C. This study provides important information on survival, development, and reproduction of A. glycines autumnal morphs, which is useful for understanding the population dynamics and life cycle of A. glycines in autumn, and to study the ecological adaptability of A. glycines in autumn.

AB  - Environmental changes, such as climate change, lead to the opening of new niches. In such situations, species that adapt to new niches can survive and/or expand their ranges. However, gene flow can hamper genetic adaptation to new environments. Alternatively, recent models have highlighted the importance of phenotypic plasticity in tracking environmental change. Here, we investigate whether phenotypic plasticity or genetic evolution (or both) allows an amphibian species to exploit two divergent climatic niches. In the Mediterranean region, the parsley frog Pelodytes punctatus breeds both in spring, as do most other species, and in autumn, a temporal niche not exploited by most other species, but which may become increasingly important with global warming. Conditions of development are dramatically different between the two seasons and deeply impact tadpole life-history traits. To determine whether these temporal niches are exploited by two genetically differentiated subpopulations, or whether the bimodal phenology arises in a panmictic population displaying plastic life-history traits, we use two complementary approaches. We measure both molecular genetic differentiation and quantitative-trait differentiation between spring and autumn cohorts, using microsatellites and common garden experiments, respectively. Seasonal cohorts were not genetically differentiated and differences in tadpole life history between cohorts were not maintained in laboratory conditions. We conclude that phenotypic plasticity, rather than genetic adaptation, allows Parsley frog to exploit two contrasting temporal niches.

AB  - Because of their complex life histories, different life stages of many marine invertebrates may be exposed to varying environmental challenges. Ultimately, the life stage that is least tolerant of its environment will determine the species' abundance and distribution. The intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus lives in high intertidal pools along the Pacific coast of North America. Unlike most other invertebrates, the different life stages of T. californicus all share the same tidepool habitat. To determine physiological tolerances of various life history stages of this species, we examined responses to acute heat stress in nauplii, copepodids, and adults from 6 populations along a latitudinal gradient. Results show that early developmental stages (nauplii and cope podids) are generally more tolerant than adults. Our results contrast with the widely accepted generalization that larval forms are more sensitive to physical stressors than adults. As previously observed in adults, nauplii and copepodids from southern populations survive higher temperatures than those from northern populations. Acute heat stress was found to delay development but did not affect adult size. We hypothesize that variation in the thermal tolerance of early life stages among intertidal species reflects ecological differences in larval habitats: where larvae remain in the intertidal zone and experience the same high temperatures as adults, selection will favor high larval thermal tolerance, while in species with planktonic larvae, the buffered temperature regime of the water column might relax such selection, and thermal tolerance will be highest in the more exposed intertidal adults.

AB  - Ontsira mellipes Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is a North American parasitoid species that develops on the invasive pest, Anoplophora glabripennis (Moltschulsky) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), under laboratory conditions and is currently being considered as a potential new-association biocontrol agent. To develop mass-rearing protocols and field-release strategies for this parasitoid, information on its reproductive biology in relation to temperature is needed. We determined the effect of temperature (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) on development, survivorship, and sex ratio, and its effect on the longevity, fecundity, and host attack rates (parasitism) of adults. Developmental time for parasitoid eggs to pupae decreased from 26.7 d to 6.1 d as temperature increased from 10 degrees C to 30 degrees C. While no pupae eclosed as adults at 10 degrees C, time of adult emergence from pupae decreased from 39.7 d to 12.2 d as temperature increased from 15 degrees C to 30 degrees C. Based on estimated lower development temperature threshold (11.1 degrees C), the degree-days required for one generation was estimated at 342.9. When female parasitoids were provided with host larvae, parasitism occurred at all temperatures and was maximized at 25 degrees C. Additionally, increasing temperatures significantly reduced the preoviposition period and longevity of female O. mellipes. In addition, combining these results with temperature data from areas in the United States currently infested with A. glabripennis, we estimated that O. mellipes can complete 1.2-3.7 generations per year. Findings from this study may be considered for the future development of effective mass rearing and augmentative release strategies of O. mellipes for biological control of A. glabripennis.

AB  - Whole-genome duplication is common in plants and is considered to have a broad range of effects on individuals' phenotypes and genomes and to be an important driver of plant adaptation and speciation. Despite their increased capacity to cope with challenging environments, polyploid lineages are generally as prone to extinction, and sometimes more prone, than their diploid progenitors. Although several explanations have been proposed to explain the short- and long-term disadvantages of polyploidy on the survival probability of populations, the consequences of whole-genome doubling on the heritable variance remain poorly studied. Whole-genome doubling can have major effects not only on the genetics, but also on the ecology and life history of the populations. Modifications of other properties of populations can reverse the effects of polyploidization per se on heritable variance. In this synthesis, I summarize the empirical and theoretical knowledge about the multifarious consequences of genome doubling on the heritable variance of quantitative traits and on the evolutionary potential of polyploid populations compared to their diploid progenitors. I propose several ways to decipher the consequences of whole-genome doubling on survival probability and to study the further consequences of shifting the ecological niche and life-history traits of a population. I also highlight some practical considerations for comparing the heritable variance of a trait among different cytotypes. Such investigations appear to be timely and necessary to understand more about the paradoxical aspects of polyploidization and to understand the evolutionary potential of polyploid lineages in a global warming context.

AB  - Climate change is altering legacies of native insect-caused disturbances and contributing to non-native invasions globally. Many insect fitness traits are temperature dependent and projected climatic changes are expected to cause continued alterations in insect-caused tree mortality, with uncertain consequences for forest ecosystems and their management. Dendroctonus ponderosae in Pinus habitats of western North America and Ips typographus in European Picea are among the most significant tree mortality agents on each continent. Changing climate is influencing both species in their native habitats, although thermal suitability if they should invade new continents and novel forest habitats has not been investigated. We assessed thermal suitability for intra- and inter-continental establishment using physiological models that describe evolved, temperature-dependent traits of each species. Models were driven by projections from two Global Climate Models representing RCP 8.5. Simulations suggest that for both species the common phenological strategy of one generation annually (univoltine) will shift northward with warming throughout this century. As optimum habitat for I. typographus univoltinism shifts northward, habitat supporting a 2nd generation, a historically common strategy in warm European Picea forests, expands on both continents. In contrast, a 2nd D. ponderosae generation has been historically rare due to traits that evolved for phenological synchrony in its cool native habitats. As thermal habitat for D. ponderosae univoltinism shifts northward, suitability for a 2nd generation is limited to the warmest Pinus forests on both continents. In the near future (2011-2040), models project extensive thermal suitability for inter-continental establishment of both species, highlighting the need for effective mitigation policies and continued monitoring at ports in an era of climate change and increasing global trade. Throughout the century, thermal suitability remains high for I. typographus population success on both continents, for D. ponderosae in warm areas of Europe, and for D. ponderosae expansion into novel North American Pinus habitats. Portions of the historical D. ponderosae range, however, are projected to become thermally unsuitable.

AB  - Although animals are widely assumed to select habitats in ways that enhance organismal fitness, there are few empirical data to demonstrate this link. We studied flat rock spiders (Hemicloea major, Gnaphosidae) from eastern Australia, where these highly modified (dorsoventrally flattened) spiders live under loose surface rocks on sandstone outcrops. Field surveys showed that the rocks used as diurnal retreat sites by spiders were relatively thin with low canopy cover and a rocky substrate and therefore were likely to experience high temperatures and large thermal fluctuations. Laboratory trials suggest that this nonrandom rock use is a direct response to thermal cues; juvenile spiders selected warmer over cooler retreat sites. To investigate consequences of habitat selection on fitness-related traits, we maintained cohorts of juvenile spiders at cycling-temperature regimes corresponding to those measured in the field under rocks that were fully, partially, or never exposed to direct sunlight (diel thermal ranges of 16.2degrees-37.8degreesC, 15.5degrees-31.2degreesC, and 15.2degrees-24.3degreesC). Survival rates were high for all groups over the eight-week study, but hotter conditions accelerated growth and development. Our data thus confirm that thermal cues are used in retreat-site selection and that selection of warmer retreat sites will confer fitness benefits to flat rock spiders.

AB  - Temperature is an important selective agent in nature. Consequently, temperature-induced plasticity which may help buffering detrimental effects of temperature variation has received considerable attention over recent decades. Laboratory studies have almost exclusively used constant temperatures, while in nature, temperature typically shows pronounced daily fluctuations. Using a factorial design with constant versus fluctuating temperatures and a higher versus a lower mean temperature, we here investigate in the butterfly Lycaena tityrus whether the use of constant temperatures is justified. Fluctuating compared to constant temperatures caused shorter development times, increased heat but decreased cold stress resistance, decreased heat-shock protein expression, and increased immunocompetence. Thus, overall, fluctuating temperatures were more beneficial to the butterflies compared to constant ones. However, despite substantial variation across temperature regimes, the ranking of trait values among treatments remained largely unaffected (e.g. lower constant as well as fluctuating temperatures caused increased pupal mass). Thus, we tentatively conclude that there is no general reason for concern about using constant temperatures in studies investigating phenotypic plasticity, which seem to comprise a fair proxy. However, substantial differences in mean values as well as interactive effects suggest that one needs to be cautious. We further demonstrate negative effects of high temperatures on butterfly immune function, which seem to result from a trade-off between the latter and the heat shock response.

AB  - Changes in temperature across geographic gradients can occur on a wide temporal range, from fluctuations within hours as a result of day-night to those over many years. These events will drive many organisms towards their physiological limits of thermal tolerance. Recently, many reports support a limited scope for adaptive evolutionary responses to high temperatures, meaning a conserved heat tolerance among ectotherms in general. We address this problem and tested the heat and cold tolerance invariant-variant hypotheses in terrestrial isopods. We studied five different populations of Porcellio laevis and three populations of Porcellio scaber, spanning 30 degrees S latitudinal gradient in Chile. The heat tolerance of woodlice was conserved with little variation along latitude and environmental temperatures, but cold tolerance decreases significantly with environmental temperatures and latitudes. Indeed, a significant and negative correlation was observed between cold tolerance and latitude. Also, significant and positive correlations were observed among cold tolerance and environmental temperatures. Conversely, heat tolerance was not significantly correlated with any of the environmental temperatures tested neither with latitude. This macrophysiological pattern indicated that heat and cold-tolerances of species and populations not always change across geographical gradients meaning that thermal tolerance responses to high temperatures may be evolutionary constrained.

AB  - Insects can adapt to temperate environments by increasing levels of resistance to cold conditions over winter and/or altering reproductive patterns to focus reproduction in favourable conditions. In temperate areas, Drosophila melanogaster persists over winter at the adult stage. A previous experiment, conducted with flies kept in outdoor population cages in the temperate winter, indicated that temperate populations produced more eggs than did tropical populations following an abrupt increase in reproduction in late winter. In contrast, the tropical populations produced more eggs prior to the increase. Both patterns resulted in a higher net number of surviving offspring for temperate populations. Here we again examine the clinal pattern in reproduction using outdoor cages, this time held under tropical winter conditions. In this environment, surprisingly, egg production was higher and on average earlier in populations originating from temperate areas. However, mortality rates also increased with latitude of origin, and the relationship of lifetime egg production to latitude should therefore be measured. To test the role of altered pattern of egg production per se in the reproductive advantage of temperate populations in the temperate winter, we tested the performance of laboratory lines selected for altered reproductive patterns, under temperate winter conditions. Lines selected for high early fecundity exhibited this characteristic in the field cages and lines selected for late reproduction exhibited a relatively high fecundity in spring. The timing of the abrupt increase in egg production was identical in these sets of lines and occurred at the same time in recently collected populations, suggesting evolutionary conservation of the switch. These findings suggest that changes in early and late reproduction per se determine adaptation to temperate winter conditions, and illustrate how laboratory selection lines can be used to understand traits underlying adaptive shifts in field performance.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity can be an important adaptive response to climate change, particularly for dispersal-limited species. Temperature frequently alters developmental and phenotypic traits including morphology, behavior, and reproductive cycles. We often lack crucial information about if and how thermal conditions during development will interact with genetic responses and facilitate persistence or adaptation under climate change. Polymorphic species offer an ideal test for this, as alternative morphs often confer differential adaptive advantages. However, few studies have examined the effects of incubation temperature on color expression or development in polymorphic taxa. Here we test if developmental temperature mediates morph frequency in the polymorphic salamander Plethodon cinereus. Although previous research suggests geographic variation in morph proportions results from differential climate adaptation, it remains unknown if plasticity also contributes to this variation. We used a split-clutch common garden experiment to determine the effects of developmental temperature on the color and development of P. cinereus. Our results indicate developmental temperature affects coloration in P. cinereus, either via plasticity or differential mortality, with eggs incubated at warmer temperatures yielding a higher proportion of unstriped individuals than those from cooler temperatures. This temperature response may contribute to the spatial variation in morph frequencies in natural populations. Surprisingly, we found neither temperature nor egg size affected hatchling size. Our study provides important insights into the potential for climate-induced responses to preserve diversity in dispersal-limited species, like P. cinereus, and enable time for adaptive evolution.

AB  - Evolutionary simulations are developed to explore environmental constraints that select observed spatial and temporal spawning patterns for anchovy (Engraulis capensis) in the southern Benguela. They couple a realistic three-dimensional hydrodynamic model with an individual-based model in which an evolutionary-based reproductive strategy for adult fish and a passive transport for early life stages are implemented. The evolutionary success of spawning is quantified when patterns at the population level emerge after many generations from constraints at the individual level through a selective process. As a result, several self-sustaining populations are identified considering different sets of selective constraints. Simulated spawning patterns better match the observed mean spawning pattern when two selective environmental constraints are associated: a threshold temperature of 14degreesC, above which the development of early life stages is ensured, and the avoidance of offshore currents that constitute a loss of spawning products. Simulated recruitment patterns are more realistic when considering the constraint of reaching the nursery area. This modeling experience can help to identify, temporally and spatially, environmental factors important for fish recruitment and to establish a hierarchy of these factors. The probable coexistence in nature of several self-sustaining populations of pelagic fishes is shown to be important for recruitment studies.

AB  - Environmental temperature, particularly in habitats with extreme temperature fluctuations, may shape selection pressures on life history traits. Especially in ectotherms, temperature affects performance, physiology, and in some species, skin color. Skin color can be a sexual ornament signaling the bearer's ability to resist infections, when only high-quality individuals are able to invest both in high immune defense and elaborate ornament expression. However, how the information content of these sexual traits may vary with environmental conditions has been less studied. Dickerson's collared lizard (Crotaphytus dickersonae) males are blue and have a black and white collar. This conspicuous coloration signals performance and immune response, and is related to body temperature. Here, by maintaining males at higher, lower, and mean environmental temperatures we evaluated whether temperature variation influences color and constitutive innate humoral immunity (agglutination and lysis titers, estimated through hemolysis-hemagglutination assays), and whether extreme temperatures impose trade-offs between color and humoral immunity. We found that at low and high temperature treatments males had lower agglutination and lysis titers, and at low temperature, blue chroma from the dorsum declined and males became greener. Interestingly, at low and control temperature treatments, agglutination titer and blue coloration were positively correlated, whereas high temperatures revealed a trade-off between increasing agglutination titers and displaying bluer skin color. Our results suggest that in the Dickerson collared lizard even short-term variation of environmental temperature affects performance of constitutive innate humoral immunity and the brilliant blue skin color. Particularly, high temperatures may compromise some components of male's immunity and sexual signaling.

AB  - Global temperatures have risen over the last century, and are forecast to continue rising. Ectotherms may be particularly sensitive to changes in thermal regimes, and tropical ectotherms are more likely than temperate species to be influenced by changes in environmental temperature, because they may have evolved narrow thermal tolerances. Keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii) are tropical, oviparous reptiles. To quantify the effects of temperature on the morphology and physiology of hatchling keelbacks, clutches laid by wild-caught females were split and incubated at three temperatures, reflecting the average minimum, overall average and average maximum temperatures recorded at our study site. Upon hatching, the performance of neonates was examined at all three incubation temperatures in a randomized order over consecutive days. Hatchlings from the 'hot' treatment had slower burst swim speeds and swam fewer laps than hatchlings from the cooler incubation temperatures in all three test temperatures, indicating a low thermal optimum for incubation of this tropical species. There were no significant interactions between test temperature and incubation temperature across performance variables, suggesting phenotypic differences caused by incubation temperature did not acclimate this species to post-hatching conditions. Thus, keelback embryos appear evolutionarily adapted to development at cooler temperatures (relative to what is available in their habitat). The considerable reduction in hatchling viability and performance associated with a 3.5 A degrees C increase in incubation temperature, suggests climate change may have significant population-level effects on this species. However, the offspring of three mothers exposed to the hottest incubation temperature were apparently resilient to high temperature, suggesting that this species may respond to selection imposed by thermal regime.

AB  - Species are expected to alter their ranges as climates change. Climate-induced range expansions of predators could threaten evolutionarily naive prey populations, leading to high mortality at the invasion front. If prey can apply existing defenses against local predators to novel predation threats induced by climate change, mortality threats will be less than expected. Here, we examine if spotted salamander larvae Ambystoma maculatum from populations that coexist with native red-spotted newts Notophthalmus viridescens survive better when exposed to a novel predator, the marbled salamander Ambystoma opacum. We show that regional mean winter temperatures warmed 2.0 degrees C over 116 yr in the region, and that A. opacum survival increases in ponds with higher winter temperatures. Hence as winters continue to warm, this apex predator will likely colonize ponds north of their current range limit. Next, we performed common garden experiments to determine if local adaptations to native N. viridescens and exposure to A. opacum or N. viridescens kairomones (predator chemical cues) altered A. maculatum survival in predation trials. We did not find evidence for local adaptation to N. viridescens. However, A. maculatum from high-N. viridescens ponds that were reared with A. opacum kairomones suffered significantly higher mortality from the native predator N. viridescens. This outcome suggests an unanticipated interaction between local adaptation and plastic responses to novel kairomones from a potentially range-expanding predator. Current projections of biodiversity losses from climate change generally ignore the potential for eco-evolutionary interactions between native and range-expanding species and thus could be inaccurate.

AB  - Different physiological thresholds of species across biogeographic boundaries can show a long-term scope for adaptation. Characterised by cold-stenothermal conditions, polar and deep-sea environments are constrained by thermal stability across wide regions, and polar invertebrates are broadly considered to be highly sensitive to only subtle changes in thermal regime. We examine the respiratory response of two distinct biogeographic populations of the widespread bivalve Lissarca notorcadensis from deep waters in the Southern Ocean to acute thermal changes, and present distinct respiratory responses for each population. Populations from the Weddell Sea living in cooler water temperatures (< 0 A degrees C) show a lower tolerance to temperature increases, identified by an increase in oxygen consumption at temperatures from -1 to 4 A degrees C and mortality at 5 A degrees C. In contrast, populations from the Scotia Sea, experiencing a thermally more variable cold-stenothermal environment driven by seasonality, show no significant increase in oxygen consumption up to 6 A degrees C before peaking at 8 A degrees C, and mortality during acclimation to 9 A degrees C. Our results are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that long-term adaptation to thermal envelopes, over multiple generations, likely determines the degree of thermal resilience to warming and at population-specific levels. This contrasts to previous laboratory-based (short-term acclimation or acute) thermal response studies, which have shown high sensitivities and low acclimation capacities to temperature increases. We highlight the need for long-term acclimation studies and pose questions as to how selection for population-specific thermal tolerances may take place in a global warming scenario and within a macroecological context.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity in heterogeneous environments can provide tight environment-phenotype matching. However, the prerequisite is a reliable environmental cue(s) that enables organisms to use current environmental information to induce the development of a phenotype with high fitness in a forthcoming environment. Here, we quantify predictability in the timing of precipitation and temperature change to examine how this is associated with seasonal polyphenism in tropical Mycalesina butterflies. Seasonal precipitation in the tropics typically results in distinct selective environments, the wet and dry seasons, and changes in temperature can be a major environmental cue. We sampled communities of Mycalesina butterflies from two seasonal locations and one aseasonal location. Quantifying environmental predictability using wavelet analysis and Colwell's indices confirmed a strong periodicity of precipitation over a 12-month period at both seasonal locations compared to the aseasonal one. However, temperature seasonality and periodicity differed between the two seasonal locations. We further show that: (a) most females from both seasonal locations synchronize their reproduction with the seasons by breeding in the wet season but arresting reproduction in the dry season. In contrast, all species breed throughout the year in the aseasonal location and (b) species from the seasonal locations, but not those from the aseasonal location, exhibited polyphenism in wing pattern traits (eyespot size). We conclude that seasonal precipitation and its predictability are primary factors shaping the evolution of polyphenism in Mycalesina butterflies, and populations or species secondarily evolve local adaptations for cue use that depend on the local variation in the environment.

AB  - A common reptile conservation strategy involves artificial incubation of embryos and release of hatchlings or juveniles into wild populations. Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) occurs in most chelonians, permitting conservation managers to bias sex ratios towards females by incubating embryos at high temperatures, ultimately allowing the introduction of more egg-bearing individuals into populations. Here, we revisit classic sex allocation theory and hypothesize that TSD evolved in some reptile groups (specifically, chelonians and crocodilians) because male fitness is more sensitive to condition (general health, vigor) than female fitness. It follows that males benefit more than females from incubation environments that confer high-quality phenotypes, and hence high-condition individuals. We predict that female-producing temperatures, which comprise relatively high incubation temperatures in chelonians and crocodilians, are relatively stressful for embryos and subsequent life stages. We synthesize data from 28 studies to investigate how constant temperature incubation affects embryonic mortality in chelonians with TSD. We find several lines of evidence suggesting that warm, female-producing temperatures are more stressful than cool, male-producing temperatures. Further, we find some evidence that pivotal temperatures (TPiv, the temperature that produces a 1:1 sex ratio) may exhibit a correlated evolution with embryonic thermal tolerance. If patterns of temperature-sensitive embryonic mortality are also indicative of chronic thermal stress that occurs post-hatching, then conservation programs may benefit from incubating eggs close to species-specific TPivs, thus avoiding high-temperature incubation. Indeed, our models predict that, on average, a sex ratio of >75% females can generally be achieved by incubating eggs only 1 degrees C above TPiv. Of equal importance, we provide insight into the enigmatic evolution of TSD in chelonians, by providing support to the hypothesis that TSD evolution is related to the quality of the phenotype conferred by incubation temperature, with males produced in high-quality incubation environments.

AB  - The egg parasitoid Trissolcus vassilievi (Mayr) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) is a significant natural enemy of the sunn pest, Eurygaster integriceps Puton (Hemiptera: Scutelleridae), the most important pest of wheat in Iran. This study examined the developmental time and egg-to-adult survival of two geographically separate populations of T. vassilievi on two corresponding host populations at five constant temperatures ranging from 15.0 to 35.0 +/- 1 degrees C. No wasps of either population emerged at 15.0 degrees C and the temperature threshold for development was similar between populations, ranging from 13.1 +/- 0.3 to 13.8 +/- 0.4 degrees C for males and 12.2 +/- 0.1 to 12.6 +/- 0.1 degrees C for females, but the thermal constant varied with gender and parasitoid population. Development of wasps from the colder Tabriz location was slower, with thermal constants for males and females of 172.6 +/- 3.1 and 204.1 +/- 1.2 degree-days, respectively, compared to Varamin wasps with 164.7 +/- 3.0 and 195.6 +/- 1.3 degree-days, respectively. Based on genetic inheritance patterns, reciprocal crosses between the two populations were expected to result in females with thermal phenotypes intermediate to their parental populations, and males that resembled their mothers. However, female progeny of crosses more closely resembled their maternal population, indicating a maternal effect on thermal phenotype. Furthermore, the magnitude of the maternal effect on the thermal constant was asymmetric and was more strongly expressed by Varmin than Tabriz females. These results suggest the possibility of using selective crosses between wasp populations, in combination with artificial selection in the laboratory, to tune the thermal phenotype of parasitoids to specific regions prior to augmentative releases.

AB  - Mayfly nymphs are among the most sensitive taxa to neonicotinoids. The present study presents the acute and chronic toxicity of 3 neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) to a mayfly species (Cloeon dipterum) and some notes on the seasonality of the toxicity of imidacloprid to C. dipterum and 5 other invertebrate species. Imidacloprid and thiamethoxam showed equal acute and chronic toxicity to a winter generation of C. dipterum, whereas thiacloprid was approximately twice as toxic. The acute and chronic toxicity of imidacloprid was much higher for the C. dipterum summer generation than for the winter one. The acute toxicity differs by a factor of 20 for the 96-h 50% effective concentration (EC50) and by a factor of 5.4 for the chronic 28-d EC50. Temperature had only a slight effect on the sensitivity of C. dipterum to imidacloprid because we only found a factor of 1.7 difference in the 96-h EC50 between tests performed at 10 degrees C and 18 degrees C. The difference in sensitivity between summer and overwintering generations was also found for 3 other insect species. The results indicate that if the use and environmental fate of the 3 neonicotinoids are comparable, replacing imidacloprid by another neonicotinoid might not reduce the environmental impact on the mayfly nymph C. dipterum. The results also show the importance of reporting which generation is tested because sensitivity values of insects in the summer might be underestimated by the experiments performed with neonicotinoids and an overwintering population.

AB  - Systematic studies on the impact of environmental pollution on the survival adaptability of amphibians are relatively few. In this study,Bufo raddeitadpoles from two places with totally different backgrounds of heavy metal pollution were chosen to explore the effects of heavy metal pollution on fitness and swimming performance of tadpoles, the physiological effects were investigated as well. The tadpoles at GS 25, GS 30 and GS 35 were collected randomly from the two study sites and were exposed to different environmental temperatures. The results showed that heavy metal enrichment and antioxidant levels were significantly higher in the tadpoles under long-term heavy metal stress. Meanwhile, heavy metal pollution affected the adaptability of tadpoles to environmental change and decreased the swimming performance of the tadpoles. Unexpected, the tadpoles from heavy metal-polluted area also showed some adaptive changes, mainly reflected in the increase in swimming endurance.

AB  - Thermal performance curves (TPCs) are continuous reaction norms that describe the relationship between organismal performance and temperature and are useful for understanding trade-offs involved in thermal adaptation. Although thermal trade-offs such as those between generalists and specialists or between hot- and cold-adapted phenotypes are known to be genetically variable and evolve during thermal adaptation, little is known of the genetic basis to TPCs - specifically, the loci involved and the directionality of their effects across different temperatures. To address this, we took a multivariate approach, mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) for locomotor activity TPCs in the fly, Drosophila serrata, using a panel of 76 recombinant inbred lines. The distribution of additive genetic (co)variance in the mapping population was remarkably similar to the distribution of mutational (co)variance for these traits. We detected 11 TPC QTL in females and 4 in males. Multivariate QTL effects were closely aligned with the major axes genetic (co)variation between temperatures; most QTL effects corresponded to variation for either overall increases or decreases in activity with a smaller number indicating possible trade-offs between activity at high and low temperatures. QTL representing changes in curve shape such as the generalist-specialist' trade-off, thought key to thermal adaptation, were poorly represented in the data. We discuss these results in the light of genetic constraints on thermal adaptation.

AB  - The contribution of phenotypically plastic traits to evolution depends on the degree of environmental influence on the target of selection (the phenotype) as well as the underlying genetic structure of the trait and plastic response. Likewise, maternal effects can help or hinder evolution through affects to the response to selection. The sacoglossan sea slug Alderia willowi exhibits intraspecific variation for developmental mode (= poecilogony) that is environmentally modulated with populations producing more yolk-feeding (lecithotrophic) larvae during the summer, and more planktonic-feeding (planktotrophic) larvae in the winter. I found significant family-level variation in the reaction norms between 17 maternal families of A. willowi when reared in a split-brood design in low (16 ppt) versus high (32 ppt) salinity, conditions which mimic seasonal variation in salinity of natural populations. I documented a significant response to selection for lecithotrophic larvae in high and low salinity. The slope of the reaction norm was maintained following one generation of selection for lecithotrophy. When the maternal environment was controlled in the laboratory, I found significant maternal effects, which reduced the response to selection. These results suggest there is standing genetic variation for egg-mass type in A. willowi, but the ability of selection to act on that variation may depend on the environment in which the phenotype is expressed in preceding generations.

AB  - The warming climate has enabled a rapid expansion of many forest pests. The adaptation potential of the invaders affects largely on how well the invasive species can spread to new areas and in what extent can they have an impact on the invaded ecosystem. To measure the adaptation potential of an invasive (winter moth) and a potentially invasive defoliating moth species (scarce umber moth), we examined life history parameters in two environments on a set of genetically diverse host trees and compared the traits with those of a resident moth species (autumnal moth). In addition, variations in life history parameters due to host genotype were calculated and compared.

AB  - Climate change alters phenological relations between interacting species. We might expect the historical baseline, or starting-point, for such effects to be precise synchrony between the season at which a consumer most requires food and the time when its resources are most available. We synthesize evidence that synchrony was not the historical condition in two insect-plant interactions involving Edith's checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha), the winter moth (Operophtera brumata) and their host plants. Initial observations of phenological mismatch in both systems were made prior to the onset of anthropogenically driven climate change. Neither species can detect the phenology of its host plants with precision. In both species, evolution of life history has involved compromise between maximizing fecundity and minimizing mortality, with the outcome being superficially maladaptive strategies in which many, or even most, individuals die of starvation through poor synchrony with their host plants. Where phenological asynchrony or mismatch with resources forms the starting point for effects of anthropogenic global warming, consumers are particularly vulnerable to impacts that exacerbate the mismatch. This vulnerability likely contributed to extinction of a well-studied metapopulation of Edith's checkerspot, and to the skewed geographical pattern of population extinctions underlying a northward and upward range shift in this species.

AB  - Multigenerational effects can have important and sex-dependent effects on offspring. Sex allocation theory predicts that females should differentially invest in sons and daughters depending on sex-specific fitness returns and costs of investment. Maternal stress-relevant (glucocorticoid) hormones may be one mechanism driving this effect. We investigated how maternal stress hormones differentially affected sons and daughters by manipulating levels of the glucocorticoid, corticosterone (CORT), in gravid female eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) and quantifying reproductive investment and sex ratio of resulting clutches, and the mass, snout-vent length, and body condition of sons versus daughters at hatching. We found no effect of maternal CORT-treatment on the number or size of eggs laid or on the sex ratio of resulting offspring, but sons of CORT-treated mothers were shorter, lighter, and of poorer body condition at hatching than were sons of control mothers. We found no difference in size or condition of daughters with maternal treatment. Our results suggest that maternal stress, mediated by elevations in maternal CORT concentrations, can have sex-specific effects on offspring manifesting as lower investment in sons.

AB  - We investigated the adaptive significance of behavioural thermoregulation in univoltine populations of the grasshopper Melanoplus sanguinipes along an altitudinal gradient in California using laboratory tests of animals raised under different temperatures. Trials consisted of continuous body temperature measurements with semi-implanted microprobes in a test arena, and observation and simultaneous recording of behavioural responses. These responses included mobility, basking and orientation of the body axes (aspect angle) towards a radiation source. Mobility and basking are determined by the altitudinal origin of the parental generation and not by the temperature treatments. With increasing altitude, individuals tend increasingly to raise body temperatures via mobility and increased basking. In contrast, body orientation towards the radiation source is influenced by the temperature treatments but not by the altitude of origin. Individuals experiencing higher temperatures during rearing show a lower tendency to lateral flanking. We conclude that body orientation responses are not adapted locally. In contrast other components of the behavioural syndrome that increase body temperature, such as mobility and basking, are adaptive in response to local selection pressure. The thermoregulatory syndrome of these grasshoppers is an important contribution to life-history adaptations that appropriately match season lengths.

AB  - Thermal physiology of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) is a critical aspect of field performance and fitness. Thermal limits for survival and activity, and the ability of these limits to adjust (i.e., show phenotypic flexibility) depending on recent thermal history, are generally poorly established, especially for non-model nematode species. Here we report the acute thermal limits for survival, and the thermal acclimation-related plasticity thereof for two key endemic South African EPN species, Steinernema yirgalemense and Heterorhabditis zealandica. Results including LT50 indicate S. yirgalemense (LT50 = 40.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C) has greater high temperature tolerance than H. zealandica (LT50 = 36.7 +/- 0.2 degrees C), but S. yirgalemense (LT50 = -2.4 +/- 0 degrees C) has poorer low temperature tolerance in comparison to H. zealandica (LT50 = -9.7 +/- 0.3 degrees C), suggesting these two EPN species occupy divergent thermal niches to one another.
   Acclimation had both negative and positive effects on temperature stress survival of both species, although the overall variation meant that many of these effects were non-significant. There was no indication of a consistent loss of plasticity with improved basal thermal tolerance for either species at upper lethal temperatures. At lower temperatures measured for H. zealandica, the 5 degrees C acclimation lowered survival until below -12.5 degrees C, where after it increased survival. Such results indicate that the thermal niche breadth of EPN species can differ significantly depending on recent thermal conditions, and should be characterized across a broad range of species to understand the evolution of thermal limits to performance and survival in this group.

AB  - In this study, the effect of temperature on the growth of the European pepper moth, Duponchelia fovealis (Zeller). was assessed at five constant temperatures (18, 21, 24, 27 and 30 degrees C). The European pepper moth was observed to complete its developmental stages (from egg to adult) at all the temperatures evaluated. From the results, it was evident that temperature affected the rate and development time of all the growth stages, to a significant degree. The length in time of the embryonic, larval, pupal and total (egg-adult) stages was observed to drop as the temperature rose from 18 to 24 degrees C, but remained constant between 27 and 30 degrees C. The developmental time in the pre-pupal stage dropped between 18 and 30 degrees C. The European pepper moth takes 454 degree-days to complete development at 11.7 degrees C temperature threshold. The D. fovealis survival was thus inversely proportional to temperature over range of 18 to 30 degrees C. On assessing the number of annual generations for the five largest strawberry-producing municipalities in Espirito Santo State, an average of 5.5 generations per year was estimated. This is a first report of temperature on D. fovealis development.

AB  - As organisms age the environment fluctuates, exerting differential selection across ontogeny. In particular, highly seasonal environments expose life stages to often drastically different thermal environments. This developmental variation is particularly striking in organisms with complex life cycles, wherein life history stages also exhibit distinct morphologies, physiologies, and behaviors. Genes acting pleiotropically on thermal responses may produce genetic correlations across ontogeny, constraining the independent evolution of each life stage to their respective thermal environments. To investigate whether developmental genetic correlations constrain the evolution thermal hardiness of the fly Drosophila melanogaster, we applied quantitative genetic analyses to cold hardiness measured in both larvae and adults from isogenic lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), using survival at stressful low temperatures as the phenotypic metric. Using full genome resequencing data for the DGRP, we also implemented genome-wide association (GWA) analysis using Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Models (BSLMMs) to estimate associations between naturally segregating variation and cold hardiness for both larvae and adults. Quantitative genetic analyses revealed no significant genetic correlation for cold hardiness between life stages, suggesting complete genetic decoupling of thermal hardiness across the metamorphic boundary. Both quantitative genetic and GWA analyses suggested that polygenic variation underlies cold hardiness in both stages, and that associated loci largely affected one stage or the other, but not both. However, reciprocal enrichment tests and correlations between BSLMM parameters for each life stage support some shared physiological mechanisms that may reflect common cellular thermal response pathways. Overall, these results suggest no developmental genetic constraints on cold hardiness across metamorphosis in D. melanogaster, an important consideration in evolutionary models of responses to changing climates. Genetic correlations for environmental sensitivity across ontogeny remains largely unexplored in other organisms, thus assessing the generality of genetic decoupling will require further quantitative or population genetic analysis in additional species.

AB  - Ru immobilized Al2O3 pellets were synthesized as a catalyst for hydrogen generation in NaBH4 solutions. Under the Ru/Al2O3 catalysis, the hydrogen generation rate from the hydrolysis and methanolysis of NaBH4 in alkaline solution was explored as a function of NaBH4 concentration and temperature. Meanwhile, the borate byproducts derived from the NaBH4 hydrolysis were characterized by XRD and NMR. The results showed that the hydrogen generation rate depended on NaBH4 concentration for the hydrolysis, but did not for the methanolysis. 10 wt% NaBH4 hydrolysis containing 1 wt% NaOH catalyzed with 0.5 g Ru/Al2O3 could generate hydrogen with a rate of about 65.5 ml min(-1) g(-1). The productivity and activation energy of hydrogen generation from the NaBH4 hydrolysis were 93% and 41.8 kJ mol(-1), and from the NaBH4 methanolysis were 97% and 51.0 kJ mol(-1), respectively. The XRD and NMR analyses showed that the species from the hydrolysis byproducts varied with the NaBH4 concentration could be the borax (Na2B4O7 center dot H2O) and sodium borate hydrate (NaBO2 center dot H2O).

AB  - Excised leaves of four rice varieties, 'Facagro 57', 'Facagro 76', 'Kirundo 3', 'Kirundo 9', were chilled for six days at 10/5 degrees C day/night, along with 11 somaclonal families arising from three of these varieties, which had been selected over four generations for improved chilling tolerance. At the end of the chilling treatment, electrolyte leakage from leaf pieces was followed for 12 h and compared with an unchilled control. With unchilled leaves, no varietal differences nor a rise in Leakage over time were observed. Chilling induced higher leakages in all varieties, except in 'Kirundo 3' at the time of first measurement, and a continuous rise over time was found in all varieties. Varietal differences were detected, 'Kirundo 3' being the least affected, followed by 'Kirundo 9' and 'Facagro 76', and finally 'Facagro 57', which coincides with their ranking for chilling tolerance established through chilling survival tests. The leakages were generally lower in the somaclonal families than in the variety they originated from in 'Kirundo 9' and 'Facagro 76', while the opposite was observed in 'Kirundo 3'. The significance and usefulness of electrolyte leakage measurement for chilling tolerance screening, and the potentials of somaclonal variation for chilling tolerance improvement are discussed.

AB  - Animals can respond in three main ways to environments that change and deteriorate. They can cope with their inherent physiological flexibility, evolve or adapt to new conditions, or migrate away to areas consistent with survival. The main factors dictating survival are the rates of change and capacities of species to cope. Articulated brachiopods are known as a group that employ low, energy Solutions and exhibit slow rates in life histories characters, especially in growth and metabolic rates. This way of life carries with it a range of consequences, including poor abilities to raise metabolic rates to perform work. This brings with it poor abilities to cope with elevated temperature. Slow growth, deferred maturity and low feeding rates make them less likely to produce novel adaptations compared with other marine invertebrate taxa. Being largely restricted to hard substrata and low energy supply environments also makes it harder for them to migrate to new sites compared to other groups, because of the large geographic distances between colonisable areas. The only clear area they may have that gives them advantages is in the flexibility of their larval release strategies, where settlement can be from very short, millimetre-scale distances to hundreds of kilometres.

AB  - The social development, economic growth and booming population have caused aggravated water pollution, making clean water shortage an urgent issue to be solved. In recent decades, researchers have aroused upsurge studies of direct solar steam generation (DSSG) system for the production of clean water, in which solar thermal conversion materials (STCM) can strongly transform absorbed solar light into thermal energy, tremendously speeding the evaporation of water under sunlight irradiation. DSSG system has been considered an efficient, sustainable, low-cost and environment-friendly way to solve water shortage crisis of practical importance. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive summary of the recent development of DSSG system for clean water production. The introduction about categories of DSSG, principle of solar thermal conversion on STCM and efficiency calculation in DSSG system will first demonstrate the fast water evaporation mechanism. Then strategies for high performance water evaporation in DSSG are detailed including sunlight absorption regulation on STCM for efficient light utilization, system optimization of DSSC for minimizing the heat loss, water transport adjustment for adequate water supply and so on. Benefiting from the basic understanding and effective strategies of DSSG system, the quality of produced clean water, pollutants disposal in remaining water body and various designs of solar stills for high clean water productivity are further presented. Finally, we outline the current challenges and crucial issues of recent DSSG system, aiming to provide guidances and pointers to speed the development of DSSG in clean water production for practical applications.

AB  - Reproduction is an energetically costly activity that can alter thermal requirements in Squamata. This phenomenon has been largely studied in many viviparous species; however, little is known about the role of oviparous females in controlling temperature during vitellogenesis and embryo development before oviposition. Diversity of female phenotypes could be associated with diversity of thermoregulatory performance, since thermal requirements are frequently influenced by body shape. Furthermore, studying the thermoregulatory behaviour is fundamental to understand how females regulate their body temperature. Here, we aimed to determine whether reproduction alters thermal requirements in an oviparous model, Tropidorus spinulosus, and if the preferred body temperature and thermoregulatory behaviour vary among reproductive stages and in relation to the female phenotype. We characterized the female phenotypes according to multiple morphological traits (snout-vent length, inter-axillar length, abdominal perimeter, body condition and head width). Reproductive structures were diagnosed by portable ultrasound scanning. To determine body temperatures, the lizards were placed in an open-top terrarium, where a thermal gradient ranging from 18 to 50 degrees C was set up; we also recorded the permanence of individuals in cold, temperate and warm zones during each experiment. Reproductive females preferred higher temperatures and presented lower amplitude in thermal variability than non-reproductive females. Moreover, within reproductive females, females with wide abdominal perimeter and high body condition showed thermal stability. Females with oviductal eggs tended to select higher temperature and also show more thermal stability than females with vitellogenic follicles. The latter females used the temperate zone most frequently and to a lesser degree the warm one, whereas females with oviductal eggs used the temperate and warm zones with similarly high frequency. We conclude that reproductive stage and phenotypic traits influence the selection of preferred body temperatures and thermoregulatory behaviour in T. spinulosus females.

AB  - The sperm pre-fertilization environment has recently been suggested to mediate remarkable transgenerational consequences for offspring phenotype (transgenerational plasticity, TGB), but the adaptive significance of the process has remained unclear. Here, we studied the transgenerational effects of sperm pre-fertilization thermal environment in a cold-adapted salmonid, the European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus). We used a full-factorial breeding design where the eggs of five females were fertilized with the milt of 10 males that had been pre-incubated at two different temperatures (3.5 degrees C and 6.5 degrees C) for 15 h prior to fertilization. Thermal manipulation did not affect sperm motility, cell size, fertilization success or embryo mortality. However, offspring that were fertilized with 6.5 degrees C-exposed milt were smaller and had poorer swimming performance than their full-siblings that had been fertilized with the 3.5 degrees C-exposed milt. Furthermore. the effect of milt treatment on embryo mortality varied among different females (treatmentxfemale interaction) and male-female combinations (treatmentxfemalexmale interaction). Together, these results indicate that sperm pre-fertilization thermal environment shapes offspring phenotype and post-hatching performance and modifies both the magnitude of female (dam) effects and the compatibility of the gametes. Generally, our results suggest that short-term changes in sperm thermal conditions may have negative impact for offspring fitness. Thus, sperm thermal environment may have an important role in determining the adaptation potential of organisms to climate change. Detailed mechanism(s) behind our findings require further attention.

AB  - Thermal power has accounted for the major part of the electricity generation over recent several decades in China. It plays an important role in supporting China's economic development while it also brings great pressure to the environment protection because of a large amount of pollution generated during its production. In order to solve or alleviate the environmental problem caused by thermal power firms, efficiency evaluation is the first important step. As thermal power firm is a complex system with multiple inputs and multiple outputs, usually including fuzzy data and undesirable outputs in the productions, in this paper, we build an integrated Enhanced Russell measure model based on data envelopment analysis for evaluating the performance of decision making units in the presence of the undesirable outputs in fuzzy circumstance. Then, this new model is applied to analyze the environmental performance and provide the benchmarks for the thermal power firms in China which can guide the decision makers to make suitable future production plans for improving their performance.

AB  - Urban-driven evolution is widely evident, but whether these changes confer fitness benefits and thus represent adaptive urban evolution is less clear. We performed a multiyear field reciprocal transplant experiment of acorn-dwelling ants across urban and rural environments. Fitness responses were consistent with local adaptation: we found a survival advantage of the "home" and "local" treatments compared to "away" and "foreign" treatments. Seasonal bias in survival was consistent with evolutionary patterns of gains and losses in thermal tolerance traits across the urbanization gradient. Rural ants in the urban environment were more vulnerable in the summer, putatively due to low heat tolerance, and urban ants in the rural environment were more vulnerable in winter, putatively due to an evolved loss of cold tolerance. The results for fitness via fecundity were also generally consistent with local adaptation, if somewhat more complex. Urban-origin ants produced more alates in their home versus away environment, and rural-origin ants had a local advantage in the rural environment. Overall, the magnitude of local adaptation was lower for urban ants in the novel urban environment compared with rural ants adapted to the ancestral rural environment, adding further evidence that species might not keep pace with anthropogenic change.

AB  - The injection of anthropogenically-produced CO2 into the atmosphere will lead to an increase in temperature and a decrease in pH at the surface of the oceans by 2100. Marine intertidal organisms possess the ability to cope in the short term with environmental fluctuations exceeding predicted values. However, how they will cope with chronic exposure to elevated temperature and pCO(2) is virtually unknown. In addition, individuals from the same species/population often show remarkable levels of variation in their responses to complex climatic changes: in particular, variation in metabolic rates often is linked to differences in individuals' performances and fitness. Despite its ecological and evolutionary importance, inter-individual variation has rarely been investigated within the context of climatic changes, and most investigations have typically employed orthogonal experimental designs paired to analyses of independent samples. Although this is undoubtedly a powerful and useful approach, it may not be the most appropriate for understanding all alterations of biological functions in response to environmental changes. An individual approach arguably should be favored when trying to describe organisms' responses to climatic change. Consequently, to test which approach had the greater power to discriminate the intensity and direction of an organism's response to complex climatic changes, we investigated the extracellular osmo/iono-regulatory abilities, upper thermal tolerances (UTTs), and metabolic rates of individual adults of an intertidal amphipod, Echinogammarus marinus, exposed for 15 days to combined elevated temperature and pCO(2). The individual approach led to stronger and different predictions on how ectotherms will likely respond to ongoing complex climatic change, compared with the independent approaches. Consequently, this may call into question the relevance, or even the validity, of some of the predictions made to date. Finally, we argue that treating individual differences as biologically meaningful can lead to a better understanding of the physiological responses themselves and the selective processes that will occur with complex climatic changes; selection will likely play a crucial role in defining species' responses to future environmental changes. Individuals with higher metabolic rates were also characterized by greater extracellular osmo/iono-regulative abilities and higher UTTs, and thus there appeared to be no evolutionary trade-offs between these functions. However, as individuals with greater metabolic rates also have greater costs for maintenance and repair, and likely a lower fraction of energy available for growth and reproduction, trade-offs between life-history and physiological performance may still arise.

AB  - Hatching time (HT) of autumn-spawning fishes depends strongly on the egg incubation temperature and especially on the warming of water in spring, which synchronizes the hatching with ice-out despite the large inter-annual variability in spring phenology. However, the relative roles of genetic and environmental effects on the HT have rarely been explored. We studied experimentally the parental effects on the HT and size of vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) and whitefish (C. lavaretus L.) larvae under short and long winter conditions using a full-factorial breeding design. Both parents significantly affected the HT of vendace, mostly by additive genetic effects, and the difference between short and long winter treatment was also significant. In whitefish, the female x male interaction was significant, implying non-additive genetic effects. The maximum range of the HT of eggs between parent pairs within certain winter condition was 3 weeks and was clearly lower than the potential range for the temperature-adjusted HT. The size of eggs or hatched larvae did not correlate with the HT in either of the species. The variation in HT between eggs from different parents creates a basis for genetic adaptation to climate change and for local adaption of populations in their thermal environments.

AB  - Exogenous anomalies induced by contemporary climate change may severely impact dynamics of early life stages of fish. Here, we modelled how growth rate and abundance of postflexion larvae, and recruitment of Baltic spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus membras) in the Parnu Bay, Gulf of Riga (GoR) may respond to shifting climate variables. Higher larval growth rates were aligned with later seasonal emergence of yolk-sac larvae, while lower abundance of postflexion larvae occurred in years of earlier seasonal seawater warming. Cooler temperatures (< 16 degrees C) in spring expanded the optimal thermal window for first-feeding herring larvae, attributable to the absence of early seasonal water temperature warming. Higher recruitment levels emerged in years of seasonally delayed warming and were associated with higher abundance of post flexion larvae. In recent decades, the trend towards earlier warming of the Baltic Sea in spring threatens to create a bottleneck to successful recruitment of herring. The existing paradigm that abundant Baltic herring year-classes occur only in the years following mild winters no longer stands as environmental conditions undergo rapid change. The relative contribution of Parnu Bay larval nursery areas to recruitment has diminished as the suitable thermal window has been dramatically reduced in recent decades. Evolving thermal dynamics in the GoR have developed relatively recently and in future present a bottleneck for herring production.

AB  - Fifteen populations of Escherichia coli were propagated for 150 freeze-thaw-growth (FTG) cycles in order to study the phenotypic and genetic changes that evolve under these stressful conditions. Here we present the phenotypic differences between the evolved lines and their progenitors as measured by competition experiments and growth curves. Three FTG lines evolved from an ancestral strain that was previously used to start a long-term evolution experiment, while the other 12 FTG lines are derived from clones that had previously evolved for 20,000 generations at constant 37 degrees C. Competition experiments indicate that the former FTG group improved their mean fitness under the FTG regime by about 90% relative to their progenitor, while the latter FTG group gained on average about 60% relative to their own progenitors. These increases in fitness result from both improved survival during freezing and thawing and more rapid recovery to initiate exponential growth after thawing. This shorter lag phase is specific to recovery after freezing and thawing. Future work will seek to identify the mutations responsible for evolutionary adaptation to the FTG environment and use them to explore the physiological mechanisms that allow increased survival and more rapid recovery.

AB  - Anthropogenic changes to the environment have the opportunity to impact natural systems, particularly in organisms that exhibit phenotypic plasticity. Species with environmental sex determination (ESD) are uniquely susceptible to changes in the stimuli that affect sexual development, potentially leading to maladaptive sex ratios. We studied the factors affecting sex determination and sex ratios in the common snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina, in an area heavily impacted by agricultural practices. We investigated the effects of soybean, corn, and sunflower planting on incubation temperatures, sex ratios, and depredation in naturally laid nests. We also identified and analyzed a novel mitochondrial microsatellite in order to examine the presence of natal homing and determine the likelihood that nest sites impacted by agricultural practices could be transmitted across generations. Females frequently chose to nest in agricultural fields over sand prairie sites, and offspring sex ratios and depredation rates were significantly influenced by crop planting. Despite detecting considerable genetic variation in our population, we found no relationship between relatedness and nesting location, suggesting that females are not transmitting nesting sites across generations. Our results suggest that agricultural practices can directly impact populations of animals with ESD, and will need to be considered in management decisions. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Thermal-stress selection can affect multiple fitness components including mating success. Reproductive success is one of the most inclusive measures of overall fitness, and mating success is a major component of reproduction. However, almost no attention has been spent to test how mating success can be affected by thermal-stress selection. In this study, we examine the mating success in the cactophilic Drosophila buzzatii Patterson & Wheeler (Diptera: Drosophilidae) derived from two natural populations that nearly represent the ends of an altitudinal cline for heat knock-down resistance. Furthermore, we extended the analysis using laboratory lines artificially selected for high and low heat knock-down resistance. Mating success at high temperature was found to be higher in the lowland than the highland population after a heat pre-treatment. Moreover, individuals selected for heat knock-down resistance showed higher mating success at high temperature than did individuals selected for low knock-down resistance. These results indicate that adaptation to thermal stress can confer an advantage on fitness-related traits including mating success and highlight the benefits of earlier heat exposure as an adaptive plastic response affecting mating success under stress of higher temperature.

AB  - We demonstrated that predation by adult bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and white crappies Pomoxis annularis may be a major source of mortality for freshwater larval fish. In 5.3-m(3)-mesocosms, we compared the survival of larval bluegill prey (19 larvae/m(3); mean standard length [SL], 8.6 mm; range, 3-22 mm) in the presence of adult bluegills, adult white crappies, or adult izzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum with the survival of predator-free controls. The duration of the experiments was 3.7 h for bluegills, 3.2 h for white crappies, 5.5 h for gizzard shad, and 4.3 h for the predator-free controls. Larval fish survival in both the bluegill and white crappie predator treatments was lower than that of the predator-free controls, whereas larval fish survival in the gizzard shad treatments did not differ from that of the controls. The instantaneous hourly mortality rate attributable to predation was 0.11 for bluegill (9.8 larvae consumed/predator each hour) and 0.05 for white crappie (4.8 larvae consumed/predator each hour). Larval fish mortality in bluegill treatments was related positively to water clarity. Furthermore, bluegills were size-selective predators, with neutral selection for small larvae (<8 mm SL), positive selection for intermediate larvae (8-12 mm SL), and negative selection for large larvae (>12 mm SL). Despite a slight trend towards positive selection of small larvae, white crappies were not size-selective predators. Our concurrent stomach content analysis of predators failed to accurately quantify predation rates or detect any consumption of small larvae, which partly explains the dearth of published evidence linking adult fish predators to larval fish prey in freshwater systems. Thus, predation on limnetic freshwater fish larvae by adult fish (both cannibalism and predation on other species) may be a major mortality source that varies with predator type, larval size, and water clarity. These findings suggest that in addition to competition, predation may greatly affect larval survival in freshwater fishes.

AB  - Simple Summary The brown stink bug, Euschistus heros, is the most abundant species infesting Brazilian soybean crops, causing significant yield losses. This stink bug is controlled with chemical insecticides, although the use of biological control with the egg parasitoids Ooencyrtus submetallicus and Telenomus podisi is increasing. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the development of O. submetallicus and T. podisi in E. heros eggs at different temperatures, and to estimate the number of annual generations for seven representative soybean-producing regions in Brazil. In the comparative biology study, the sex ratio and individuals per egg were higher for O. submetallicus in all regions. In the study of thermal requirements, the temperatures of 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, and 33 & DEG;C were tested. The base temperature (Tb) for O. submetallicus and T. podisi was found to be 9.3 and 6.7 & DEG;C, and the thermal constant (K) was 336.9 and 272.7 degree-days, respectively. The average number of annual generations was estimated from the average temperatures of the last ten years in each region; based on these results, both parasitoids presented a higher number of generations than the host in all regions. O. submetallicus and T. podisi have the same ability to parasitize and develop in the eggs of E. heros under the conditions studied; in addition, both exhibited development and satisfactory parasitism at temperatures between 19 and 31 & DEG;C. The development of the two parasitoids was faster than E. heros, and the number of generations was higher for the seven studied localities.
   Temperature is one of the abiotic factors that strongly influences the biology and behavior of insects. In this study, we assessed the development of egg parasitoids Ooencyrtus submetallicus and Telenomus podisi parasitizing Euschistus heros eggs at different temperatures, and estimated the average number of generations for seven representative soybean-producing regions in Brazil. A comparative biology study was conducted, where the percentage of parasitism and emergence, life cycle duration (egg-adult), and longevity were found to be similar between O. submetallicus and T. podisi. The sex ratio and the number of individuals emerged from parasitized egg were higher in O. submetallicus in all regions. In the study of thermal requirements, temperatures of 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, and 33 & DEG;C were tested. O. submetallicus and T. podisi developed at temperatures between 16 and 31 & DEG;C. The base temperature (Tb) for O. submetallicus and T. podisi was 9.3 and 6.7 & DEG;C, respectively; the thermal constant (K) was 336.9 and 272.7 degree-days, respectively. The estimated average number of annual generations of both parasitoids was higher than the host. O. submetallicus and T. podisi have the same ability to parasitize and develop in eggs of E. heros under the conditions studied. Both parasitoids exhibited satisfactory development and parasitism at temperatures between 19 and 31 & DEG;C. The development of both parasitoids was faster than their host, and the number of generations was higher for the seven studied localities.

AB  - Genetic rescue has been proposed as a management strategy to improve the fitness of genetically eroded populations by alleviating inbreeding depression. We studied the dynamics of genetic rescue in inbred populations of Drosophila. Using balancer chromosomes, we show that the force of heterosis that accompanies genetic rescue is large and allows even a recessive lethal to increase substantially in frequency in the rescued populations, particularly at stress temperatures. This indicates that deleterious alleles present in the immigrants can increase significantly in frequency in the recipient population when they are in linkage disequilibrium with genes responsible for the heterosis. In a second experiment we rescued eight inbred Drosophila populations with immigrants from two other inbred populations and observe: (i) there is a significant increase in viability both 5 and 10 generations after the rescue event, showing that the increase in fitness is not transient but persists long-term. (ii) The lower the fitness of the recipient population the larger the fitness increase. (iii) The increase in fitness depends significantly on the origin of the rescuers. The immigrants used were fixed for a conditional lethal that was mildly deleterious at 25A degrees C but lethal at 29A degrees C. By comparing fitness at 25A degrees C (the temperature during the rescue experiment) and 29A degrees C, we show that the lethal allele reached significant frequencies in most rescued populations, which upon renewed inbreeding became fixed in part of the inbred lines. In conclusion, in addition to the fitness increase genetic rescue can easily result in a substantial increase in the frequency of mildly deleterious alleles carried by the immigrants. This can endanger the rescued population greatly when it undergoes recurrent inbreeding. However, using a sufficient number of immigrants and to accompany the rescue event with the right demographic measures will overcome this problem. As such, genetic rescue still is a viable option to manage genetically eroded populations.

AB  - Environments are changing rapidly, and to cope with these changes, organisms have to adapt. Adaptation can take many shapes and occur at different speeds, depending on the type of response, the trait, the population, and the environmental conditions. The biodiversity crisis that we are currently facing illustrates that numerous species and populations are not capable of adapting with sufficient speed to ongoing environmental changes. Here, we discuss current knowledge on the ability of animals and plants to adapt to environmental stress on different timescales, mainly focusing on thermal stress and ectotherms. We discuss within-generation responses that can be fast and induced within minutes or hours, evolutionary adaptations that are often slow and take several generations, and mechanisms that lay somewhere in between and that include epigenetic transgenerational effects. To understand and predict the impacts of environmental change and stress on biodiversity, we suggest that future studies should (1) have an increased focus on understanding the type and speed of responses to fast environmental changes; (2) focus on the importance of environmental fluctuations and the predictability of environmental conditions on adaptive capabilities, preferably in field studies encompassing several fitness components; and (3) look at ecosystem responses to environmental stress and their resilience when disturbed.

AB  - Populations of unisexual Ambystoma salamanders typically consist of ploidy-variable individuals (diploid through pentaploid) that differ in their proportional representation within the populations. These salamanders reproduce using a method that has been termed kleptogenesis: stealing genetic material from males of compatible bisexual Ambystoma species (e.g., Jefferson Salamanders [A. jeffersonianum] and Blue-spotted Salamanders [A. laterale]). Kleptogenesis can result in ploidy-variable embryos within an egg mass because the unisexual female might or might not incorporate the male genome. Little is known about the survivorship of individuals having different ploidy levels. Triploid individuals are most abundant, indicating that higher ploidy individuals (tetraploids and pentaploids) are either produced more rarely, or suffer higher mortality than triploids. We assessed the frequency of ploidy levels (determined by microsatellite analysis) across four life-history stages over 2 yr: adults, early larvae, late larvae, and metamorphosed juveniles. We found that warmer breeding-season temperatures were correlated with an increased frequency of high-ploidy individuals being produced. In addition, there was a gradual decline in tetraploids across all stages as the larvae developed into adults. Breeding season temperature and selection against certain ploidy levels both appear to be important drivers of unisexual salamander population composition at our study site.

AB  - Because of the renewed interest in renewable energy as well as increased emphasis on alternative technologies, micropower-generating systems have attracted considerable research interest over the last decade. However, micro-scale power generation for low grade heat recovery applications, i.e. as low as 1-3 kW - for domestic use, are characterized by very low efficiencies and relatively high specific cost. For economic viability, these factors make it imperative that the heat source remains "free", such as solar or geothermal energy.
   In this paper, a small-scale Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is presented. The small-scale ORC module was built and tested at San Diego State University lab, aimed at producing electricity and hot water from ultra-low grade heat source that can be tapped from solar collectors and low temperature exhaust heat. The system was built for economic viability and flexibility, tailored for a domestic use.
   The tests demonstrated that the system offered CHP capability, with electric and thermal power output suitable for a domestic application. It also offered high operational flexibility, since the scroll expander could work with a high temperature range, accommodating an even-significant drop of the heat source temperature. Therefore, it can be conveniently used to capture solar and low-temperature energy sources. The system could be produced at an overall cost of less than $3,000 (USD 2010).

AB  - Understanding how populations adapt to changing environmental conditions is a long-standing theme in evolutionary biology. Gene expression changes have been recognized as an important driver of local adaptation, but relatively little is known regarding the direction of change and in particular, about the interplay between plastic and evolutionary gene expression. We have previously shown that the gene expression profiles of European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) populations inhabiting different thermal environments include both plastic and evolutionary components. However, whether the plastic and evolutionary responses were in the same direction was not investigated in detail, nor was the identity of the specific genes involved. In this study, we show that the plastic changes in protein expression in response to different temperatures are highly correlated with the evolutionary response in grayling subpopulations adapted to different thermal environments. This finding provides preliminary evidence that the plastic response most likely facilitates adaptation during the early phases of colonization of thermal environments. The proteins that showed significant changes in expression level between warm and cold temperature treatments were mostly related to muscle development, which is consistent with earlier findings demonstrating muscle mass differentiation between cold and warm grayling populations.

AB  - This paper presents an algorithm for thermal optimization formulation strategies for multi-heat generation of integrated circuit (IC) on printed circuit board (PCB). Weighted-sum approach for multi-objective genetic algorithm (WMOGA) with formulated initial placement and multi-constraints parameters (FIPMCP) are presented. FIPMCP is used for the components selection and components to PCB placement mapping procedures for random initial population. The objectives are to optimize thermal distribution f(T) of electronic components on PCB and the PCB area f(A) needed simultaneously. For multi-objective optimization process, non-dominated optimal solutions and the best fitness WMOGA over iterations are plotted for both cases in order to obtain the best PCB optimal design solution. The results show that the best solution of f(T),f(A) and F(T,A) are minimized by 1.80%, 8.54% and 4.97% respectively.

AB  - As negative effects of ocean acidification are experienced by coastal ecosystems, there is a growing trend to investigate the effect ocean acidification has on multiple generations. Parental exposure to ocean acidification has been shown to induce larval carryover effects, but whether acute exposure to a stressor as an adult can influence the larval generation long after the stress has been removed has yet to be tested. To assess how a temporary exposure to experimental ocean acidification affects the ecologically and commercially relevant Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, adult oysters were exposed to either low pH (7.31 +/- 0.02) or ambient pH (7.82 +/- 0.02) conditions for 7 wk. Oysters were then held for 8 wk in ambient conditions, and subsequently reproductively conditioned for 4 wk at ambient pH. After conditioning, the oysters were strip-spawned to create four families based on maternal and paternal ocean acidification exposure. The number of D-hinge larvae was counted 18 h postfertilization. A sex-specific brood stock response was observed, where female exposure to low pH conditions resulted in fewer D-hinge larvae. This study demonstrates that the effects of ocean acidification can last beyond the time from when the environmental perturbation is experienced. Broadening the understanding of environmental memory will be valuable when considering organismal ability to persist in the face of environmental change.

AB  - Vector life-history traits and parasite development respond in strongly nonlinear ways to changes in temperature. These thermal sensitivities create the potential for climate change to have a marked impact on disease transmission. To date, most research considering impacts of climate change on vector-borne diseases assumes that all populations of a given parasite or vector species respond similarly to temperature, regardless of their source population. This may be an inappropriate assumption because spatial variation in selective pressures such as temperature can lead to local adaptation. We examine evidence for local adaptation in disease vectors and present conceptual models for understanding how local adaptation might modulate the effects of both short- and long-term changes in climate.

AB  - The population of influenza virus consists of a huge variety of variants, called quasispecies, due to error-prone replication. Previously, we reported that progeny virions of influenza virus become infected to adjacent cells via cell-to-cell transmission pathway in the presence of oseltamivir. During cell-to-cell transmission, viruses become infected to adjacent cells at high multiplicity since progeny virions are enriched on plasma membrane between infected cells and their adjacent cells. Co-infection with viral variants may rescue recessive mutations with each other. Thus, it is assumed that the cell-to-cell transmission causes expansion of virus quasispecies. Here, we have demonstrated that temperature-sensitive mutations remain in progeny viruses even at non-permissive temperature by co-infection in the presence of oseltamivir. This is possibly due to a multiplex infection through the cell-to-cell transmission by the addition of oseltamivir. Further, by the addition of oseltamivir, the number of missense mutation introduced by error-prone replication in segment 8 encoding NS1 was increased in a passage-dependent manner. The number of missense mutation in segment 5 encoding NP was not changed significantly, whereas silent mutation was increased. Taken together, we propose that oseltamivir expands influenza virus quasispecies via cell-to-cell transmission, and may facilitate the viral evolution and adaptation.

AB  - The growth and reproduction of 2 co-occurring mysids (Neomysis integer Leach, 1814 and Praunus flexuosus F. Muller, 1776) were investigated against the background of their life cycle with individual-based experiments in the laboratory at 2 temperatures (10 and 15degreesC). The response of postmarsupial growth in relation to age in N. integer followed a sigmoid curve, based on an increase in both intermoult periods and growth factors. Maturity occurred after 15 to 16 moults and an age of 110 d at 10degreesC. At 15degreesC, the mean age was 45 d and mean length was 8 mm at maturity. Up to this stage they had moulted 9 to 10 times, In adults, growth rates decreased with increasing length. In post-larval and juvenile individuals of N. integer (3 to 7 mm), growth strongly depended on temperature as shown by high temperature coefficients (Q(10) = 4.0 to 7.4). The impact of temperature, on the growth of P. flexuosus was markedly different, the intermoult periods decreased while the growth factors increased with increasing temperature. At 15degreesC they needed 3.5 mo to mature and averaged 16 to 18 mm. P. flexuosus needed more than twice as long as N. integer to reach maturity, long enough for 2 generations of N. integer. In addition, temperature coefficients were markedly lower in juvenile P. flexuosus (Q(10) = 1.0 to 3.1) than in juvenile N. integer, The reproduction rate of N, integer was twice that of P. flexuosus. Incubation time for P. flexuosus was longer, fewer post-larval individuals emerged, and juveniles were 1 to 1.5 mm longer than juvenile N. integer. There were clear differences in the sequence of generations of N. integer and P. flexuosus, based on the development, time to maturity, number, and length of offspring, These interspecific differences in growth and reproduction enable a better insight into the life history strategies of N. integer and P. flexuosus and help to interpret the different distribution patterns, population structures, and the coexistence of these 2 species.

AB  - Climate change facilitates biological invasions globally. Predicting potential distribution shifts of invasive crop pests under climate change is essential for global food security in the context of ongoing world population increase. However, existing predictions often omit the capacity of crop pests to mitigate the impacts of climate change by using microclimates, as well as through thermoregulation, life history variation and evolutionary responses. Microclimates provide refugia buffering climate extremes. Thermoregulation and life history variation can reduce the effects of diurnal and seasonal temperature variability. Evolutionary responses allow insects to adapt to long-term climate change. Neglecting these ecological processes may lead to overestimations in the negative impacts of climate change on invasive pests whereas in turn cause underestimations in their range expansions. To improve model predictions, we need to incorporate the fine scale microclimates experienced by invasive crop pests and the mitigation responses of insects to climate change into species distribution models.

AB  - Temperature effects on predatorprey interactions are fundamental to better understand the effects of global warming. Previous studies never considered local adaptation of both predators and prey at different latitudes, and ignored the novel population combinations of the same predatorprey species system that may arise because of northward dispersal. We set up a common garden warming experiment to study predatorprey interactions between Ischnura elegans damselfly predators and Daphnia magna zooplankton prey from three source latitudes spanning >1500km. Damselfly foraging rates showed thermal plasticity and strong latitudinal differences consistent with adaptation to local time constraints. Relative survival was higher at 24 degrees C than at 20 degrees C in southern Daphnia and higher at 20 degrees C than at 24 degrees C, in northern Daphnia indicating local thermal adaptation of the Daphnia prey. Yet, this thermal advantage disappeared when they were confronted with the damselfly predators of the same latitude, reflecting also a signal of local thermal adaptation in the damselfly predators. Our results further suggest the invasion success of northward moving predators as well as prey to be latitude-specific. We advocate the novel common garden experimental approach using predators and prey obtained from natural temperature gradients spanning the predicted temperature increase in the northern populations as a powerful approach to gain mechanistic insights into how community modules will be affected by global warming. It can be used as a space-for-time substitution to inform how predatorprey interaction may gradually evolve to long-term warming.

AB  - Water availability is a major environmental challenge to a variety of terrestrial organisms. In insects, desiccation tolerance varies predictably over spatial and temporal scales and is an important physiological determinant of fitness in natural populations. Here, we examine the dynamics of desiccation tolerance in North American populations of Drosophila melanogaster using: (a) natural populations sampled across latitudes and seasons; (b) experimental evolution in field mesocosms over seasonal time; (c) genome-wide associations to identify SNPs/genes associated with variation for desiccation tolerance; and (d) subsequent analysis of patterns of clinal/seasonal enrichment in existing pooled sequencing data of populations sampled in both North America and Australia. A cline in desiccation tolerance was observed, for which tolerance exhibited a positive association with latitude; tolerance also varied predictably with culture temperature, demonstrating a significant degree of thermal plasticity. Desiccation tolerance evolved rapidly in field mesocosms, although only males showed differences in desiccation tolerance between spring and autumn collections from natural populations. Water loss rates did not vary significantly among latitudinal or seasonal populations; however, changes in metabolic rates during prolonged exposure to dry conditions are consistent with increased tolerance in higher latitude populations. Genome-wide associations in a panel of inbred lines identified twenty-five SNPs in twenty-one loci associated with sex-averaged desiccation tolerance, but there is no robust signal of spatially varying selection on genes associated with desiccation tolerance. Together, our results suggest that desiccation tolerance is a complex and important fitness component that evolves rapidly and predictably in natural populations.

AB  - Parental effects may produce adaptive or maladaptive plasticity that either facilitates persistence or increases the extinction risk of species and populations in a changing climate. However, empirical evidence of transgenerational adaptive plastic responses to climate change is still scarce. Here we conducted thermal manipulation experiments with a factorial design in a Chinese lacertid lizard (Takydromus septentrionalis) to identify the fitness consequences of parental effects in response to climate warming. Compared to present climate conditions, a simulated warming climate significantly advanced the timing of oviposition, depressed the immune capability of post-partum females, and decreased the hatching success of embryos, but did not affect female reproductive output (clutch size and egg mass). These results indicate that maternal warming negatively affects female health, and embryonic hatchability. More interestingly, we found that offspring from parents exposed to warming environments survived well under a simulated warming climate, but not under a present climate scenario. Accordingly, our study demonstrates anticipatory parental effects in response to a warming climate in an ectothermic vertebrate. However, the fitness consequences of this parental effect will depend on future climate change scenarios.

AB  - 1. When first instar nymphs and adults of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Aphidiae) were maintained in long-term cultures (> 6 months) at 20 degrees C and 10 degrees C, the LT50 decreased from -8 and -8.8 degrees C to -16.0 and -13.5 degrees C, respectively.
   2. When aphids from the 20 degrees C culture were transferred to 10 degrees C, there was a progressive increase in cold tolerance through three successive generations. Transfer of newly moulted pre-reproductive adults reared at 10 degrees C for three generations back to 20 degrees C resulted in a rapid loss of cold hardiness in their nymphal offspring.
   3. In all generations reared at 10 degrees C, first born nymphs were more cold hardy than those born later in the birth sequence. The LT50 of nymphs produced on the first day of reproduction in the first, second and third generations maintained at 10 degrees C were -14.8, -17.0 and -16.6 degrees C, respectively. Thereafter, nymphal cold hardiness decreased over the subsequent 14 days of reproduction in each generation at 10 degrees C with mean LT50 values of -10.3, -12.6 and -14.8 degrees C, respectively. By contrast, the cold tolerance of first born nymphs of aphids reared continuously at 20 degrees C did not differ in comparison with later born siblings. The LT50 of adult aphids was also unaffected by ageing.
   4. The ecological relevance of these findings is discussed in relation to the overwintering survival of aphids such as S. avenae.

AB  - In Europe, numerous Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) provenance trials have been established and evaluated at a juvenile age. Still, information about the adaptation potential and long-term fitness of transferred seedlots in the Baltic Sea region is lacking. The aim of the study was to evaluate the adaptation capacity of provenances and assess the patterns of their long-term reaction to environmental transfer. We examined a 32-year-old provenance trial in the mild Baltic Sea coastal climate of Western Latvia. Significant differences in height and stem volume were observed among provenances. Growth superiority for certain local and Carpathian provenances was maintained over more than one-third of the rotation period. The best predictor of climate transfer functions was minimum temperature of the coldest month at the place of origin, explaining 28% variation in tree height. Populations from sites with more frost days and a colder mean annual temperature, minimum temperature, and lower annual heat-moisture index than the planting site were generally taller.

AB  - The Kalina cycle is believed to be one of the most promising technologies for power generation from low temperature heat sources such as geothermal energy. So far, most Kalina cycle power plants are designed with a working fluid mixture having a fixed composition, and thus normally operate at a fixed condensing temperature. However, the ambient temperature (i.e., heat sink) varies over a large range as the season changes over a year, particularly in continental climates. Recently, a new concept, i.e., composition adjustable Kalina cycle, was proposed to develop power plants that can match their condensing temperature with the changing ambient conditions, aiming at improving the cycle's overall thermal efficiency. However, no detailed analysis of its implementation and the potential benefits under various climate conditions has been reported. For this reason, this paper carried out a comprehensive numerical research on its implementation and performance analysis under several different climate conditions. A mathematical model is firstly established to simulate the working principle of a composition-adjustable Kalina cycle, based on which a numerical program is then developed to analyse the cycle's performance under various climate conditions. The developed numerical model is verified with some published data. The dynamic composition adjustment in response to the changing ambient temperature is simulated to evaluate its effect on the plant's performance over a year. The results show that a composition-adjustable Kalina cycle could achieve higher annual-average thermal efficiency than a conventional one with a fixed mixture composition. However, such an improvement of thermal efficiency strongly depends on the heat source temperature, climate conditions, etc. The composition-adjusting system introduces extra capital and operation costs. The economic viability of a composition-adjustable Kalina cycle power plant depends on the balance between these extra costs and the increase of thermal efficiency. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Little is known about intraspecific variation in fitness performance in response to thermal stress among natural populations and how this relates to evolutionary aspects of species ecology. In this study, population growth rate (PGR; a composite fitness measure) varied among five natural Chironomus riparius populations sampled across a climatic gradient when subjected to three temperature treatments reflecting the typical range of summer habitat temperatures (20, 24 and 28 A degrees C). The variation could be explained by a complex model including effects of genetic drift, genetic diversity and adaptation to average temperature during the warmest month, in addition to experimental temperature. All populations suffered a decrease in PGR from 20 to 28 A degrees C and Delta PGR was significantly correlated with the respective average habitat temperature in the warmest month-populations from warmer areas showing lower Delta PGR. This implies that long-term exposure to higher temperatures in the warmest month (the key reproductive period for C. riparius) is likely to be a key selective force influencing fitness at higher temperatures. A comparison of phenotypic divergence and neutral genetic differentiation revealed that one phenotypic trait-the number of fertile egg masses per female-appeared to be under positive selection in some populations. Our findings support a role for response to temperature selection along a climatic gradient and suggest population history is a key determinant of intraspecific fitness variation. We stress the importance of integrating different types of data (climatic, experimental, genetic) in order to understand the effects of global climate change on biodiversity.

AB  - Body temperature influences the performance and fitness of ectotherms. How thermal sensitivity responds to selection for resistance to high temperature is broadly relevant in evolutionary physiology and also has practical implications. We review several complementary approaches to studying the evolution of thermal sensitivity. First, we analyze comparative data that illustrate the historical evolution of thermal sensitivity of locomotion in iguanid lizards. Taxa that experience high body temperatures in nature have evolved high optimal temperatures for sprinting. Critical thermal maxima are coadapted with optimal temperatures but not with critical thermal minima. Thus some but not all aspects of thermal sensitivity are coadapted. Second, we describe selection experiments that help reveal potential genetic constraints on the future evolution of thermal sensitivity in Drosophila. Thermal sensitivity responds rapidly both to laboratory natural selection and artificial selection, and tolerance of extreme high temperature appears genetically correlated with performance at intermediate temperature. Third, applying a recent model by Lynch and Lande, we describe how the shape of thermal performance curves may affect evolutionary responses of thermal sensitivity to a gradual shift in the thermal environment. Our theoretical predictions depend crucially on the relationship-between the genetic variation in optimal temperature and the performance breadth. If genetic variation is independent of breadth, then populations with an intermediate value of performance breadth will tolerate the greatest rate of environmental change. Moreover, if a trade-off exists between maximum performance and breadth of performance, then thermal specialists will be favored over thermal generalists in a rapidly changing environment. On the other hand, if genetic variation increases with increasing breadth, then populations of thermal generalists will tolerate the greatest rates of environmental change.

AB  - Epidemiological studies on the impact of outdoor temperature to human health have demonstrated the capability of humans to adapt to local climate. However, there is limited information on the association between indoor temperature and human health, despite people spending most of their time indoors. The problem stems from the lack of sufficient indoor temperature measurement in the population. To overcome this obstacle, this paper presents an indirect epidemiological approach to evaluate the impact of high indoor temperature on mortality. The relationships between indoor-outdoor temperatures in different climate zones identified in the literature were combined with the outdoor temperature mortality curves of the same locations to obtain the local indoor minimum mortality temperatures (iMMT), the temperature at which mortality is lowest, which by implication is the temperature at which the population is most comfortable on average. We show that the iMMT varies and has a weak linear relationship with the distance to the equator, which provides evidence of human adaptation to local indoor temperatures. These findings reinforce the adaptive comfort theory, which states that people can adapt to local indoor environment and establish their thermal comfort. Recognising the human adaptability to local climate will direct flexible and optimized policy to protect public health against extreme temperature events. This will also help reduce energy consumption for regulating indoor temperature without compromising the occupants' health. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural selection alters the distribution of a trait in a population and indirectly alters the distribution of genetically correlated traits. Long-standing models of thermal adaptation assume that trade-offs exist between fitness at different temperatures; however, experimental evolution often fails to reveal such trade-offs. Here, we show that adaptation to benign temperatures in experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster resulted in correlated responses at the boundaries of the thermal niche. Specifically, adaptation to fluctuating temperatures (16-25 degrees C) decreased tolerance of extreme heat. Surprisingly, flies adapted to a constant temperature of 25 degrees C had greater cold tolerance than did flies adapted to other thermal conditions, including a constant temperature of 16 degrees C. As our populations were never exposed to extreme temperatures during selection, divergence of thermal tolerance likely reflects indirect selection of standing genetic variation via linkage or pleiotropy. We found no relationship between heat and cold tolerances in these populations. Our results show that the thermal niche evolves by direct and indirect selection, in ways that are more complicated than assumed by theoretical models.

AB  - Outdoor personal thermal comfort is of substantial significance to ameliorate the health conditions of pedestrian and outdoor laborer. However, the uncontrollable sunlight, substantial radiative loss, and intense temperature fluctuations in the outdoor environment present majestic challenges to outdoor personal thermal management. Here, we report an eco-friendly passive nanostructured textile which harvests energy from the sun and the outer space for optional localized heating and cooling. Compared to conventional heating/cooling textiles like black/white cotton, its heating/cooling mode enables a skin simulator temperature increase/decrease of 8.1 degrees C/6 degrees C, respectively, under sunlight exposure. Meanwhile, the temperature gradient created between the textile and human skin allows a continuous electricity generation with thermoelectric modules. Owing to the exceptional outdoor thermoregulation ability, this Janus textile is promising to help maintain a comfortable microclimate for individuals in outdoor environment and provide a platform for pervasive power generation.

AB  - One of the leitmotifs of the ecophysiological research on ectotherms is the variation and evolution of thermal reaction norms for biological rates. This long-standing issue is crucial both for our understanding of life-history diversification and for predicting the phenology of economically important species. A number of properties of the organism's thermal phenotype have been identified as potential constraints on the evolution of the rate-temperature relationship. This comparative study addresses several such constraints by testing whether the actual interspecific variation of thermal reaction norms across nearly hundred leaf beetle species agrees with the expected patterns. The results show that developmental rate and its temperature-dependent parameters are similar in closely related species and that the variation pattern depends on the taxonomic scale, the thermal reaction norms being mostly parallel for the representatives of distant subclades but intersecting more often farther down the phylogenetic tree. The parallel shift disagrees with the putative ubiquity of a positive slope-threshold relationship, whereby thermal reaction norms should normally intersect, and even more contradicts with the common-intersection hypothesis. The ability to develop in cooler conditions is not traded off at higher temperatures, which is an exception to the warmer is better principle. A comparison of high- and low-quality data indicates that some of these discrepancies with earlier findings may stem from a likely presence of noise in previous analyses, which may have affected the variation patterns observed. Overall, the failure to support the universality of the predicted patterns suggests that the evolution of thermal reaction norms in leaf beetles has largely overcome the hypothesized constraints.

AB  - A system of parallelly placed Li-ion batteries placed at different spacings and cooled by different coolants is analyzed. The prime focus is on the effect of spacings between the batteries on battery thermal performance. The temperature and heat flux at the coolant and battery interface is taken as continuous. Coolants used belong to thermal oils, gases, conventional oils, liquid metals, and nanofluids. Finite volume method-based numerical analysis is performed upon validation with experimental work reported in the literature, by developing a code in the C language. The simultaneous effect of battery aspect ratio, thermal conductivity, Reynolds number (Re-f), and heat generation at different battery spacings for each coolant on average Nusselt number (Nu(H)) is explored. An analytical model is developed and artificial neuro-fuzzy interference system (ANFIS) prediction of Nu(H) is carried out later. Battery aspect ratio, thermal conductivity, and heat generation for any given coolant do not affect the Nu(H). However, the coolant Prandtl number at different battery spacings has a prominent effect on Nu(H). Thermal oils and liquid metal coolants show a significant and non-linear variation of Nu(H) with increased battery spacings. The effect of Re-f on Nu(H) was linear as expected for all the coolants at different battery spacings. However, Nu(H) variations for liquid metal at different Re-f were highly non-linear. The mathematical model developed and ANFIS regression analysis indicated a very comfortable prediction of Nu(H). The R-squared value of the mathematical model is up to 0.98 while from ANFIS it is up to 0.985 showing a very good fitness of these models.

AB  - Synopsis Thermal performance curves enable physiological constraints to be incorporated in predictions of biological responses to shifts in mean temperature. But do thermal performance curves adequately capture the biological impacts of thermal extremes? Organisms incur physiological damage during exposure to extremes, and also mount active compensatory responses leading to acclimatization, both of which alter thermal performance curves and determine the impact that current and future extremes have on organismal performance and fitness. Thus, these sub-lethal responses to extreme temperatures potentially shape evolution of thermal performance curves. We applied a quantitative genetic model and found that beneficial acclimatization and cumulative damage alter the extent to which thermal performance curves evolve in response to thermal extremes. The impacts of extremes on the evolution of thermal performance curves are reduced if extremes cause substantial mortality or otherwise reduce fitness differences among individuals. Further empirical research will be required to understand how responses to extremes aggregate through time and vary across life stages and processes. Such research will enable incorporating passive and active responses to sub-lethal stress when predicting the impacts of thermal extremes.

AB  - Breeding and rearing the offspring through successive generations are mandatory in order to study evolutionary responses to anthropogenic impact in marine organisms. However, fish offer a limited number of marine model species that allow performing multigenerational experimental approaches. Here, we propose a novel breeding and rearing experimental model based on the marbled goby Pomatoschistus marmoratus (Risso 1810) which is representative of small (up to 65 mm total length), benthic species with a short life cycle. We devised a 'full-sib/half-sib' breeding design, and the resulting offspring were reared in captivity using a complex feeding protocol and a creative design of the tanks. Three families survived up to 160 days post-hatching (dph); one was reared at 24 degrees C and two at 18 degrees C. The families reared at 18 degrees C reached sexual maturity and spawned. The size range at sexual maturity of individuals reared in captivity was consistent with the one observed in nature. The possibility to complete the entire life cycle, from hatching to sexual maturity and spawning in P. marmoratus offers great perspectives for experimental evolution and quantitative genetics studies aimed at understanding the role of evolutionary processes in response to global changes.

AB  - Surface waters are warming due to climate change, potentially pushing aquatic organisms closer to their thermal tolerance limits. However, cyanobacterial blooms are expected to occur more often with rising temperature, increasing the likelihood of poor-quality food available for herbivorous zooplankton. Zooplankton can adapt locally by genetic differentiation or via adaptive phenotypic plasticity to increasing temperatures, but there is limited knowledge on how these processes may be affected by food quality limitation imposed by cyanobacteria. To test the effects of cyanobacteria-mediated food quality on local temperature adaptation, we measured juvenile somatic growth and reproduction of five Daphnia magna clones from different latitudinal origin grown on three food qualities at 20, 24, and 28 degrees C. Additionally we estimated short-term heat tolerance, measured as knockout time (time to immobility) at lethally high temperature, of two clones acclimated to the three temperatures and two food quality levels to test for the effects of food quality on adaptive plastic responses. As expected, clones from lower latitudes showed on average better somatic growth and reproduction than clones from higher latitudes at higher temperatures. However, the difference in somatic growth diminished with increasing cyanobacteria abundance in the diet, suggesting constraints on local genetic adaptation under predicted decreases in food quality. As expected, short-term heat tolerance of the clones generally increased with increasing acclimation temperature. However, heat tolerance of animals acclimated to the highest temperature was larger when grown at medium than at good food quality, whereas the opposite response was observed for animals acclimated to the lowest temperature. This suggests a better adaptive phenotypic response of animals to elevated temperatures under higher cyanobacteria abundance, and thus shows an opposite pattern to the results for somatic growth. Overall, we demonstrate that food quality limitation can mediate responses of D. magna life history traits and heat tolerance to increasing temperatures, and that the effects differ depending on the time scale studied, that is, mid-term (somatic growth) versus short-term (tolerance to acute heat stress). These aspects will need further attention to accurately predict of how organisms will cope with future global warming by local adaptation and adaptive phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - To mitigate the effects of climate change, it is important to understand species' responses to increasing temperatures. This has often been done by studying survival or activity at temperature extremes. Before such extremes are reached, however, effects on fertility may already be apparent. Sex differences in the thermal sensitivity of fertility (TSF) could impact species persistence under climate warming because female fertility is typically more limiting to population growth than male fertility. However, little is known about sex differences in TSF. Here we first demonstrate that the mating system can strongly influence TSF using the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We exposed populations carrying artificially induced mutations to two generations of short-term experimental evolution under alternative mating systems, manipulating the opportunity for natural and sexual selection on the mutations. We then measured TSF in males and females subjected to juvenile or adult heat stress. Populations kept under natural and sexual selection had higher fitness, but similar TSF, compared to control populations kept under relaxed selection. However, females had higher TSF than males, and strikingly, this sex difference had increased over only two generations in populations evolving under sexual selection. We hypothesized that an increase in male-induced harm to females during mating had played a central role in driving this evolved sex difference, and indeed, remating under conditions limiting male harassment of females reduced both male and female TSF. Moreover, we show that manipulation of mating system parameters in C. maculatus generates intraspecific variation in the sex difference in TSF equal to that found among a diverse set of studies on insects. Our study provides a causal link between the mating system and TSF. Sexual conflict, (re)mating rates and genetic responses to sexual selection differ among ecological settings, mating systems and species. Our study therefore also provides mechanistic understanding for the variability in previously reported TSFs which can inform future experimental assays and predictions of species responses to climate warming.

AB  - The rate of change in selective pressures is one of the main factors that determines the likelihood that populations can adapt to stress conditions. Generally, the reduction in the population size that accompanies abrupt environmental changes makes it difficult to generate and select adaptive mutations. However, in systems with high genetic diversity, as happens in RNA viruses, mutations with beneficial effects under new conditions can already be present in the population, facilitating adaptation. In this work, we have propagated an RNA bacteriophage (Q beta) at temperatures higher than the optimum, following different patterns of change. We have determined the fitness values and the consensus sequences of all lineages throughout the evolutionary process in order to establish correspondences between fitness variations and adaptive pathways. Our results show that populations subjected to a sudden temperature change gain fitness and fix mutations faster than those subjected to gradual changes, differing also in the particular selected mutations. The life-history of populations prior to the environmental change has great importance in the dynamics of adaptation. The conclusion is that in the bacteriophage Q beta, the standing genetic diversity together with the rate of temperature change determine both the rapidity of adaptation and the followed evolutionary pathways.

AB  - In salmon populations, local adaptation to seasonally varying incubation temperature is characterized by temperature-adjusted development times [measured in degree days - accumulated temperature units (ATUs)] that differ between control and F-1 hybrid crosses that were made between temporally separated population segments, a contrast not expected in a panmictic population. We examined adaptation of embryo development time to seasonally cooling temperature in a population of pink salmon by estimating genetic components of variation in control and hybrid F-1 crosses made between members of early- and late-spawning subpopulations, and replicated our observations in independent odd- and even-year brood lines. In each brood line, both sire and dam components of variation of development time were significant and accounted for a substantially larger portion of variation than their interactions, which suggested that natural selection has acted primarily on additive genetic variation. The implications of these results are that (1) spatially or temporally proximate salmon populations may be structured by distinct adaptations; (2) artificial relaxation of local geneflow barriers may lead to depression of fitness; and (3) populations of salmon genetically structured by local adaptation may carry variation that enhances their persistence during rapid climate change.

AB  - The generation of electricity from solar thermal source has continued to garner more attention due to the very attractive environmental performance, the applicability to small distributed users and as alternative to the fossil fuels power generation. Indeed, solar thermal energy, through the coupling with ORC systems, becomes fit for electric power generation as well and, with a proper thermal storage, can deliver more equivalent hours than other residential systems. The paper analyses, by means of system modelling simulation, a small solar power plant composed by a CPC heat pipe solar collector device feeding a thermal storage, an ORC and an absorber unit. Beside the analysis of configuration and design, this paper proposes an economic analysis taking into consideration the applicable incentive. The evaluation highlights the economic viability of the proposed system and tries to define a roadmap to optimize results consisting in acceptable PBT and positive NPV.

AB  - Bronze birch borer (Agrilus anxius Gory) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), a specialist wood-borer endemic to North America, is prone to periodic outbreaks that have caused widespread mortality of birch (Betula spp.) in boreal and north temperate forests. It is also the key pest of birch in ornamental landscapes. Amenity plantings have extended the distribution of birch in North America, for which we report an updated map. Life history and phenology also are summarized. Larvae feed primarily on phloem tissue of stems and branches, which can girdle and kill trees. Stressors such as drought, elevated temperature, and defoliation predispose trees to bronze birch borer colonization and trigger outbreaks, which implicates the availability of suitable host material in the bottom-up regulation of populations. Stress imposed by climate change may increase the frequency of outbreaks and alter the distribution of birch. Bronze birch borer has a diverse array of natural enemies, but their role in top-down population regulation has not been studied. There is substantial interspecific variation in resistance to this insect. North American species share a coevolutionary history with bronze birch borer and are much more resistant than Eurasian species, which are evolutionarily naive. Potential resistance mechanisms are reviewed. The high susceptibility of Eurasian birch species and climatic similarities of North America and Eurasia create high risk of widespread birch mortality in Eurasia if the borer was inadvertently introduced. Bronze birch borer can be managed in amenity plantings through selection of resistant birch species, plant health care practices, and insecticides.

AB  - Much scientific research dedicated to understanding the effects of freshwater salinization caused by road de-icing salts has utilized static exposures, with many tests conducted at winter or spring temperatures. While relevant for lentic ecosystems, pulsed patterns of salinity occur in lotic environments, particularly in summer months where precipitation can decrease elevated salinity levels caused by retention of residual salts. The current study aimed to evaluate the effects of pulsed patterns of salinity on the emergence, sex ratio, and fecundity of Chironomus dilutus over two generations of laboratory exposure. Three road de-icing salt treatments, including a control, modeled after environmental monitoring data of two local streams, were used to determine the ecological effects of periodic declines in salinity on C. dilutus at summer temperatures. No significant effects were observed on emergence success or sex ratios within or across generations, but fecundity of C. dilutus in the high salt treatment was reduced regardless of generation (P < 2e-16), possibly due to increased osmoregulatory stress caused by increased salinities. The intermediate and decreasing salinities may account for the lack of negative effects on emergence success and sex ratios by protecting sensitive life stages. More research is needed on long-term effects of reduced fecundity on population viability. The current study suggests more research using a similar experimental design is needed to fully evaluate the influence of road de-icing salts in lotic environments, as static laboratory exposures may not accurately reflect environmental changes in salinity.

AB  - Genetic variation for parasite resistance occurs in most host populations. Costs of resistance, manifested as reduced fitness of resistant genotypes in the absence of parasitism, can be an important factor contributing to the maintenance of this variation. One powerful tool for detecting costs of resistance is the study of correlated responses to artificial selection. Provided that experimental lines are recently derived from large outbreeding populations, and that inbreeding is minimized during the experiment, correlated responses to selection are expected to be strong indicators of pleiotropy. We artificially selected for elevated behavioral resistance against an ectoparasitic mite (Macrocheles subbadius) in replicate populations of the fly Drosophila nigrospiracula. Resistance was modeled as a threshold trait, and the realized heritability of resistance was estimated to be 12.3% (1.4% SE) across three replicate lines recently derived from nature. We contrasted the longevity and fecundity of resistant and control (unselected) flies under a variable thermal environment. We report that reduced fecundity is a correlated response to artificial selection for increased resistance, and that the strength of this effect increases from 25 degrees to 29 degrees C. In contrast, longevity differences were not detected between resistant and control lines at either temperature. These findings are robust as they were confirmed with an independent set of experimental lines. Thus, our results identify a negative genetic correlation between ectoparasite resistance and an important life-history trait. That a correlated response was only detected for fecundity, and not longevity, suggests that the genetic correlation is attributable to pleiotropic effects with narrower effects than reallocation of a general resource pool within the organism, although other interpretations are discussed. Combined with fluctuating parasite-mediated selection and temperature, the presence of this trade-off may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation for resistance in natural populations.

AB  - We previously demonstrated temperature-specific genetic adaptation in experimental lines of Escherichia coli. Six initially identical populations were propagated for 2000 generations under each of five regimes: constant 20 degrees C, 32 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 42 degrees C, and a daily switch between 32 degrees C and 42 degrees C. Glucose was the sole carbon source in all cases. Here, we examine the physiological bases of adaptation to determine whether the same mechanisms evolved among the replicate lines within each thermal regime and across different regimes. Specifically, we investigate whether changes in glucose transport may account for the temperature-specific adaptation. We compared each line's direct response of fitness to glucose with its correlated response to maltose; glucose and maltose enter the cell by different pathways, but their catabolism is identical. Except for lines maintained at the ancestral temperature (37 degrees C), almost all derived lines had significantly different fitnesses (relative to their common ancestor) in glucose and maltose, supporting the hypothesis that adaptation involved changes in glucose transport. An alternative explanation, that maltose transport decayed by genetic drift, appears unlikely for reasons that are discussed. Although most lines showed evidence of temperature-specific adaptation in glucose transport, several different mechanisms may underlie these improvements, as indicated by heterogeneity in correlated responses (across temperatures and substrates) among replicate lines adapted to the same regime. This heterogeneity provides a latent pool of genetic variation for responding to environmental change.

AB  - The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) has been actively involved in development of biomass gasifier system for thermal and power generation use. Though the basic science of gasification is well established, there have not many efforts in the past on product development. By continuous interaction with users, silk experts and consultants, TERI could able to develop a gasifier based silk reeling oven. A major thrust on this development work was to evolve marketable product by continued efforts to gain an insight of the actual process and user feedback through an extended presence and interaction at field level, and then translating this experience in product design. The present paper gives a summary of design, development and testing of gasifier based cottage basin system for cocoon cooking in silk reeling industry in order to achieve higher fuel efficiency and increase productivity of the process. The paper describes in detail the approach of different technology development stages, its testing both at laboratory and field and economic viability of the system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Experiments on life history genetics are usually performed using constant temperature environments in the laboratory. However, the dynamics of insect growth can be influenced profoundly by daily fluctuations in temperature such as those which characterize field environments. We report here on experiments using different stocks and selected lines of a tropical butterfly, Bicyclus anynana, to examine whether genotype-environment interactions occur for three traits describing pre-adult growth. These traits were measured over two pairs of environments differing in mean temperature, each of which had a constant, and a cycling temperature regime. Development time, pupal weight and growth rate show genotype-environment interactions, especially at comparatively low average temperatures. Researchers should, therefore, take care when extrapolating from the form of genetic covariance matrices and 'trade-offs' among life history traits found in constant temperature environments to those likely to occur in nature.

AB  - This research presents technical and cost-minimised design to decarbonise the heating network by using large-scale heat pump and thermal heat storage. In this paper, real hourly heat-consumption and heat production cost data for the city of Aarhus, Denmark are used for calculating techno-economic feasibility of coupling the heating network with electrical grid. An optimum solution is suggested for the entire network with least amount of backup generation capacity, thermal heat storage capacity, natural gas boiler capacity and levelised cost of energy. Aarhus constitutes 5% of the Denmark's total heat demand and 4% of electrical load demand. This can be fulfilled with 160 MW of rated wind generation capacity, 35 MW of solar PV generation capacity, 45 MW of backup generation capacity, 221 MW of natural gas boiler capacity and 3.4 GWh of thermal heat storage capacity. The levelised cost of energy shows that, the coupling between the electrical grid and heating sector reduces the cost by more than 50% to 45 /MWh. However, the cost-minimised design is possible with wind/solar mix of 85% and renewable energy penetration of 100%. Sensitivity analysis concedes that, the 100% decarbonisation of heating sector relies heavily upon the cost assumed for wind generation and solar PV generation, instead of the operation and maintenance cost for heat pump. Furthermore, the reduction in cost for wind generation and solar PV generation leads to the decrease in levelised cost of energy. Whereas, the reduction in cost for heat pump, thermal heat storage capacity and natural gas boiler capacity leads to an increase in renewable energy penetration. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that, increasing thermal heat storage capacity and the cost of selling excess renewable energy does not have major impact upon the levelised cost of energy and can be instrumental for the economic viability of fossil-free future.

AB  - The growth responses of Yersinia enterocolitica as affected by NaCl concentration, pH value and storage temperature were studied in laboratory medium. Growth curves at concentrations of NaCl in the range 0.5-6.5% (w/v), pH Values in the range 4.0-7.0 and storage temperatures in the range 5-30 degrees C were fitted using the Gompertz routine and the derived parameters modelled. Growth curves could then be regenerated for any set of conditions within the matrix studied and values for growth rate, generation time, lag time and time to 1000-fold increase predicted. The model was validated against data from the literature and was found to give realistic estimates for generation time in media and a range of foods including meat and meat products, milk, eggs, fish and tofu. All predictions were consistently 'fail-safe'.

AB  - The influence of temperature on the emergence and adult longevity of Platygaster demades Walker, an egg parasitoid of apple leaf curling midge (ALCM) was determined at five constant temperatures in the laboratory: 11, 15, 19, 23, and 27 degrees C. Apple leaves infested with second and fourth generation ALCM larvae were collected from three regions in New Zealand. Emergence of both ALCM and P. demades at the five temperatures were compared across two generations and three locations. Adult P. demades were fed with honey-agar diet and tested for longevity without exposure to ALCM eggs. Ten females reared at each temperature were allowed to live full life spans, and once dead were dissected to measure potential fecundity. The development period of P. demades in soil increased with increasing temperature but fewer emerged at 11 and 27 degrees C. The optimum temperature was 19 'C. Significant differences in development and emergence rates of P. demades between the second and fourth generations with temperature were detected (P = 0.003), although no differences in either were found between locations (P > 0.400). The highest longevity for females (47.9 +/- 5.5 days) and males (31.3 +/- 5.3 days) was recorded at 11 degrees C. Longevity decreased with increasing temperature. Life time fecundity did not change with age (P = 0.888) and an average female carried a mean pre-ovipositional load of 1380 +/- 263 eggs. Temperature has been considered one of the most important physical factors to influence asynchrony between second generation populations of P. demades and ALCM. Impacts of high longevity and fecundity on the ability of the parasitoid to overcome the synchrony are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The radiation exposure due to Rn-222 and its progeny inhalation for clients and employees of selected thermal water spas was assessed. The radon risk was calculated using the measured Rn-222 activity concentrations in the investigated thermal waters and radon transfer coefficient, defined as a fraction of radon released from the swimming pool water to the indoor air of swimming pool. The total radon in air concentration was not measured. The annual effective doses for workers and clients of the studied spa centers excluding LA...dek-Zdroj ranged from 0.02 to 2.69 mSv and 0.40 to 48 mu Sv, respectively. For thermal water from LA...dek-Zdroj (LA...dek-Zdroj L-2), significantly elevated doses were observed both for workers (10.8 mSv) and clients (194 mu Sv).

AB  - Previous studies reported that of the two egg parasitoids of Riptortus pedestris (F.) (Hemiptera: Alydidae) found in Korea, Gryon japonicum (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) appears in soybean fields much earlier than Ooencyrtus nezarae Ishii (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae). To explain this phenomenon, we evaluated the interactive influence of temperature and relative humidity (RH) on the biological attributes of these parasitoids, including adult parasitoid longevity and survival. Temperature had significant effects on all the biological attributes examined for both parasitoids, while RH only affected rates of parasitism and adult emergence. Interaction between temperature and species, but not RH and species was found to affect significantly on parasitism. G. japonicum showed higher relative increment in parasitism than O. nezarae at temperatures higher than 25 degrees C. No significant differences in progeny sex ratio were detected for either species at any temperature X humidity combination. RH had no effect on the developmental time of O. nezarae but on the developmental time of G. japonicum, which was longer at low RH. Although the biological attributes of adult parasitoids of both species showed a wide range of adaptability, but it did not explain the patterns of occurrence of these species in the field. However, G. japonicum showed greater longevity than O. nezarae at all combinations of temperature and RH and this may partially explain the seasonal pattern of occurrence of adult parasitoids in the field previously observed.

AB  - Massive spring mortality outbreaks have been reported in Mytilus spp. in France since 2014. The main areas affected are the Pertuis Charentais Sounds and the coast of the Pays de la Loire, which cultivate mainly M. edulis, and the putative causal agents remain unknown. We report the results of the first generation of mass selection focused on survival and resistance to the spring mortality in M. edulis. Two stocks of mussels were sampled in the Pertuis Charentais Sounds in 2014; one of these went through a spring mortality outbreak and the survivors were used to produce the selected stock, while the second stock was M. edulis considered to be naive against the putative causal agents of the mortality outbreak and was used to produce the control stock. A first cohort was produced in 2015 and tested at one site in the Pertuis Charentais Sounds. In April and May 2016, a spring mortality outbreak was observed when seawater temperature ranged from 10 to 15 degrees C. In October 2016, the selected stock had a lower mortality (44%) than the control stock (78%). To confirm this result and investigate genotype by environment interaction, a second cohort was produced in 2016 and tested at six sites. Although no significant mortality was reported at the four sites in the Pertuis Charentais Sounds in 2017, the selected stock had a lower mortality (17-27%) than the control stock (61-74%) at the two sites along the coast of the Pays de la Loire. The survival had increased of 34-48% after one generation of mass selection and the realized heritability was high, ranging from 0.55 to 1.15, but further generations of selection are required to obtain a better estimation of the heritability. Our study showed a positive response to selection in three environments that were different to the site from which mussels were selected, suggesting the absence of strong genotype by environment interaction in sites where spring mortality outbreaks occurred. Selection to enhance M. edulis survival of the spring mortality should be efficient and should be capable of easy implementation through mass selection. Apparently, selection to enhance the survival of M. edulis did not affect the mussel growth in comparison with the controls, but automatically improved the yield of M. edulis in sites affected by the spring mortality outbreaks.

AB  - Arrhenius parameters, 25 degrees and 10 degrees C rate constants for hydrolysis of most EPA 601/602 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), their hydrolytic progeny, and selected other VOCs are tabulated. Data include Arrhenius parameters for base-mediated hydrolysis of bromodichloromethane, bromoform, dibromochloromethane, and the acid-mediated hydrolysis of ethylene oxide which have not been published before. The average activation energy of the tabulated values, excepting epoxides, is 110,100 joules per mole, which exceeds values reported previously as typical for VOCs. As a result of this high activation energy, the half-lives of VOCs typically are more than an order of magnitude longer at 10 degrees than 25 degrees C.
   These data are necessary for calculating hydrolysis rates accurately and, thus, for estimating remediation effectiveness when hydrolysis is being considered for remediation. Other things being equal, hydrolysis rates become much faster with increasing temperature and, for some VOCs, with increasing pH. The hydrolysis half-lives at 25 degrees C and pH = 7 of many haloalkanes and halogenated alcohols are less than 100 years (yr), many halomethanes (freon-like compounds), and halogenated aldehydes are less than 1000 yr, and many haloalkenes and aromatic VOCs tend to exceed 1000 yr.
   These data can be used to select temperature and pH conditions to impose on water to favor fast hydrolysis or, for branching degradation schemes, select the shorter lived or less toxic progeny. Moreover, these data are necessary to calculate the major hydrolysis progeny for any conditions. Also, these data can be used in forensic geochemical applications such as estimating original contamination composition, time since contamination occurred, distance to source, and whether nonaqueous-phase liquids persist.
   The main base-mediated hydrolytic degradation route of haloalkanes is induced to be dehydrohalogenation and the main progeny of these reactions are ethenes. Another degradation phenomenon for chlorinated hydrocarbons in aquifers, chemical reductive dehalogenation by low concentrations of natural organic carbon, is proposed and shown to be consistent with published literature.

AB  - The energy generation industry faces new challenges and requirements. The fourth generation of nuclear power plants is developed to meet the future clean energy demand by 2030. The supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) Brayton closed cycle features compactness and high efficiency, combined with short construction time, standing for higher profitability when compared to current steam cycles. In this article, a method for assessing overall viability of direct and indirect carbon dioxide cycles is described. This method comprises both thermodynamic and economic analyses. Thermodynamic and economic models have been developed to assess several cycle designs in terms of overall viability that includes thermodynamic performance and financial outcome. Each cycle has been calculated through an iterative process that takes into account the variation of the properties of the working fluid and returns temperatures, pressure, efficiency, and power generation for the given design characteristics. The economic model, on the other hand, includes the calculation of overnight cost, which is a function of the cycle choice, through the cost of the components. Furthermore, plant profitability is calculated over a given period, which depends on both overnight cost and power plant efficiency. The method has been applied on an indicative parametric analysis of two S-CO2 cycles (direct and indirect) where the capability of identifying optimum areas has been case shown. In terms of overall pressure ratio, it was found that a thermodynamically optimized cycle would not coincide with an economically optimized one, due to the effect of component costing. On the other hand, turbine entry temperature appeared to considerably improve both power output and economic outcome, even though a maximum value is dictated by thermal and mechanical resistances of materials. In overall, even though power generation train is only a subsystem in a nuclear plant, it has been demonstrated that thermodynamic cycle design can have a significant impact on maximizing the earning capacity of the plant, especially through the implementation of a novel highly dense fluid, such as the S-CO2, which bears the potential of high compactness.

AB  - Maternal basking regime can affect gestation length in viviparous squamates, but effects on offspring phenotype in species with extended pregnancies and ability to delay the birth season are unclear. We investigated the effects of three maternal basking regimes on maternal thermoregulation, gestation length, pregnancy outcome and offspring phenotype in the gecko Woodworthia 'Otago/Southland'. This long-lived (30+ years), nocturnal forager has field pregnancies lasting up to 14 months, with fully developed offspring maintained in utero over winter. Within regimes, we also compared outcomes for spontaneous (early) deliveries with those from induced (late) deliveries to test the 'adaptive prolongation of pregnancy' hypothesis. Although a cool regime significantly extended gestation, the effect was reduced by increased maternal basking, and embryonic development under the cool regime was just as successful. Offspring from spontaneous births (but not induced births) were smaller and grew more slowly when from the cool regime. However, induced offspring did not differ in consistent ways from those delivered spontaneously and offspring from all groups had high viability, similar use of warm retreat sites and similar sprint speeds. Thus, consistent evidence for adaptive prolongation of pregnancy was lacking. Unusually for squamates, pregnant females can begin vitellogenesis before giving birth, and a profound drop in maternal body temperature near the end of pregnancy (similar to 6.3 degrees C, confirmed under the warm regime) may assist survival of embryos in utero. Female lizards that maintain fully developed embryos in utero have the potential to make complex trade-offs among birthdate, offspring phenotype and future reproduction.

AB  - Most research on thermal adaptation of ectotherms is based on experiments performed at constant temperatures. However, for short-lived insects daily fluctuations of temperature could be an important environmental parameter involved in evolutionary adaptation to thermal heterogeneity. In this study we investigated the mechanisms underlying evolutionary adaptation to daily fluctuating temperatures. We studied replicated selection lines of Drosophila simulans evolved in a constant or a daily fluctuating thermal regime. Previous studies of these lines have shown clear acclimation benefits to heat tolerance induced by the fluctuating regime. First, we tested the existence of an evolved circadian controlled adjustment of heat resistance in selected flies. This was done by investigating the daily variation in time to heat knockdown in flies from both selection regimes when exposed to either a constant or a daily fluctuating thermal regime for a single generation. While daily variation in heat resistance was found, the results suggest that there was neither an evolved adaptive circadian controlled adjustment of heat resistance nor a continuous acclimation response induced by fluctuating temperatures in these lines. Second, in order to reveal functional candidates for adaptation to the fluctuating thermal regime, we investigated the global transcriptomic response to a high temperature exposure in flies from both regimes. We found that flies selected both in constant and fluctuating thermal regimes responded similarly to increasing temperature. However, we found that evolutionary adaptation to the fluctuating thermal regime led to transcriptional enrichment of the GO terms eggshell chorion assembly and cellular response to heat The latter category was constituted by a constitutive up -regulation of four Turandot genes and not heat shock protein genes, suggesting that Turandot genes could play a prominent role for adaptation to daily fluctuating thermal conditions.

AB  - India depends mainly on indigenous coal for its power generation and imported oil for its transportation needs. Most of the energy needs of rural poor are met by burning wood and other biomass in the least efficient manner adding to the GHG emissions. A comprehensive system of utilizing biomass energy to replace or supplement coal usage in power generation and industrial heating systems is a pressing need. Converting rural population to better fuels or efficient biomass burners will also help in reducing the growth of GHG emissions. An efficient network of Biomass Briquette Manufacturing system could help addressing most of these issues in a sustainable manner. The briquettes made from biomass can be mixed with coal for co-firing, used in gasifiers to produce syngas used for small scale power plants established in remote regions. This paper discusses the elements and needs of briquetting system and proposes ways to improve the productivity of the biomass briquetting system by eliminating bottlenecks and improving processes.

AB  - Comparisons between transgenic (T) and wild-type Metaseiulus occidentalis colonies (COS) were made under laboratory conditions as part of a risk assessment effort prior to proposed field releases. There were no differences between the transgenic T18 colony and the COS strain in the daily egg production, hatchability at three temperatures and four relative humidity (RH) conditions, diapause incidence, or proportion of female progeny produced. Metaseiulus occidentalis eggs do not hatch at 38 degrees C under any RH tested, nor at 33.5 degrees C under 100% RH, indicating that high temperature and extreme RH affect egg hatch negatively. At 28.5 and 33.5 degrees C, fewer eggs hatched at 32.5% than at 75.5 and 93% RH. Metaseiulus occidentalis cannot survive on any plant tested without prey nor on a diet of pollen alone; adult female mites cannot prey or survive on a diet of eggs and larvae of two lepidopteran species, indicating that the suitability of food sources has not been altered in the transgenic strain. Two subcolonies, derived from two transgenic strains using single females, differed in the rate of egg hatch at 28.5 degrees C under 32.5 and 100% RH, indicating that reduced genetic variation and/or random genetic drift in the two lines may have led to differences in some biological characters. Since we did not find any significant differences between the T18 and COS colonies in the traits tested, the T18 colony is not expected to exhibit any new biological attributes in a proposed short-term field release.

AB  - Global climate is changing at a rapid pace and the pivotal question is if the rate and extent of species' responses to stressful events enable them to persist in a changing world. Although the consequences of rapid environmental changes on animal life-history traits are receiving considerable attention, our understanding of how temperature fluctuations affect sexual chemical communication in animals is scarce. Male-female interactions often depend on pheromone detectability and sudden shifts in environmental temperature are expected to disrupt communication between potential mates. Whether organisms can adapt to temperature-induced changes at both signaller and receiver levels is virtually unexplored. In this perspective paper, we first provide a broad overview of the sex pheromone pathway, from biosynthesis to detection, and outline the importance of chemical-based mate choice. Finally, through several study cases, we highlight how thermal stress may interfere with chemical communication between the sexes, and discuss the potential evolutionary consequence of temperature stress.

AB  - The well-preserved Mesoproterozoic succession in the North China platform consists mainly of three lithological associations including peritidal quartz sandstone, shallow marine and lagoonal dark to black shales, and shallow epeiric carbonates, with a total thickness of up to 8 000 m. In addition to well-documented microplants, macroalgae, and microbial buildups, abundant microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS) and mat-related sediments have been recognized in these rocks. Intensive microbial mat layers and MISS are especially well preserved in the carbonates of the upper Gaoyuzhuang (ca. 1.5 Ga) and lower Wumishan (ca. 1.45 Ga) formations, indicating diversified microbial activities and a high organic production. In these petrified biomats, putative microbial fossils (both coccoidal and filamentous) and framboidal pyrites have been identified. The abundance of authigenic carbonate minerals in the host rocks, such as, acicular aragonites, rosette barites, radial siderites, ankerites, and botryoidal carbonate cements, suggests authigenic carbonate precipitation from anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) under anoxic/euxinic conditions. Warm climate and anoxic/euxinic conditions in the Mesoproterozoic oceans may have facilitated high microbial productivity and organic burial in sediments. Although authigenic carbonate cements may record carbonate precipitation from anaerobic methane oxidation, gas blister (or dome) structures may indicate gas release from active methanogenesis during shallow burial. Bituminous fragments in mat-related carbonates also provide evidence for hydrocarbon generation. Under proper conditions, the Mesoproterozoic mat-rich carbonates will have the potential for hydrocarbon generation and serve as source rocks. On the basis of petrified biomats, a rough estimation suggests that the Mesoproterozoic carbonates of the North China platform might have a hydrocarbon production potential in the order of 10 x 10(8) t.

AB  - Animals that face natural and human-mediated landscape disturbance processes can demonstrate different modalities of phenotypic variation to influence local population persistence. Differences in the frequency and pervasiveness of environmental variation can cause an individual's phenotype to demonstrate either directional plasticity (i.e., environmental matching), canalization, or increased trait variance. Furthermore, how important a trait's influence is on fitness can further mediate the nature of phenotypic outcomes to environmental variation. We explored the effects of multi-decadal chronosequences of logging and fire-related forest disturbance on morphological variation of the generalist lizard species, the Yellow-bellied water skink (Eulamprus heatwolei) in Southern Australia. There was evidence that both logging and fire-related disturbance could influence multiple elements of vegetation structure that would construe a major source of environmental variation for lizards. Nevertheless, neither logging nor fire-related disturbance effects resulted in significant differences in lizard morphological traits. However, there was evidence that years post-fire disturbance was associated with a modest but significant increase in a measure of lizard morphological variance. For the most part, we suggest that lizards exhibit canalization in their morphological responses to disturbance related environmental variation. In forests ecosystems with complex temporal and spatial regimes of environmental variation, canalization of lizard morphology could be expected to ensure phenotypic stability within or across generations to favor geometric, over arithmetic, fitness.

However, these partnerships with symbionts could also induce costs for the hosts. This study focused on such associations to unearth induced costs and coevolution. Our data indicated that two strains of Regiella insecticola had negative effects on aphid fecundity, developmental time of the 3(rd) instar nymphs, and the age at first reproduction. Subsequently, the role of the R. insecticola was examined in the aphid's resistance to a parasitoid, Aphidius gifuensis (Ashmaed), a major agent used in biological control of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae. Results revealed that a significant reduction in emergence rate of the wasp, but not the percentage of parasitism. These results provided more evidences on a hypothesis that aphid individuals hosting facultative symbionts have a fecundity cost associated with parasitoid resistances. Additional tests were conducted to determine fitness costs of harboring the symbiont on the remaining unparasitized aphid individuals, showing no difference in aphid fecundity and survival between aphids with and without the symbiont. However, when compared to the absence of the wasp, the reproduction rate of aphids showed a strong increase under the stress of the parasitism in three aphid lines, particularly in the aphids harboring R. insecticola. This may suggest a potential evolutionary direction. Overall, the study enhanced our knowledge of the role of symbionts in host and parasite coevolution and insect pest control.

AB  - 1. Water fleas (Daphnia magna) bred at 23 degreesC were non-responsive to temperatures between 13 and 25 degreesC.
   2. At the lower (11 degreesC) and upper limits (30 degreesC) their klinokinetic avoidance behaviour showed a larger intraindividual than interindividual variation.
   3. Thermal sensitivity for avoidance responses in D. magna was about 1.5 degreesC.
   4. For D. magna bred for one parthenogenetic generation at 14 degreesC heat avoidance temperature was about 8 degreesC lower, and cold avoidance temperature was about 1 degreesC higher than in D. magna from 23 degreesC.
   5. In group experiments the animals showed some preference for the acclimation temperature.
   6. Cold induced stenothermy and warm induced eurythermy in D. magna were related to the mode of reproduction. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The maintenance of genetic variation for infection-related traits is often attributed to coevolution between hosts and parasites, but it can also be maintained by environmental variation if the relative fitness of different genotypes changes with environmental variation. To gain insight into how infection-related traits are sensitive to environmental variation, we exposed a single host genotype of the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna to four parasite isolates (which we assume to represent different genotypes) of its naturally co-occurring parasite Pasteuria ramosa at 15, 20 and 25 degrees C. We found that the cost to the host of becoming infected varied with temperature, but the magnitude of this cost did not depend on the parasite isolate. Temperature influenced parasite fitness traits; we found parasite genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions for parasite transmission stage production, suggesting the potential for temperature variation to maintain genetic variation in this trait. Finally, we tested for temperature-dependent relationships between host and parasite fitness traits that form a key component of models of virulence evolution, and we found them to be stable across temperatures.

AB  - Theoretical models predict that selection on reaction norms should depend on the relative frequency of environmental states experienced by a population. We report a laboratory experimental test of this prediction for thermal performance curves of larval growth rate in Pieris rapae in relation to their thermal environment. We measured short-term relative growth rate (RGR) for each individual at a series of five temperatures, and then we assigned individuals randomly to warm or cool selection treatments, which differ in the frequency distributions of environmental temperatures. Selection gradient analyses of two independent experiments demonstrated significant positive selection for increasing RGR, primarily through its effects on survival to adulthood and on development rate. In both the warm and cool selection treatments, the magnitude of directional selection on RGR was consistently greater at lower ( suboptimal) temperatures than at higher temperatures; differences in selection between the treatments did not match model predictions. The temporal order and duration of environmental conditions may affect patterns of selection on thermal performance curves and other continuous reaction norms, complicating the connections between variation in environment, phenotype, and fitness.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of reported cases of herbicide-resistant weed species (over 100), as well as an increase in the types of herbicides to which resistance has evolved. This paper reviews evidence for differential fitness of herbicide-resistant and susceptible biotypes. Fitness estimates are required to produce reliable population models. Fitness measures describe the potential evolutionary success of a genotype based on survival, competitive ability and ultimately reproductive success. Differences in relative fitness between resistant and susceptible biotypes are usually inferred from measures of relative plant productivity or competitiveness. For triazine-resistant weed species, studies have indicated that resistant plants were generally less fit than susceptible plants, although exceptions did exist. Although less data are available on the fitness of plants resistant to non-triazine herbicides, information is summarized for sulfonylureas, substituted ureas, dinitroanilines, paraquat, diclofop, and organic arsenicals. No consistent differences in relative fitness were observed for non-triazine resistant and susceptible biotypes. In general, studies have indicated that the relative fitness of susceptible and resistant biotypes of a single species depends upon biological conditions, including genotype and population variation, intra- and inter-biotype competition, and environmental conditions such as temperature, light quality, and management practices. Future needs for relative fitness studies are discussed.

AB  - Nickel (Ni)-based materials have been shown as good catalysts for hydrogen production by steam reforming of methane, but the hydrogen productivity has been restricted due to agglomeration among particles on Ni loaded catalysts. A new strategy is demonstrated by which to produce ultimate nickel nanocatalysts with high particle dispersion and high metal loading by using automated and systematic synthesis tools based on a simple melt-infiltration process and thermal treatment. The systematic sequence can yield highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles (4.5 nm) with high metal loading (25 wt%) on porous alumina (u-Ni/Al2O3) as an ultimate catalyst.

AB  - The capacity of individuals to cope with stress, for example, from pathogen exposure, might decrease with increasing levels of sexual selection, although it remains unclear which sex should be more sensitive. Here, we measured the ability of each sex to maintain high reproductive success following challenges with either heat-killed bacteria or procedural control, across replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster evolved under either high or low levels of sexual selection. Our experiment was run across four separate sampling blocks. We found an interaction between bacterial treatment, sexual selection treatment, and sampling block on female reproductive success. Specifically, and only in the fourth block, we observed that bacterial-challenged females that had evolved under high sexual selection, exhibited lower reproductive success than bacterial-challenged females that had evolved under low sexual selection. Furthermore, we could trace this block-specific effect to a reduction in viscosity of the ovipositioning substrate in the fourth block, in which females laid around 50% more eggs than in previous blocks. In contrast, patterns of male reproductive success were consistent across blocks. Males that evolved under high sexual selection exhibited higher reproductive success than their low-selection counterparts, regardless of whether they were subjected to a bacterial challenge or not. Our results are consistent with the prediction that heightened sexual selection will invoke male-specific evolutionary increases in reproductive fitness. Furthermore, our findings suggest that females might pay fitness costs when exposed to high levels of sexual selection, but that these costs may lie cryptic, and only be revealed under certain environmental contexts.

AB  - Models of thermal adaptation assume that warm-adapted and cold-adapted organisms can achieve the same fitness, yet recent comparative studies suggest that warm-adapted organisms outperform cold-adapted ones. We explored how this thermodynamic effect on performance might influence selective pressures on thermal physiology. In the absence of a thermodynamic effect, natural selection favors a thermal optimum for performance that closely matches the mean (or modal) body temperature. When warm-adapted organisms outperform cold-adapted organisms, natural selection can favor a thermal optimum that exceeds the mean body temperature. The optimal mismatch between the thermal optimum and the mean temperature increases as does the variation in body temperature within generations. This result holds regardless of whether performance affects fitness through fecundity or survivorship. The selective pressures generated by a thermodynamic effect might explain the substantial mismatch between thermoregulatory behavior and thermal physiology that has been observed in some species.

AB  - Environmental stressors are persistent but most toxicological studies always evaluate the risk via short-term acute toxicity, while continuous toxicity and biological resistance across generations are relatively unknown. Here, earthworm Eisenia fetida was laboratory-reared and exposed to historically contaminated soils with an increasing metal gradient (CK, LM and HM), to investigate cross-generation toxicity and resistance of F1 and F2 worms. The results elucidated that biomass and juvenile hatching rate of F2 E. fetida showed maximum decreases of 20.8% and 38.5% than those of F1, which indicated severer toxicity of earthworm offspring. However, metal bioaccumulation in F2 E. fetida showed maximum increases of 150%, 49.2%, 19.7% and 25.5% than F1 for Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb, respectively. F2 E. fetida suffered less oxidative stress because the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were basically lower than that of F1. Meanwhile, the detoxification genes of metallothionein and heat shock protein 70 in F2 E. fetida showed maximum of 296% and 78.9% up-regulations, respectively, which suggested greater metal resistance of F2 E. fetida. This study confirmed the cross-generation toxicity and resistance of earthworms, which provides novel insights to reveal specific contaminant risks from longer lifecycles. Capsule: Earthworms under cross-generation exposure can develop metal resistance despite suffering worse toxicity effects.

AB  - The colonisation of new suitable habitats is crucial for species survival at evolutionary scale under changing environmental conditions. However, colonisation potential may be limited by philopatry that facilitates exploiting successful habitats across generations. We examine the mechanisms of long distance dispersal of the philopatric loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) by analysing 40 sporadic nesting events in the western Mediterranean. The analysis of a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA and 7 microsatellites of 121 samples from 18 of these nesting events revealed that these nests were colonising events associated with juveniles from distant populations feeding in nearby foraging grounds. Considering the temperature-dependent sex determination of the species, we simulated the effect of the incubation temperature and propagule pressure on a potential colonisation scenario. Our results indicated that colonisation will succeed if warm temperature conditions, already existing in some of the beaches in the area, extend to the whole western Mediterranean. We hypothesize that the sporadic nesting events in developmental foraging grounds may be a mechanism to overcome philopatry limitations thus increasing the dispersal capabilities of the species and the adaptability to changing environments.
