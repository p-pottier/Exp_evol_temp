AB  - When copepod Acartia tonsa is isolated from tropical populations, the produced eggs exhibit low hatching after long-term storage, a critical aspect that makes their use difficult in aquaculture. In three experiments, this study spawned adults of A. tonsa cultured at different salinities and temperatures. The eggs were collected to determine hatching success of fresh and cold-stored eggs (HS-C). Experiment 1: Adults spawned under four combinations of two temperatures (18 and 28 degrees C) and two salinities (18 and 30 PSU) to determine the HS-C from 0 (fresh eggs) to 4 weeks of storage. Experiment 2: Adults spawned under three combinations of temperatures (18, 23, and 29 degrees C) and 30 PSU to determine the HS-C (from 0 to 4 weeks of storage). Experiment 3: Adults spawned under 18 degrees C and 30 PSU to determine the HS-C (from 0 to 8 weeks of storage). All adults were distributed in triplicate in 2 L containers at 0.5 individual mL(-1) and fed with the Rhodomonas sauna microalgae at 2000 mu g C L-1. In every experimental unit, the eggs were collected and stored at 3 +/- 1 degrees C. In fresh eggs (0 weeks of storage), most of the treatments showed great hatching ( > 90%). However, low salinity and high temperature resulted in a significantly (p < .05) lower hatch (81%) of the fresh eggs. The combination of 18 degrees C and 30 PSU produced better hatching (p < .05) in eggs stored for 2 and 4 weeks (85% and 73%, respectively), followed by 18 degrees C and 18 PSU (65% and 41%), 28 degrees C and 30 PSU (50% and 17%) and 28 degrees C and 18 PSU (11% and 2%). Stored quiescent eggs were strongly affected by the temperature and salinity of the culture environment. On the other hand, fresh (subitaneous) eggs do not depend so much of these variables. Therefore, the criteria to select what salinity and temperature combination is best to raise adults for egg production will depend on whether the eggs will be used for immediate-use (fresh) or storage.

AB  - Plant-herbivore interactions have evolved in response to coevolutionary dynamics, along with selection driven by abiotic conditions. We examine how abiotic factors influence trait expression in both plants and herbivores to evaluate how climate change will alter this long-standing interaction. The paleontological record documents increased herbivory during periods of global warming in the deep past. In phylogenetically corrected meta-analyses, we find that elevated temperatures, CO2 concentrations, drought stress and nutrient conditions directly and indirectly induce greater food consumption by herbivores. Additionally, elevated CO2 delays herbivore development, but increased temperatures accelerate development. For annual plants, higher temperatures, CO2 and drought stress increase foliar herbivory. Our meta-analysis also suggests that greater temperatures and drought may heighten florivory in perennials. Human actions are causing concurrent shifts in CO2, temperature, precipitation regimes and nitrogen deposition, yet few studies evaluate interactions among these changing conditions. We call for additional multifactorial studies that simultaneously manipulate multiple climatic factors, which will enable us to generate more robust predictions of how climate change could disrupt plant-herbivore interactions. Finally, we consider how shifts in insect and plant phenology and distribution patterns could lead to ecological mismatches, and how these changes may drive future adaptation and coevolution between interacting species.

AB  - Selection can create complex patterns of adaptive differentiation among populations in the wild that may be relevant to management. Atlantic cod in the Northwest Atlantic are at a fraction of their historical abundance and a lack of recovery within the Gulf of Maine has created concern regarding the misalignment of fisheries management structures with biological population structure. To address this and investigate genome-wide patterns of variation, we used low-coverage sequencing to perform a region-wide, whole-genome analysis of fine-scale population structure. We sequenced 306 individuals from 20 sampling locations in U.S. and Canadian waters, including the major spawning aggregations in the Gulf of Maine in addition to spawning aggregations from Georges Bank, southern New England, the eastern Scotian Shelf, and St. Pierre Bank. With genotype likelihoods estimated at almost 11 million loci, we found large differences in haplotype frequencies of previously described chromosomal inversions between Canadian and U.S. sampling locations and also among U.S. sampling locations. Our whole-genome resolution also revealed novel outlier peaks, some of which showed significant genetic differentiation among sampling locations. Comparisons between allochronic winter- and spring-spawning populations revealed highly elevated relative (F-ST) and absolute (d(xy)) genetic differentiation near genes involved in reproduction, particularly genes associated with the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis, which likely control timing of spawning, contributing to prezygotic isolation. We also found genetic differentiation associated with heat shock proteins and other genes of functional relevance, with complex patterns that may point to multifaceted selection pressures and local adaptation among spawning populations. We provide a high-resolution picture of U.S. Atlantic cod population structure, revealing greater complexity than is currently recognized in management. Our genome-scan approach likely underestimates the full suite of adaptive differentiation among sampling locations. Nevertheless, it should inform the revision of stock boundaries to preserve adaptive genetic diversity and evolutionary potential of cod populations.

AB  - Recent research has shown that many cold-adapted species survived the last glacial maximum (LGM) in northern refugia. Whether this evolutionary history has had consequences for their genetic diversity and adaptive potential remains unknown. We sampled 14 populations of Carex limosa, a sedge specialized to bog ecosystems, along a latitudinal gradient from its Scandinavian core to the southern lowland range-margin in Germany. Using microsatellite and experimental common-garden data, we evaluated the impacts of global climate change along this gradient and assessed the conservation status of the southern marginal populations. Microsatellite data revealed two highly distinct genetic groups and hybrid individuals. In our common-garden experiment, the two groups showed divergent responses to increased nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P) availability, suggesting ecotypic differentiation. Each group formed genetically uniform populations at both northern and southern sampling areas. Mixed populations occurred throughout our sampling area, an area that was entirely glaciated during the LGM. The fragmented distribution implies allopatric divergence at geographically separated refugia that putatively differed in N/P availability. Molecular data and an observed low hybrid fecundity indicate the importance of clonal reproduction for hybrid populations. At the southern range-margin, however, all populations showed effects of clonality, lowered fecundity and low competitiveness, suggesting abiotic and biotic constraints to population persistence.

AB  - Bering Sea sea ice during winter 2017-2018 was the lowest ever recorded. Ecosystem effects of low ice have been observed in the southeastern Bering Sea, but never in the northern Bering Sea. Observations in both systems included weakened water column stratification, delayed spring bloom, and low abundances of large crustacean zooplankton. Summer Cold Pool presence was extremely limited. Young walleye pollock production and condition were similar to prior warm years, though catches of other pelagic forage fishes were low. Summer seabird die-offs were observed in the northern Bering Sea, and to lesser extent in the southeastern Bering Sea, and reproductive success was poor at monitored colonies. Selected bottom-up responses to lack of sea ice in the north were similar to those in the south, potentially providing environmental indicators to project ecosystem effects in a lesser studied system. Results offer a potential glimpse of the broader Bering Sea pelagic ecosystem under future low-ice projections.
   Plain Language Summary During the winter of 2017-2018, there was a lack of winter sea ice in the northern and southeastern Bering Sea. This was unprecedented, and its implications were unknown, especially for the northern Bering Sea. Ecosystem surveys showed that oceanic plants and animals at the base of the food web were delayed in their spring production and food quality was generally low. Abundances of young walleye pollock, a commercial species important to the global fish market, were average in 2018, but catches of other forage fishes were lower. Seabird die-offs in the northern Bering Sea were extensive. If heat-related ecosystem changes previously observed in the southeastern Bering Sea ecosystem are now happening in the northern Bering Sea, disruptions to food webs and increased die-offs could occur if oceans continue to warm in the future.

AB  - In light of recent declines in scleractinian communities worldwide, research on the genetic structure of and connectivity among coral populations has assumed importance. However, the genetic structure of corals in the South China Sea (SCS) has remained largely neglected by studies. The genetic structure of the broadcast spawning coral Porites lutea was examined using 482 specimens from 20 sites in the SCS spanning 13 degrees of latitude. Analyses of two nuclear markers congruently revealed that genetic diversity was high in most populations, with relatively lower diversity in Daya Bay (DY). However, we identified a recent bottleneck in P. lutea populations, which may be in accordance with recent coral community declines. Pairwise F-ST values and principal coordinates analyses indicated large-scale (similar to 1500km) genetic homogeneity among SCS P. lutea populations, possibly attributed to their reproductive strategy (spawning vs. brooding) and historical changes in population sizes. However, populations in DY were highly differentiated from the others, which may reflect the genetic-level adaptation of corals there to lower winter temperatures. Coalescent migration analyses of ITS rDNA markers revealed high levels of gene flow (Nm>100) among all adjacent populations except between DY and Taiwan. Additionally, universally asymmetrical northward gene flow was identified, possibly reflecting the northward migration of the species in response to global warming. We concluded that populations of P. lutea in the SCS comprise one large panmictic meta-population. However, the lower-diversity, more differentiated northern marginal populations in DY are probably more vulnerable than others to the adverse effects of anthropogenic activities.

AB  - Background: Coexistence and transition of diverse sex determination strategies have been revealed in some ectothermic species, but the variation between males caused by different sex determination strategies and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. Here, we used the gynogenetic gibel carp (Carassius gibelio) with both genotypic sex determination (GSD) and temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) strategies to illustrate this issue.
   Results: We found out that males of GSD and TSD in gibel carp had similar morphology, testicular histology, sperm structure and sperm vitality. However, when maternal individuals were mated with males of GSD, sperm nucleus swelling and fusing with the female pronucleus were observed in the fertilized eggs. On the contrary, when maternal individuals were mated with males of TSD, sperm nucleus remained in the condensed status throughout the whole process. Subsequently, semen proteomics analysis unveiled that DNA replication and gene expression-related pathways were inhibited in the sperm from males of TSD compared to males of GSD, and most differentially expressed proteins associated with DNA replication, transcription and translation were down-regulated. Moreover, via BrdU incorporation and immunofluorescence detection, male nucleus replication was revealed to be present in the fertilized eggs by the sperm from males of GSD, but absent in the fertilized eggs by the sperm from males of TSD.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that DNA replication and gene expression-related pathways are associated with the distinct sperm nucleus development behaviors in fertilized eggs in response to the sperm from males of GSD and TSD. And this study is the first attempt to screen the differences between males determined via GSD and TSD in gynogenetic species, which might give a hint for understanding evolutionary adaption of diverse sex determination mechanisms in unisexual vertebrates.

AB  - Canola is an extremely important commodity to the western Canadian economy. Annual or geographic fluctuations in yield due to heat stress can have a significant influence on total production. To increase the stability of canola yield, breeders need to select for increased heat tolerance in a reliable, repeatable, cost effective manner that represents commercial production conditions. Field experiments with 10 (5 maintainer and 5 restorer) inbreds and the 25 corresponding hybrids were conducted across 2 years with 2 locations per year. Each experiment had two planting dates (normal planting date and a late planting date). The experiments were designed to determine If: 1) planting date can be used as a proxy for heat stress; 2) heterosis can minimize the impact of heat stress; and 3) direct selection within a heat-stress environment improves genetic gain for heat stress tolerance. Principal component analysis of the Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, soil moisture, daily light integral and yield were conducted. The resulting biplot analyses demonstrate that the temperature variables had a greater impact on yield than soil moisture or daily light integral and therefore planting date was identified as a successful proxy for heat stress. The heat-stress treatment caused a 23% mean reduction in seed yield (20% reduction within the hybrids and 25% reduction within the inbreds) indicating that heterosis can reduce the impact of higher temperatures on canola yield. The mean heat susceptibility index was 0.94 and 1.20 for the hybrids and inbreds respectively; further demonstrating that the hybrids were more heat tolerant than the inbreds. Analyses of the GCA for the inbreds shows 4 cross-over interactions between the two temperature treatments indicating that direct selection for heat tolerance will be necessary to increase the response to selection for this trait. Overall canola breeders interested in increasing heat tolerance need to consider utilizing planting date as a high-temperature treatment and cannot rely on indirect selection from experiments under optimal conditions.

AB  - Intraspecific biodiversity among populations is ecologically and evolutionarily notable. Substantial adaptations in well-studied commercial species should be obvious and ought to have been uncovered. The tenet of marine stability posits relatively little local adaptation in the sea, except for temperature responses to latitude for widespread species. However, aquatic reproduction is tightly constrained by water chemistry, which may lead to abstruse adaptations. Capelin (Mallotus villosus) reproduction has been studied for over a century, occurring within pebble substrate on beaches or the seafloor of continental shelves. Offshore spawners (Iceland/Barents Sea) have embryos with tolerance of high salinity. I provide new and historical data on beach spawners from several areas indicating that their embryos perform well from similar to 2 to 28 psu, but at higher salinities indicative of coastal seawater, there is poor hatch success, larvae take longer to hatch, hatch at a smaller size, and starve more quickly. The body of evidence supports the hypothesis that beach spawning evolved from anadromy, with offshore spawning a derived state, enabled by increased salinity tolerance. The results have recovery implications for depleted Newfoundland stocks, which have been spawning seasonally late under relatively high salinity for over 25 years.

AB  - Five provenance tests with twenty-six European silver fir autochthonous populations were used in order to assess the response of populations to climate change. Height growth and diameter at breast height of trees at age 31 years were considered as response variables and eight climate variables as predictors. Climatic variables for the trial sites and for origin location of provenances were calculated from 1961 to 2010. The experiments revealed a large genetic variability within species level and a plastic response to climate change, which certainly has a genetic basis. The transfer to warmer climate has resulted in an increase of the provenances growth, in the trial sites situated on the lower vegetation layer. But growth is significantly influenced by mean annual temperature and annual precipitation of planting site and also by the differences in mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, monthly mean temperature in July and July precipitation between provenance site and test site. These are the climatic factors which should be associated with risk in case of the transfer of forest reproductive materials. The provenance origin should be especially considered if the species will be planted outside of its current climate optimum. The best provenances in terms of total height and diameter at 1.30 m came from origin climate close to site climate, small transfer distances. Based on growth response functions and RCP4.5 scenario, we could project the shifts in species distribution for 2050s and 2100s and identify vulnerable populations.

AB  - A projected future warmer climate implies significant impacts on canola (Brassica napus L.) production in Canada. We aimed to use a modeling approach to simulate climate change impacts on canola yield in Canada and to evaluate potential adaptation measures. The CSM-CROPGRO-Canola model was used to simulate the responses of canola to the projected climate change at Brandon on the Prairies, and West Nipissing and Normandin in eastern Canada. Future climate scenarios for the near (2041-2070) and distant (2071-2100) future under two representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were developed based on climate change simulations by a regional climate model CanRCM4. Seeding dates were estimated from air temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture to account for the potential of earlier seeding as an adaptation measure. Compared to the baseline climate, simulated seed yield reduction was 42, 21, and 24% in the near future and of 37, 27, and 23% in the distant future, under RCP4.5, respectively for Brandon, West Nipissing, and Normandin. A larger reduction was simulated under RCP8.5, especially in the distant future at Brandon and West Nipissing. The simulated seed yield reduction was associated with increases in heat and water stresses under rainfed conditions with current N fertilizer application rates. Coping with heat and water stresses is a big challenge for canola production in Canada under the projected climate change, especially on the Canadian Prairies.

AB  - Interactions between the land biosphere and the atmosphere play an important role for the Earth's carbon cycle and thus should be considered in studies of global carbon cycling and climate. Simple approaches are a useful first step in this direction but may not be applicable for certain climatic conditions. To improve the ability of the reduced-complexity Danish Center for Earth System Science (DCESS) Earth system model DCESS to address cold climate conditions, we reformulated the model's land biosphere module by extending it to include three dynamically varying vegetation zones as well as a permafrost component. The vegetation zones are formulated by emulating the behaviour of a complex land biosphere model. We show that with the new module, the size and timing of carbon exchanges between atmosphere and land are represented more realistically in cooling and warming experiments. In particular, we use the new module to address carbon cycling and climate change across the last glacial transition. Within the constraints provided by various proxy data records, we tune the DCESS model to a Last Glacial Maximum state and then conduct transient sensitivity experiments across the transition under the application of explicit transition functions for high-latitude ocean exchange, atmospheric dust, and the land ice sheet extent. We compare simulated time evolutions of global mean temperature, pCO(2), atmospheric and oceanic carbon isotopes as well as ocean dissolved oxygen concentrations with proxy data records. In this way we estimate the importance of different processes across the transition with emphasis on the role of land biosphere variations and show that carbon outgassing from permafrost and uptake of carbon by the land biosphere broadly compensate for each other during the temperature rise of the early last deglaciation.

AB  - Global climate change is expected to have major impacts on biodiversity. Sea turtles have temperature-dependent sex determination, and many populations produce highly female-biased offspring sex ratios, a skew likely to increase further with global warming. We estimated the primary sex ratio at one of the world's largest green turtle Chelonia mydas rookeries in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, and explored its resilience to climate change. In 2013 and 2014, we deployed data loggers recording nest (n = 101) and sand (n = 30) temperatures, and identified hatchling sex by histological examination of gonads. A logistic curve was fitted to the data to allow predictions of sex ratio across habitats and through the nesting season. The population-specific pivotal temperature was 29.4 degrees C, with both sexes produced within incubation temperatures from 27.6 to 31.4 degrees C: the transitional range of temperatures (TRT). Primary sex ratio changed from male-to female-biased across relatively small temporal and spatial scales. Overall it was marginally female-biased, but we estimated an exceptionally high male hatchling production of 47.7% (95% CI: 36.7-58.3%) and 44.5% (95% CI: 33.8-55.4%) in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Both the temporal and spatial variation in incubation conditions and the wide range of the TRT suggest resilience and potential for adaptation to climate change if the present nesting habitat remains unchanged. These findings underline the importance of assessing site-specific parameters to understand populations' responses to climate change, particularly with regard to identifying rookeries with high male hatchling production that may be key for the future conservation of sea turtles under projected global warming scenarios.

AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a very important staple crop, as it feeds more than half of the world's population. Numerous studies have focused on the negative impacts of climate change on rice production. However, there is little debate on which region of the world is more vulnerable to climate change and how adaptation to this change can mitigate the negative impacts on rice production. We investigated the impacts of climate change on rice yield, based on simulations combining a global crop model, M-GAZE, and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model projections. Our focus was the impact of mitigating emission forcings (representative concentration pathway RCP 4.5 vs. RCP 8.5) and autonomous adaptation (i.e., changing crop variety and planting date) on rice yield. In general, our results showed that climate change due to anthropogenic warming leads to a significant reduction in rice yield. However, autonomous adaptation provides the potential to reduce the negative impact of global warming on rice yields in a spatially distinct manner. The adaptation was less beneficial for countries located at a low latitude (e.g., Cambodia, Thailand, Brazil) compared to mid-latitude countries (e.g., USA, China, Pakistan), as regional climates at the lower latitudes are already near the upper temperature thresholds for acceptable rice growth. These findings suggest that the socioeconomic effects from rice production in low-latitude countries can be highly vulnerable to anthropogenic global warming. Therefore, these countries need to be accountable to develop transformative adaptation strategies, such as adopting (or developing) heat-tolerant varieties, and/or improve irrigation systems and fertilizer use efficiency.

AB  - Rice is the staple food for more than 50% of the world's population1-3. Reliable prediction of changes in rice yield is thus central for maintaining global food security. This is an extraordinary challenge. Here, we compare the sensitivity of rice yield to temperature increase derived from field warming experiments and three modelling approaches: statistical models, local crop models and global gridded crop models. Field warming experiments produce a substantial rice yield loss under warming, with an average temperature sensitivity of -5.2 +/- 1.4% K-1. Local crop models give a similar sensitivity (-6.3 +/- 0.4% K-1), but statistical and global gridded crop models both suggest less negative impacts of warming on yields (-0.8 +/- 0.3% and -2.4 +/- 3.7% K-1, respectively). Using data from field warming experiments, we further propose a conditional probability approach to constrain the large range of global gridded crop model results for the future yield changes in response to warming by the end of the century (from -1.3% to -9.3% K-1). The constraint implies a more negative response to warming (-8.3 +/- 1.4% K-1) and reduces the spread of the model ensemble by 33%. This yield reduction exceeds that estimated by the International Food Policy Research Institute assessment (-4.2 to -6.4% K-1) (ref. 4). Our study suggests that without CO2 fertilization, effective adaptation and genetic improvement, severe rice yield losses are plausible under intensive climate warming scenarios.

AB  - The increase in seawater temperature due to anthropogenic climate change is likely to affect population persistence and changes in distributional ranges of marine species. Adaptation to warmer environmental conditions will be determined by the presence of tolerant genotypes within a population. The present study determined the genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions during early development of the New Zealand sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus cultured at 18 degrees C (mean annual temperature), 21 degrees C (ambient summer temperature) and 24 degrees C (+ 3 degrees C above ambient summer temperature). The experiment was performed in 3 experimental blocks using gametes from 3 males and 3 females crossed in all combinations (North Carolina II cross-breeding design), resulting in 9 families per experimental block (i.e., total of 27 families). Differences between female and male identities were quantified during cleavage and gastrulation: Reaction norms (i.e., interaction plots) showed a clear G x E interaction, with some genotypes performing better than others at high temperatures. Heritability during gastrulation was 0.51, indicating that 51 % of the variability corresponds to genetic variation. Overall, the present study shows that seawater temperature has a negative effect on early development of E. chloroticus; however, there are resilient genotypes in the studied population that could provide the genetic potential to adapt to future ocean conditions.

AB  - This study was designed to determine the manner in which metabolism is suppressed during dormancy in black and white tegu lizards (Tupinambis merianae). To this end, heart rate (f (H)), respiration rate (f (R)), and deep body temperature (T (b)) were continuously monitored in outdoor enclosures by radio-telemetry for nine months. There was a continuous decline in nighttime breathing and heart rate, at constant T (b), throughout the late summer and fall suggestive of an active metabolic suppression that developed progressively at night preceding the entrance into dormancy. During the day, however, the tegus still emerged to bask. In May, when the tegus made a behavioural commitment to dormancy, T (b) (day and night) fell to match burrow temperature, accompanied by a further reduction in f (H) and f (R). Tegus, under the conditions of this study, did arouse periodically during dormancy. There was a complex interplay between changes in f (H) and T (b) associated with the direct effects of temperature and the indirect effects of thermoregulation, activity, and changes in metabolism. This interplay gave rise to a daily hysteresis in the f (H)/T (b) relationship reflective of the physiological changes associated with warming and cooling as preferred T (b) alternated between daytime and nighttime levels. The shape of the hysteresis curve varied with season along with changes in metabolic state and daytime and nighttime body temperature preferences.

AB  - Species may respond to climate change in many ecological and evolutionary ways. In this simulation study, we focus on the concurrent evolution of three traits in response to climate change, namely dispersal probability, temperature tolerance (or niche width), and temperature preference (optimal habitat). More specifically, we consider evolutionary responses in host species involved in different types of interaction, that is parasitism or commensalism, and for low or high costs of a temperature tolerance-fertility trade-off (cost of generalization). We find that host species potentially evolve all three traits simultaneously in response to increasing temperature but that the evolutionary response interacts and may be compensatory depending on the conditions. The evolutionary adjustment of temperature preference is slower in the parasitism than in commensalism scenario. Parasitism, in turn, selects for higher temperature tolerance and increased dispersal. High costs for temperature tolerance (i.e. generalization) restrict evolution of tolerance and thus lead to a faster response in temperature preference than that observed under low costs. These results emphasize the possible role of biotic interactions and the importance of multidimensional' evolutionary responses to climate change.

AB  - Coral reefs are globally threatened by climate change-related ocean warming and ocean acidification (OA). To date, slow-response mechanisms such as genetic adaptation have been considered the major determinant of coral reef persistence, with little consideration of rapid-response acclimatization-mechanisms. These rapid mechanisms such as parental effects that can contribute to trans-generational acclimatization (e.g. epigenetics) have, however, been identified as important contributors to offspring response in other systems. We present the first evidence of parental effects in a cross-generational exposure to temperature and OA in reef-building corals. Here, we exposed adults to high (28.9 degrees C, 805 mu atm P-CO2) or ambient (26.5 degrees C, 417 mu atm P-CO2) temperature and OA treatments during the larval brooding period. Exposure to high treatment negatively affected adult performance, but their larvae exhibited size differences and metabolic acclimation when subsequently re-exposed, unlike larvae from parents exposed to ambient conditions. Understanding the innate capacity corals possess to respond to current and future climatic conditions is essential to reef protection and maintenance. Our results identify that parental effects may have an important role through (1) ameliorating the effects of stress through preconditioning and adaptive plasticity, and/or (2) amplifying the negative parental response through latent effects on future life stages. Whether the consequences of parental effects and the potential for trans-generational acclimatization are beneficial or maladaptive, our work identifies a critical need to expand currently proposed climate change outcomes for corals to further assess rapid response mechanisms that include non-genetic inheritance through parental contributions and classical epigenetic mechanisms.

AB  - Rapid and divergent evolution of male genital morphology is a conspicuous and general pattern across internally fertilizing animals. Rapid genital evolution is thought to be the result of sexual selection, and the role of natural selection in genital evolution remains controversial. However, natural and sexual selection are believed to act antagonistically on male genital form. We conducted an experimental evolution study to investigate the combined effects of natural and sexual selection on the genital-arch lobes of male Drosophila simulans. Replicate populations were forced to evolve under lifetime monogamy (relaxed sexual selection) or lifetime polyandry (elevated sexual selection) and two temperature regimes, 25 degrees C (relaxed natural selection) or 27 degrees C (elevated natural selection) in a fully factorial design. We found that natural and sexual selection plus their interaction caused genital evolution. Natural selection caused some aspects of genital form to evolve away from their sexually selected shape, whereas natural and sexual selection operated in the same direction for other shape components. Additionally, sexual and natural selection tended to favour larger genitals. Thus we find that the underlying selection driving genital evolution is complex, does not only involve sexual selection, and that natural selection and sexual selection do not always act antagonistically.

AB  - Food processing is costly, potentially limiting the energy and time devoted to other essential functions such as locomotion or reproduction. In ectotherms, post-prandial thermophily, the selection of a warm environmental temperature after feeding, may be advantageous in minimizing the duration of this elevated cost. Although present in many vertebrate taxa, this behaviour had not previously been observed in invertebrates. Sanguivorous leeches ingest large blood meals that are costly to process and limit mobility until excess fluid can actively be expelled to reduce body volume. When presented with a temperature gradient from 10 degrees C to 30 degrees C, leeches select a temperature that is significantly warmer (24.3 +/- 0.9 degrees C, n = 6) than their acclimation temperature (T-a, 21 degrees C). Unfed leeches preferred temperatures that were significantly cooler than ambient (12.8 +/- 0.9 degrees C, n = 6). This behavioural strategy is consistent with minimizing the time course of elevated post-feeding energy costs and reducing energy expenditure during fasting. Our observations raise the possibility that thermoregulatory behaviour of this type is an unrecognized feature of other invertebrate taxa.

AB  - Mating speed and copulation duration respond rapidly to laboratory selection in Drosophila melanogaster Meigen (Diptera: Drosophilidae), but there is a lack of data on the evolutionary response to natural selection in the wild. Further, it is not clear whether body melanization and mating behavior are correlated traits. Accordingly, we tested whether variation in body color impacts on mating latency, copulation duration, and fecundity in latitudinal populations of D. melanogaster. We observed geographical variation (cline) for mating propensity, i.e., mating speed as well as copulation duration increased along latitude. Phenotypic plastic responses for body melanization at 17 and 25 degrees C also showed significant correlations with mating latency and copulation duration. Within-population analysis based on assorted dark and light flies of five geographical populations showed significant positive correlations of copulation duration and fecundity with body melanization. To assess the role of males and/or females on mating speed and copulation duration, we used atypical body color strains (i.e., dark and light males of D. melanogaster) for no-choice mating tests. Our data showed a major influence of males for copulation duration and of females for mating speed. Furthermore, a difference in impact of body melanization on mating speed and copulation duration was demonstrated between species, i.e., low melanization in Drosophila ananassae Doleschall is correlated with lower mating speed and shorter copulation duration than in D. melanogaster. Geographical changes in mating propensity were significantly correlated with body melanization at three levels, i.e., within and between populations and between species. Thus, we have shown that a relationship exists between body melanization and mating success. Further, we found seasonal changes in temperature and humidity to confer selection pressures on mating-related traits.

AB  - Although information about embryonic and larval development of garpike, Belone belone (Linnaeus, 1761), is present in the published literature, the bulk of research concerns garpike from the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea. The present work describes the embryonic and larval development of garpike, Belone belone, from the Adriatic Sea, and methods used for incubation of fertilized eggs in aquarium conditions. Because garpike is, as suggested by some authors, divided into subspecies, we conclude that some differences in embryonic development could also be expected. In the present study, eggs were fertilized using the dry fertilization method and were incubated in a tank equipped with aeration and constant sea water flow. Salinity and content of dissolved oxygen were constant, and the temperature varied between 19.4 and 22.3 degrees C. Eggs were spherical, measuring 3071.9 +/- 75.73 mu m in diameter. Yolk sacs were homogeneous and did not contain oil globules. The first larvae hatched 329 h and 47 min after fertilization. Absorption of the yolk sac occurred 17 h-48 h after hatching and the total length of newly hatched larvae was 9.78 mm. The peculiarities observed in the embryonic and early larval development are evidence of an exceptional plasticity and adaptive potential, which could be considered as helpful features in extending the natural range of occurrence of this species.

AB  - Wolbachia are obligatory intracellular and maternally inherited bacteria that infect and spread through natural arthropod populations by inducing male-killing, feminization, parthenogenesis, and, most commonly, unidirectional and bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). Cytoplasmic incompatibility can be used to control natural populations of insect pests, in a way analogous to the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT), namely through the Incompatible Insect Technique (IIT). For the successful application of the IIT (based on a unidirectional CI approach) against a target species, it is essential that only males are released, as the release of females would lead to fertile matings between the released males and the released females and the establishment of a Wolbachia-carrying field population. In the present study, we describe a Wolbachia-infected line of the VIENNA 8 genetic sexing strain of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae), that carries the selectable marker temperature sensitive lethal (tsl). We show that (1) transferred Wolbachia induce high levels of CI even after the temperature treatment required for the male-only production, and (2) the Wolbachia-infected genetic sexing C. capitata line can be used in cage population suppression experiments analogous to the SIT. We also discuss our results in a comparison between IIT and SIT, investigating whether irradiation and cytoplasmic factors can be combined toward the development of novel strategies for insect pest control.

AB  - Effects of habitat and acclimation temperature on cholesterol contents were examined in oceanic and inshore species of copepods. The cholesterol content of five species of thermally acclimated copepods was determined, and nine species ( representing six families) were sampled to assess the role of habitat temperature. The species selected have maximum habitat temperatures ( and temperature tolerances) that vary at least twofold. Levels of dietary cholesterol required to achieve maximum growth were also studied at different acclimation temperatures in a eurythermal copepod. Both eggs and copepodites of Calanus finmarchicus had higher cholesterol levels at the warm acclimation temperature (16 degrees C) than at the cooler temperature (6 degrees C). Neither Acartia tonsa, Acartia hudsonica, Temora longicornis nor Eurytemora affinis altered cholesterol contents with acclimation temperature. Maximum growth rates were achieved at fourfold higher concentrations of dietary cholesterol in warm-acclimated Eurytemora affinis than in cold-acclimated animals. The most consistent trend is the positive relationship between cholesterol content and habitat temperature. Species residing in warmer habitats ( e. g. Centropages typicus, Eurytemora affinis) had approximately twice the cholesterol of species living in colder waters ( e. g. Calanus glacialis, Euchaeta norvegica). A similar pattern was observed for comparisons of species within genera ( Calanus, Acartia and Centropages), with the species abundant at lower latitudes having more cholesterol than the northern congener. These data indicate that habitat temperature is an important determinant of cholesterol content, and cholesterol endows membranes with the stability required for a range of body temperatures.

AB  - We tested competing hypotheses regarding the persistence of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in the African spurred tortoise (Geochelone sulcata (Miller, 1779)), by measuring the effects of incubation temperature (T-inc) on a suite of physiological and behavioral endpoints, including resting metabolic rate, yolk-to-tissue conversion efficiency, posthatching growth, and temperature preference. Correlations of these variables with T-inc could lend support to the hypothesis that TSD persists owing to sex-specific benefits of development at specific temperatures, whereas absence of T-inc effects support the null hypothesis that TSD persists simply because selection favoring alternate sex determining mechanisms is weak or absent. The metabolic rate Q(10) value exhibited temporal variation and was higher immediately after hatching compared with 40 or 100 days posthatching, and mass conversion efficiency varied among clutches. Incubation temperature correlated inversely with duration of embryonic development, but did not influence yolk conversion efficiency, growth, or resting metabolic rate. Thus, our results provide little evidence indicating contemporary benefits of TSD, suggesting that TSD in G. sulcata is no longer evolutionarily adaptive but persists because selection against it and in favor of other sex-determining mechanisms is weak, or that TSD is an adaptive trait but for reasons not elucidated by this study.

AB  - Under temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), temperatures experienced by embryos during development determine the sex of the offspring. Consequently, populations of organisms with TSD have the potential to be strongly impacted by climatic warming that could bias offspring sex ratio, a fundamental demographic parameter involved in population dynamics. Moreover, many taxa with TSD are imperiled, so research on this phenomenon, particularly long-term field study, has assumed great urgency. Recently, turtles with TSD have joined the diverse list of taxa that have demonstrated population-level changes in breeding phenology in response to recent climate change. This raises the possibility that any adverse impacts of climate change on populations may be alleviated by individual plasticity in nesting phenology. Here, we examine data from a long-term study on a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) to determine whether changes in phenology are due to individual plasticity and whether individual plasticity in the timing of nesting has the capacity to offset the sex ratio effects of a rise in climatic temperature. We find that individual females show plasticity in the date of first nesting each year, and that this plasticity depends on the climate from the previous winter. First nesting date is not repeatable within individuals, suggesting that it would not respond to selection. Sex ratios of hatchlings within a nest declined nonsignificantly over the nesting season. However, small increases in summer temperature had a much stronger effect on nest sex ratios than did laying nests earlier in the season. For this and other reasons, it seems unlikely that individual plasticity in the timing of nesting will offset the effects of climate change on sex ratios in this population, and we hypothesize that this conclusion applies to other populations with TSD.

AB  - The goal of this study was to test whether it is possible to produce early hatching cysts of Artemia franciscana from San Francisco Bay (SFB) by truncation selection. The starting material was an SFB cyst sample, harvested in nature. After selection of early hatching nauplii had taken place, these selected individuals were cultured to maturity, and the hatching rate of their offspring (F-1) was compared with that of the parental generation and with the non-selected control F1. The possible differences in hatching rate were used to estimate heritability.
   Two different selection experiments were run, accompanied with a number of additional tests studying the influence of the hatching set-up, the hatching temperature and diapause termination using hydrogen peroxide, on the hatching rate. Also the influence of different culture salinities on hatching rate and on possible success of selection was studied.
   The results revealed an influence of all those abiotic factors on the hatching rate, but also a marked interference of the hatching percentage with the hatching rate. Choosing the individuals based on their own phenotypic values (hatching within a certain time span of hatching incubation) and using those to produce the next generation, revealed a positive response. The selection in different salinities showed a different response. Depending on the strength of the selection pressure, the samples were advanced in time, starting with the highest selection pressure, and ending with the control and the parental sample. In spite of the strong interference of environmental factors, our results suggest that selection of early hatching cysts is possible. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nocturnal lizards inhabiting cool temperate environments potentially experience a wide range of body temperatures (T(b)). We used radio telemetry to characterize field T(b). in a nocturnal diplodactylid gecko (Hoplodactylus maculatus) from a high-latitude (45 degrees S), sub-alpine site in Southern New Zealand. Variation in T(b) within days (diel), among clays and among different reproductive groups of this viviparous species (pregnant females, non-pregnant females and males) was measured with temperature-sensitive transmitters. We found that surgical implantation of transmitters did not have a significant effect on selected temperature on a laboratory gradient (T(sel)). Field T(b) values were examined in concert with T(sel) and microhabitat temperature in late Summer, revealing marked fluctuations of up to 30 degrees C in T(b) both within and between days. When weather conditions allowed, all reproductive groups exhibited some degree of thermoregulation, with T(b) generally elevated at least 4 degrees C above microhabitat temperature and within the bounds (central 50%) of T(sel) at the warmest times of day on most clays. Considerable thermoregulation occurred early in the day, particularly for pregnant females, and is likely to have involved some degree of direct solar basking. Temperature telemetry revealed both extreme variability in T(b) and complexity of thermoregulatory behaviour in a primarily nocturnal, thigmothermic lizard.

AB  - Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) occurs in all major reptile lineages, but the selective forces and physiological mechanisms that link sex to incubation temperature may differ among and within those groups. Different models for TSD evolution make different predictions about when offspring sex will respond to environmental cues. Although TSD has evolved in several lizard lineages, there is less detailed information on these taxa than in turtles and crocodilians with TSD. We incubated eggs of ail agamid lizard (Amphibolurus muricatus) and a scincid lizard (Bassiana duperreyi), two species with TSD. Rather than manipulate incubation temperature to identify periods of sexual lability (as in most previous Studies of this topic), we topically applied the aromatase inhibitor fadrozole to eggs at a variety of times through the incubation period. Fadrozole application sex-reversed the resultant hatchlings if applied from the time of oviposition until at least 60% of the way through incubation. In all of the TSD lizard species studied so far, offspring sex is determined either while the eggs are held inside the mother's body or soon after oviposition, providing substantial maternal control over incubation temperatures at this critical period. Hence, the hypothesis that TSD evolves because it enables offspring sex to be matched to conditions that are unpredictable at the time of laying is less likely to apply to squamates than to turtles, sphenodontians, and (especially) crocodiles, in which the period of sexual lability is delayed until long after oviposition.

AB  - Insects experience important selection pressures from their parasitoids, which affect both their population dynamics and their evolutionary responses. The interaction between the egg parasitoid Oomyzus galerucivorus Graham (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) and its chrysomelid host Galeruca tanaceti L. (Coleoptera: Galerucinae) was investigated with the particular aim determining whether the chrysomelid host can escape its parasitoid by ovipositing late in the year as early as September. Although the leaf beetle and its parasitoid emerge in April, G. tanaceti starts to oviposit after spending the summer in reproductive diapause. The objective was to determine, whether the small parasitic wasp can parasitise its host's eggs even at the end of its host's reproductive season in December, when temperatures are low. Beetle oviposition, parasitism rates and temperatures were measured on three comparable mesoxerophytic grassland sites over the coarse of a season. Beetle oviposition, but not parasitism, was significantly positively dependent on temperature. Rate of oviposition decreased over the oviposition period with decrease in temperature. In contrast, after a lag phase of 1-2 weeks at the beginning of the oviposition period in September beetle egg clutches were parasitised at a constant rate until the end of the season in December. Host eggs were parasitised even at mean daily temperatures of 0-6 degrees C. Thus the tansy leaf beetle does not escape from egg parasitism by ovipositing late in the season in central Germany.

AB  - Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in various upland soils show a rather large diversity with respect to their amoA genes (coding for a Subunit of the ammonium monooxygenase). It is known that the community Structure of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in upland soils is influenced by different selective factors, such as pH, gravimetric water content, fertilizer treatment, and temperature. The question, from an ecological point of view, is whether a particular ecophysiological factor, such as temperature, could select for a particular community structure of ammonia oxidizers in upland soils that would be represented by distinct clusters of the amoA gene (AmoA Cluster). Studying the literature, including recent publications and Our own unpublished results, we found that AmoA clusters 3a, 3b, and 9-12 apparently exhibited no preference for either subtropical/tropical soils (i.e., warm regions) or temperate cold soils. However, AmoA Clusters 1 and 4 (and perhaps cluster 2) seem to occur predominantly in soils from cold-temperate regions. Here we review the evidence for a temperature effect on the global distribution of amoA genes in warm- and cold-temperate soils.

AB  - Theoretical models identify maternal behavior as critical for the maintenance and evolution of sex ratios in organisms with environmental sex determination (ESD). Maternal choice of nest site is generally thought to respond more rapidly to sex ratio selection than environmental sensitivity of offspring sex (threshold temperatures) in reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD, a form of ESD). However, knowledge of the evolutionary potential for either of these traits in a field setting is limited. I developed a simulation model using local climate data and observed levels of phenotypic variation for nest-site choice and threshold temperatures in painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) with TSD. Both nestsite choice and threshold temperatures, and hence sex ratios, evolved slowly to simulated climate change scenarios. In contrast to expectations from previous models, nest-site choice evolved more slowly than threshold temperatures because of large climatic effects on nest temperatures and indirect selection on maternally expressed traits. A variant of the model, assuming inheritance of nest-site choice through natal imprinting, demonstrated that natal imprinting inhibited adaptive responses in female nest-site choice to climate change. These results predict that females have relatively low potential to adaptively adjust sex ratios through nest-site choice.

AB  - Many plants and animals use the length of day or photoperiod to cue their seasonal patterns of development, reproduction, dormancy, and migration. Among temperate arthropods, the median or critical photoperiod increases with latitude or altitude. Concomitantly, in beetles, moths, mites, flies, and mosquitoes, there is a declining expression of a rhythmic, presumably circadian-based, component of photoperiodic response. It has been proposed that the long summer days in the north select for a reduced response to light by the circadian clock, which results in this declining rhythmic expression and, consequently, longer northern critical photoperiods. However, these patterns might also be due to direct, seasonal selection on the critical photoperiod itself, which results in a correlated reduction in the rhythmic component as a result of internal physiological constraints within the organism. Using standard light duration and selection experiments, we show that evolution of photoperiodic time measurement in the mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, results from the direct response of critical photoperiod to seasonal selection and a correlated response of the rhythmic component of photoperiodic time measurement. We conclude that expression of the circadian clock is necessary neither for the central mechanism of photoperiodic time measurement nor for the adaptive modification of critical photoperiod.

T2  - AUSTENITE FORMATION AND DECOMPOSITION

CP  - Symposium on Austenite Formation and Decomposition
KW  - RETAINED AUSTENITE
AB  - Increased emphasis oil crash worthiness in combination with weight reduction has prompted automotive manufacturers to search for steels with unusual properties. TRansformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) Steels offer a unique combination of high tensile strength and ductility, factors that facilitate a high degree of energy absorption. As a consequence, TRIP steel has become a material of interest for automotive applications. However, in order to optimize these very complicated steels, a clear understanding of the microstructural evolution during heat treatment is necessary. This work was, therefore, undertaken to study phase transformation behavior during continuous cooling and isothermal holding of Al and Si hearing TRIP Steels.
   Comprehensive dilatometric investigation of four TRIP Steels based oil 0.15C-1.5Mn composition was carried out. Two steels contained 1.0% and 1.6%Si, two others were Si-free steels with 1.25% and 1.9%Al. A(C1) - A(C3) values were determined during continuous heating at 2-20degreesC/sec. An increase in Si or Al results in a decrease in the austenite fraction at compared temperatures due to the expanding A(C1) - A(C3) range. The differences in the austenitization kinetics occurred due to both different "equilibrium arnount" and the effects of constituent elements oil the rate of diffusion.
   A generalized method was developed to construct CCT diagrams from dilatometric data. Appropriate peaks in the plot of the second derivative dilatation curve Versus temperature identified the transformation temperatures. Comparison of CCT diagrams based oil hot rolled and cold rolled samples show a lack of fit between the two. The initially hot rolled (IHR) structure does not truly represent the real behavior of initially cold rolled (ICR) material. In particular, ICR samples exhibit considerably higher F-S and B-S temperatures (start of fertile and bainite transformation respectively) and a higher rate of ferrite formation that results in significantly lower M-S temperatures.
   Differences in the isothermal behavior of the studied steels are attributed not only to the role of alloying elements, but also to the initial carbon content in austenite, which is a function of the austenite Volume fraction formed at comparative temperatures. The microstructural evolution during isothermal holding is strongly correlated to the mechanical properties in these steels.

AB  - The optimal conditions for the retention of the second polar body in sea bass eggs were investigated by altering the timing, intensity and duration of application of pressure and cold shocks. Treatment optima for cold shocks were 0-1 degrees C for 15-20 min at 5 min after fertilisation (a.f.) and 8500 psi for 2 min at 6 min a.f. for pressure shocks. Meiogenesis was obtained by fertilising eggs with UV-irradiated homologous sperm (32,000 erg mm(-2)) and pressure or cold shocking eggs as above. 100% triploidy was induced following definition of liable periods for the disruption of the meiotic spindle obtained in gynogenesis. Ploidy investigations were performed on experimental groups by flow-cytometry. Verification of uniparental transmission in meiogens was carried out by microsatellite marker loci analysis. This work highlights the degree of variation in individual responses of selected broodstock to these agents. Finally, some preliminary results on heterologous fertilisation in sea bass with potential applications for gynogenetic studies are also provided. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The annual patterns of oxygen tension (PO2) and temperature are described for two humanmade ponds in Alabama-one exposed, shallow, and much longer than wide (Road Pond); and one protected, deeper, and circular (Strip Mine Pond). Both ponds supported large populations of bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) tadpoles. Wind-mixing produced complete water column overturn on several occasions throughout the year in the Road Pond but only incomplete turnover in the Strip Mine Pond and only then during the colder months, PO2 in the Strip Mine Pond fell below the critical O-2 tension (P-c) of the tadpoles during warmer months at depths of greater than or equal to 2 m; nevertheless the tadpoles favored depths near 2 m during the summer, reversing their winter tendency to move toward shore. Road Pond tadpoles also moved away from shore during the summer, but the PO2 in this pond did not normally fall below the P-c of the tadpoles. Summer tadpoles acclimated to 25 C selected a mean temperature of 28.9 C in a temperature gradient; winter tadpoles acclimated to 10 C selected a mean of 20.0 C, Diurnal and annual shifts in the patterns of distribution of bullfrog tadpoles within our study ponds were most likely related to temperature patterns, not to aquatic predators.

AB  - The effects of weather conditions and two parasitoid quality attributes, realized fecundity and host acceptance, were assessed on the field efficacy of mass-released Trichogramma minutum. Temperature was the most important single variable, explaining up to 75% of the variation in field parasitism. There were significant positive relationships between both the sum of the maximum temperatures and the number of degree-hours above a 15 degrees C threshold, accumulated in the three days following the release, and parasitism in the field. There was a significant negative relationship between the mean relative humidity and the odds of parasitism in the field. Quality parameters based on parasitoid biology were not effective for predicting field efficacy if poor weather conditions persisted after a release. If weather conditions were 'good' (i.e. accumulated maximum temperatures above 62 degrees C, in the 3 days following the release), then parameters such as release rate and fecundity in the lab were useful predictors of field performance. There was no relationship between host acceptance measured in the lab and field parasitism Given the importance of field temperatures for field performance, selection for cold tolerance of T. minutum would be desirable.

AB  - Effects of temperature and 4 plant pollens on the development, survivorship, and reproduction of Amblyseius largoensis (Muma) were evaluated. The average egg incubation period at 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C was 6.02, 3.26, 2.01, 1.45, and 1.95 d, respectively. The combined larval and nymphal developmental time (mean +/- SD) decreased from 11.18 +/- 0.55 to 3.21 +/- 0.41 d and adult longevity from 39.45 +/- 6.24 to 11.91 +/- 5.33 d as temperature was increased from 15 to 35 degrees C, respectively No significant difference in adult longevity was observed when pollens from live oak, Quercus virginiana Miller, castor bean, Ricinus communis L., cattail, Typha domingensis Persoon, and pygmy date palm, Phoenix roebelenii O'Brien, were provided as food at 25 degrees C. Survivorship was >90% when this predator was reared at 5 constant temperatures on 4 plant pollens as food, with the exception of egg hatch at 35 degrees C. The highest intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m) = 0.265) and net reproductive rate (R(o) = 19.27) were obtained at 25 degrees C compared with the life table parameters derived from the other 4 constant temperatures. When pollens of live oak, castor bean, cattail, and pygmy data palm were provided as single food sources at 25 degrees C, life table parameters indicated that live oak pollen is the most suitable food source, followed by castor bean and cattail pollens.

AB  - Embryonic development times and the stage at which embryonic diapause occurs varied dramatically among 23 populations of the Melanoplus sanguinipes/devastator species complex in California, USA. Grasshoppers were collected from a wide range of latitudes (32-degrees-57N to 41-degrees-20N) and altitudes (10 m to 3031 m), spanning much of the variation in climatic conditions experienced by these insects in California. When reared in a ''common garden'' in the laboratory, total embryonic development times were positively correlated to the mean annual temperature of the habitat from which the grasshoppers were collected (varying from about 19 days to 32 days when reared at 27-degrees-C). These grasshoppers overwinter as diapausing eggs and the proportion of embryonic development completed prior to diapause was significantly higher in populations collected from cool habitats (>70%) than in populations collected from warm environments (<26%). The length of pre-diapause development time is determined by the stage of embryonic development at which diapause occurs, and varies considerably among populations of these grasshoppers; grasshoppers from warmer environments tend to diapause at very early stages of embryogenesis, while grasshoppers from cooler environments diapause at very late stages. The combined effect of variation in embryonic development times and variation in the stage at which diapause occurs results in a dramatic reduction in the time needed to hatch in the spring; populations from warm environments required up to 20 days (at 27-degrees-C) to hatch while populations from cool environments required as few as 5 days to complete embryonic development prior to hatching. Egg size also varied significantly among populations, but tended to be larger in populations with shorter embryonic development times. Significant family effects were observed for development time and stage of diapause, suggesting significant heritabilities for these traits, although maternal effects may also contribute to family level variation. We interpret these findings to support the hypothesis that embryonic development time and the stage of embryonic diapause have evolved as adaptations to prevailing season lengths in the study populations.

AB  - The screwworm fly is mass-produced using an artificial larval diet and an artificial oviposition substrate. On the artificial diet, mean fecundity was 185 eggs per female, whereas host-reared flies averaged 280 eggs per female. Host-reared flies were generally larger (head capsule width [HCW] > 3.6 mm) than laboratory-reared flies (HCW < 3.6 mm). Larger flies are generally more fecund, and size is related to larval nutrition. Only 75-89% of females reared on artificial diet and maintained at 30-degrees-C were gravid at 6 d of age compared with 100% of host-reared females tested at 5-6 d. When gravid females were offered artificial substrate for oviposition, almost-equal-to 28% failed to oviposit and another 11% laid only partial clutches. Among all females tested for oviposition, 25% of the total egg production was withheld. Fecundity influenced oviposition, because the more mature eggs a female had, the more likely she was to oviposit. Supplementing the adult diet of honey and water with raw meat increased fecundity by 14% under normal laboratory conditions, but by as much as 350% in flies in which larval feeding was curtailed by removal of the larvae from the media 1 d before the normal completion of development. Many females became gravid in 4-5 d at 30-degrees-C versus 8-9 d at 22-degrees-C. But fecundity and oviposition rate were more variable (less synchronous) in colonies maintained at the higher temperature. This suggests that there may be greater selection for laboratory adaptation at the higher maintenance temperatures.

AB  - Phally, a genital dimorphism found in some species of self-compatible simultaneous hermaphrodites, presents an opportunity to examine factors maintaining outcrossing within an animal species in the presence of recombination. Both aphallics and euphallics can self-fertilize but only euphallics develop a functional penis and prostate allowing them to donate sperm. Previous studies of phally in the gastropod Bulinus truncatus (Mollusca: Pulmonata) suggest that phally may be under direct genetic control in some populations and strongly influenced by environmental factors in others. Experiments reported here identify temperature as a cue affecting phally determination in two populations of B. truncatus. In both populations, a higher proportion of euphallics was produced at low temperature (22 +/- 1-degrees-C) than at high temperature (30 +/- 1-degrees-C). Temperatures experienced by parents did not affect the proportion of euphallics they produced. Instead, phally was sensitive to temperature during the egg stage postoviposition and during the hatchling stage; the relative influence of temperature before and after hatching varied between populations. The total number of hatchlings reaching maturity at high and low temperature did not differ, but at low temperature, snails took longer to hatch and mature, and had lower survivorship. Just as studies of environmental sex determination have shed light on selective pressures influencing sex ratio evolution, we suggest that temperature-sensitive phally determination may shed light on the selective pressures maintaining outcrossing in B. truncatus.

AB  - Adults of the noctuid moth Autographa gamma undertake seasonal migrations into areas where they are unable to breed continuously. Individuals migrate into Britain each spring and offspring of these migrants probably return in autumn to over-wintering areas in North Africa and the Middle East, although the existence of these return migrations has been questioned. Insects usually migrate during the adults' pre-reproductive period (PRP). The length of this period is therefore an index of migratory potential because individuals with longer PRPs have more time to express their potential for flight and to travel further. Significant, positive full-sib correlations showed that female offspring with long PRPs came from families where their brothers had correspondingly long PRPs. This suggests that the same genes control the rate of reproductive development in both sexes. There was a rapid response to selection for short and long PRP, with separation of the lines by the second generation of selection. Sib-analysis and parent-offspring regressions showed that the genes with the greatest influence on PRP are X-linked, although there is also an autosomal influence. The significance of X-linkage of genes controlling the PRP is discussed in relation to the migratory strategy of A. gamma.

AB  - Male Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica) help their mates to incubate in North America but not in Europe. In this study, conducted at four colonies in southeastern Canada, males contributed an average of 9% of the total amount of incubation during daylight hours. The total percent of time that eggs were incubated (nest attentiveness) by both sexes declined through the day, largely due to a response to increasing temperature. The nest attentiveness of both males and females was negatively correlated with nest temperature (i.e., air temperature near the nest) but not consistently with weather. In general a male seemed to incubate more when his help was needed-early in the day when the female had to recover energy lost during nighttime incubation and late in the incubation period when females should have been most stressed energetically. We found no evidence that male nest attentiveness was affected by their expected opportunity to obtain extra-pair copulations - neither differences in male attractiveness due to tail-length manipulation (shortening or elonption) nor changes in the operational sex ratio affected the male's relative share of incubation duties. Using DNA fingerprinting, we also found that the male contribution was not affected by his paternity in the brood. Since colony size and the mating system of this species appear to be similar in both North America and Europe, the intensity of sexual selection should not differ substantially between these populations. Instead we suggest that nest temperature or feeding conditions are the most likely factors influencing the differences in male incubation behavior between European and North American populations.

AB  - The distribution of rare earth elements (REE) in the alteration zones surrounding modern and ancient volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits is often characterized by a wide range of variations comprising both gains and losses of light REE (LREE: La to Sm) and europium. The evolution of the hydrothermal system is recorded by mineral assemblages and their chemical composition. To address the behavior of the REE in such a context, the Bracemac-McLeod Archean VMS deposits of the Matagami district are used. There, mineralization was formed mainly by subsea-floor replacement along a tuffaceous marker unit (Key Tuffite) of homogenous andesitic composition, hence providing a single protolith to account for mineral and chemical variations in relation to ore position. We combine whole-rock and mineral REE data in both distal sericite and proximal chlorite alteration surrounding the mineralization. A model, integrating observed textural relationships, geochemical data and current understanding of mineral stabilities, is proposed to explain the redistribution of the REE during the evolution of the VMS hydrothermal system. The distal sericite zone represents the early, low temperature alteration. It is characterized by the destruction of volcanic glass and plagioclase leading to a negative Eu anomaly in the whole-rock analyses and the depletion of LREE. The proximal chlorite zone was formed during the thermal evolution of a fertile VMS hydrothermal system. It is generally characterized by gains of LREE and Eu, although some chloritized samples are depleted in LREE. Petrographic observations suggest that the coprecipitation of allanite with chlorite explains the increase of LREE, whereas a mass balance calculation indicates that the precipitation of apatite (carbonates) essentially controls the Eu. Local silicification, occurring as pulses during the hydrothermal system life, is also of interest because it could preserve an intermediate alteration state and thus provide additional information on the evolution of the hydrothermal system. The mobility of REE is indicative of specific hydrothermal conditions, which may reflect the efficiency of a mineralizing hydrothermal system. At Matagami, the mobility of LREE and Eu could be used for vectoring in exploration, especially Eu which has an anomalous behavior that extends far beyond the limit of the sulfide zone, into the distal sericitic low-temperature alteration (up to 400 m from the ore zones).

AB  - Activity rhythms play an important role in the ecological relations of a species and form part of its evolutionary adaptation. Such rhythms are strongly synchronised with the annual cyclic changes by environmental stimuli, the so-called zeitgebers. Animals' reliance on environmental stimuli is highly species-specific and allows behavioural adjustments to be made in preparation for the conditions expected in each season. We investigated daily and annual activity rhythms of Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) by analysing high-resolution data of animals monitored with GPS collars. This first detailed field study of chamois activity showed that this species exhibited clear daily and annual activity rhythms entrained to the light-dark cycle. Chamois were more active during spring-summer and less active during winter, likely in response to the variation in the availability of food resources: both sexes appeared to maximise energy intake during the season offering the highest amount of food resources to compensate for poor food supply during winter. Daily activity was influenced by the climatic factors considered. We showed a negative correlation between daily activity and adverse climatic conditions (i.e. precipitation and, during winter, snow depth). As activity was strongly influenced by the interplay between temperature and wind throughout the year and by radiation and wind in winter, we conjectured that it was critically dependent upon animals' thermal balance. In conclusion, our study highlighted that chamois is well adapted to the Alpine environment and seasonality but also raised questions about its ability to adapt to future climate change.
   In this study, we investigated the effects of ecological factors on Alpine chamois activity. Thanks to radio collars with accelerometers, we obtained highly detailed information on activity levels of wild animals. We found that chamois were more active during spring-summer (i.e. the seasons with the highest quality and quantity of food) and less active during winter. Our results showed that chamois activity was strongly influenced by such climatic factors as temperature, precipitation and wind speed. In winter time, chamois activity increased during the days with high solar radiation and decreased with high snow depth. Given their wide distribution in the Alps, chamois can be considered as a sentinel species of Alpine habitats. Thus, our results on the current relationship between climate and chamois behaviour may shed light on the animals' ability to track and adapt to climate change.

AB  - Arctic populations live in an environment characterized by extreme cold and the absence of plant foods for much of the year and are likely to have undergone genetic adaptations to these environmental conditions in the time they have been living there. Genome-wide selection scans based on genotype data from native Siberians have previously highlighted a 3 Mb chromosome 11 region containing 79 protein-coding genes as the strongest candidates for positive selection in Northeast Siberians. However, it was not possible to determine which of the genes might be driving the selection signal. Here, using whole-genome high-coverage sequence data, we identified the most likely causative variant as a nonsynonymous G>A transition (rs80356779; c.1436C>T [p.Pro479Leu] on the reverse strand) in CPT1A, a key regulator of mitochondrial long-chain fatty-acid oxidation. Remarkably, the derived allele is associated with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and high infant mortality yet occurs at high frequency in Canadian and Greenland Inuits and was also found at 68% frequency in our. Northeast Siberian sample. We provide evidence of one of the strongest selective sweeps reported in humans; this sweep has driven this variant to high frequency in circum-Arctic populations within the last 6-23 ka despite associated deleterious consequences, possibly as a result of the selective advantage it originally provided to either a high-fat diet or a cold environment.

AB  - Over many glacial cycles, the glacial erosion of alpine valleys can be sufficient to reduce the length of glaciers in the most recent cycles. We document field cases illustrative of this erosional feedback and model the long-term evolution of glacier lengths analytically and numerically. The general feature we target is a moraine deposited well beyond the last glacial maximum (LGM) limit, which we refer to as a "far-flung" moraine. Firstly, we assemble published observations to illustrate that far-flung moraines are documented around the world. The observations suggest that the downvalley distance to such far-flung moraines can exceed the distance to LGM moraines by up to twofold. Secondly, we address the problem analytically, making several simplifying assumptions, to demonstrate that glacier length scales linearly with erosion depth. Finally, we employ a numerical model to test the analytical solution. This 1D (depth-integrated) flowline model includes: (i) a depth-averaged longitudinal coupling stress approximation, (ii) prescribed winter and summer surface mass balance profiles, (iii) evolving ice temperature calculated via the conventional heat equation, and (iv) glacier sliding velocity parameterized as a function of basal ice temperature and spatially and temporally variable prescribed flotation fraction. The simulated alpine landscape is modified through the competing processes of glacier erosion, which is dependent on glacier sliding velocity and prescribed bedrock erodibility, and prescribed uplift rate. The climate controlling surface mass balance is prescribed by time series of air temperature and snowfall approximated by the sum of two sinusoidal cycles. The recurrence statistics of these prescribed climate drivers closely match those of the marine isotopic record; hence the prescribed climate drivers faithfully mimic observed long-term climate drivers.
   Consistent with earlier landscape evolution studies, we find that the primary effect of repeated glaciations is to flatten a valley floor and steepen its headwall, effectively cutting a longitudinal notch in a fluvial valley profile. Analytical and numerical model results also demonstrate that far-flung moraines are an inevitable consequence of repeated glaciations: glaciers in tectonically inactive regions can sufficiently erode their valleys so that the earliest glaciations leave moraines many kilometers down-valley from moraines left by the latest glaciations, despite similar climates. This suggests that a different landscape, rather than a different climate, is capable of explaining the early glacier extents. As a corollary, the long-term drift toward reduced glacier length favors the survival of early moraines in the face of later glacial advances. Finally, rock uplift can defeat this erosional feedback, while rock subsidence enhances the feedback. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Genetic variation evolves during postglacial range expansion of a species and is important for adapting to varied environmental conditions. It is crucial for the future survival of a species. We investigate the nuclear DNA sequence variation to provide evidence of postglacial range expansion of Musa basjoo var. formosana, a wild banana species, and test for adaptive evolution of amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) loci underlying local adaptation in association with environmental variables. Postglacial range expansion was suggested by phylogeographical analyses based on sequence variation of the second intron of copper zinc superoxide dismutase 2 gene. Two glacial refugia were inferred by the average F-ST parameter (mean F-ST of a population against the remaining populations). Using variation partitioning by redundancy analysis, we found a significant amount of explained AFLP variation attributed to environmental and spatially-structured environmental effects. By combining genome scan methods and multiple univariate logistic regression, four AFLP loci were found to be strongly associated with environmental variables, including temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, wet days, and surface coverage activity representing vegetation greenness. These environmental variables may have played various roles as ecological drivers for adaptive evolution of M. basjoo var. formosana during range expansion after the last glacial maximum.

AB  - Shrimp hemocyte iridescent virus (SHIV), which was first identified in white leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) in China in 2014, can cause extensive shrimp mortality and major economic losses in the shrimp farming industry in China. In this study, a novel real-time isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assay was developed using a TwistAmp exo kit for SHIV detection. First, five primers and a probe were designed for the major capsid protein gene (GenBank: KY681039.1) according to the TwistDx manual; next, the optimal primers were selected by a comparison experiment. The primers and probe were specific for SHIV and did not react with shrimp white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), shrimp infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV), shrimp enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP), and macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV) samples, as well as pathogens of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND). The RPA assay reached a detection limit of 11 copies per reaction according to probit regression analysis. In addition, RPA assay detected the positive plasmid samples at concentration of 1000 copies/mu L within 16.04 +/- 0.72 min at a single low operation temperature (39 degrees C). The results proved that the proposed RPA method was an accurate, sensitive, affordable, and rapid detection tool that can be suitably applied for the diagnosis of SHIV in field conditions and in resource-poor settings.

AB  - Lice from pinnipeds - sea lions, seals and walruses - are the only insects capable of surviving marine dives. Throughout their evolutionary history, they have adapted to tolerate hypoxia, high salinity, low temperature and, in particular, to tolerate conditions of high hydrostatic pressure. To understand the limits of the capacity of lice to survive during host deep dives, we conducted a series of controlled experiments in the laboratory. We collected lice from elephant seals and submitted the different life stages to high pressure conditions. Lice were first exposed to one of four hydrostatic pressures: 30, 80, 150 or 200 kg cm(-2). They were then exposed a second time to higher or lower hydrostatic pressure conditions to test for the impact of the first experience, which could either be deleterious or trigger physiological adaption, allowing them a better tolerance to high pressure. We found that lice from elephant seals can tolerate hydrostatic pressures higher than 200 kg cm(-2) (close to 200 atm), which is equivalent to 2000 m depth. Adults exhibited lower recovery times than nymphs after immersion at high hydrostatic pressure. Our findings show that lice have developed unique adaptations to endure extreme marine conditions. We discuss these extreme performances in relation to the morphological characteristics and physiological responses to diving in these insects.

AB  - Living organisms when subjected to various forms of environmental stress mount a physiological response to survive the long- and short-term ill-effects of the stress. The stress response may involve selective shut down of nonessential metabolic activities and the repair of macromolecular damage resulting from the stress. Messenger RNA splicing in cultured HeLa cells is one of the processes inhibited by heat stress. splicing is protected from such inhibition in stress-preconditioned cells that have acquired a tolerant state characterised by increased cell survival and resistance to other environmental stresses. Stress tolerant cells have heat shock proteins (HSPs) that had been induced by the preconditioning process. To examine the biochemical changes induced by stress in the splicing apparatus, we analysed the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles associated with spliceosomes in normal. stressed, and stress tolerant cells. We show that (a) the spliceosomal component U4/U5/U6 snRNP particle is disassembled by heat stress into intermediates of splicing assembly, (b) prior induction of stress tolerance protects the structural and functional integrity of snRNPs if cells are subsequently exposed to a severe stress and (c) a novel 65 kDa protein is associated with small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles in stress tolerant cells.

AB  - Urbanization is considered a global threat to biodiversity; the growth of cities results in an increase in impervious surfaces, soil and air pollution, fragmentation of natural vegetation and invasion of non-native species, along with numerous environmental changes, including the heat island phenomenon. The combination of these effects constitutes a challenge for both the survival and persistence of many native species, while also imposing altered selective regimes. Here, using 110314 single nucleotide polymorphisms generated by restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing, we investigated the genome-wide effects of urbanization on putative neutral and adaptive genomic diversity in a major insect pollinator, Bombus lapidarius, collected from nine German cities and nine paired rural sites. Overall, genetic differentiation among sites was low and there was no obvious genome-wide genetic structuring, suggesting the absence of strong effects of urbanization on gene flow. We nevertheless identified several loci under directional selection, a subset of which was associated with urban land use, including the percentage of impervious surface surrounding each sampling site. Overall, our results provide evidence of local adaptation to urbanization in the face of gene flow in a highly mobile insect pollinator.

AB  - 1. Freshwater mussels are in decline throughout their range. The lack of natural recruitment in freshwater pearl mussel populations and other freshwater molluscs has led to controversies about the usefulness and applicability of captive breeding techniques for their conservation.
   2. The current state of rearing and culturing programmes for freshwater mussels in Europe and North America is reviewed here with a focus on the endangered freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera). Different strategies of propagation and the key factors of success are addressed and conservation management decisions are discussed with respect to risk reduction and the intensity of the culturing system.
   3. Based on the rearing techniques applied for multiple species in North America, and for the genus Margaritifera in European countries, sufficient numbers of juveniles can be produced to sustain selected populations. However, captive breeding and stocking should be carefully documented and must not replace the restoration of functional stream habitats.
   4. From a conservation point of view, captive breeding of endangered mussel species can be a last-minute rescue tool in order to retain the evolutionary potential of priority populations which would not persist long enough to benefit from habitat restoration practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuta absolutaMeyrick (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is native to South America and has recently invaded European, African and Asian countries, where it is causing severe damage to tomato crops leading to an increase in the number of insecticide applications. This situation has prompted a demand for alternative pest management strategies aiming to control T. absoluta and concomitantly reduce insecticide applications. The development period for immature stages of T. absoluta at constant temperatures was modelled to select appropriatemathematical functions for simulating its development.
   RESULTS: The performance of themodels varied according to the insect development stage, but in general all models performed well considering the statistical criteria used. Discrimination among models was possible only when the reliability of the temperature thresholds estimated by the models was used as an additional criterion. In this case, the models Briere-1, Lactin-2 and Shi proved adequate to describe the relationship between temperature and development rate of T. absoluta.
   CONCLUSION: These models provide an important tool to predict the occurrence of the immature stages of T. absoluta in the field in order to determine the best period for implementing controlmeasures. This is an important contribution to the development of pest management strategies for T. absoluta. (C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - High mountain environments are highly stressful for insect survival. It has been suggested that small microtopographic variations generating less stressful microclimatic conditions than the surrounding environment would provide more suitable sites for insect development. Cushion plants represent one of the life forms best adapted to the extreme alpine habitats. Cushion plants can modify microclimatic conditions within and under their canopy, generating less severe microsites than the surrounding environment. In this study, we characterized the microclimatic modifications made by the cushion plants Azorella monantha and Laretia acaulis and examine their role as microcliniatic shelters for two species of high Andean coleopterans (Coccinelidae): Eriopis connexa and Hippodamia variegata at 3200 in a.s.l. in the Andes of central Chile. Results showed that the cushion species create microhabitats with higher availability of water and less oscillating temperatures. However, the intensity of modifications was higher in A. monantha compared to L. acaulis. The abundance of the two ladybird beetle species was higher within cushions than outside, although E. connexa showed higher abundances compared to H. variegata. However, a habitat selection experiment in a greenhouse showed that under milder temperature conditions ladybird beetles species do not prefer cushions. This suggests that in the harsh alpine climate, cushion plants may act as microclimatic shelters since they reduce stressful environmental conditions, allowing greater abundances of coleopterans than in the surrounding environment.

AB  - The relative effectiveness of three methods for the recovery of Salmonella serovars from orange juice was determined. One method, a modified Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) procedure consisted of preenrichment in lactose broth at 35 degreesC for 24 h, selective enrichment, and selective plating. Another method, a National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 1) procedure, consisted of direct enrichment in tetrathionate broth at 35 degreesC for 24 and 48 h, followed by selective plating. The third method (also from CDC and designated CDC 2) consisted of preenrichment in Universal Preenrichment (UP) broth at 35 degreesC for 24 h, selective enrichment, and selective plating. In 10 experiments encompassing five different Salmonella serovars and 200 test portions per broth, the CDC 1 method recovered 141 Salmonella-positive test portions, the BAM method recovered 151, and the CDC 2 method recovered 171. In 2 of the 10 experiments, with two different Salmonella serovars, the BAM recovered significantly fewer (P < 0.05) Salmonella-positive test portions than did the CDC 2 method. On the basis of the above results, the second phase of this study focused on a comparison of the effectiveness of the BAM-recommended lactose broth and the CDC 2-recommended UP broth as preenrichment media for the recovery of Salmonella serovars from pasteurized and unpasteurized orange juice. Subsequent culture treatment of the two preenrichments was identical so that the effect of other variables (e.g., different selective enrichment media, various incubation temperatures, and different selective plating agars) on the relative performance of these two preenrichment media was excluded. In one of nine experiments, with pasteurized orange juice, lactose broth recovered significantly fewer (P < 0.05) Salmonella-positive test portions than did UP broth. For the combined results of the nine pasteurized orange juice experiments (180 test portions per broth), lactose broth recovered 99 Salmonella-positive test portions, and UP broth recovered 116. In three of seven experiments, with unpasteurized orange juice, lactose broth recovered significantly fewer (P < 0.05) Salmonella-positive test portions than did UP broth. For the combined results of the seven unpasteurized orange juice experiments (140 test portions per broth), lactose broth recovered 73 Salmonella-positive test portions, and UP broth recovered 117. For both pasteurized and unpasteurized orange juice, the total number of Salmonella-positive test portions recovered with UP broth was significantly greater than the number recovered with lactose broth. These results indicate that UP broth is a more effective enrichment broth for the recovery of Salmonella from orange juice than is lactose broth.

AB  - Dissecting the genomic basis of local adaptation is a major goal in evolutionary biology and conservation science. Rapid changes in the climate pose significant challenges to the survival of natural populations, and the genomic basis of long-generation plant species is still poorly understood. Here, we investigated genome-wide climate adaptation in giant sequoia and coast redwood, two iconic and ecologically important tree species. We used a combination of univariate and multivariate genotype-environment association methods and a selective sweep analysis using non-overlapping sliding windows. We identified genomic regions of potential adaptive importance, showing strong associations to moisture variables and mean annual temperature. Our results found a complex architecture of climate adaptation in the species, with genomic regions showing signatures of selective sweeps, polygenic adaptation, or a combination of both, suggesting recent or ongoing climate adaptation along moisture and temperature gradients in giant sequoia and coast redwood. The results of this study provide a first step toward identifying genomic regions of adaptive significance in the species and will provide information to guide management and conservation strategies that seek to maximize adaptive potential in the face of climate change.

AB  - Microbes can respond quickly to environmental disturbances through adaptation. However, processes determining the constraints on this adaptation are not well understood. One process that could affect the rate of adaptation to environmental perturbations is genetic robustness, the ability to maintain phenotype despite mutation. Genetic robustness has been theoretically linked to evolvability but rarely tested empirically using evolving populations. We used populations of the RNA bacteriophage Phi 6 previously characterized as differing in robustness, and passaged them through a repeated environmental disturbance: periodic 45 degrees C heat shock. The robust populations evolved faster to withstand the disturbance, relative to the less robust (brittle) populations. The robust populations also achieved relatively greater thermotolerance by the end of the experimental evolution. Sequencing revealed that thermotolerance occurred via a key mutation in gene P5 (viral lysis protein), previously shown to be associated with heat shock survival in the virus. Whereas this identical mutation fixed in all of the independently evolving robust populations, it was absent in some brittle populations, which instead fixed a less beneficial mutation. We concluded that robust populations adapted faster to the environmental change, and more easily accessed mutations of large benefit. Our study shows that genetic robustness can play a role in determining the relative ability for microbes to adapt to changing environments.

AB  - The metabolic theory of ecology posits that the functional properties at any level of biological organization are a function of the metabolic rate (MR) of its constituent units, although we know little about how heterogeneity among them shapes group-level performance. Using honeybees as a model system, we leveraged the differences in MR associated with "slow" and "fast" malate dehydrogenase alleles to breed genetic lines with low MR and high MR, respectively, and created four experimental groups with different phenotypic compositions. We then measured MR, energetic intake, thermoregulation, and survival of these groups in low- and high-resource conditions. Contrary to expectations, neither the monomorphic fast groups nor the polymorphic (1 : 1 slow-to-fast) groups showed a consistent advantage over other groups, but the performance of all groups was consistently better under high-resource conditions. MR had a strong influence on the other performance traits, more so under low-resource conditions. We quantified the effect of heterogeneity in the polymorphic groups as a diversity effect and found different impacts of metabolic heterogeneity, depending on the specific performance measure in question. We discuss these results in the context of how MR plays an important role in shaping division of labor and social evolution.

AB  - The Hong Kong oyster Magallana hongkongensis, previously known as Crassostrea hongkongensis, is a true oyster species native to the estuarine-coast of the Pearl River Delta in southern China. The species-with scientific, ecological, cultural, and nutritional importance-has been farmed for hundreds of years. However, there is only limited information on its genetics, stress adaptation mechanisms, and gut microbiota, restricting the sustainable production and use of oyster resources. Here, we present population structure analysis on M. hongkongensis oysters collected from Deep Bay and Lantau Island in Hong Kong, as well as transcriptome analysis on heat shock responses and the gut microbiota profile of M. hongkongensis oysters collected from Deep Bay. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including those on the homeobox genes and heat shock protein genes, were revealed by the whole genome resequencing. Transcriptomes of oysters incubated at 25 degrees C and 32 degrees C for 24 h were sequenced which revealed the heat-induced regulation of heat shock protein pathway genes. Furthermore, the gut microbe community was detected by 16S rRNA sequencing which identified Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes as the most abundant phyla. This study reveals the molecular basis for the adaptation of the oyster M. hongkongensis to environmental conditions.

AB  - The southern part of the Punjab province is blessed with a warm climate favorable for cotton production. Most of the rural families are dependent on cotton for socio-economic survival. Therefore, they utilize huge financial resources on pesticides to get maximum cotton production for sustainable rural livelihoods. However, lack of information about safe usage of pesticides may result not only in wastage of resources but also causes harmful effects. Therefore, the present study has been designed to assess the knowledge level of farmers about safe use of pesticides. From southern part of the Punjab, district Khanewal was selected for in-depth analysis about knowledge and behavior of pesticide users. A sample of 160 respondents was selected randomly and data from them was collected through interviews. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for data analyzing. Results depict that instructions regarding safe use of pesticides application was ranked 1st due to highest weighted score with value of 581. Based on ranking of health and environmental effects of pesticides, headache (health hazard) and ground water pollution (environmental hazard) were ranked 1st as perceived by farmer respondents. There is a need for training of farming community concerning safe usage of pesticides to avoid its health and the environmental effects.

AB  - Leguminous service crops (SCs) can provide multiple services to cropping systems, reducing the reliance on external resources if sufficient biomass is produced. However, rapid light and temperature reductions limit post-harvest cultivation of SCs in Northern Europe. A novel practice of intercropping SCs in two consecutive crops (spring-winter cereal) to extend the period of SCs growth, and hence improve yield and reduce weeds, was tested. Three spatial and temporal arrangements of SCs and cash crops were investigated, as well as three SC mixtures, characterized by their longevity and frost sensitivity. Compared to no SC, the best performing mixture, frost-tolerant annuals, increased grain and N yield of winter wheat by 10% and 19%, respectively, and reduced weed biomass by 15% and 26% in oats and winter wheat, respectively. These effects were attributed to high biomass production and winter survival. However, this SC reduced oat yields by 15% compared to no SC. Furthermore, SC growth and service provision varied largely between experiments, driven by the weather conditions. Extending the SC's growth period by intercropping in two consecutive cereal crops has potential, but locally adapted species choices and establishment strategies are needed to ensure SC vitality until termination.

AB  - Pure and polycrystalline samples of Yb3Sb5O12 were prepared under vacuum by solid-state reaction. In this cubic matrix, space group I (4) over bar 3m (No. 217), Z = 4, Yb3+ occupies a single crystallographic site with point symmetry S-4. The confident determination of the Yb3+ energy levels was carried out through the analysis of 9 K optical absorption (OA) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra, and 300 K Raman measurements, assisted by models and procedures providing proper estimations of crystal-field (CF) interactions in this host. The parametrization of free-ion and CF effects for Er3+ in Er3Sb5O12 has been revised and then used as reference in the simulation of Yb3+ CF energy levels. The correctness of the energy level sequence of Yb3+ in Yb3Sb5O12, which is characterized by a large splitting for the F-2(7/2) ground state, 933 cm(-1), and the composition of the associated wave functions were tested through the successful reproduction of the thermal evolution of the paramagnetic molar susceptibility chi(m), of Yb3Sb5O12. Some parameters of interest accounting for application perspectives as a laser material have been evaluated and compared with those corresponding to other stoichiometric and Yb-doped confirmed laser materials.

AB  - Recent high-redshift surveys for 21 cm absorption in damped Ly alpha absorption systems (DLAs) take the number of published searches at z(abs) > 2 to 25, the same number as at z(abs) < 2, although the detection rate at high redshift remains significantly lower (20% compared to 60%). Using the known properties of the DLAs to estimate the unknown profile widths of the 21 cm non-detections and including the limits via a survival analysis, we show that the mean spin temperature/covering factor degeneracy at high redshift is, on average, double that of the low-redshift sample. This value is significantly lower than the previous factor of eight for the spin temperatures and is about the same factor as in the angular diameter distance ratios between the low-and high-redshift samples. That is, without the need for the several pivotal assumptions, which lead to an evolution in the spin temperature, we show that the observed distribution of 21 cm detections in DLAs can be accounted for by the geometry effects of an expanding universe. That is, as yet there is no evidence of the spin temperature of gas-rich galaxies evolving with redshift.

AB  - Survival and growth of Legionella pneumophila in both biofilm and planktonic phases were determined with a two-stage model system. The model used filter-sterilized tap water as the sole source of nutrient to culture a naturally occurring mixed population of microorganisms including virulent L. pneumophila. At 20 degrees C, L. pneumophila accounted for a low proportion of biofilm flora on polybutylene and chlorinated polyvinyl chloride, but was absent from copper surfaces. The pathogen was most abundant on biofilms on plastics at 40 degrees C, where it accounted for up to 50% of the total biofilm Bora. Copper surfaces were inhibitory to total biofouling and included only low numbers of L. pneumophila organisms. The pathogen was able to survive in biofilms on the surface of the plastic materials at 50 degrees C, but was absent from the copper surfaces at the same temperature. L. pneumophila could not be detected in the model system at 60 degrees C. In the presence of copper surfaces, biofilms forming on adjacent control glass surfaces were found to incorporate copper ions which subsequently inhibited colonization of their surfaces. This work suggests that the use of copper tubing in water systems may help to limit the colonization of water systems by L. pneumophila.

AB  - Background and Aim: Viral nervous necrosis (VNN) is a serious disease of several marine fish species. VNN causes 100% mortality in the larval stages, while lower losses have been reported in juvenile and adult fish. This study aimed to detect the occurrence of VNN while identifying its associated risk factors and the genotypes of its causative agent in a hybrid grouper hatchery in Malaysia.
   Materials and Methods: A batch of newly hatched hybrid grouper fly (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus x Epinephelus lanceolatus) were followed from the larval stage to market size. Samples of the hybrid groupers, water, live feed. and artificial fish pellets were collected periodically from day 0 to 180 in the hybrid grouper hatchery. Reverse transcription-poly merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nested PCR amplifications were carried out on VNN-related sequences. The phylogenetic tree including the sampled causative agent of VNN was inferred from the coat protein genes from all known Betanodavirus species using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA). Pearson's correlation coefficient values were calculated to determine the strength of the correlation between the presence of VNN in hybrid grouper samples and its associated risk factors.
   Results: A total of 113 out of 146 pooled and individual samples. including hybrid grouper. water. and artificial fish pellet samples, demonstrated positive results in tests for the presence of VNN-associated viruses. The clinical signs of infection observed in the samples included darkened skin, deformation of the backbone, abdominal distension, skin lesions, and fin erosion. VNN was present throughout the life stages of the hybrid groupers, with the first detection occurring at day 10. VNN-associated risk factors included water temperature. dissolved oxygen content, salinity, ammonia level, fish size (adults more at risk than younger stages), and life stage (age). Detection of VNN-associated viruses in water samples demonstrated evidence of horizontal transmission of the disease. All the nucleotide sequences found in this study had high nucleotide identities of 88% to 100% to each other, striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV), and the reassortant strain red-spotted grouper NNV/SJNNV (RGNNV/SJNNV) isolate 430.2004 (GenBank accession number JN189932.1) (n=26). The phylogenetic analysis showed that quasispecies was present in each VNN-causing virus-positive sample, which differed based on the type of sample and life stage.
   Conclusion: This study was the first to confirm the existence of a reassortant strain (RGNNV/SJNNV) in hybrid groupers from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. However. the association between the mode of transmission and the risk factors of this virus needs to be investigated further to understand the evolution and potential new host species of the reassortant strain.

AB  - Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a water soluble antioxidant present in many Lamiaceae species at varying levels, including spearmint (Mentha spicata L). Two proprietary spearmint clonal lines, KI110 and KI42, with elevated levels of RA (designated Hi-RA) are currently being grown in Indiana for the commercial extraction of RA. The two Hi-RA clonal lines were selected from a native spearmint genetic background and are distinct in their phytochemical composition relative to native spearmint that is commercially grown for purposes of extraction of volatile oils for flavoring applications ("commercial spearmint"). The aim of this study was to describe the major compositional chemotypic differences between the proprietary Hi-RA native spearmint clonal lines relative to a commercial native clonal line of spearmint grown in Indiana. Leaf tissue samples of KI110, KI42 and the commercial spearmint clonal line were collected from field locations in Indiana during June 2013 for RA quantitation and chemical profiling of the essential oil fraction. RA levels in KI110 and KI42 were significantly higher than the commercial spearmint samples. GC-MS analysis revealed major compositional differences between the Hi-RA and commercial spearmint oils. Carvone was the dominant molecule in the commercial spearmint oil, constituting 54% of its oil content. In contrast carvone was below the detection levels in the oils of the two Hi-RA clonal lines, KI110 and KI42. Limonene, another notable constituent of commercial spearmint, was found in lower amounts in the Hi-RA mint clonal lines. Mint lactone and alpha-cubebene, the predominant compounds in the oil fractions of Hi-RA clonal lines KI110 and KI42, respectively, were either absent or present in insignificant amounts in the commercial spearmint. Differential amounts of myrcene and 1,8-cineole were observed in the three mint oil samples. The chemical fingerprints of the Hi-RA spearmint clonal lines clearly differentiate them from commercial spearmint and they should therefore be considered distinct, clonal lines of spearmint (M. spicata) with potential heath-promotive properties associated with KI110 and KI42 plant extracts that contain higher level of rosmarinic acid.

AB  - Due to their expected higher resilience following disturbances and adaptive potential to new climatic conditions, interest in uneven-aged mixed forests has increased in recent years. It is, however, unclear how to best quantify their site-specific growth potential, particularly at a time when there is a pressing need to consider the effects of a changing climate on tree and forest growth. Here, we address these topics using growth models for Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst.) and Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), based on long-term observations from uneven-aged mixed forests in southwestern Germany.
   We used a linear mixed-effects framework for modeling basal area increment of individual trees. We accounted for site quality using a phytocentric index based on the past growth of dominant trees (growth index) and three classes of geocentric environmental descriptors: physiographic, edaphic and climatic (temperature means and precipitation sums aggregated over 5, 15 or 30 years). For a subset of the data where it was possible to determine site index, growth index proved to be better predictor of tree increment than site index. When considering the entire dataset, climate variables had the single largest positive impact on model fit, yet cross-validation results suggested that no improvement in predictive ability occurred unless physiographic variables were also added. Higher levels of spring and growing season precipitation stimulated growth for Norway spruce and Silver fir, respectively. Temperature-growth relationships were predominantly positive for Silver fir and negative for Norway spruce. Aggregating climate variables over progressively longer time spans clearly reduced model fit for Norway spruce, yet a similar pattern was not apparent for Silver fir.
   Our results indicate that without rigorous testing, tried-and-trusted decision tools developed for even aged, single-species stands cannot be transferred to uneven-aged mixed forests. Precipitation- and temperature-based variables provide dynamic proxies which may allow us to better grasp the complexity of climate-growth relationships. This understanding is essential for reducing the uncertainty around predictions of climate change impacts on forest ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. The deep-sea hydrothermal vent is one of the most 'extreme' environments in the marine realm. Few species are capable of inhabiting such ecosystems, despite extremely high productivity there supported by microbial chemosynthesis, leading to high biomass and low species richness. Although gastropod molluscs are one of the main constituents of megafaunal communities at vent ecosystems, most species belong to several typical families (e.g., Provannidae, Peltospiridae, Lepetodrilidae) specialised and adapted to life at vents.
   Methods. During recent surveys of Okinawa Trough hydrothermal vent systems, two snails atypical of vent ecosystems were unexpectedly found in newly discovered hydrothermally influenced areas. Shell and radular characteristics were used to identify the gastropods morphologically.
   Results. One species was a vetigastropod, the calliostomatid Tristichotrochus ikukoae (Sakurai, 1994); and the other was a caenogastropod, the muricid Abyssotrophon soyoae (Okutani, 1959). Both gastropods were previously only known from regular non-chemosynthetic deep-sea and very rare - only two definitive published records exist for T. ikukoae and three for A. soyoae. The radula formula of Tristichotrochus ikukoae is accurately reported for the first time and based on that it is returned to genus Otukaia. For both species, barcode sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene were obtained and deposited for future references.
   Discussion. These new records represent the second record of calliostomatids from vents (third from chemosynthetic ecosystems) and the third record of muricids from vents (tenth from chemosynthetic ecosystems), and extend the distribution of both species to the southwest. Neither family has been recorded at chemosynthetic ecosystems in the western Pacific. Both were from weakly diffuse flow areas not subject to high temperature venting but were nevertheless associated with typical vent-reliant taxa such as Lamellibrachia tubeworms and Bathymodiolus mussels. These new records show that these species are capable of tolerating environmental stress associated with weak hydrothermally influenced areas, despite not being vent endemic species, adding to the list of known vent/non-vent species intersections. This signifies that such weakly influenced areas may provide key habitats for them, and that such areas may play a role in the evolution of biological adaptations to 'extreme' chemosynthetic ecosystems.

AB  - The changing view of planets orbiting low mass stars, M stars, as potentially hospitable worlds for life and its remote detection was motivated by several factors, including the demonstration of viable atmospheres and oceans on tidally locked planets, normal incidence of dust disks, including debris disks, detection of planets with masses in the 5-20 M-circle plus range, and predictions of unusually strong spectral biosignatures. We present a critical discussion of M star properties that are relevant for the long- and short-term thermal, dynamical, geological, and environmental stability of conventional liquid water habitable zone (HZ) M star planets, and the advantages and disadvantages of M stars as targets in searches for terrestrial HZ planets using various detection techniques. Biological viability seems supported by unmatched very long-term stability conferred by tidal locking, small HZ size, an apparent shortfall of gas giant planet perturbers, immunity to large astrosphere compressions, and several other factors, assuming incidence and evolutionary rate of life benefit from lack of variability. Tectonic regulation of climate and dynamo generation of a protective magnetic field, especially for a planet in synchronous rotation, are important unresolved questions that must await improved geodynamic models, though they both probably impose constraints on the planet mass. M star HZ terrestrial planets must survive a number of early trials in order to enjoy their many Gyr of stability. Their formation may be jeopardized by an insufficient initial disk supply of solids, resulting in the formation of objects too small and/or dry for habitability. The small empirical gas giant fraction for M stars reduces the risk of formation suppression or orbit disruption from either migrating or nonmigrating giant planets, but effects of perturbations from lower mass planets in these systems are uncertain. During the first similar to 1 Gyr, atmospheric retention is at peril because of intense and frequent stellar flares and sporadic energetic particle events, and impact erosion, both enhanced, the former dramatically, for M star HZ semimajor axes. Loss of atmosphere by interactions with energetic particles is likely unless the planetary magnetic moment is sufficiently large. For the smallest stellar masses a period of high planetary surface temperature, while the parent star approaches the main sequence, must be endured. The formation and retention of a thick atmosphere and a strong magnetic field as buffers for a sufficiently massive planet emerge as prerequisites for an M star planet to enter a long period of stability with its habitability intact. However, the star will then be subjected to short-term fluctuations with consequences including frequent unpredictable variation in atmospheric chemistry and surficial radiation field. After a review of evidence concerning disks and planets associated with M stars, we evaluate M stars as targets for future HZ planet search programs. Strong advantages of M stars for most approaches to HZ detection are offset by their faintness, leading to severe constraints due to accessible sample size, stellar crowding (transits), or angular size of the HZ (direct imaging). Gravitational lensing is unlikely to detect HZ M star planets because the HZ size decreases with mass faster than the Einstein ring size to which the method is sensitive.
   M star Earth-twin planets are predicted to exhibit surprisingly strong bands of nitrous oxide, methyl chloride, and methane, and work on signatures for other climate categories issummarized. The rest of the paper is devoted to an examination of evidence and implications of the unusual radiation and particle environments for atmospheric chemistry and surface radiation doses, and is summarized in the Synopsis. We conclude that attempts at remote sensing of biosignatures and nonbiological markers from M star planets are important, not as tests of any quantitative theories or rational arguments, but instead because they offer an inspection of the residues from a Gyr-long biochemistry experiment in the presence of extreme environmental fluctuations. A detection or repeated nondetections could provide a unique opportunity to partially answer a fundamental and recurrent question about the relation between stability and complexity, one that is not addressed by remote detection from a planet orbiting a solar-like star, and can only be studied on Earth using restricted microbial systems in serial evolution experiments or in artificial life simulations. This proposal requires a planet that has retained its atmosphere and a water supply. The discussion given here suggests that observations of M star exoplanets can decide this latter question with only slight modifications to plans already in place for direct imaging terrestrial exoplanet missions.

AB  - The biocatalytic production of rare carbohydrates from available sugar sources rapidly gains interest as a route to acquire industrial amounts of rare sugars for food and fine chemical applications. Here we present a multi-objective optimization procedure for a simulated moving bed (SMB) process for the production of the rare sugar D-psicose from enzymatically produced mixtures with its epimer D-fructose. First, model parameters were determined using the inverse method and experimentally validated on a 2-2-2-2 lab-scale SMB plant. The obtained experimental purities (PUs) were in excellent agreement with the simulated data derived from a transport-dispersive true-moving bed model demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed design. In the second part the performance of the separation was investigated in a multi-objective optimization study addressing the cost-contributing performance parameters productivity (PR) and desorbent requirement (DR) as a function of temperature. While rare sugar SMB operation under conditions of low desorbent consumption was found to be widely unaffected by temperature, SMB operation focusing on increased PR significantly benefited from high temperatures, with possible productivities increasing from 3.4 kg (L day)(-1) at 20 degrees C to 5 kg(Lday)(-1) at 70 degrees C, indicating that decreased selectivity at higher temperatures could be fully compensated for by the higher mass transfer rates, as they translate into reduced switch times and hence higher PR. A DR/PR Pareto optimization suggested a similar but even more pronounced trend also under relaxed PU requirements, with the PR increasing from 4.3 kg (L day)(-1) to a maximum of 7.8 kg (L day)(-1) for SMB operation at 50 degrees C when the PU of the non-product stream was reduced from 99.5% to 90%. Based on the in silico optimization results experimental SMB runs were performed yielding considerable PRs of 1.9 (30 degrees C), 2.4 (50 degrees C) and 2.6 kg (L day)(-1) (70 degrees C) with rather low DR (27 L per kg of rare sugar produced) on a lab-scale SMB installation.

AB  - To determine the characteristic of carbonaceous species in atmospheric particles in Hong Kong, PM10 and PM2.5, samples were collected using high volume (hi-vol.) air samplers from November 2000 to February 2001. The organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were analyzed by the selective thermal manganese dioxide oxidation (TMO) method. The ratios of PM2.5/PM10 mass ratios were 0.61, 0.78 and 0.53 for particulate matter collected at PolyU station (PolyU, near a major traffic corridor), Kwun Tong station (KT, mixed residential/commercial/industrial) and the Hok Tsui background station (HT), respectively. These results indicate that the PM2.5 concentrations constitute the majority of the PM10 concentrations, especially in urban and industrial areas of Hong Kong. The average concentrations at the three sites ranged from 73.11 to 83.52 mug/m(3) for PM10 and from 42.37 to 57.38 mug/m(3) for PM2.5. The highest daily mass concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 were 125.89 mug/m(3) and 116.89 mug/m(3) at KT, respectively. The correlation between PM10 and PM2.5 was high at KT and HT (r > 0.9, P < 0.01). This means that the sources of PM10 and PM2.5 may be the same at both sites. The highest mean concentration of OC (12.02 mug/ m(3)) and EC (6.86 mug/m(3)) in PM10 was found at the PolyU among the three sites. For PM2.5, the highest mean concentration of OC (10.16 mug/m(3)) was at KT while the highest mean concentration of EC (7.95 mug/m(3)) was at PolyU. However, the background concentrations at HT were higher than another background area, Kosan, Korea. Transportation of pollutants from the Asian continent may be responsible for the elevations of EC + OC at the remote site. More than 74% of the EC and more than 79% of the OC were found in the PK2.5 fraction at the three sampling locations. At PolyU station, PM2.5 consisted of 18.18% OC and 11.16% EC while 17.70% OC and 8.81% EC were found in KT station. Thus OC and EC are major constituents of aerosols in Hong Kong. OC/EC ratios for PM10 and PM, 5 were less than 2 at PolyU and KT stations while the ratio exceeded 3 at HT background station. This indicates that OC measured in the urban area may be emitted directly as a primary aerosol. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Glyphosate-based formulations are the most commonly used herbicides worldwide with the risk of potential contamination of aquatic bodies. The present study assessed the response of four marine crustaceans to three different brands of herbicides Roundup (R) Platinum, Efesto (R) and Taifun (R) MK CL.T, under two selected temperatures of 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The harpacticoid copepod Tigriopus fulvus, the anostracan Artemia franciscana, the amphipod Corophium insidiosum and the isopod Sphaeroma serratum were chosen as testing organisms. Effects of herbicides and temperatures were assessed by estimating lethal concentrations. The results showed that the high temperature rises the toxicity of glyphosate with an increase of mortality of all the tested species. This is an important aspect for future risk assessments of pesticides under global climate change scenarios. Efesto (R) resulted the most toxic brand, showing C. insidiosum the most sensitive with 96 h-LC50 values of 3.25 mg/L acid equivalent (a.e.) at 30 degrees C and 7.94 mg/L a.e. at 20 degrees C followed by T. fulvus while A. franciscana and S. serratum were the less sensitive. This study provides important information for assessing the toxic effects of three different brands of glyphosate-based herbicides on non-target marine organisms suggesting that they should be carefully managed to minimize any negative impact on marine organisms.

AB  - Aeromonas hydrophila is an opportunistic pathogen of a variety of aquatic animals that displays extreme diversity in drug resistance, phenotypes, virulence genes, and virulence. In this study, eight pathogenic A. hydrophila strains were isolated from diseased Amur sturgeons and investigated for their sensitivity to select antibiotics, their phenotype, virulence genes, and virulence. According to the phylogenetic analysis of the DNA gyrase subunit B protein, the eight isolates formed a single branch in the A. hydrophila group. The antibiotics ceftazidime, cefuroxime, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime appeared effective against them. All of the isolates possessed the virulence genes for aerolysin, flagellin, heat-stable cytotonic enterotoxin, heat-labile cytotonic enterotoxin, hemolysin, and elastase, while only one isolate, HZ8, possessed the gene for lateral flagella. The cytolytic enterotoxin and lipase genes were present in all isolates, except in ZJ10 and ZJ12. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence PCR indicated that the eight A. hydrophila isolates could be divided into four types. Isolates YW2, TR3, HZ8 and ZJ10, each representing a different type, were selected for challenge experiments. The challenge tests revealed that isolate HZ8 had the lowest lethal dose, causing 50% mortality at 2.30 x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu)/ml. The isolate ZJ10 had the highest LD50, 1.25 x 10(6) cfu/ml. Knowledge of the characteristics of the A. hydrophila isolates obtained from Amur sturgeon will be beneficial in developing potential disease control strategies.

AB  - Aims Green roofs are important novel urban ecosystems, but their shallow substrates can create plant water deficits in dry climates. Physiological approaches can improve green roof plant selection, and shrubs with high drought tolerance and conservative water use under water-deficit should perform well. The water potential at turgor loss point (psi(tlp)) has been used to predict drought resistance. Therefore we aimed to determine whether psi(tlp) could be used as a screening tool to assess drought resistance for green roof plant selection. Methods We evaluated 20 shrub species, originating from ecosystems varying in water availability, quantified by heat moisture index (HMI) and mean annual precipitation. We conducted a water-deficit experiment to measure psi(tlp), the degree of iso-anisohydry (o psi(MD)) and water use (ET) in response to drought. Results Shrubs with lower psi(tlp) were more anisohydric (greater o psi(MD)) and had a more conservative water use (lower ET). However, psi(tlp), Delta psi(MD) and ET were not related to HMI. Conclusions These results suggest that psi(tlp) could be used to select shrubs for green roofs, as species with lower psi(tlp) tended to be more drought tolerant, more anisohydric and used less water under water-deficit. However, species with higher psi(tlp) could also potentially survive through drought avoidance.

KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - Three small-pore, eight-membered ring (8-MR) zeolites of different cage-based topology (CHA, AEI, RTH), in their proton-and copper-exchanged forms, were first exposed to high temperature hydrothermal aging treatments (1073 K, 16 h, 10% (v/v) H2O) and then to reaction conditions for low temperature (473 K) standard selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with ammonia, in order to study the effect of zeolite topology on the structural and kinetic changes that occur to Cu-zeolites used in NOx abatement. UV-visible spectra were collected to monitor changes to Cu structure and showed that band intensities for isolated, hydrated Cu2+ cations (similar to 12500 cm(-1)) remain constant after hydrothermal aging, but decrease in intensity upon subsequent exposure to low temperature SCR reaction conditions. Standard SCR rates (per Cu, 473 K), activation energies, and reaction orders are similar between Cu-AEI and Cu-CHA zeolites before and after hydrothermal aging, although rates are lower after hydrothermal aging as expected from the decreases in intensity of UV-visible bands for Cu2+ active sites. For Cu-RTH, rates are lower (by 2-3x) and apparent activation energies are lower (by similar to 2x) than for Cu-AEI or Cu-CHA. These findings suggest that the RTH framework imposes internal transport restrictions, effectively functioning as a one-dimensional framework during SCR catalysis. Hydrothermal aging of Cu-RTH results in complete deactivation and undetectable SCR rates, despite X-ray diffraction patterns and Ar micropore volumes (87 K) that remain unchanged after hydrothermal aging treatments and subsequent SCR exposure. These findings highlight some of the differences in low temperature SCR behavior among small-pore Cu-zeolites of different topology, and the beneficial properties conferred by double six-membered ring (D6R) composite building units. They demonstrate that deleterious structural changes to Cu sites occur after exposure to hydrothermal aging conditions and SCR reactants at low temperatures, likely reflecting the formation of inactive copper-aluminate domains. Therefore, the viability of Cu-zeolites for practical low temperature NOx SCR catalysis cannot be inferred solely from assessments of framework structural integrity after hydrothermal aging treatments, but also require Cu active site and kinetic characterization after hydrothermally aged zeolites are exposed to low temperature SCR reaction conditions.

AB  - As has been shown for other ecosystems, the ecological and socio-economic impacts of climate change on Mediterranean intertidal habitats are highly variable in space and time. We conducted field and laboratory measurements of cellular, ecophysiological and behavioural responses of selected intertidal invertebrates (mussels, gastropods and sponges) and completed a literature review to determine what is known of socio-economic consequences of these biological changes. Results suggest significant gaps in our knowledge that may impede a complete understanding of likely impacts (physical, biological and socio-economic) and that sufficient data for such an analysis are available only for mussels. Application of ecological models for native mussels Mytilaster minimus and invasive Brachidontes pharaonis bivalves indicates that the current distribution of these species is linked to the availability of food and local temperature. Choosing Israel as a case study, the study focused on the identification of ecosystem services and goods provided by the Mediterranean rocky intertidal and on the assessment of conservation approaches. Intertidal systems were poorly represented in the socio-economic literature, and there was low awareness of the value of these ecosystems among stakeholders. Subsequently, conservation efforts for intertidal communities were minimal. While climate change will very likely continue to impact these systems, our predictive capacity for the extent and locations of such impacts, and of any derived socio-economic consequences, remains limited.

AB  - Locations by radiotelemetry during eight 24-h sampling periods in 1991, 1992, and 1993 were used to evaluate the diel activity patterns of adult brook charr Salvelinus fontinalis in two lakes of the Laurentian Shield (Quebec, Canada). Based on the minimum distance travelled between two consecutive locations, adult brook charr were more active at dusk and at night than during the day. During daylight periods, individual fish displayed strong site selection, remaining in the same area along the shore from day to day. The fish left their inshore position at dusk, were highly mobile during the night, and returned to their focal point at sunrise, exhibiting diel homing behaviour. These results are supported by an increase in gillnet captures of adult brook charr in Lac Melchior at night. Data obtained by gillnet fishing in lakes Bondi and Simpson shelved that juvenile (1+) brook charr were active throughout the diel cycle and that young-of-the-year were active mainly during the day, suggesting that there is an ontogenetic change in the diel activity of brook charr. Despite its limitations (restrictions on the number and size of tracked individuals, post-manipulation mortality, lifetime of transmitter battery), radiotelemetry allows for collection of multiple behavioural observations (distances travelled, instantaneous activity, site selection and homing) during the activity cycle of individual fish, and thus provides a finer degree of spatial resolution than alternative methods such as gillnetting.

AB  - The Diurnal Temperature Range (DTR) profoundly affects human health, agriculture, eco-system, and socioeconomic systems. In this study, we analyzed past and future changes in DTR using gridded Climate Research Unit (CRU) datasets for the years 1950-2020 and an ensemble means of thirteen bias-corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5) scenarios for the rest of the 21st century over the southern slope of Central Himalaya, Nepal. Furthermore, the potential drivers (precipitation and cloud cover) of seasonal and annual DTR were studied using correlation analysis. This study found that the DTR trends generally declined; the highest decrease was observed in the pre-monsoon and winter at a rate of 0.09 degrees C/decade (p <= 0.01). As expected, DTR demonstrated a significant negative correlation with cloudiness and precipitation in all four seasons. Further, the decreased DTR was weakly related to the Sea Surface Temperature variation (SST) in the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. We found that the projected DTR changes in the future varied from a marginal increase under the SSP1-2.6 (only pre-monsoon) scenario to continued significant decreases under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5. Insights based on retrospective and prospective evaluation help to understand the long-term evolution of diurnal temperature variations.

AB  - The opossum shrimp Mysis diluviana (formerly M relicta) performs large amplitude diel vertical migrations in Lake Ontario and its nighttime distribution is influenced by temperature, light and the distribution of its predators and prey. At one location in southeastern Lake Ontario, we measured the vertical distribution of mysids, mysid predators (i.e. planktivorous fishes) and mysid prey (i.e. zooplankton), in addition to light and temperature, on 8 occasions from May to September, 2004 and 2005. We use these data to test 3 different predictive models of mysid habitat selection, based on: (1) laboratory-derived responses of mysids to different light and temperature gradients in the absence of predator or prey cues; (2) growth rate of mysids, as estimated with a mysid bioenergetics model, given known prey densities and temperatures at different depths in the water column; (3) ratio of growth rates (g) and mortality risk (mu) associated with the distribution of predatory fishes. The model based on light and temperature preferences was a better predictor of mysid vertical distribution than the models based on growth rate and g:mu on all 8 occasions. Although mysid temperature and light preferences probably evolved as mechanisms to reduce predation while increasing foraging intake, the response to temperature and light alone predicts mysid vertical distribution across seasons in Lake Ontario.

AB  - Salinity is one of the key factors that affects metabolism, survival and distribution of fish species, as all fish osmoregulate and euryhaline fish maintain osmotic differences between their extracellular fluid and either freshwater or seawater. The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a euryhaline species with populations in both marine and freshwater environments, where the physiological and genomic basis for salinity tolerance adaptation is not fully understood. Therefore, our main objective in this study was to investigate gene expression of three targeted osmoregulatory genes (Na+/K+-ATPase (ATPA13), cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) and a voltage gated potassium channel gene (KCNH4) and one stress related heat shock protein gene (HSP70)) in gill tissue from marine and freshwater populations when exposed to non-native salinity for periods ranging from five minutes to three weeks. Overall, the targeted genes showed highly plastic expression profiles, in addition the expression of ATP1A3 was slightly higher in saltwater adapted fish and KCNH4 and HSP70 had slightly higher expression in freshwater. As no pronounced changes were observed in the expression profiles of the targeted genes, this indicates that the osmoregulatory apparatuses of both the marine and landlocked freshwater stickleback population have not been environmentally canalized, but are able to respond plastically to abrupt salinity challenges.

AB  - The Qaidam Basin on the northern Tibetan Plateau, China, is one of the driest deserts at high elevations, and it has been considered a representative Mars analogue site. Despite recent advances in the diversity of microbial communities in the Qaidam Basin, our understanding of their genomic information, functional potential and adaptive strategies remains very limited. Here, we conducted a combination of physicochemical and metagenomic analyses to investigate the taxonomic composition and adaptive strategies of microbial life in the regolith across the Qaidam Basin. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene-based and metagenomic analyses both reveal that microbial communities in the Qaidam Basin are dominated by the bacterial phylum Actinobacteria. The low levels of moisture and organic carbon contents appear to have essential constraints on microbial biomass and diversity. A total of 50 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes were reconstructed and analysed. Our results reveal the potential of microorganisms to use ambient trace gases to meet energy and carbon needs in this nutrient-limited desert. Furthermore, we find that DNA repair mechanisms and protein protection are likely essential for microbial life in response to stressors of hyperaridity, intense ultraviolet radiation and tremendous temperature fluctuations in this Mars analogue. These findings shed light on the diversity and survival strategies of microbial life inhabiting Mar-like environments, which provide implications for potential life on early Mars.

AB  - Flatfish species are an important target for fisheries. During their juvenile stage they concentrate in coastal nursery areas. Food conditions in these areas are an important factor determining habitat quality and ultimate survival. Recently, growth reduction in summer has been observed in plaice, Pleuronectes platessa, feeding on both epibenthic and benthic prey. In the current study, we test the hypothesis that summer growth reduction is a consequence of a reduced availability of benthic prey by analysing summer growth in a fully benthic feeding flatfish, juvenile sole (Solea solea). Summer growth was studied for contrasting years with respect to preceding winter water temperature conditions to exclude possible irreversible non-genetic adaptations of growth to water temperature. Individual growth, estimated from otolith daily rings, was compared with predictions of maximum growth at the prevailing temperature. In line with expectations, 0-group sole showed strong summer growth reduction, supporting the notion that summer growth reduction is related to feeding modes. Summer growth reduction underlines the importance of a good definition of how and over what time period growth as indicator of habitat quality is estimated and compared.

AB  - Abiotic stresses adversely affect cellular homeostasis, impairing overall growth and development of plants. These initial stress signals activate downstream signalling processes, which, subsequently, activate stress-responsive mechanisms to re-establish homeostasis. Dehydrins (DHNs) play an important role in combating dehydration stress. Rice (Oryza sativa L.), which is a paddy crop, is susceptible to drought stress. As drought survival in rice might be viewed as a trait with strong evolutionary selection pressure, we observed DHNs in the light of domestication during the course of evolution. Overall, 65 DHNs were identified by a genome-wide survey of 11 rice species, and 3 DHNs were found to be highly conserved. The correlation of a conserved pattern of DHNs with domestication and diversification of wild to cultivated rice was validated by synonymous substitution rates, indicating that Oryza rufipogon and Oryza sativa ssp. japonica follow an adaptive evolutionary pattern; whereas Oryza nivara and Oryza sativa ssp. indica demonstrate a conserved evolutionary pattern. A comprehensive analysis of tissue-specific expression of DHN genes in japonica and their expression profiles in normal and PEG (poly ethylene glycol)-induced dehydration stress exhibited a spatiotemporal expression pattern. Their interaction network reflects the cross-talk between gene expression and the physiological processes mediating adaptation to dehydration stress. The results obtained strongly indicated the importance of DHNs, as they are conserved during the course of domestication.

AB  - Anthropogenically induced global climate change has profound implications for marine ecosystems and the economic and social systems that depend upon them. The relationship between temperature and individual performance is reasonably well understood, and much climate-related research has focused on potential shifts in distribution and abundance driven directly by temperature. However, recent work has revealed that both abiotic changes and biological responses in the ocean will be substantially more complex. For example, changes in ocean chemistry may be more important than changes in temperature for the performance and survival of many organisms. Ocean circulation, which drives larval transport, will also change, with important consequences for population dynamics. Furthermore, climatic impacts on one or a few 'leverage species' may result in sweeping community-level changes. Finally, synergistic effects between climate and other anthropogenic variables, particularly fishing pressure, will likely exacerbate climate-induced changes. Efforts to manage and conserve living marine systems in the face of climate change will require improvements to the existing predictive framework. Key directions for future research include identifying key demographic transitions that influence population dynamics, predicting changes in the community-level impacts of ecologically dominant species, incorporating populations' ability to evolve (adapt), and understanding the scales over which climate will change and living systems will respond.

AB  - At two experiments, infective stage juveniles of three heterorhabditid nematode isolates and Steinernema riobravis were placed in sterilized sandy soil in sealed containers buried in corn field during summer. Containers were removed daily for 10 consequent days and surviving juveniles were recovered from the soil by Baermann funnel method, then the remainder of soil was subjected to Spodoptera littoralis-baiting technique. Apparently, the low level of soil moisture (3%) and ceiling temperature levels (up to 42 degrees C) as well as faint electric conductivity (0.48 mmhos/cm) of the soil containing the nematodes resulted in a rapid decline in the number of nematodes recoverable from the soil over time by Baermann method, The percentage of recovery for the nematode isolates EAM8, EIS7 and EAS59 by the Baermann funnel was 35.6%, 43.9% and 20.5% for the total nematodes recovered in the first trial, respectively. The nematode numbers increased when the recovery time extended from 24 to 48 h at 23 degrees C. Insignificant differences were found between nematode numbers recovered daily in both trials. The average number of the recovered S. riobravis was more (P less than or equal to 0.05) than that of any other nematode isolate, Nematodes which were not recoverable by Baermann technique were infective when bioassayed over the period of the two experiments, The infective juveniles which survived the stressed conditions are recommended to be subcultured through selection regime in order to obtain an improved nematode strain.

AB  - Upon application of a sufficiently strong electric field, electrons break away from thermal equilibrium and approach relativistic speeds. These highly energetic 'runaway' electrons (similar to MeV) play a significant role in tokamak disruption physics, and therefore their accurate understanding is essential to develop reliable mitigation strategies. For this purpose, we have developed a fully implicit solver for the 0D-2P (i.e., including two momenta coordinates) relativistic nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation (rFP). As in earlier implicit rFP studies (NORSE, CQL3D), electron-ion interactions are modeled using the Lorentz operator, and synchrotron damping using the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac reaction term. However, our implementation improves on these earlier studies by (1) ensuring exact conservation properties for electron collisions, (2) strictly preserving positivity, and (3) being scalable algorithmically and in parallel. Key to our proposed approach is an efficient multigrid preconditioner for the linearized rFP equation, a multigrid elliptic solver for the Braams-Karney potentials (Braams and Karney, 1987), and a novel adaptive technique to determine the associated boundary values. We verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme with numerical results ranging from small electric-field electrical conductivity measurements to the accurate reproduction of runaway tail dynamics when strong electric fields are applied.

AB  - The late Eocene - early Miocene Alpine-Carpathian fold-and-thrust belt (FTB) lies in the transition between the Eastern Alps and the Western Carpathians, SE of the Bohemian crystalline massif. Our study shows the involvement of crystalline basement from the former European Jurassic continental margin in two distinct events. A first extensional event coeval with Eggerian-Karpatian (c. 28-16 Ma) thin-skinned thrusting reactivated the rift basement fault array and resulted from the large degree of lower plate bending promoted by high lateral gradients of lithospheric strength and slab pull forces. Slab break-off during the final stages of collision around Karpatian times (c. 17-16 Ma) promoted large-wavelength uplift and an excessive topographic load. This load was reduced by broadening the orogenic wedge through the reactivation of the lower-plate deep detachment beneath and ahead of the thin-skinned thrust front (with the accompanying positive inversion of the basement fault array) and ultimately, by the collapse of the hinterland summits, enhanced by transtensional faulting. Although this work specifically deals with the involvement of the basement in the Alpine-Carpathian Junction, the main conclusions are of general interest to the understanding of orogenic systems.

AB  - Acceptance of the theory of plate tectonics was accompanied by the rise of the mantle plume/hotspot concept which has come to dominate geodynamics from its use both as an explanation for the origin of intraplate volcanism and as a reference frame for plate motions. However, even with a large degree of flexibility permitted in plume composition, temperature, size, and depth of origin, adoption of any limited number of hotspots means the plume model cannot account for all occurrences of the type of volcanism it was devised to explain. While scientific protocol would normally demand that an alternative explanation be sought, there have been few challenges to "plume theory" on account of a series of intricate controls set up by the plume model which makes plumes seem to be an essential feature of the Earth. The hotspot frame acts not only as a reference but also controls plate tectonics. Accommodating plumes relegates mantle convection to a weak, sluggish effect such that basal drag appears as a minor, resisting force, with plates having to move themselves by boundary forces and continents having to be rifted by plumes. Correspondingly, the geochemical evolution of the mantle is controlled by the requirement to isolate subducted crust into plume sources which limits potential buffers on the composition of the MORE-source to plume- or lower mantle material. Crustal growth and Precambrian tectonics are controlled by interpretations of greenstone belts as oceanic plateaus generated by plumes. Challenges to any aspect of the plume model are thus liable to be dismissed unless a counter explanation is offered across the geodynamic spectrum influenced by "plume theory". Nonetheless, an alternative synthesis can be made based on longstanding petrological evidence for derivation of intraplate volcanism from volatile-bearing sources (wetspots) in conjunction with concepts dismissed for being incompatible or superfluous to "plume theory". In the alternative Earth, the sources for intraplate volcanism evolve from the source residues of are volcanism located along sutures in the continental mantle. Continental rifting and the lateral distribution of intraplate sources in the asthenosphere are controlled by Earth rotation. Shear induced on the base of the asthenosphere from the mesosphere as the Earth rotates is transmitted to the lithosphere as basal drag. Attenuation of the drag due to the low viscosity of the asthenosphere, in conjunction with plate motions from boundary forces, results in a rotation differential of up to 5 cm yr(-1) between the lithosphere and mesosphere manifest as westward plate lag/eastward mantle flow. Continental rifting results from basal drag supplemented by local convection induced by lithospheric architecture. Large continental igneous provinces are generated by convective melting, with passive margin volcanic sequences following the axis of rifting and flood basalts overlying the intersection of sutures in the continental mantle. As rifting progresses, the convection cells expand, cycling continental mantle from sutures perpendicular to the rift axis to generate intraplate tracks in the ocean basin. Continental mantle not melted on rifting, or delaminated on continental collision, becomes displaced to the east of the continent by differential rotation, which also sets up a means for tapping the material to give fixed melting anomalies.
   When plates move counter to the Earth's rotation, as in the example of the Pacific plate, asthenospheric flow is characterised by a counterflow regime with a zero velocity layer at depths within the stability field for volatile-bearing minerals. Intraplate volcanism results when melts are tapped from this stationary layer along lithospheric stress trajectories induced by stressing of the plate from variations in the subduction geometry around the margins of the plate. Plate boundary forces acting in the same direction as Earth rotation, as for the Nazca plate, produce fast plate velocities but not counterflow, though convergent margin geometry may still induce propagating fractures which set up melting anomalies. Lateral migration of asthenospheric domains allows the sources of Pacific intraplate volcanism to be traced back to continental mantle eroded during the breakup of Gondwana and the amalgamation of Asia in the Paleozoic. Intraplate volcanism in the South Pacific therefore has a common Gondwanan origin to intraplate volcanism in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, hence the DUPAL anomaly is entirely of shallow origin. Such domains constitute a second order geochemical heterogeneity superimposed on a streaky/marble-cake structure arising from remixing of subducted crust with the convecting mantle. During the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic, remixing of slabs has buffered the evolution of the depleted mantle to a rate of 2.2 epsilon Nd units Ga-1 with fractionation of Lu from I-if in the sediment component imparting the large range in Hf-176/Hf-177 relative to Nd-143/Nd-144 observed in MORE. Only the high epsilon Nd values of some Archean komatiites are compatible with derivation from unbuffered mantle. The existence of a very depleted reservoir is attributed to stabilisation of a large early continental crust through either obduction tectonics or slab melting regimes which reduced the efficiency of crustal recycling back into the mantle. Generation of komatiite is therefore a consequence of mantle composition, and is permitted in ocean ridge environments and/or under hydrous melting conditions. Correspondingly, as intraplate volcanism depends on survival of volatile-bearing sources, its appearance in the Middle Proterozoic corresponds to the time in the Earth's thermal evolution at which minerals such as phlogopite and amphibole could survive in off-ridge environments in the shallow asthenosphere. The geodynamic evolution of the Earth was thus determined at convergent margins, not by plumes and hotspots, with the decline in thermal regime causing both a reduction in size of crust and continental mantle roots, the latter becoming a source for intraplate volcanism while the crust was incorporated into the convecting mantle.

AB  - Dead benthic foraminiferal assemblages from the central western Portuguese continental shelf have been studied to identify the prevalent oceanographic processes in the study area. Sediment samples collected at 46 stations along transepts perpendicular to the coastal line, between the latitudes of 38-40 degrees N and 17-190 m water depth, in April/May 2008, were analysed for selected physicochemical parameters (temperature, redox potential), grain size, organic matter content, and benthic foraminifera. Statistical analysis identified two main groups of stations, the Inshore/Offshore groups, which are not only defined by their geographical positions, but easily distinguishable by different hydrodynamic conditions. The Offshore Group is mainly represented by deeper stations characterized by a higher percentage of fines and TOM, negative values of redox potential and by the higher foraminiferal density and species diversity than the Inshore one. Foraminiferal assemblages of the Offshore Group are dominated/represented by species (such as Cassidulina laevigata/Cassidulina carinata, Bolivina spathulata, Bolivina ordinaria, Globo-cassidulina minuta, Bulimina elongata/Bulimina gibba and Bulimina marginata) common in areas with significant concentrations of organic matter. The benthic foraminiferal assemblages of the Inshore Group are instead characterized by epifaunal species such as Lobatula lobatula, Cibicides ungerianus, Planorbulina mediterranensis, Gavelinopsis praegeri and Quinqueloculina seminula. Both the sedimentary and foraminiferal results suggest that this group of stations is subjected to stronger bottom hydrodynamic conditions, caused by waves and swell activity and coastal currents, than the Offshore Group. Bray-Curtis similarity comparison between the stations of both groups reveals that the Offshore Group has a higher internal similarity than the Inshore Group. These differences seem to stem from topographic forcing, from the presence of rocky outcrops, from canyons and capes, from the distribution of rivers and from the magnitude of their discharges, which determine specific hydrodynamic features and differences in the sedimentary deposits and biological productivity. The influence of the Tagus river (supply of fresh water, detritus and organic matter from continental sources), the presence of canyons and capes, which leave the most important imprint on the study area, are marked by changes in the foraminiferal assemblages both in the Inshore and Offshore groups.

AB  - This work discusses in detail the parameters involved in water balance. The analysis is performed by considering the current conditions and climate change in a climatic zone that represents the arid regions of Colombia: The municipality of Uribia (desert) in the state of La Guajira. For this purpose, some climatological stations, which by their reported values of temperature and precipitation can be considered representative of the arid or desert climatic zones according to the Lang's index (PCP/T-avg), were selected. Then. with historical temperature and precipitation values registered at the station of the area, the baseline was built and its behavior analyzed. The station data were obtained from the database of the Instituto de Hidrologia, Meteorologia y Estudios Ambientales (Institute of Hidrology. Meteorology and Environmental Studies) of Colombia. After estimating the baseline scenarios, the current water balance on the site was calculated by taking into account the original variables and including new parameters, if necessary, for the calculation of the simplified continuity equation. The analysis included parameters such as potential and actual evapotranspiration, moisture of soil, storage or recharge and their changes, water deficit and excess, runoff, periods of recharge, and water use. Anomalies in temperatures (degrees C) and precipitation were calculated by taking into account the new climate scenarios "representative concentration pathways" for different periods (short- and long-term). With the anomalies identified, the baseline for the above-mentioned variables was adjusted. Again, the associated parameters were analyzed and discussed in the context of water balance. In climate change scenarios, the water balance projects a prospective exacerbation of desert conditions in the Uribia-Guajira region. since a decrease in the Lang's index from its current value of 18.7 (desert) to 17.0 in 2050 and 14.5 in 2070 is expected. as a consequence of a decrease in precipitation (2.4 and 11.0%) and an increase in annual temperature of about 1.7 degrees C with the HadGEM2-ES model for the period 2041-2060 and 3.7 degrees C with the GFDL-CM3 model for the period 2061-2080. This can be verified by means of the Thornthwaite climate classification, which categorizes the area of study as an arid zone with limited and no excess of water. This deficit could lead to serious environmental consequences, social problems and a decline in the industrial and agricultural productivity of the zone.

AB  - Rear edge populations, those residing at the low-latitude margins of species ranges, represent a critical genetic diversity for species conservation, management, and evolutionary potential. The present study analyses climate-radial growth relations for Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra at their dry distribution limit in the Mediterranean basin. The study was conducted in native relict forests of the two species in SE Spain, analyzing radial growth variability and climate-growth relations over time and between different ecological conditions. The lack of strong precipitation signals found could be due to high tree density, appropriate microclimatic conditions and/or high local adaptation. However, previous September temperatures exerted a negative impact on radial growth at all sites, presumably as a result of a prolonged summer drought. By contrast, high temperatures during winter and spring boosted radial growth at most locations. Both the negative and positive effects of temperature have gained relevancy in the last decades and can determine future performance of these Mediterranean pinewoods. Besides common patterns, recorded site-specific signals in climate-growth relationships reveal the influence of different ecological conditions. In this respect, tree-growth variability increased at low elevation coupled with increasing aridity, indicating higher vulnerability to rapid climate changes at low elevations. In contrast, the lack of strong precipitation signals and positive effects of temperatures at high elevation, could buffer the impact of drought and favor the persistence of P. sylvestris and P. nigra rear edge populations.

AB  - Waste generation and management has emerged as one of the greatest challenges facing our environment in recent times. In this study, waste dumping sites in Uyo metropolis, Nigeria were selected to assess waste generation and management and their effects on outdoor air quality. Concentrations of gaseous pollutants such as CO, SO2, NO2, HCN, H2S, Cl, NH3 and suspended particulate matter (SPM), as well as heat, noise and radiation, were measured using in situ portable digital monitors. Concentrations of those pollutants varied with location, partly due to variation in the composition of waste dumped and partly due to predominant activities at each site. Results obtained from the study revealed that the concentration of NO2 was highest at SP5 (0.45 +/- 0.07), while the concentration of ammonia was highest at SP3 (13.3 +/- 0.71 ppm). Concentrations of SO2 at all the sampled locations varied between 0.15 +/- 0.07 ppm and 0.45 +/- 0.07 ppm. All the sites under study recorded high levels of CO, with a range of 13.5 +/- 0.71 to 27.0 +/- 1.41 ppm. Also, 16 of the 19 locations recorded high SO2 concentrations. These concentrations were higher than the 2007 US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for CO and SO2. The concentrations of HCN, Cl, H2S and SPM were far below their instruments' alarm level. Heat, radiation and noise values varied from one location to another. The concentrations of these pollutants increased as the quantity, duration and decomposition of waste materials dumped at each dump site also increased.

AB  - The effects of competition and climate on the growth of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP.) were examined using long term measurement data collected across the western Canadian boreal forest. Non-linear mixed effect models were developed and used to examine tree growth responses to competition and climate across the range of upland forest types where black spruce is found in this region including: spruce/fir, deciduous and pine forest types. Basal area of competitor trees larger than the subject tree, and at least one of the following climate variables: frost free period, mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature, were selected as predictors of diameter and height growth. Spruce/fir competition had a stronger negative effect on the growth of black spruce than pine competition. However, deciduous competition had a positive effect on diameter and height growth of black spruce. Growth was generally sensitive to changes in climate across the three forest types. Increases in temperature (except in pine forest stand) and reductions in precipitation (except in deciduous forest stand) lead to increases in diameter and height growth; however, our model also predicted that increasing temperature when pine stand densities are high will lead to a reduction in growth. These results indicated that forest types and competition will determine the impact of climate on the growth of black spruce trees. Climate sensitive growth functions developed for black spruce in this study will be useful in modeling and managing pure and mixed stands of black spruce across the western boreal forest.

AB  - Simulation experiments using the inSTREAM individual-based brown trout Salmo trutta population model explored the role of individual adaptive behaviour in food limitation, as an example of how behaviour can affect managers' understanding of conservation problems. The model includes many natural complexities in habitat (spatial and temporal variation in characteristics such as depth and velocity, temperature, hiding and feeding cover, drift-food supply and predation risk), fish physiology (especially, how food intake and growth vary with hydrodynamics, cover, fish size and temperature) and behaviour. When drift-food concentration was increased over a wide range in 7 year simulations, the simulated population was always food limited. In fact, as food supply increased, the population increased at an increasing rate and consumed a higher percentage of the food supply, apparently because higher food concentrations make more stream area energetically profitable for drift feeders. The behaviour most responsible for this response was activity selection: when food was abundant, fish chose to feed less frequently and more nocturnally, thereby reducing predation mortality so more fish survived longer. These results indicate that the traditional concept of food limitation, that food availability stops limiting population size when it exceeds some threshold level, may not be useful and can be misleading. Results also strongly contradict the concept that a salmonid population is not food limited if the total food supply is greater than the population's consumption. Explicit consideration of adaptive behaviour produced a novel but believable understanding of food effects on salmonid populations. Published 2011.

AB  - A co-occluded binary mixture of Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus genotypes HearSP1B and HearLB6 at a 1:1 ratio (HearSP1B+HearLB6) was selected for the development of a virus-based biological insecticide, which requires an efficient large-scale production system. In vivo production systems require optimization studies in each host-virus pathosystem. In the present study, the effects of larval instar, rearing density, timing of inoculation, inoculum concentration and temperature on the production of HearSP1B+HearLB6 in its homologous host were evaluated. The high prevalence of cannibalism in infected larvae (40-87%) indicated that insects require individual rearing to avoid major losses in OB production. The OB production of recently molted fifth instars (7.0 x 10(9) OBs/larva), combined with a high prevalence of mortality (85.7%), resulted in the highest overall OB yield (6.0 x 10(11) OBs/100 inoculated larvae), compared to those of third or fourth instars. However, as inoculum concentration did not influence final OB yield, the lowest concentration, LC80 (5.5 x 10(6) OBs/ml), was selected. Incubation temperature did not significantly influence OB yield, although larvae maintained at 30 degrees C died 13 and 34 hours earlier than those incubated at 26 degrees C and 23 degrees C, respectively. We conclude that the efficient production of HearSP1B+HearLB6 OBs involves inoculation of recently molted fifth instars with a LC80 concentration of OBs followed by individual rearing at 30 degrees C.

AB  - This article reassesses historical studies of Inuit metabolism in light of recent developments in evolutionary genetics. It discusses the possible selective advantage of a variant of CPT1a, which encodes the rate limiting enzyme in hepatic fatty acid oxidation. The L479 variant of CPT1a underwent one of the strongest known selective sweeps in human history and is specific to Inuit and Yu'pik populations. Recent hypotheses predict that this variant may have been selected in response to possible detrimental effects of chronic ketosis in communities with very low carbohydrate consumption. Assessing these hypotheses alongside several alternative explanations of the selective sweep, this article challenges the notion that the selection of L479 is linked to predicted detrimental effects of ketosis. Bringing together for the first time data from biochemical, metabolic, and physiological studies inside and outside the Inuit sphere, it aims to provide a broader interpretative framework and a more comprehensive way to understand the selective sweep. It suggests that L479 may have provided a selective advantage in glucose conservation as part of a metabolic adaptation to very low carbohydrate and high protein consumption, but not necessarily a ketogenic state, in an extremely cold environment. A high intake of n-3 fatty acids may be linked to selection through the mitigation of a detrimental effect of the mutation that arises in the fasted state. The implications of these conclusions for our broader understanding of very low carbohydrate metabolism, and for dietary recommendations for Inuit and non-Inuit populations, are discussed.

AB  - In this work, the supercritical carbon dioxide impregnation of low density polyethylene (LDPE) films with a mixture of two terpenic ketones (thymoquinone and R-(+)-pulegone) with biopesticide activity is investigated, as a strategy for developing a packaging material or delivery device for protecting seeds, kernels and derivatives during storage and transport. Impregnation runs were performed according to a fractional factorial experimental design in order to evaluate the effect of four process variables at two levels (pressure: 10-15 MPa; depressurization rate: 0.5-2.0 MPa/min; time: 2-4 h; initial ketone mole fraction: 0.0017-0.0025) on impregnation yield and selectivity between ketones. Operational temperature was constant for all experiments and equal to 45 degrees C. The impregnated films were analyzed by infrared spectroscpy (FTIR) in order to confirm the presence of both ketones and determine their relative ratio in the final product. ANOVA test of the results indicate that contact time and ketone concentration are the only factors with significant effects on impregnation yield (ranging between 2.25 and 5.59%), while no factor seems to affect significantly the loading selectivity, with thymoquinone/pulegone ratios in the final product between 0.39 and 0.99. The insecticidal activity of impregnated film samples was evaluated in fumigant assays against corn weevil (Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky), a major pest of stored kernels. The films showed a high activity level during the first 2 days (similar to 100% mortality), which gradually decreased until showing no toxicity after 7 days. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Hybrid zones are noteworthy systems for the study of environmental adaptation to fast-changing environments, as they constitute reservoirs of polymorphism and are key to the maintenance of biodiversity. They can move in relation to climate fluctuations, as temperature can affect both selection and migration, or remain trapped by environmental and physical barriers. There is therefore a very strong incentive to study the dynamics of hybrid zones subjected to climate variations. The infaunal bivalve Macoma balthica emerges as a noteworthy model species, as divergent lineages hybridize, and its native NE Atlantic range is currently contracting to the North. To investigate the dynamics and functioning of hybrid zones in M. balthica, we developed new molecular markers by sequencing the collective transcriptome of 30 individuals. Ten individuals were pooled for each of the three populations sampled at the margins of two hybrid zones. A single 454 run generated 277 Mb from which 17K SNPs were detected. SNP density averaged 1 polymorphic site every 14 to 19 bases, for mitochondrial and nuclear loci, respectively. An FST scan detected high genetic divergence among several hundred SNPs, some of them involved in energetic metabolism, cellular respiration and physiological stress. The high population differentiation, recorded for nuclear-encoded ATP synthase and NADH dehydrogenase as well as most mitochondrial loci, suggests cytonuclear genetic incompatibilities. Results from this study will help pave the way to a high-resolution study of hybrid zone dynamics in M. balthica, and the relative importance of endogenous and exogenous barriers to gene flow in this system.

AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main vector of multiple diseases, such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. Due to modifications in weather patterns, its geographical range is continuously evolving. Temperature is a key factor for its expansion into regions with cool winters, but rainfall can also have a strong impact on the colonization of these regions, since larvae emerging after a rainfall are likely to die at temperatures below 10 degrees C. As climate change is expected to affect rainfall regimes, with a higher frequency of heavy storms and an increase in drought-affected areas, it is important to understand how different rainfall scenarios may shape Ae. aegypti's range. We develop a model for the population dynamics of Ae. aegypti, coupled with a rainfall model to study the effect of the temporal distribution of rainfall on mosquito abundance. Using a fracturing process, we then investigate the effect of a higher variability in the daily rainfall. As an example, we show that rainfall distribution is necessary to explain the geographic range of Ae. aegypti in Taiwan, an island characterized by rainy winters in the north and dry winters in the south. We also predict that a higher variability in the rainfall time distribution will decrease the maximum abundance of Ae. aegypti during the summer. An increase in daily rainfall variability will likewise enhance its extinction probability. Finally, we obtain a nonlinear relationship between dry season duration and extinction probability. These findings can have a significant impact on our ability to predict disease outbreaks.

AB  - Habitat selection Is Important for a species' survival, and Its identification represents a crucial component in the development of conservation strategies. Habitat selection occurs when habitats are used disproportionately to their availability, and what constitutes available habitat will depend on the biology of the species under Investigation. Habitat selection and movement patterns of Spotted Turtles (Clemmys guttata) in a population near Lake Huron, Ontario, were studied over two consecutive years using radio telemetry. Selection was assessed at two spatial scales (second order, home range from population range; and third order, locations from home range) using compositional analyses. Spotted Turtles shift macrohabitat use throughout the annual cycle, therefore seasonal habitat selection was also analyzed. Selection occurred at both scales tested, and the ranking of preferred habitats differed based on the scale of analysis. Selection differed across seasons (emergence, nesting, post-nesting), but was similar between the sexes. Despite seasonal shifts In macrohabitat selection, microhabitat used did not differ seasonally, but females were more likely to choose locations with cover in the late summer compared to males. Individuals selected overwintering sites that afforded structural protection and a temperature near 0 degrees C. Movements were similar between the sexes, with a reduction In activity In July and August. The seasonal variability In habitat selection supports the need for surveys at multiple time-points within the year to fully document the critical habitat requirements of Spotted Turtles.

AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes for proteins mainly involved in the oxidative phosphorylation process, and due to its molecular features, it is one of the most used molecular markers for phylogenetic and taxonomic purposes. Since mitochondria are the primary source of energy for aerobic organisms, it has been suggested that modifications of the mitochondrial genome's features could be linked with major adaptive processes to particular environmental conditions. In this respect, Antarctic Collembola (springtails) may be considered an interesting model to study whether positive selective pressure has occurred, inducing significant changes in the mtDNA characteristics that have eventually led to cold adaptation. In this study, we describe the molecular features of the mitochondrial genome of Cryptopygus terranovus, a springtail species endemic to Victoria Land. Molecular data are also employed to support the new taxonomic placement of C. terranovus, and to establish if the conspecific lineages of Friesea antarctica, that lives in separated biogeographical regions of the Antarctic Continent, are indeed distinct species. Finally, all the mitochondrial genomes of springtails, so far sequenced, were applied for calculating the ratio () of nonsynonymous versus synonymous nucleotide substitutions. This approach allowed us to investigate if Antarctic collembolans could have experienced Darwinian selective pressures compared to the non-Antarctic springtail species. Indeed, our data does indicate positive selection (>1), suggesting that survival at extreme environmental conditions could be also related to mtDNA modifications.

AB  - Aerosol samplers with a recirculating liquid film are promising devices for remote biological monitoring. The presence of the liquid film provides a high survival rate for biological objects. The relatively simpler design allows portability to the sampler, which will make it possible to conduct tests outside the laboratory.
   In this study an analytical expression, describing the capturing efficiency of aerosol particles in the water film, taking into account the friction forces arising from interaction of water and air in a cyclone-based aerosol collector, was obtained. A new element, took over from the theory of centrifugal sprayers - a vortex chamber, was added to the theory and design of the collector. It allows increasing the initial angular moment of the elements of air volume entering the collector, which leads in appropriately an increase of maximal height of rising liquid film and particle capturing efficiency.
   To analyze the obtained expressions, graphs of particle capturing efficiency on basic parameters of modified cyclone collector and volumetric air flow were calculated. The graphs made it possible to determine the optimal geometric parameters for the portable cyclone-based collector.
   The introduced dependence on viscosity made it possible to estimate more accurately the efficiency of the device at various temperatures (including negative temperatures). For the selected parameters, graphs particle capturing efficiency were plotted. Water-alcohol solution and Novec 1230 fluid were used as fluids capable of operating at subzero temperatures.
   To check the operability of the sampler, tests were carried out to collect samples of sprayed inactivated adenovirus in a microbiological safety box at the Gamaleya Institute. The results of tests are discussed.

AB  - We use a simulation performed within the Constrained Local Universe Simulation (CLUES) project to study a realistic Local Group (LG)-like object. We employ this group as a numerical laboratory for studying the evolution of the population of its subhaloes from the point of view of the effects it may have on the origin of different types of dwarf galaxies. We focus on the processes of tidal stripping of the satellites, their interaction, merging and grouping before infall. The tidal stripping manifests itself in the transition between the phase of mass accretion and mass loss seen in most subhaloes, which occurs at the moment of infall on to the host halo, and the change of the shape of their mass function with redshift. Although the satellites often form groups, they are loosely bound within them and do not interact with each other. The infall of a large group could however explain the observed peculiar distribution of the LG satellites, but only if it occurred recently. Mergers between prospective subhaloes are significant only during an early stage of evolution, i.e. more than 7 Gyr ago, when they are still outside the host haloes. Such events could thus contribute to the formation of more distant early-type Milky Way companions. Once the subhaloes enter the host halo the mergers become very rare.

AB  - Climatic gradients model genetic diversity in widespread woody trees: the case of the widely distributed Nothofagus in the southern Andes. Widespread forest species are well suited to be the subject of studies combining adaptive responses to distinct habitats. We studied the genetic diversity of the wide-ranging Nothofagus pumilio that inhabits high-elevation and high-latitude forests, along different environmental gradients in Patagonia. The results of this study show a strong relationship between climate and the different environmental gradients; which in turn affect the genetic variation of N. pumilio. The most influential variables were related to summer precipitations and winter temperatures, where greater genetic diversity was associated to higher precipitations and milder temperatures. This demonstrates that the genetic diversity of this species is not randomly distributed in space, but it is structured according to complex climatic models. To understand how genetic adaptation and/or environmental aspects influence species' distribution ranges is crucial to evaluate their potential for long term survival. While some genotypes may become locally extinct under different climatic settings, others might be locally adapted to particular climatic conditions, which may allow them to endure such changes. Widespread taxa as N. pumilio has undergone past environmental changes, such as those that occurred during glacial periods, through adaptation and plasticity. We highlight the importance of conserving genetic diversity of populations, not only to ensure the long-term persistence, but also to mitigate the negative impacts of global climate change.

AB  - One concept of evolutionary ecology holds that a living fossil is the result of past evolutionary events, and is adapted to recent selective forces only if they are similar to the selective forces in the past. We describe the present environment of the living coelacanth Latimeria chalumnae Smith, 1939 at Grande Comore, western Indian Ocean and report depth-dependent cave distribution, temperature, salinity and oxygen values which are compared to the fish's distribution and its physiological demands. We studied the activity pattern, feeding behaviour, prey abundance and hunting success to evaluate possible links between environmental conditions, feeding ecology and evolutionary success of this ancient fish. Transmitter tracking experiments indicate nocturnal activity of the piscivorous predator which hunts between approximately 200 m below the surface to 500 m depth. Fish and prey density were measured between 200 and 400 m, both increase with depth. Feeding tracks and feeding strikes of the coelacanth at various depths were simulated with the help of video and laser techniques. Along a 9447 m video transect a total of 31 potential feeding strikes occurred. Assuming 100% hunting success, medium-sized individuals would obtain 122 g and large females 299 g of prey. Estimates of metabolic rates revealed for females 3.7 ml O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) and for males 4.5 ml O-2 kg(-1) h(-1). Today coelacanths are considered to be a specialist deep-water form and to inhabit, with their ancient morphology, a contemporary environment where they compete with advanced, modern fish.

AB  - Soil microbial communities have remarkable capacities to cope with ceaseless environmental changes, but little is known about their adaptation potential when facing an unprecedented disturbance. We tested the effect of incremental dose of microwaving on soil bacteria as a model of unprecedented stress. 16S rRNA gene qPCR at both the DNA and cDNA levels was used to characterize the total (DNA) and transcriptionally active (cDNA) fractions of the bacterial community. Amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA gene transcripts was performed to decipher tolerance ranges within the community using the concept of functional response groups (FRGs). Increasing microwaving doses resulted in 90% loss in total and transcriptionally active bacterial communities after 6.8 and 4.7 min, respectively. Four distinct FRGs with peculiar phylogenetic signatures were identified, revealing a link between taxonomy and increasing stress doses. FRG1, the most sensitive group, was dominated by Actinobacteria. FRG2 and FRG3, with intermediate tolerance, displayed prevalence of Proteobacteria, while FRG4, the most resistant group, was driven by Firmicutes. While the most sensitive FRGs showed predictable responses linked to changes in temperature and soil water content associated with microwaving, more tolerant FRG4 members exhibited a stochastic response nested within the Firmicutes phylum, potentially revealing bet-hedging strategists. The concept of FRGs based on 16S rRNA gene transcripts stood as an efficient tool for unraveling bacterial survival strategies and tolerance ranges triggered by incremental doses of an unprecedented stress, with regard to phylogeny linkages.

AB  - Site-specific delivery of chemotherapeutics specifically to neoplastic hepatocytes without affecting normal hepatocytes should be a focus for potential therapeutic management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aptamer TLS 9a with phosphorothioate backbone modifications (L5) has not been explored so far for preferential delivery of therapeutics in neoplastic hepatocytes to induce apoptosis. Thus, the objective of the present investigation was to compare the therapeutic potential of L5-functionalized drug nanocarrier (PTX-NPL5) with those of the other experimental drug nanocarriers functionalized by previously reported HCC cell-targeting aptamers and non-aptamer ligands, such as galactosamine and apotransferrin. A myriad of well-defined investigations such as cell cycle analysis, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling) assay, and studies related to apoptosis, histopathology, and immunoblotting substantiated that PTX-NPL5 had the highest potency among the different ligand-attached experimental formulations in inducing selective apoptosis in neoplastic hepatocytes via a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway. PTXNPL5 did not produce any notable toxic effects in healthy hepatocytes, thus unveiling a new and a safer option in targeted therapy for HCC. Molecular modeling study identified two cell-surface biomarker proteins (tumor-associated glycoprotein 72 [TAG-72] and heat shock protein 70 [HSP70]) responsible for ligand-receptor interaction of L5 and preferential internalization of PTX-NPL5 via clathrin-mediated endocytosis in neoplastic hepatocytes. The potential of PTX-NPL5 has provided enough impetus for its rapid translation from the pre-clinical to clinical domain to establish itself as a targeted therapeutic to significantly prolong survival in HCC.

AB  - Food hoarding is a common behavior used by a variety of animals to cope with periods of low food availability. At the retreating edge of species' distribution, the stressful environment and unfavourable climate conditions may impose severe costs on hoarding behavior. Since relict populations are hotspots for evolution and adaptation, and considering that food hoarding behavior has a strong evolutionary basis, we decided to evaluate the occurrence of behavioral variability in the amount of food cached by the endangered Mount Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus fremonti grahamensis). We tested the variation in cache size in response to microclimate, soil relief, vegetation, food availability and squirrel sex. The number of pits excavated by squirrels to cache cones was used as a proxy of cache size and was affected by mountain slope aspect and density of trees. More pits were excavated in the northeast facing slopes. The density of trees negatively affects the cache volume on southwest slopes, but not on northeast slopes. The sex of the resident squirrel also affects the number of pits in the squirrel midden, with males excavating 47% more pits than females. Males and females also presented different responses to the mountain slope aspect, with females excavating more pits on northeastern slopes than on southwestern slopes, whereas male cache size did not vary with the slope aspect. Finally, the squirrel's caching behavior did not vary in response to midden microclimate variation, a result with possible implications for the survival of the Mt Graham red squirrels, given the predicted temperature increases in the region due to climate change.

AB  - Polypedilum vanderplanki is a striking and unique example of an insect that can survive almost complete desiccation. Its genome and a set of dehydration-rehydration transcriptomes, together with the genome of Polypedilum nubifer (a congeneric desiccation-sensitive midge), were recently released. Here, using published and newly generated datasets reflecting detailed transcriptome changes during anhydrobiosis, as well as a developmental series, we show that the TCTAGAA DNA motif, which closely resembles the binding motif of the Drosophila melanogaster heat shock transcription activator (Hsf), is significantly enriched in the promoter regions of desiccation-induced genes in P. vanderplanki, such as genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, thioredoxins, or trehalose metabolism-related genes, but not in P. nubifer. Unlike P. nubifer, P. vanderplanki has double TCTAGAA sites upstream of the Hsf gene itself, which is probably responsible for the stronger activation of Hsf in P. vanderplanki during desiccation compared with P. nubifer. To confirm the role of Hsf in desiccation-induced gene activation, we used the Pv11 cell line, derived from P. vanderplanki embryo. After preincubation with trehalose, Pv11 cells can enter anhydrobiosis and survive desiccation. We showed that Hsf knockdown suppresses trehalose-induced activation of multiple predicted Hsf targets (including P. vanderplanki-specific LEA protein genes) and reduces the desiccation survival rate of Pv11 cells fivefold. Thus, cooption of the heat shock regulatory system has been an important evolutionary mechanism for adaptation to desiccation in P. vanderplanki.

AB  - Plane strain simple shearing of norcamphor (C7H10O) in a see-through deformation rig to a shear strain of gamma = 10.5 at a homologous temperature of T-h = 0.81 yields a microfabric similar to that of quartz in amphibolite facies mylonite. Synkinematic analysis of the norcamphor microfabric reveals that the development of a steady-state texture is linked to changes in the relative activities of several grain-scale mechanisms. Three stages of textural and microstructural evolution are distinguished: (1) rotation and shearing of the intracrystalline glide planes are accommodated by localized deformation along three sets of anastomozing microshears. A symmetrical c-axis girdle reflects localized pure shear extension along the main microshear set (S-a) oblique to the bulk shear zone boundary (abbreviated as SZB); (2) progressive rotation of the microshears into parallelism with the SZB increases the component of simple shear on the S-a microshears. Grain-boundary migration recrystallization favours the survival of grains with slip systems oriented for easy glide. This is associated with a textural transition towards two stable c-axis point maxima whose skeletal outline is oblique with respect to the S-a microshears and the SZB; and (3) at high shear strains (gamma > 8), the microstructure, texture and mechanism assemblage are strain invariant, but strain continues to partition into rotating sets of microshears. Steady state is therefore a dynamic, heterogeneous condition involving the cyclic nucleation, growth and consumption of grains. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB  - Animals inhabiting hydrothermal vents and cold seeps face conditions that are challenging for survival. In particular, these two habitats are characterized by chronic hypoxia, sometimes reaching complete anoxia. The characteristics of the scaphognathite and gills were studied in four species of shrimp and three species of crabs from hydrothermal vents and cold seeps, in order to highlight potential adaptations that could enhance oxygen acquisition in comparison with shallow-water relatives. All the vent and seep species studied here exhibit significantly larger scaphognathites, likely allowing more water to flow over their gills per stroke of this appendage. This is probably more energetically efficient that prolonged hyperventilation. In contrast to annelids, vent and seep decapods usually do not possess enlarged gills, a phenomenon likely due to the physical limitations imposed by the size of the gill chamber. In the vent shrimp Rimicaris exoculata and the vent crab Bythograea thermydron, however, there is a significantly higher specific gill surface area linked to a higher number of lamellae per gram of gill. Again in contrast to annelids, the diffusion distance through the gills is not strikingly different between the vent shrimp Alvinocaris komaii and the shallow-water species Palaemon spp. This may indicate that the epithelium and cuticle of the decapod gills are already optimized for oxygen uptake and that reducing the thickness of these compartments is not physically possible without affecting the physical integrity of the gills.

AB  - High mu (HIMU) islands such as St. Helena in the southern Atlantic Ocean, and Tubuaii and Mangaia in the Australes (Polynesia), are known for having mantle sources relatively enriched in some high field-strength elements (HFSE) such as Nb, and, as deduced from their extremely enriched lead isotopic compositions, long-lived high U/Pb (mu) ratios.
   A second group of HIMU mantle reservoirs is well identified in the Pacific Ocean, at Ua Pou (Marquesas), Mururoa and Fanptaufa (Gambiers), Guadalupe; and in the Atlantic Ocean, in the New England seamounts, Azores, Cape Verde, and Canarias. In contrast to Group I, these exhibit a much less pronounced enrichment in radiogenic lead due to only a recent increase in the mu ratio, whereas HFSE enrichment and lead depletion (as visible from high Ce/Pb ratios) are more pronounced than in Group I.
   If the HIMU reservoir is related to recycling of subducted lithosphere impoverished by dehydration in some elements enriched in arc magmas, the evolution of the thermal regime in subduction zones makes the HIMU reservoir progressively more abundant with time. During the early to middle Precambrian, a large part of the subducted lithosphere was melted; hence the residue recycled in the mantle was not sufficiently fertile to allow further basaltic melt extraction. In contrast, in modem, cooler subduction zones, dehydration and the subsequent extraction by fluids of mobile elements leaves behind a fertile residue.

AB  - Mild stresses are known to retard progressive decline in survival with age. The process wherein mild stresses exhibit a beneficial role is termed hormesis. The two mild stresses which are gaining interest in the present scenario of aging research are repeated mild heat shock (RMHS) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). Our interest was to know how the unique laboratory-evolved short- and long-lived cytoraces of nasuta-albomicans complex of Drosophila would respond to these stresses. Differential response by these cytoraces to RMHS and HDACi was observed. The lifespan of short-lived cytoraces, SL-1 and SL-2, extended more remarkably than other races in response to both RMHS and HDACi, whereas two of the long-lived cytoraces, LL-1 and LL-2, have not shown significant response to HDACi, even though they showed mild response to RMHS. The LL-3 and LL-4 cytoraces have not behaved similarly for all the three hormesis treatments as LL-1 and LL-2 cytoraces. These findings specify that there is a race-specific response developed in each system, and the reason we predict for such plasticity would be their genetic background. These cytoraces which evolved through hybridization have unique genome introgression and recombination, through which they might have acquired a race specific aging pathways, which in turn, played a crucial role in their differential response to stresses.

AB  - Sensory receptors enable animals to perceive their external world, and functional properties of receptors evolve to detect the specific cues relevant for an organism's survival. Changes in sensory receptor function or tuning can directly impact an organism's behavior. Functional tests of receptors from multiple species and the generation of chimeric receptors between orthologs with different properties allow for the dissection of the molecular basis of receptor function and identification of the key residues that impart functional changes in different species. Knowledge of these functionally important sites facilitates investigation into questions regarding the role of epistasis and the extent of convergence, as well as the timing of sensory shifts relative to other phenotypic changes. However, as receptors can also play roles in non-sensory tissues, and receptor responses can be modulated by numerous other factors including varying expression levels, alternative splicing, and morphological features of the sensory cell, behavioral validation can be instrumental in confirming that responses observed in heterologous systems play a sensory role. Expression profiling of sensory cells and comparative genomics approaches can shed light on cell-type specific modifications and identify other proteins that may affect receptor function and can provide insight into the correlated evolution of complex suites of traits. Here we review the evolutionary history and diversity of functional responses of the major classes of sensory receptors in vertebrates, including opsins, chemosensory receptors, and ion channels involved in temperature-sensing, mechanosensation and electroreception.

AB  - Flavour ingredients are an essential part of e-liquids. Their responsible selection and inclusion levels in e-liquids must be guided by toxicological principles. We propose an approach to the screening and toxicological risk assessment of flavour ingredients for e-liquids. The screening involves purity requirements and avoiding ingredients that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. Additionally, owing to the uncertainties involved in potency determination and the derivation of a tolerable level for respiratory sensitisation, we propose excluding respiratory sensitisers. After screening, toxicological data on the ingredients should be reviewed. Inhalation-specific toxicological issues, for which no reliable safe levels can currently be derived, can lead to further ingredient exclusions. We discuss the use of toxicological thresholds of concern for flavours that lack inhalation data suitable for quantitative risk assessment. Higher toxicological thresholds of concern are suggested for flavour ingredients (170 or 980 mu g/day) than for contaminant assessment (1.5 mu g/day). Analytical detection limits for measurements of potential reaction and thermal breakdown products in vaping aerosol, should be informed by the contaminant threshold. This principle leads us to recommend 5 ng/puff as an appropriate limit of detection for untargeted aerosol measurements. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Pulsed laser deposited (PLD) Y-doped BaZrO3 thin films (BaZr1-xYxO3-y/2, x = 0.2, y > 0), were investigated as to their viability for reliable humidity microsensors with long-term stability at high operating temperatures (T > 500 degrees C) as required for in situ point of source emissions control as used in power plant combustion processes. Defect chemistry based models and initial experimental results in recent humidity sensor literature [1,2]. indicate that bulk Y-doped BaZrO3 could be suitable for use in highly selective, high temperature compatible humidity sensors. In order to accomplish faster response and leverage low cost batch microfabrication technologies we have developed thin film deposition processes, characterized layer properties, fabricated and tested high temperature humidity micro sensors using these thin films. Previously published results on sputtering Y-doped BaZrO3 thin films have confirmed the principle validity of our approach [3]. However, the difficulty in controlling the stoichiometry of the films and their electrical properties as well as mud flat cracking of the films occurring either at films thicker than 400 nm or at annealing temperature above 800 degrees C have rendered sputtering a difficult process for the fabrication of reproducible and reliable thin film high temperature humidity microsensors, leading to the evaluation of PLD as alternative deposition method for these films.
   X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) data was collected from as deposited samples at the sample surface as well as after 4 min of Ar+ etching. PLD samples were close to the desired stoichiometry. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra from all as deposited BaZrO3:Y films show that the material is polycrystalline when deposited at substrate temperatures of 800 degrees C. AFM results revealed that PLD samples have a particle size between 32 nm and 72 nm and root mean square (RMS) roughness between 0.2 nm and 1.2 nm. The film conductivity increases as a function of temperature (from 200 degrees C to 650 degrees C) and upon exposure to a humid atmosphere, supporting our hypothesis of a proton conduction based conduction and sensing mechanism. Humidity measurements are presented for 200-500 nm thick films from 500 degrees C to 650 degrees C at vapor pressures of between 0.05 and 0.5 atm, with 0.03-2% error in repeatability and 1.2-15.7% error in hysteresis during cycling for over 2 h. Sensitivities of up to 7.5 atm(-1) for 200 nm thick PLD samples at 0.058 atm partial pressure of water were measured. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thick-crusted (>45 km) Cordilleran arcs exhibit cyclic processes including periods of magmatic quiescence interspersed with pulses of high-flux magmatism. Most models assume that during high-flux events, fractional crystallization and partial melting within the deep crustal hot zone generate a dense (>3.4 g/cm(3)) arclogitic subarc root that can readily founder into the mantle. Yet these models do not consider that: (1) the retention of low-density melt within the subarc root, and (2) the protolith lithology of the restitic portion of the subarc root may greatly impact the density evolution of the root and its susceptibility to foundering. In this article, we first address the effect of retained melt on the foundering ability of the subarc root by calculating the density and time for foundering of melt-bearing arclogitic residue at 1.5, 2, and 2.5 GPa. We find that melt volumes >10-18% are required to stabilize the root within the lower crust; melt volumes below this threshold lower the viscosity of the residue so much so as to decrease the time for foundering by an order of magnitude. We then constrain through phase equilibria modeling the effect of partial melting of different lower crustal protoliths on the density of the restitic subarc root. To do this, we model the density and mineralogical evolution of restites in equilibrium with their derivative melts during open-system, isobaric partial melting of typical crustal assemblages from 600-1100 degrees C at 1.5 (similar to 50 km) and 2 GPa (similar to 65 km). In our models, typical end-member assemblages in a lower crustal hot zone include basalt, metapelite, and metagraywacke. We find that melt-depleted restites derived from basaltic compositions are amphibole-bearing arclogites with densities conducive to foundering, which at 2 GPa can occur even in the presence of the coexisting hydrous felsic residual melt. Foundering of the amphibole +/- melt-bearing root may refertilize the mantle wedge and induce melting of the surrounding asthenosphere as well as the arclogitic mass. However, if temperatures in a 50-km deep subarc hot zone are not sufficient to drive melt depletion of basaltic restites, these dense (3.1-3.3 g/cm(3)) residues are gravitationally stable, increasing the density of the lower crust and lowering the elevation of the arc. In comparison, partial melting of metasedimentary country rock produces alkali feldspar-rich residues that never achieve densities conducive to foundering. Thus, if high-flux events are driven by the influx of melt-fertile lithosphere beneath the arc as envisioned by the Cordilleran cycle model, then partial melting of the metasedimentary portion will generate low-density residues that remain in the lower crust and contribute to the thickness, geochemistry, and seismic structure of the bulk arc.

AB  - Climate change offers new opportunities for Finnish field crop production, which is currently limited by the short growing season. A wanner climate will extend the thermal growing season and the physiologically effective part of it. Winters will also become milder, enabling introduction of winter-sown crops to a greater extent than is possible today. With this study we aim to characterise the likely regional differences in capacity to grow different seed producing crops. Prolongation of the Finnish growing season was estimated using a 0.5 degrees latitude x 0.5 degrees longitude gridded dataset from the Finnish Meteorological Institute. The dataset comprised an average estimate from 19 global climate models of the response of Finnish climate to low (B 1) and high (A2) scenarios of greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions for 30-year periods centred on 2025, 2055 and 2085 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). Growing season temperature sums that suit crop growth and are agronomically feasible in Finland are anticipated to increase by some 140 degrees Cd by 2025, 300 degrees Cd by 2055 and 470 degrees Cd by 2085 in scenario A2, when averaged over regions, and earlier sowing is expected to take place, but not later harvests. Accordingly, the extent of cultivable areas for the commonly grown major and minor crops will increase considerably. Due to the higher base temperature requirement for maize (Zea mays L.) growth than for temperate crops, we estimate that silage maize could become a Finnish field crop for the most favourable growing regions only at the end of this century. Winters are getting milder, but it will take almost the whole century until winters such as those that are typical for southern Sweden and Denmark are experienced on a wide scale in Finland. It is possible that introduction of winter-sown crops (cereals and rapeseed) will represent major risks due to fluctuating winter conditions, and this could delay their adaptation for many decades. Such risks need to be studied in more detail to estimate timing of introduction. Prolonged physiologically effective growing seasons would increase yielding capacities of major field crops. Of the current minor crops, oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack), pea (Pisum sativum L.) and faba bean (Vicia faba L.) are particularly strong candidates to become major crops. Moreover, they have good potential for industrial processing and are currently being bred. Realisation of increased yield potential requires adaptation to 1) elevated daily mean temperatures that interfere with development rate of seed crops under long days, 2) relative reductions in water availability at critical phases of yield determination, 3) greater pest and disease pressure, 4) other uncertainties caused by weather extremes and 5) generally greater need for inputs such as nitrogen fertilisers for non-nitrogen fixing crops.

AB  - The presence of nucleobases in carbonaceous meteorites on Earth is an indication of the existence of this class of molecules in outer space. However, space is permeated by ionizing radiation, which can have damaging effects on these molecules. Adenine is a purine nucleobase that amalgamates important biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, and ATP. Adenine has a unique importance in biochemistry and therefore life. The aim of this work was to study the effects of cosmic ray analogues on solid adenine and estimate its survival when exposed to corpuscular radiation.
   Adenine films were irradiated at GANIL (Caen, France) and GSI (Darmstadt, Germany) by 820 MeV Kr33+, 190 MeV Ca10+, 92 MeV Xe23+, and 12 MeV C4+ ion beams at low temperature. The evolution of adenine molecules under heavy ion irradiation was studied by IR absorption spectroscopy as a function of projectile fluence.
   It was found that the adenine destruction cross section (sigma(d)) follows an electronic stopping power (S-e) power law under the form: CSen; C is a constant, and the exponential n is a dimensionless quantity. Using the equation above to fit our results, we determined sigma(d) = 4 x 10(-17) S-e(1.17), with S-e in kiloelectronvolts per micrometer (keV mu m(-1)). New IR absorption bands arise under irradiation of adenine and can be attributed to HCN, CN-, C2H4N4, CH3CN, and (CH3)(3)CNC.
   These findings may help to understand the stability and chemistry related to complex organic molecules in space. The half-life of solid adenine exposed to the simulated interstellar medium cosmic ray flux was estimated as (10 +/- 8) x 10(6) years.

AB  - Background: Despite advances in imaging techniques, real-time visualization of the structure and dynamics of tissues and organs inside small living animals has remained elusive. Recently, we have been using synchrotron x-rays to visualize the internal anatomy of millimeter-sized opaque, living animals. This technique takes advantage of partially-coherent x-rays and diffraction to enable clear visualization of internal soft tissue not viewable via conventional absorption radiography. However, because higher quality images require greater x-ray fluxes, there exists an inherent tradeoff between image quality and tissue damage.
   Results: We evaluated the tradeoff between image quality and harm to the animal by determining the impact of targeted synchrotron x-rays on insect physiology, behavior and survival. Using 25 keV x-rays at a flux density of 80 mu W/ mm(-2), high quality video-rate images can be obtained without major detrimental effects on the insects for multiple minutes, a duration sufficient for many physiological studies. At this setting, insects do not heat up. Additionally, we demonstrate the range of uses of synchrotron phase-contrast imaging by showing high-resolution images of internal anatomy and observations of labeled food movement during ingestion and digestion.
   Conclusion: Synchrotron x-ray phase contrast imaging has the potential to revolutionize the study of physiology and internal biomechanics in small animals. This is the only generally applicable technique that has the necessary spatial and temporal resolutions, penetrating power, and sensitivity to soft tissue that is required to visualize the internal physiology of living animals on the scale from millimeters to microns.

AB  - The sharp increase in infections due to Staphylococcus aureus is associated with its ability to adapt to changes in its habitat. This study aimed to investigate the differences in the cytoplasmic amino acid profiles of a clinical strain of S. aureus under five combinations of stress-induced conditions representative of a wound site by varying temperature 35-37 degrees C, adding 0-5% NaCl and adjusting pH 6-8. The results indicated that aspartic acid, lysine, glutamic acid and histidine were the most abundant cytoplasmic amino acids in the control samples grown under optimal growth conditions. However, the magnitudes and levels of these amino acids were altered under the various wound site conditions, which led to differential cytoplasmic amino acid profiles as characterized by multivariate analyses (PLS-DA). The total cytoplasmic amino acid content was significantly reduced in the cells grown with 2.5% NaCl added at pH 7 and 37 degrees C relative to the control samples and other growth regimes. However, all combinations of enhanced stress conditions showed unique and characteristic changes in the concentration profiles of the cytoplasmic amino acids. These outcomes supported the hypothesis that bacterial cells of S. aureus maintain different metabolic homeostasis under various stress-induced conditions. The potent capability of S. aureus to constantly and rapidly acclimatize to variations within the environment may reflect the crucial feature supporting its virulence as an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium to invade the wound site. Understanding the control systems governing these marked changes in amino acids during the adaptation to the potential wound site conditions of this dangerous bacterium may offer new clinical controls to combat infection.

AB  - Aeromonas salmonicida is a Gram-negative bacterium that can infect a wide host range of fish populations, including salmonids and non-salmonids as well as freshwater and marine life. Some strains of A. salmonicida cause the disease furunculosis, which can cause lethargy, intestinal inflammation, ulcers, haemorrhaging and death. The infection is spread through fish-to-fish contact, and the presence of infection can have devastating effects on cultivated fish populations. The purpose of this study was to explore the ability of non-A-layer and A-layer A. salmonicida strains to incorporate polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) into their lipid profile and test the phenotypic effects thereof. Lipids were extracted from PUFA-exposed cultures and analysed for lipid modification by thin-layer chromatography and ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, showing A. salmonicida, regardless of A-layer, capable of incorporating all seven of the PUFAs studied. Phenotypic effects were determined through the use of assays that tested for biofilm formation, membrane permeability and cyclic peptide susceptibility. Temperature-dependent effects on biofilm formation were observed, and PUFA exposure showed significant (p < .001) increases in membrane permeability as tested by the uptake of the hydrophobic compounds crystal violet and ethidium bromide. Additionally, some PUFAs elicited modest protection and vulnerability against the membrane-targeting cyclic peptides polymyxin B (PMB) and colistin. The diverse, strain-specific responses to exogenous PUFAs may allude to evolved adaptive strategies that enhance survival, persistence and virulence of non-pathogenic and pathogenic members of bacteria that oscillate between environmental and fish host niches.

AB  - Background: Ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) is an important medicinal herbs in Asia. However, ginseng varieties are less developed.
   Method: To developed ginseng varieties, a pure line selection method was applied in this study.
   Results: Gumpoong was testing of 4-yr-old specimens in 2002, the proportions of the below-ground roots that were rusty colored for Gumpoong was 1.29 in Daejeon and 1.45 in Eumseong, whereas the proportions for its yellow berry variant were 2.60 and 2.45 in the two regions, respectively. Thus the Gumpoong was resistant to root rust. Sunpoong has a high yielding property. Its average root weight is 70.6 g for 6-yr-old roots. Its yield is 2.9 kg/1.62m(2) and the rate of heaven- and earth-grade product is 20.9%, which is very high compared to 9.4% for Yunpoong. Sunone is resistance to root rot and the survival rate of 4-yr-old roots was 44.4% in 1997, whereas that of the violet-stem variant landrace was 21.7%. Sunhyang has content of arginyl-fructosyl-glucose (AFG), which produces the unique scent of red ginseng, is 95.1 mu mol/g and greater than the 30.8 mu mol/g of Chunpoong in 6-yr-old plants. Sunun and Cheongsun are being nurtured to protect genetic resources.
   Conclusion: Developed ginsneg varieties will be used as the basis for the protection of genetic resources and breeding. Copyright (C) 2015, The Korean Society of Ginseng, Published by Elsevier. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ice-binding proteins (IBPs) have evolved independently in multiple taxonomic groups to improve their survival at sub-zero temperatures. Intertidal invertebrates in temperate and polar regions frequently encounter sub-zero temperatures, yet there is little information on IBPs in these organisms. We hypothesized that there are far more IBPs than are currently known and that the occurrence of freezing in the intertidal zone selects for these proteins. We compiled a list of genome-sequenced invertebrates across multiple habitats and a list of known IBP sequences and used BLAST to identify a wide array of putative IBPs in those invertebrates. We found that the probability of an invertebrate species having an IBP was significantly greater in intertidal species than in those primarily found in open ocean or freshwater habitats. These intertidal IBPs had high sequence similarity to fish and tick antifreeze glycoproteins and fish type II antifreeze proteins. Previously established classifiers based on machine learning techniques further predicted ice-binding activity in the majority of our newly identified putative IBPs. We investigated the potential evolutionary origin of one putative IBP from the hard-shelled mussel Mytilus coruscus and suggest that it arose through gene duplication and neofunctionalization. We show that IBPs likely readily evolve in response to freezing risk and that there is an array of uncharacterized IBPs, and highlight the need for broader laboratory-based surveys of the diversity of ice-binding activity across diverse taxonomic and ecological groups.

AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) require replication across a wide range of temperatures to perpetuate. While vertebrate hosts tend to maintain temperatures of approximately 37 degrees C-40 degrees C, arthropods are subject to ambient temperatures which can have a daily fluctuation of > 10 degrees C. Temperatures impact vector competence, extrinsic incubation period, and mosquito survival unimodally, with optimal conditions occurring at some intermediate temperature. In addition, the mean and range of daily temperature fluctuations influence arbovirus perpetuation and vector competence. The impact of temperature on arbovirus genetic diversity during systemic mosquito infection, however, is poorly understood. Therefore, we determined how constant extrinsic incubation temperatures of 25 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 35 degrees C control Zika virus (ZIKV) vector competence and population dynamics within Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. We also examined fluctuating temperatures which better mimic field conditions in the tropics. We found that vector competence varied in a unimodal manner for constant temperatures peaking between 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C for both Aedes species. Transmission peaked at 10 days post-infection for Aedes aegypti and 14 days for Aedes albopictus. Conversely, fluctuating temperature decreased vector competence. Using RNA-seq to characterize ZIKV population structure, we identified that temperature alters the selective environment in unexpected ways. During mosquito infection, constant temperatures more often elicited positive selection whereas fluctuating temperatures led to strong purifying selection in both Aedes species. These findings demonstrate that temperature has multiple impacts on ZIKV biology, including major effects on the selective environment within mosquitoes.

AB  - Coastal hypoxia has detrimental effects to community ecology, degrading community structure and diminishing benthic function. Benthic function is largely driven by infauna bioturbation, which facilitates life-supporting processes by increasing the quality of marine sediments for nearly all biota. These infauna-mediated processes are diminished by coastal hypoxia. However, some infauna have been documented to exhibit metabolic plasticity to low oxygen allowing them to maintain some form of benthic function. Of particular interest to this study is the Nereid polychaete Alitta succinea. Stopflow respirometry was used to assess the hypoxic tolerance of A. succinea, by quantifying resting metabolic rate (V-O2), critical oxygen saturation (i.e. the oxygen level below which worms could not maintain aerobic metabolism), and the oxyregulation ability at an acclimation temperature (25 degrees C) and after an acute temperature increase (to 30 degrees C). The acute Q(10) during normoxia was 4.6, though this effect of temperature on V-O2, was completely muted during hypoxia with a Q(10) of 1. Compared among other polychaetes, A. succinea was the most efficient at oxyregulation, resulting in low critical oxygen saturation levels of 16% and 10% at 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively. Finally, there was a significant effect of hypoxia on the mass metabolism relationship of A. succinea. Oxygen consumption rates were significantly higher during hypoxia only for smaller A. succinea, suggesting a physiological size selection for hypoxia response. These findings demonstrate the significant effect of hypoxia on A. succinea metabolism, but also provide the metabolic justification for survival of this infaunal worm during severe hypoxia.

AB  - Collective behaviors of spiral waves in the networks of Hodgkin-Huxley neuron are investigated. A stable rotating spiral wave can be developed to occupy the quiescent areas in networks of neurons by selecting appropriate initial values for the variables in the networks of neurons. In our numerical studies, most neurons are quiescent and finite (few) numbers of neurons are selected with different values to form a spiral seed. In this way, neurons communicating are carried by propagating spiral wave to break through the quiescent domains (areas) in networks of neurons. The effect of membrane temperature on the formation of spiral wave is investigated by selecting different fixed membrane temperatures in the networks, and it is found that a spiral wave cannot be developed if the membrane temperature is close to a certain threshold. A quantitative factor of synchronization is defined to measure the statistical properties and collective behaviors of the spiral wave. And a distinct phase transition, which indicates the critical condition for spiral survival, is observed in the sudden changing point of the factors of synchronization curve vs. certain bifurcation parameter. Internal noise is introduced into ion channels (channel noise) with the Langevin method. It is found that a stable rotating spiral wave is developed and the spiral wave is robust to weak channel noise (the membrane patch is not small). The spiral wave can not grow up and the stable rotating spiral wave encounters instability in presence of strong channel noise.

AB  - Endemic species flocks inhabiting ancient lakes, oceanic islands and other long-lived isolated habitats are often interpreted as adaptive radiations. Yet molecular evidence for directional selection during species flocks radiation is scarce. Using partial transcriptomes of 64 species of Lake Baikal (Siberia, Russia) endemic amphipods and two nonendemic outgroups, we report a revised phylogeny of this species flock and analyse evidence for positive selection within the endemic lineages. We confirm two independent invasions of amphipods into Baikal and demonstrate that several morphological features of Baikal amphipods, such as body armour and reduction in appendages and sensory organs, evolved in several lineages in parallel. Radiation of Baikal amphipods has been characterized by short phylogenetic branches and frequent episodes of positive selection which tended to be more frequent in the early phase of the second invasion of amphipods into Baikal when the most intensive diversification occurred. Notably, signatures of positive selection are frequent in genes encoding mitochondrial membrane proteins with electron transfer chain and ATP synthesis functionality. In particular, subunits of both the membrane and substrate-level ATP synthases show evidence of positive selection in the plankton species Macrohectopus branickii, possibly indicating adaptation to active plankton lifestyle and to survival under conditions of low temperature and high hydrostatic pressures known to affect membranes functioning. Other functional categories represented among genes likely to be under positive selection include Ca-binding muscle-related proteins, possibly indicating adaptation to Ca-deficient low mineralization Baikal waters.

AB  - The signal transducers and activators of transcription - STAT5A and STAT5B - take part in the regulation of many essential physiopathological processes. They influence the cell cycle, apoptosis and the proliferation of different types of cell lines. The STAT5 proteins are induced in response to multiple haematopoietic cytokines. Because they are constitutively active in certain haemato-oncologic diseases, it is also suggested that they play an important role in leukaemogenesis. However, function of these proteins in haematopoietic cell transformation and proliferation is not clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of perturbation of STAT5 expression [using oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) against STAT5 mRNA], on the clonogenicity and survival of selected human leukaemic cell lines, HEL, HL-60, K562, TF-1. We analysed the effect of ODN pre-treatment on the cell clonogenicity in methylcellulose cultures according to the time and the temperature of exposure. Moreover, we attempted to estimate apoptosis induced in examined cells, by flow cytometry using combined Annexin V-PI staining and the TUNEL method. We also applied the RT-PCR method to analyse Bax and Bcl-x(L) gene expression. We found that the perturbation of STAT5 expression with antisense oligonucleotides caused a decrease in the proliferative potential of human K562 and TF-1 cell lines. Also, we observed higher induction of apoptotic cell death in the K562 and TF-1 cells incubated with the antisense STAT5A ODNs. We did not notice any impact of ODNs on the HL-60 and HEL cells. Our studies using STAT5 antisense oligonucleotides showed that these proteins may be critical in the regulation of growth and apoptosis of some types of leukaemic blasts.

AB  - The hypersaline sediment and groundwater of playa lake, Lake Lucero, at the White Sands National Monument in New Mexico were examined for microbial community composition, geochemical gradients, and mineralogy during the dry season along a meter and a half depth profile of the sediment vs. the groundwater interface. Lake Lucero is a highly dynamic environment, strongly characterized by the capillary action of the groundwater, the extreme seasonality of the climate, and the hypersalinity. Sediments are predominantly composed of gypsum with minor quartz, thenardite, halite, quartz, epsomite, celestine, and clays. Geochemical analysis has revealed the predominance of nitrates over ammonium in all of the analyzed samples, indicating oxygenated conditions throughout the sediment column and in groundwater. Conversely, the microbial communities are primarily aerobic, gram-negative, and are largely characterized by their survival adaptations. Halophiles and oligotrophs are ubiquitous for all the samples. The very diverse communities contain methanogens, phototrophs, heterotrophs, saprophytes, ammonia-oxidizers, sulfur-oxidizers, sulfate-reducers, iron-reducers, and nitrifiers. The microbial diversity varied significantly between groundwater and sediment samples as their temperature adaptation inferences that revealed potential psychrophiles inhabiting the groundwater and thermophiles and mesophiles being present in the sediment. The dynamism of this environment manifests in the relatively even character of the sediment hosted microbial communities, where significant taxonomic distinctions were observed. Therefore, sediment and groundwater substrates are considered as separate ecological entities. We hope that the variety of the discussed playa environments and the microorganisms may be considered a useful terrestrial analog providing valuable information to aid future astrobiological explorations.

AB  - Dapediidae are a characteristic group of deep-bodied Mesozoic actinopterygian fishes with a moderate diversity at genus- and species-level. Here, we add a new occurrence to their patchy fossil record and describe in detail a nearly complete dapediid specimen from the pelagic deposit of the Toarcian urkut Manganese Ore Formation in the Transdanubian Range of Hungary. The preserved characters represent nearly all anatomically important body parts and allow assignment to Dapedium and comparison with other dapediid genera. This is the first reported occurrence of the order in Hungary and the Carpathian Basin that extends the known geographical range of the genus to the Mediterranean (western Tethyan) Jurassic. A review of the temporal distribution of published occurrences of dapediids permits speculation that the disappearance of exclusively Late Triassic genera, coincident with the end-Triassic extinction event, was likely related to their specialised feeding strategies and light or incomplete squamation. Multiple environmental crises (warming, acidification and anoxia) severely affected reefal habitats and favoured the survival of the generalist-durophagous Dapedium. The urkut specimen adds important data to the Early Jurassic, particularly Toarcian Lagerstatte-dominated fossil record of dapediids. In contrast to the end-Triassic, the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event did not lead to genus extinction among dapediids, possibly prevented by adaptations evolved during the preceding and similarly multi-stressor event. Continuing studies of Mesozoic fish specimens in Hungarian collections may provide new records and insights into other groups as well.

AB  - Sulfide and hypoxia threaten marine organisms in various ways. Anadara broughtonii, a commercial marine bivalve in China which has great potential exposure to sulfide and hypoxia, was selected to test the responses to these stresses. Digital gene expression profile (DGE) analysis was performed on the juveniles' gills after exposed to normal condition (CG group), hypoxia (LO group), and low/high concentration of sulfide (LS/HS group, administered in hypoxia), respectively, using RNA-seq technology. A total of over 30 million clean reads were filtered from each DGE library and over 90% of them were annotated successfully. In total, 774 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected and assigned to Gene ontology (GO) classification and KEGG Pathway enrichment analysis. The results show that many of the upregulated DEGs are related to hemoglobin, immunology, and stress responding. In the stressed A. broughtonii, cytochrome P450 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase may stimulate the glycolysis process to reduce oxygen consumption; Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, heat shock protein and protein disulfide isomerase probably help to maintain the genome integrity; Baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 2/3, mitogen-activated protein kinase and tumor necrosis factor pathways were probably responsible for protein repair, proteolysis, apoptosis and immune responses to high concentration of sulfide. Combined challenges also induced alternative oxidase and sushi repeat-containing protein, which have indistinct but probably indispensable function in invertebrates. For the first time, comprehensive transcriptome information on A. broughtonii in response to sulfide and hypoxia were provided. Our research offers new insights into the molecular mechanism behind the resistance of shellfish to sulfide and hypoxia.

AB  - Finding life on other worlds is a fascinating area of astrobiology and planetary sciences. Presently, over 3800 exoplanets, representing a very wide range of physical and chemical environments, are known. Scientists are not only looking for traces of life outside Earth, but they are also trying to find out which of Earths known organisms (ex: tardigrades (water bears)) would be able to survive on other planets. In our study, we have established a metric tool for distinguishing the potential survivability of active and cryptobiotic tardigrades on rocky-water and water-gas planets in our solar system and exoplanets, taking into consideration the geometrical means of six physical parameters such as radius, density, escape velocity, revolution period, surface temperature, and surface pressure of the considered planets. More than 3800 exoplanets are available as the main sample from Planetary Habitable Laboratory - Exoplanet Catalog (PHL-EC), from which we have chosen 57 exoplanets in our study including Earth and Mars, with water composition as reference. The Active Tardigrade Index (ATI) and Cryptobiotic Tardigrade Index (CTI) are two metric indices with minimum value 0 (= tardigrades cannot survive) and maximum 1 (= tardigrades will survive in their respective state). Values between 0 and 1 indicate a percentage chance of the active or cryptobiotic tardigrades surviving on a given exoplanet. Among known planets some of the exoplanets are tabulated as ATI and CTI indices for sample representation like: Kepler-100d, Kepler-48d, Kepler-289b, TRAPPIST-1 f and Kepler-106e. The results with Mars as the threshold indicates that Mars could be the only rock-water composition planet that could be more suitable for tardigrades than other considered exoplanets.

AB  - Hydrothermal vent organisms have evolved physiological adaptations to cope with extreme abiotic conditions including temperature and pH. To date, acid-base regulatory abilities of vent organisms are poorly investigated, although this physiological feature is essential for survival in low pH environments. We report the acid-base regulatory mechanisms of a hydrothermal vent crab, Xenograpsus testudinatus, endemic to highly acidic shallow-water vent habitats with average environment pH-values ranging between 5.4 and 6.6. Within a few hours, X. testudinatus restores extracellular pH (pHe) in response to environmental acidification of pH 6.5 (1.78 kPa pCO(2)) accompanied by an increase in blood HCO3- levels from 8.8 +/- 0.3 to 31 +/- 6 mM. Branchial Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) and V-type H+-ATPase (VHA), the major ion pumps involved in branchial acid-base regulation, showed dynamic increases in response to acidified conditions on the mRNA, protein and activity level. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrate the presence of NKA in basolateral membranes, whereas the VHA is predominantly localized in cytoplasmic vesicles of branchial epithelial-and pillar-cells. X testudinatus is closely related to other strong osmo-regulating brachyurans, which is also reflected in the phylogeny of the NKA. Accordingly, our results suggest that the evolution of strong ion regulatory abilities in brachyuran crabs that allowed the occupation of ecological niches in euryhaline, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats are probably also linked to substantial acid-base regulatory abilities. This physiological trait allowed X. testudinatus to successfully inhabit one of the world's most acidic marine environments.

AB  - The effect of Ultrasonic Treatment (UT) over selected temperature ranges during cooling and solidification of an Al-2Cu alloy melt on the grain structure and cooling behaviour of the alloy has been investigated using a molybdenum sonotrode introduced without preheating. UT was applied over various temperature ranges before, during and after the nucleation of primary aluminium grains. It was found that ultrasonic grain refinement was achieved only when UT was applied from more than 20 degrees C above the liquidus temperature until below the liquidus temperature after nucleation has occurred. Applying UT from 40 degrees C or 60 degrees C above the liquidus to just above the liquidus brings the melt to a condition that favours nucleation, survival of the nucleated grains and their subsequent transport throughout the melt. Continuing to apply UT beyond the liquidus for a short time enhances both nucleation and convection thereby ensuring the formation of a fine, uniform equiaxed grain size throughout the casting. The lack of grain refinement when UT was applied from 20 degrees C above the liquidus temperature or from temperatures below the liquidus temperature is attributed to the formation of a strong solidified layer on the sonotrode which hinders the effective transmission of ultrasonic irradiation into the liquid metal. The application of a preheated sonotrode showed that formation of a solid layer can be prevented by preheating the sonotrode to 285 degrees C. Thus, an appropriate amount of superheat of the liquid metal or sufficient preheating of the sonotrode is necessary for ultrasonic grain refinement when a sonotrode is introduced into the melt.

AB  - Sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum, L.) production during the hot-wet and hot-dry seasons in the lowland tropics is constrained by high temperature, flooding, and root diseases. AVRDC has developed a grafting technology for tomato production during the hot summer season and is now accepted by a growing number of farmers in Southeast Asia. Similar technology is being developed for sweet pepper to enhance yield and improve quality under flooding. Since 2002, several chili pepper lines from a wide collection including wild species were identified to have tolerance to flooding. In 2003, screening was expanded with the goal of identifying chili pepper lines for production in flood-prone areas or for use as rootstocks for sweet pepper production during the hot-wet season, when market prices are profitable. Selected lines from C. baccatum, C. frutescens and C. chacoense were most tolerant to flooding damage with survival rate greater than 45%. In 2004, 23 accessions were selected to evaluate outstanding lines as rootstocks for sweet pepper production during the hot-wet and hot-dry seasons. Significant correlations (P < 0.01) were detected among plant traits during both seasons. Most traits were negatively correlated with disease incidence indicating that resistance to disease may be enhanced by taller plant stature, larger rootstock stem diameter and higher root number. Significant differences in yield were observed among rootstocks in both seasons. Mean yield during the hot-dry season was 50% higher than the hot-wet season. This study has identified promising lines of chili rootstock for production of grafted sweet pepper during the hot-wet and hot-dry seasons in the lowland tropics.

AB  - Ultra-short pulsed laser ablation of stainless steel is accompanied by the evolution of different microstructures. Depending on the fluence, accumulated energy and number of laser passes cones from impurities, laser induced periodic surface structures, cone-like protrusion (CLP), and thermal bumps evolve at the surface. These often unwanted morphologies can be induced or inhibited by carefully choosing the strategy and laser parameters. The investigated range reveals a small processing window for defined 515 nm sub 1 ps ablation leading to low surface roughness using circular polarization. Hitherto, the origin and dependencies of CLP are still not well understood and for the first time a precursor ripple structure reported. These precursor ripples reveal supra-wavelength periodicity with about 2 mu m spacing and evolve earliest after the second layer of ablation. Potentially, low spatial frequency laser-induced periodic surface structure generated with the first laser pass with pulse and hatch overlap are the root cause of CLP evolution. Moreover, the CLP growth is grain orientation and strongly polarization state dependent. Preferentially, CLP start to evolve at the {110} planes of the face-centered cubic crystals of the inspected austenitic stainless steel and linear polarized laser radiation revealing a 1:1 aspect ratio of 10 mu m. A nanoindentation study at the interface near region on cross-sections reveals robust mechanical properties of this CLP structure.

AB  - Optical absorption and photoluminescence measurements at 9 K were performed on stoichiometric GaRGe2O7 and on R-doped LaGaGe2O7, R = Pr3+, Nd3+, polycrystalline samples. In this monoclinic matrix, space group P2(1)/c (no. 14), the lanthanide ion occupies a single crystallographic point site with symmetry C-1. From the crystal-held analysis of the optical spectra, energy level schemes and an expression of the associated wavefunctions for the 4f(2) and 4f(3) configurations were derived. In both cases, the fitting of experimental Stark level energies and the phenomenological calculation of free-ion as well as crystal-field parameters (CFPs) were performed for the approximate C-s (C-2) symmetry. Despite the low symmetry, very satisfactory correlations between experimental and simulated energy level schemes were obtained, with root mean square deviations sigma = 10.1 and 14.8 cm(-1) for pr(3+) and Nd3+, respectively. Energy levels and the composition of their wavefunctions were checked for both cofigurations through a calculation of the thermal evolution of the paramagnetic susceptibility chi, according to the Van Vleck formula. The same calculation was accomplished with CFPs resulting from the semi-empirical simple overlap model (SOM), considering the real point symmetry of R and C-1. Over the whole measured range, 1.7-300 K, a very good reproduction of the observed chi vs. T is yielded by each of the phenomenological and SOM calculated collections of CFPs.

AB  - Mixed forests play a key role in terms of stability, production potential and adaptation to climate change. Norway spruce [PA, Picea abies (L.) Karst] and European beech (FS, Fagus sylvatica L.) are among the most important tree species in Europe. The aim of the study was to determine the influence of the species composition of these two tree genera on the production, structure, diversity and growth of mixed Fageto-Piceetum acidophilum stands in the Krkonose Mountains, in the Czech Republic. The following 5 variants (ratios) of mixture were compared in 6 replications (30 research plots in total): PA 100%, PA 75:25 FS, PA 50:50 FS, PA 25:75 FS and FS 100%. Based on 178 tree core samples, the research also focused on the influence of climatic factors (temperature, precipitation) and air pollution (SO2, NOX, AOT40F) on the radial growth of these tree species of particular variants. Mixed forests showed a timber production higher by 7.7% (-10.8 to 31.5%) in comparison to spruce monocultures, and by 47.3% (21.9-79.7%) compared to beech monocultures. The largest production as well as the highest diameter increment were documented in PA 75:25 FS (656 m(3) ha(-1)). In addition, this variant had the lowest extreme decreases/fluctuations in radial growth in both tree species. Over the last 50 years, the increment in beech increased by 7.9% and by 2.5% in spruce. The cyclical behavior in the radial growth of both tree species occurred in the short-term solar cycles of 9-11 and long-term periods of 50-75 years, while the spruce showed higher cyclic intensity. The concentration of both SO2 and NOX had a significant negative effect on the radial growth of spruce. In both tree species, the negative effect of air pollution lessened with their decreasing share in the stand. Similarly, precipitation and temperature had a more significant effect on the growth of monospecific variants in both tree species, especially in beech. Temperatures, when compared to precipitation, had a greater effect on the radial growth of both tree genera, especially during the vegetation period. In terms of diversity, mixed stands achieved significantly higher structural (diameter, height, crown) differentiation and overall diversity compared to monospecific variants. In general, mixed stands can achieve higher production potential, diversity and especially resistance to climate extremes and air pollution in relation to climate change in the water-sufficient highland and mountain areas of the Czech Republic. Differences between mixed stands vs. monocultures, i.e. the effect of tree species mixing, depend on suitable ratios of tree species and their spatial pattern.

AB  - The mid-Miocene Gangdese orogenic belt in southern Tibet contains porphyry Cu deposits that developed after the Indian-Asian continental collision in the early Cenozoic. Field work confirms that these porphyry Cu deposits are temporally and spatially associated with mid-Miocene monzogranitic and quartz monzonitic stocks, which intruded Mesozoic-Cenozoic Gangdese granitoid batholiths and surrounding Triassic-Tertiary volcano-sedimentary sequences in the Lhasa Terrane, and formed a 50-km wide, 400-km long E-W belt. Magmatism occurred during the interval 11.2 to 19.7 Ma, peaking at similar to 16 Ma for the porphyry stocks; this is consistent with the age (10 to 18 Ma) of the east-west extension and subsequent NS-striking normal fault systems (>= 13.5 Ma) in the Tibetan Orogen. The stocks typically occur as multiple small diameter intrusions (<5 km), and have shallow emplacement depths (similar to 1 to 3 km). The Cu porphyries are shoshonitic and high-K calc-alkaline, showing geochemical affinities with adakites. The porphyries were derived from a thickened basaltic lower-crust source, rather than from the subducted oceanic-slab. Geochemical and geophysical data indicate that during the Paleocene-Oligocene mantle-derived mafic magmas created a newly-formed basaltic underplate at the bottom of the lower-crust, which undewent garnet amphibolite metamorphism under high pressure (>50 km). Breakdown of hornblende in the juvenile lower-crust source during melting is regarded as fundamental for the formation of the fertile adakite and porphyry Cu systems in south Tibet. The Gangdese belt contains four large, and three intermediate- and small-sized porphyry Cu-Mo deposits, and shows a continuous spectrum from typical porphyry-type Cu-Mo to skarn-type Zn-Pb mineralization. Twenty-three samples collected from four deposits yielded a limited range of molybdenite Re-Os isochron ages from 15.2 to 16.0 Ma, similar to previously-reported Re-Os ages (13.8 to 14.9 Ma) for other porphyry Cu-Mo deposits in the belt, suggesting that Cu-Mo mineralization in the belt occurred in a post-collisional extension environment.
   The characteristics of porphyry Cu-Mo deposits in the collisional zone are similar in many aspects to those in arc settings, i.e., mineralization style, alteration zoning, and metal association. Preliminary fluid inclusion studies indicate that the early hydrothermal fluids are preserved as high temperature (>= 450 degrees C), high salinity (40 to 47 wt.% NaCl equiv.) and high pressure (>= 1100 to 1500 bar) fluid inclusions. These fluids are interpreted to represent an orthomagmatic fluid that boiled episodically due to fluid overpressuring and hydrofracturing, resulting in potassic alteration and precipitation of chalcopyrite-molybdenite assemblages. On the basis of comparison with porphyry Cu deposits in arc settings, we proposed that melting of thickened, newly-formed basaltic crust resulted in generation of Cu-bearing magmatic systems in the Tibetan collision zone, and both orogen-transverse normal faults and orogen-parallel thrust zones during the Miocene post-collisional extension constrain the temporal and spatial localization of the porphyry Cu systems in the collision zone.

AB  - The biosensor technology has the potential to revolutionize the aquaculture industry, but the selection of tagging method, operational mode (stand-alone vs. wireless systems) and telemetry technology ultimately depends on life species, life stage and research question. In particular, AEFishBIT is a small and stand-alone device composed of a tri-axial accelerometer, a microprocessor, a battery and a RFID tag that was designed to be externally attached to the operculum. This unique location serves to provide simultaneous measurements of activity patterns (signals of x- and y-axes) and respiratory frequency (z-axis signal) processed by on-board algorithms. The validity of measurements was initially proved in exercised fish in a swim tunnel respirometer, and its use as a reliable tool for the individual monitoring of whole-organism traits in free-swimming gilthead sea bream was tested herein in fish facing a wide range of biotic and abiotic stressors. The impact of the tagging method, based on the use of monel piercing fish tags with a flexible heat shrink polyethylene ring, was also evaluated and no signs of growth impairment, operculum damage or gill lamellae haemorrhage were found 10 days post-tagging. The autonomy of the device was 6 h of continuous recording with re-programmable lag times and recording schedules of 2 min windows at regular intervals along the experimental period (2?8 days). Such procedure underlined a negative linear correlation between fasting weight loss and operculum breaths, becoming respiratory frequency a reliable indicator of basal metabolic rates. Biosensing signals also highlighted the more continuous physical activity and increased respiratory rates of young fish when comparisons were made between one- and three-year old fish. Also, AEFishBIT measurements evidenced a generalized increase of respiratory frequency during severe hypoxia (2?3 ppm), but the individuals classified as proactive fish also shared an increased physical activity for supporting escape reactions in a milieu with low oxygen availability. Likewise, we also observed an overall increase of physical activity with the decrease of tank space availability, which can contribute to establish stricter criteria of welfare in farmed fish. Finally, the reduction of respiratory frequency was a consistent diagnostic marker of the progression of parasitic enteritis in experimentally infected fish with the myxozoan Enteromyxum leei. Altogether, this work constitutes the proof of concept of the use of biosensor technology as a reliable tool for an individual whole-organism behavioural profiling of farmed fish at laboratory scale, contributing to improve animal welfare and productivity of aquaculture industry.

AB  - A semantic model for overall welfare assessment of Atlantic salmon reared in sea cages is presented. The model, called SWIM 1.0, is designed to enable fish farmers to make a formal and standardized assessment of fish welfare using a set of selected welfare indicators. In order to cover all welfare relevant aspects from the animals' point of view and to create a science-based tool we first identified the known welfare needs of Atlantic salmon in sea cages and searched the literature for feasible welfare indicators. The framework of semantic modelling was used to perform a structured literature review and an evaluation of each indicator. The selected indicators were water temperature, salinity, oxygen saturation, water current, stocking density, lighting, disturbance, daily mortality rate, appetite, sea lice infestation ratio, condition factor, emaciation state, vertebral deformation, maturation stage, smoltification state, fin condition and skin condition. Selection criteria for the indicators were that they should be practical and measureable on the farm, that each indicator could be divided into levels from good to poor welfare backed up by relevant scientific literature. To estimate each indicator's relative impact on welfare, all the indicators were weighted based on their respective literature reviews and according to weighting factors defined as part of the semantic modelling framework. This was ultimately amalgamated into an overall model that calculates welfare indexes for salmon in sea cages. More importantly, the model identifies how each indicator contributes (negatively and positively) to the overall index and hence which welfare needs are compromised or fulfilled.

AB  - Deployment of lethal food baits could become a control tactic for the invasive European fire ant (EFA), Myrmica rubra L. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), because foraging ants carry the lethal food to their nest and share it with their nest mates, ultimately causing the demise of nests. Our objective was to develop a food bait that elicits a strong foraging response from EFAs, has extended shelf life, and is cost-effective to produce. To develop a bait composition with 'ant appeal', we ran two separate field experiments testing pre-selected carbohydrate sources (oranges, apples, bananas) and protein/lipid sources [tuna, pollen, sunflower seeds, mealworms (Tenebrio molitor L., Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)]. Whereas foraging EFAs responded equally well to the three types of carbohydrates, they preferred mealworms to all other protein/lipid sources. In a follow-up laboratory experiment, the combination of apples and mealworms elicited a stronger foraging response from EFAs than either apples or mealworms alone. To help reduce bait ingredient costs, we tested house crickets, Acheta domesticus (L.) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), as a less expensive mealworm alternative and found crickets and mealworms comparably appealing. Addressing the shelf life of baits, we tested freeze-dried and heat-dried apple/cricket combinations. Rehydrated freeze-dried baits proved as appealing as fresh baits and superior to rehydrated heat-dried baits, suggesting that freeze-drying may retain essential nutrients and/or aroma constituents. Insecticide-laced baits had no off-putting effect on foraging responses of worker ants and caused significant mortality. As freeze-drying is expensive, further research should investigate the preservation of moist food baits or the development of dry baits that are hydrated prior to deployment.

AB  - The essential oil of basil (Ocimum basilicum) has significant biological activity against insect pests and can be extracted through various techniques. This work aimed to optimize and validate the extraction process of the essential oil ofO. basilicumsubmitted to different drying temperatures of the leaves and extracted by the combination of a Clevenger method and ultrasound. The biological activity of the extracted oil under different conditions was evaluated for potential control ofSitophilus zeamais. The extraction method was optimized according to the sonication time by ultrasound (0, 8, 19, 31 and 38 min) and hydrodistillation (20, 30, 45, 60 and 70 min) and drying temperature (20, 30, 45, 60 and 70 degrees C). The bioactivity of the essential oil was assessed against adults ofS. zeamaisand the effects of each variable and its interactions on the mortality of the insects were evaluated. The best yield of essential oil was obtained with the longest sonication and hydrodistillation times and the lowest drying temperature of leaves. Higher toxicity of the essential oil againstS. zeamaiswas obtained by the use of ultrasound for its extraction. The identification and the relative percentage of the compounds of the essential oil were performed with a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass selective detector. The performance of the method was assessed by studying selectivity, linearity, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), precision and accuracy. The LOD and LOQ values for linalool were 2.19 and 6.62 mu g mL(-1)and for estragole 2.001 and 6.063 mu g mL(-1), respectively. The coefficients of determination (R-2) were >0.99. The average recoveries ranged between 71 and 106%, with coefficient of variation <= 6.4%.

TI  - Crowd-Based Learning of Spatial Fields for the Internet of Things From harvesting of data to inference
T2  - IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE
LA  - English
AB  - The knowledge of spatial distributions of physical quantities, such as radio-frequency (RF) interference, pollution, geomagnetic field magnitude, temperature, humidity, audio, and light intensity, will foster the development of new context-aware applications. For example, knowing the distribution of RF interference might significantly improve cognitive radio systems [1], [2]. Similarly, knowing the spatial variations of the geomagnetic field could support autonomous navigation of robots (including drones) in factories and/or hazardous scenarios [3]. Other examples are related to the estimation of temperature gradients, detection of sources of RF signals, or percentages of certain chemical components. As a result, people could get personalized health-related information based on their exposure to sources of risks (e.g., chemical or pollution). We refer to these spatial distributions of physical quantities as spatial fields. All of the aforementioned examples have in common that learning the spatial fields requires a large number of sensors (agents) surveying the area [4], [5].
   A common way to sense environmental variables is the deployment of dedicated wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which continues to stimulate fertile research activities in the scientific community. Typical WSN applications are oriented to sense specific physical quantities (e.g., temperature) in well-defined areas [6], [7]. Unfortunately WSNs are generally characterized by significant constraints in terms of deployment cost, energy limitation, and the need for maintenance. These constraints prevent them from becoming scalable and therefore from being the ultimate solution for automated and distributed sensing of the physical world.
   The expected pervasive diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices (fixed and mobile) opens up a unique opportunity for a wide and massive sensing and mapping (i.e., georeferencing of physical quantities). In fact, the IoT constitutes a paradigm where a multitude of heterogeneous devices is able to sense the environment, process data, and actuate, thus creating the necessary infrastructure for cyberphysical systems. This infrastructure galvanizes technologies such as smart grids, smart homes, smart cities, and intelligent transportation [8], [9].
   From the extensive variety of applications of the IoT, we are interested in those that will benefit from having a spatial coverage of a wide area due to a large number of agents navigating through it. For instance, this can be the case when devices are carried by people or autonomous agents (e.g., vehicles, robots, or drones) moving in outdoor-and indoor-populated environments like malls, stadiums, or crowded buildings. One can even imagine cities at large, if one considers much larger settings in size. Thanks to the widespread diffusion of IoT devices with heterogeneous sensors, the estimation of spatial physical fields is creating a new trend for next-generation sensor networks, referred to as mobile crowdsensing networks [10]-[13]. This is basically a zero-effort approach to automatically collect and process data. Recently, as an example, this concept has been proposed for zero-effort automatic mapping of environmental features using sensors already embedded in smartphones, such as magnetometers and Wi-Fi [14]-[17]. In such settings, the contribution of the agent to the sensing process is as simple as carrying the personal device in a pocket while the individual is moving around. Individuals are not even requested to be participatory, as the sensing process could run in the background during the normal operation of the device. In other words, agents are aware of the background sensing process, but they are not participatory in the sense that they are not requested to follow particular paths to make the learning process more effective. Thus, the sensing process is not an exclusive task, and it arises from the dynamic reality of humans or autonomous agents. The sensing process is a result of piggybacking on the capabilities of today's and future wireless personal devices. Including data generated by these devices will dramatically increase the amount of data for sensing and mapping purposes, with obvious benefits in terms of the resulting accuracy.
   In this context, the IoT is the technological enabler for crowdsensing and learning of spatial fields. Interestingly, IoT devices are, in general, able to communicate among themselves, either directly or through a fusion node that can potentially be in the cloud. Thanks to communication capabilities, empirical data gathered by mobile agents (the crowd) can be collected and processed by learning algorithms located in the cloud. These algorithms exploit the correspondence between the position and the value of the physical quantity measured in that position to estimate the spatial field. As a consequence, positioning and spatial field estimation are intimately intertwined, as will be illustrated in the "Sensing and Positioning" section.
   Crowdsourcing-based learning methods rely on the experience gained by previous agents. In principle, it is possible that, with crowd-based learning, one can perform optimal information fusion [10]. On the other hand, moving from the well-controlled conditions of WSN scenarios, where nodes are deployed in ad hoc known locations, to crowdsensing settings, where agents move around in an uncontrolled manner, entails a number of issues that need to be addressed. The methods rely on sharing through cloud mechanisms [18], but they can be of practical relevance in IoT applications only if their computational and memory requirements do not grow with the amount of collected data. Therefore, novel methodologies for multisensor data fusion and information processing are needed. They should guarantee efficient statistical representation of spatial fields and a computational complexity that does not depend on the number of measurements. Further, the algorithms need to be robust against irregular positioning and measurement errors.

AB  - Hydrogen sulphide (H2S) is toxic and can act as a selective pressure on aquatic organisms, facilitating a wide range of adaptations for life in sulphidic environments. Mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus) inhabit mangrove swamps and have developed high tolerance to environmental H2S. They are hermaphroditic and can self-fertilize, producing distinct isogenic lineages with different sensitivity to H2S. Here, we tested the hypothesis that observed differences in responses to H2S are the result of differences in mitochondria! functions. For this purpose, we performed two experimental series, testing (1) the overall mitochondrial oxidizing capacities and (2) the kinetics of apparent H2S mitochondrial oxidation and inhibition in two distinct lineages of mangrove rivulus, originally collected from Belize and Honduras. We used permeabilized livers from both lineages, measured mitochondrial oxidation, and monitored changes during gradual increases of sulphide. Ultimately, we determined that each lineage has a distinct strategy for coping with elevated H2S, indicating divergences in mitochondrial function and metabolism. The Honduras lineage has higher anaerobic capacity substantiated by higher lactate dehydrogenase activity and higher apparent H2S oxidation rates, likely enabling them to tolerate H2S by escaping aquatic H2S in a terrestrial environment. However, Belize fish have increased cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase activities as well as increased succinate contribution to mitochondrial respiration, allowing them to tolerate higher levels of aquatic H2S without inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Our study reveals distinct physiological strategies in genetic lineages of a single species, indicating possible genetic and/or functional adaptations to sulphidic environments at the mitochondrial level.

AB  - Recent studies have revealed repeated patterns of genomic divergence associated with species formation. Such patterns suggest that natural selection tends to target a set of available genes, but is also indicative that closely related taxa share evolutionary constraints that limit genetic variability. Studying patterns of genomic divergence among populations within the same species may shed light on the underlying evolutionary processes. Here, we examine transcriptome-wide divergence and polymorphism in the marine copepod Tigriopus californicus, a species where allopatric evolution has led to replicate sets of populations with varying degrees of divergence and hybrid incompatibility. Our analyses suggest that relatively small effective population sizes have resulted in an exponential decline of shared polymorphisms during population divergence and also facilitated the fixation of slightly deleterious mutations within allopatric populations. Five interpopulation comparisons at three different stages of divergence show that nonsynonymous mutations tend to accumulate in a specific set of proteins. These include proteins with central roles in cellular metabolism, such as those encoded in mtDNA, but also include an additional set of proteins that repeatedly show signatures of positive selection during allopatric divergence. Although our results are consistent with a contribution of nonadaptive processes, such as genetic drift and gene expression levels, generating repeatable patterns of genomic divergence in closely related taxa, they also indicate that adaptive evolution targeting a specific set of genes contributes to this pattern. Our results yield insights into the predictability of evolution at the gene level.

AB  - Bisphenol S (BPS) is an industrial chemical that is widely used to manufacture daily items, such as plastic water bottles, milk bottles, water cups, and paper products. BPS is a biologically toxic environmental endocrine dis-ruptor. Long-term exposure to BPS can disrupt the reproductive system, endanger health, and increase the risk of cancer. The metal-organic framework UiO-66 is characterised with high thermal and chemical stability, a simple synthetic route, and low preparation cost. In this study, we modified UiO-66 with nucleic acid aptamers to prepare an 'on-off-on' fluorescent sensor for the simple and rapid detection of BPS. The FAM-labelled aptamer was selected as the fluorescent probe (i.e. 'on'). In the presence of UiO-66, the FAM-labelled aptamer adsorbed onto the surface of the UiO-66 material, and the fluorescence of FAM was quenched by photoinduced electron transfer (i.e. 'off'). When BPS was introduced into the system, the configuration of the FAM-labelled aptamer changed after binding to BPS, and the adsorption of FAM on UiO-66 weakened, resulting in fluorescence recovery (i.e. 'on').Based on this principle, the reaction system was optimised, and the BPS content was analysed according to the change in the fluorescence signal. The signals changed linearly in the BPS concentration range of 2.0 x 10-4-4.0 x 10-2 mmol L-1, and the system had a detection limit of 1.84 x 10-4 mmol L-1. The sensor was successfully used to detect the BPS content in commercial plastic bottled water.

AB  - It is significant to detect lysozyme both in fundamental research and in clinical practice, since its concentration in body fluid is associated with many diseases. In this study, a new kind of sensor for rapid screening the lysozyme was fabricated based on the two-dimensional (2D) polystyrene colloidal crystal array together with the optimized hydrogel containing acrylamide-based functional groups. Distinct hydrogel volume shrink was observed due to the hydrogel crosslink induced by the functional ligand-protein interactions while the protein bound to the sensor. Therefore, the analyte concentration could be accessed by of the lattice spacing of the 2D colloidal crystal array, which was detected by a change in the Debye diffraction ring diameter. The lysozyme concentration could be easily monitored by measuring the diameter of the Debye diffraction ring in the pathophysiologic range. The particle spacing of 2D colloidal crystal hydrogel sensor increased to about 22 nm while lysozyme concentration increased from zero to 1.0 mg/mL, meanwhile the structural color of the sensor blue shifted from red to yellow. The detection limit was confirmed as 1.38 x 10(-3) mg/mL. The selective response to other common proteins in body fluids was also exhibited, indicating the great selective response properties to lysozyme. In addition, the 2D colloidal crystal hydrogel sensor was reusable to detect the lysozyme solution reversibly due to its thermal sensitivity. Moreover, the determination of lysozyme in artificial tears and human urine samples by this sensor demonstrated its feasibility in potential clinical analysis diagnosis.

AB  - This work focuses on the study of the aqueous alteration process which acted in the main belt and produced hydrated minerals on the altered asteroids. Hydrated minerals have been found mainly on Mars surface, on main belt primitive asteroids and possibly also on few TNOs. These materials have been produced by hydration of pristine anhydrous silicates during the aqueous alteration process, that, to be active, needed the presence of liquid water under low temperature conditions (below 320 K) to chemically alter the minerals. The aqueous alteration is particularly important for unraveling the processes occurring during the earliest times of the Solar System history, as it can give information both on the asteroids thermal evolution and on the localization of water sources in the asteroid belt.
   To investigate this process, we present reflected light spectral observations in the visible region (0.4-0.94 mu m) of 80 asteroids belonging to the primitive classes C (prevalently), G, F, B and P, following the Tholen (Tholen, D.J. [1984]. Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Arizona, Tucson). classification scheme. We find that about 65% of the C-type and all the G-type asteroids investigated reveal features suggesting the presence of hydrous materials, mainly a band centered around 0.7 mu m, while we do not find evidence of hydrated materials in the other low albedo asteroids (B, F, and P) investigated.
   We combine the present observations with the visible spectra of asteroids available in the literature for a total of 600 primitive main belt asteroids. We analyze all these spectra in a similar way to characterize the absorption band parameters (band center, depth and width) and spectral slope, and to look for possible correlations between the aqueous alteration process and the asteroids taxonomic classes, orbital elements, heliocentric distances, albedo and sizes. Our analysis shows that the aqueous alteration sequence starts from the P-type objects, practically unaltered, and increases through the P F B C G asteroids, these last being widely aqueous altered, strengthening thus the results previously obtained by Vilas (Vilas, F. [1994]. Icarus 111,456-467). Around 50% of the observed C-type asteroids show absorption feature in the visible range due to hydrated silicates, implying that more than similar to 70% of them will have a 3 mu m absorption band and thus hydrated minerals on their surfaces, based on correlations between those two absorptions (Howell, E.S. et al. [2011]. EPSC-DPS Joint Meeting 2011, vol. 6. Abstracts, 637).
   We find that the aqueous alteration process dominates in primitive asteroids located between 2.3 and 3.1 AU, that is at smaller heliocentric distances than previously suggested by Vilas et al. (Vilas, F., Hatch, E.C., Larson, S.M., Sawyer, S.R., Gaffey, M.J. [1993]. Icarus 102, 225-231). The percentage of hydrated asteroids is strongly correlated with their size. The aqueous alteration process is less effective for bodies smaller than 50 km, while it dominates in the 50-240 km sized primitive asteroids.
   No correlation is found between the aqueous alteration process and the asteroids albedo or orbital elements. Comparing the similar to 0.7 p,m band parameters of hydrated silicates and CM2 carbonaceous chondrites, the meteorites that have aqueous altered asteroids as parent bodies, we see that the band center of meteorites is at longer wavelengths than that of asteroids. This difference on center positions may be attributed to different minerals abundances, and to the fact that CM2 available on Earth might not be representative of the whole aqueous altered asteroids population.

AB  - The tandem process of carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol and its conversion to hydrocarbons over mixed metal/metal oxide-zeotype catalysts is a promising path to CO2 valorization. Herein, we report three Zn-doped ZrO2 catalysts prepared by co-precipitation of Zn- and Zr-containing salts to obtain three different loadings of Zn (5, 15 and 30 wt%). In the context of bifunctional catalysts, we combined ZrZnOX with two of the most performing zeolite/zeotype catalysts for the methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction: H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34. Catalytic testing at 250-350 degrees C and 20-40 bar revealed that H-ZSM-5 is more stable and more capable of converting methanol at low temperature, whereas H-SAPO-34 shows the highest C3 selectivity. The best performance was observed for the ZrZnOX sample with 30% Zn, combined with ZSM-5 at 350 degrees C, 30 bar and H-2/CO2/N-2 = 6/2/1. Under these conditions, the equilibrium methanol yield was observed after 0.4 s g(-1) ml(-1) over ZrZnOX alone. Mixing with ZSM-5 in a 1 : 1 weight ratio, methanol was rapidly converted to hydrocarbons, with an optimum C-3 productivity of 1.5 mol kg-1 h(-1) at 24000 ml h(-1) g(-1). An extensive surficial, textural and structural characterization of ZrZnOX alone was carried out by FT-IR spectroscopy, N-2 adsorption/desorption at liquid nitrogen temperature, PXRD and XAS. Formation of a ZrZnOX tetragonal solid solution was confirmed for all the samples (PXRD, XAS). The amount of Zr4+ sites at the surface was found to decrease, while the number of oxygen vacancies increased after H-2 treatment at 400 degrees C, coherent with an increase of Zn loading (FT-IR). DFT modelling pointed out that once a stoichiometric oxygen vacancy is induced by the presence of Zn, the formation of extra oxygen vacancies during activation is thermodynamically favored. Moreover, i) the oxygen vacancies were found to play an active role in CO2 hydrogenation, in accordance with experimental data, and ii) methanol is most likely formed via the formate pathway, and is energetically favored compared to CO formation, in agreement with the high methanol selectivity observed experimentally at low CO2 conversion. Importantly, operando-XAS, XPS, TEM and PXRD studies of the as-prepared, pretreated and tested catalysts showed that the structure and composition of the catalyst is not affected by the reaction. Indeed, a final catalytic test carried out on the regenerated ZrZnOX/H-ZSM-5 catalyst showed that the initial performances were completely restored and no Zn exchange in the zeolite was observed neither before nor after testing.

AB  - The Apuseni-Banat-Timok-Srednogorie magmatic-metallogenic belt (ABTS belt), forms a substantial metallogenic province in the Balkan-South Carpathian system in southeastern Europe. The belt hosts porphyry, skarn, and epithermal deposits mined since pre-Roman times. Generally, the deposits, prospects, and occurrences within the belt are linked to magmatic centers of calc-alkaline affinity. Fifty-one rhenium-osmium (Re-Os) ages and Re concentration data for molybdenites define systematic geochronologic trends and constrain the geochemical-metallogenic evolution of the belt in space and time. From these data and additional existing geologic-geochemical data, a general tectonic history for the belt is proposed. Mineralization ages in Apuseni-Banat, Timok, and Panagyurishte (the central district of the larger E-W Srednogorie Zone) range from 72-83, 81-88, and 87-92 Ma, respectively, and clearly document increasing age from the northwestern districts to the southeastern districts. Further, Re-Os ages suggest rapidly migrating pulses of Late Cretaceous magmatic-hydrothermal activity with construction of deposits in similar to 1 m.y., districts in similar to 10 m.y., and the entire 1,500 km belt in similar to 20 m.y. Ages in both Timok and Panagyurishte show systematic younging, while deposit ages in Banat and Apuseni are less systematic reflecting a restricted evolution of the tectonic system. Systematic differences are also observed for molybdenite Re concentrations on the belt scale. Re concentrations generally range from hundreds to thousands of parts per million, typical of subduction-related Cu-Au-Mo-(PGE) porphyry systems associated with the generation of juvenile crust. The geochronologic and geochemical trends are compatible with proposed steepening of subducting oceanic slab and relaxation of upper continental plate compression. Resulting influx of sub-continental mantle lithosphere (SCML) and asthenosphere provide a fertile metal source and heat, while the subducting slab contributes connate and mineral dehydration fluids, which facilitate partial melting and metal leaching of SCML and asthenosphere. Cu-Au-Mo-(PGE) porphyry deposits may develop where melts are trapped at shallow crustal levels, often with associated volcanism and epithermal-style deposits (South Banat, Timok, and Panagyurishte). Mo-Fe-Pb-Zn skarn deposits may develop where felsic melts are trapped adjacent to Mesozoic limestones at moderate crustal levels (North Banat and Apuseni). Systematic spatial variations in deposit style, commodity enrichment, Re-Os ages, and Re concentrations support specific tectonic processes that led to ore formation. In a post-collisional setting, subduction of Vardar oceanic crust may have stalled, causing slab steepening and rollback. The slab rollback relaxes compression, facilitating and enhancing orogenic collapse of previously thickened Balkan-South Carpathian crust. The progression of coupled rollback-orogenic collapse is evidenced by the width of Late Cretaceous extensional basins and northward younging of Re-Os ages, from Panagyurishte (similar to 60 km; 92-87 Ma) to Timok (similar to 20 km; 88-81 Ma) to Apuseni-Banat (similar to 5 km; 83-72 Ma). Generation of a well-endowed mineral belt, such as the ABTS, requires a temporally and spatially restricted window of magmatic-hydrothermal activity. This window is quickly opened as upper plate compression relaxes, thereby inducing melt generation and ingress of melt to higher crustal levels. The window is just as quickly closed as upper plate compression is reinstated.
   The transient tectonic state responsible for economc mineralization in the ABTS belt may be a paleo-analogue to transient intervals in the present subduction tectonics of SE Asia where much mineral wealth has been created in the last few million years.

AB  - Oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) document major perturbations of the global carbon cycle with repercussions for the Earth's climate and ocean circulation that are relevant to understanding future climate trends. Here, we compare the onset and development of Cretaceous OAE1a and OAE2 in two drill cores with unusually high sedimentation rates from the Vocontian Basin (southern France) and Tarfaya Basin (southern Morocco). OAE1a and OAE2 exhibit remarkable similarities in the evolution of their carbon isotope (delta C-13) records, with long-lasting negative excursions preceding the onset of the main positive excursions, supporting the view that both OAEs were triggered by massive emissions of volcanic CO2 into the atmosphere. However, there are substantial differences, notably in the durations of individual phases within the delta C-13 positive excursions of both OAEs. Based on analysis of cyclic sediment variations, we estimate the duration of individual phases within OAE1a and OAE2. We identify (1) a precursor phase (negative excursion) lasting similar to 430 kyr for OAE1a and similar to 130 kyr for OAE2, (2) an onset phase of similar to 390 and similar to 70 kyr, (3) a peak phase of similar to 600 and similar to 90 kyr, (4) a plateau phase of similar to 1340 and similar to 200 kyr, and (5) a recovery phase of similar to 380 and similar to 440 kyr. The total duration of the positive delta C-13 excursion is estimated at 2700 kyr for OAE1a and 790 kyr for OAE2, and that of the main carbon accumulation phase is estimated at 980 and 180 kyr. The long-lasting peak, plateau and recovery phases imply fundamental changes in global nutrient cycles either (1) by submarine basalt-seawater interactions, (2) through excess nutrient inputs to the oceans by increasing continental weathering and river discharge, or (3) through nutrient recycling from the marine sediment reservoir. We investigated the role of phosphorus in the development of carbon accumulation by analysing phosphorus speciation across OAE2 and the mid-Cenomanian Event (MCE) in the Tarfaya Basin. The ratios of organic carbon and total nitrogen to reactive phosphorus (C-org/P-react and N-total/P-react) prior to OAE2 and the MCE hover close to or below the Redfield ratio characteristic of marine organic matter. Decreases in reactive phosphorus resulting in C-org/P-react and N-total/P-react above the Redfield ratio during the later phase of OAE2 and the MCE indicate leakage from the sedimentary column into the water column under the influence of intensified and expanded oxygen minimum zones. These results suggest that a positive feedback loop, rooted in the benthic phosphorus cycle, contributed to increased marine productivity and carbon burial over an extended period of time during OAEs.

AB  - CONSPECTUS: As fossil-based energy sources become more depleted and with renewable-energy technologies still in a very early stage of development, the utilization of highly abundant methane as a transitional solution for current energy demands is highly important despite difficulties in transport and storage. Technologies enabling the conversion of methane to liquid/condensable energy carriers that can be easily transported and integrated into the existing chemical infrastructures are therefore essential. Although there commercially exists a two-step gas-to liquid process involving syngas production, a novel route of methane conversion that can circumvent the high-cost production of syngas should be developed. Among all of the conceptually possible methods for converting methane to methanol, methane hydroxylation (CH4 + O-1/2(2) -> CH3OH) at low temperature seems to be the most viable since it provides a direct route of conversion and allows a much lower operational cost. However, it is hampered by the fact that the complete oxidation to CO, is thermodynamically more favored. To overcome this, an effective catalyst that is able to "mildly" oxidize methane and stabilize the resultant methyl radical toward methanol formation is required. Particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) and copper-exchanged zeolites are two catalysts known to hydroxylate methane into methanol at low temperature with high selectivity. Having been studied for more than 30 years, these copper-cored catalysts are still relevant topics of discussion since the actual structure of the active sites has not been agreed upon, and thus, the reaction mechanism and factors influencing their reactivity and productivity are yet to be understood. Density functional theory (DFT) has provided us with a powerful computational tool for accomplishing these tasks.
   This Account presents an overview of the recent progress in the computational elucidation of the catalytic mechanism of methane hydroxylation by mono-, di-, and trinuclear copper sites in pMMO and Cu-exchanged zeolites as well as its correlations to the influencing factors that must be controlled to achieve higher reactivity. First, we briefly introduce the catalytic mechanism of a bare CuO+ cation as the simplest copper-oxo system in methane hydroxylation. The system is then extended to the copper-oxo species in pMMO and zeolites, and the radical and nonradical mechanisms are examined. Investigations of the reactivities of mononuclear and dinuclear copper-oxo species in the pMMO active site suggest that the bis(mu-oxo)(CuCuIII)-Cu-II, (mu-oxo)(mu-hydroxo)Cu(II)Cum(III), and (CuO)-O-III species are important for the catalytic activity of pMMO. In the case of Cu-exchanged zeolites, as the mono(mu-oxo)(CuCuII)-Cu-II and tris(mu-oxo)Cu(II)cu(III)cu(III) active sites have been fully characterized in experiments, here we discuss the effects of zeolite structures on the geometry and reactivity of the active sites.

AB  - It has been predicted that environmental changes will radically alter the selective pressures on phenological traits. Long-lived species, such as trees, will be particularly affected, as they may need to undergo major adaptive change over only one or a few generations. The traits describing the annual life cycle of trees are generally highly evolvable, but nothing is known about the strength of their genetic correlations. Tight correlations can impose strong evolutionary constraints, potentially hampering the adaptation of multivariate phenological phenotypes. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary, genetic and environmental components of the timing of leaf unfolding and senescence within an oak metapopulation along an elevation gradient. Population divergence, estimated from insitu and common-garden data, was compared to expectations under neutral evolution, based on microsatellite markers. This approach made it possible (1) to evaluate the influence of genetic correlation on multivariate local adaptation to elevation and (2) to identify traits probably exposed to past selective pressures due to the colder climate at high elevation. The genetic correlation was positive but very weak, indicating that genetic constraints did not shape the local adaptation pattern for leaf phenology. Both spring and fall (leaf unfolding and senescence, respectively) phenology timings were involved in local adaptation, but leaf unfolding was probably the trait most exposed to climate change-induced selection. Our data indicated that genetic variation makes a much smaller contribution to adaptation than the considerable plastic variation displayed by a tree during its lifetime. The evolutionary potential of leaf phenology is, therefore, probably not the most critical aspect for short-term population survival in a changing climate.

AB  - Host genetic resistance against disease-causing pathogens can be enhanced through family-based selective breeding. At present, there is an incomplete understanding of how artificial selection of fish alters host physiology and response following pathogen exposure. We previously reported the generation of selectively-bred rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss lines with either increased resistance (ARS-Fp-R) or susceptibility (ARS-Fp-S) to bacterial cold water disease (BCWD). This study (1) determined baseline reference-range intervals for packed cell volume (PCV) and 18 plasma biochemistry analytes, and (2) examined pathophysiological changes following infection between the genetic lines. PCV and biochemistry reference-range intervals did not significantly differ between genetic lines; thus data were pooled into a single reference-range population (n = 85). ARS-Fp-R and ARS-Fp-S line fish were intraperitoneally challenged with Flavobacterium psychrophilum, and plasma was collected on Days 1, 3, 6, and 9 post-challenge. Splenic bacterial load was measured using an F. psychrophilum-specific qPCR assay. In both genetic lines, changes were observed in mean PCV, total protein, albumin, glucose, cholesterol, chloride, and calcium, falling outside the established reference intervals and significantly differing from phosphate-buffered saline challenged fish, on at least 1 d post-challenge. Mean PCV, total protein, and calcium significantly differed between ARS-Fp-R and ARS-Fp-S line fish on Day 9 post-infection, with values in the ARS-Fp-S line deviating most from the reference interval. PCV, total protein, cholesterol, and calcium negatively correlated with bacterial load. These findings identify divergent pathophysiological responses between ARS-Fp-R and ARS-Fp-S line fish following laboratory challenge that are likely associated with differential survival.

AB  - Genetic resources of forest trees are considered as a key factor for the persistence of forest ecosystems because the ability of tree species to survive under changing climate depends strongly on their intraspecific variation in climate response. Therefore, utilizing available genetic variation in climate response and planting alternative provenances suitable for future climatic conditions is considered as an important adaptation measure for forestry. On the other hand, the distribution of adaptive genetic diversity of many tree species is still unknown and the predicted shift of ecological zones and species' distribution may threaten forest genetic resources that are important for adaptation. Here, we use Norway spruce in Austria as a case study to demonstrate the genetic variation in climate response and to analyse the existing network of genetic conservation units for its effectiveness to safeguard the hotspots of adaptive and neutral genetic diversity of this species. An analysis of the climate response of 480 provenances, clustered into 9 groups of climatically similar provenances, revealed high variation among provenance groups. The most productive and promising provenance clusters for future climates originate from three regions that today depict the warmest and driest areas of the natural spruce distribution in Austria. Gap analysis of the Austrian genetic conservation units in the EUFGIS Portal suggests adequate coverage of the genetic hotspots in southern parts of Austria, but not in eastern and northern Austria. Therefore conservation measures and sustainable utilization of the valuable genetic resources in these regions need to be expanded to cover their high adaptive genetic variation and local adaptation to a warmer climate. The study shows that current conservation efforts need to be evaluated for their effectiveness to protect genetic resources that are important for the survival of trees in a future climate.

AB  - Some endemic shrubs in arid and semiarid ecosystems are in danger of extinction, and yet they can play useful roles in maintaining or restoring these ecosystems, thus practical efforts are needed to conserve them. The shrubs Amygdalus pedunculata Pall., Amygdalus mongolica (Maxim.) Ricker and Ammopiptanthus mongolicus (Maxim. ex Kom.) Cheng f. are endemic species in arid and semiarid regions of northern China, where rangeland desertification is pronounced due to chronic overgrazing. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that these endemic shrubs have developed adaptations to arid and semiarid environments and could play critical roles as nurse species to initiate the process of rangeland recovery. Based on careful vegetation surveys, we analysed the niches of these species in relation to precipitation, temperature and habitats. All sampling plots were categorized by these endemics and sorted by the non-metric multidimensional scaling method. Species ratios of each life form and species co-occurrence rates with the endemics were also evaluated. Annual average temperature and annual precipitation were found to be the key factors determining vegetation diversity and distributions. Amygdalus pedunculata prefers low hills and sandy land in temperate semiarid regions. Amygdalus mongolica prefers gravel deserts of temperate semiarid regions. Ammopiptanthus mongolicus prefers sandy land of temperate arid regions. Communities of A. pedunculata have the highest diversity and the largest ratios of long-lived grass species, whereas those of A. mongolicus have the lowest diversity but the largest ratios of shrub species. Communities of A. mongolica are a transition between the first two community types. These findings demonstrate that our focal endemic shrubs have evolved adaptations to arid and semiarid conditions, thus they can be nurse plants to stabilize sand ground for vegetation restoration. We suggest that land managers begin using these shrub species to restore degraded rangelands as part of a general conservation effort.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a pathogenic bacterium capable of developing biofilms on food processing surfaces, a pathway leading to cross contamination of foods. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of S. aureus to form biofilm on food processing surfaces (polystyrene and stainless steel) with regard to different temperatures (12 and 37 degrees C) and cellular hydrophobicity. Biofilm assays were performed on n. 67 S. aureus isolates from food, food processing environments and food handlers and n. 3 reference strains (S. aureus ATCC 35556,S. aureus ATCC 12600 and S. epidermidis ATCC 12228). A strain-specific variation in biofilm formation within S. aureus strains tested was observed. At 37 degrees C, n. 38/67 (56.7%) of strains were biofilm producer in at least one tested surface. A total of n. 25/38 (65.7%) of strains were biofilm producer on polystyrene whereas n. 24/38 (63.1%) were biofilm producer on stainless steel. Moreover, n. 11/38 (28.9%) of strains were biofilm producers on both selected surfaces. The majority of S. aureus strains which produced biofilms (n. 17/38-44.7%), were isolated from food environments. At 12 degrees C, only one S. aureus strain from food handler (S. aureus 374) was biofilm producer. Cell surface hydrophobicity level increased with temperature. Additionally, a statistically significant difference (P < 0.001) was found between hydrophobicity at 37 degrees C and 12 degrees C. Finally, the architecture of biofilm formed by S. aureus strains on polystyrene and stainless steel surfaces at selected temperatures was observed by scanning electron microscopy. The appearance of thick extracellular products in strongly (S. aureus ATCC 35556 - positive control) and the absence of those products in the non-biofilm producer (S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 - negative control) is presented.

AB  - As new green solvents, ionic liquids (ILs) have been generally applied in the extraction and separation of natural product. In this study, microwave assisted extraction based on IL (IL-MAE) was firstly employed to extract total biflavonoids from Selaginella doederleinii. Based on single-factor experiment, microwave power (300-700 W), extract time (30-50 min) and extract temperature (40-60 degrees C) on total bioflavonoids and antioxidant activities of the extracts were further investigated by a Box-Behnken design of response surface methodology (RSM) selecting total bioflavonoids yields and IC50 of radical scavenging as index. Besides antioxidant activity of the extract was evaluated by a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydarzyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate (ABTS) radical scavenging assay, ferric reducing power assay and chelation of ferrous ions assay, and then anticaner activity was also researched against A549 cell line and 7721 cell line. The results illustrated that three factors and their interactions could be well suited for second-order polynomial models (p < 0.05). Through process parameters, optimization of the extract (460W, 40 min, and 45 degrees C) and detection of bioactivity, the yield of total bioflavonoids was 16.83 mg/g and IC50 value was 56.24 mu g/mL, respectively, indicating the extract has better anti-oxidation effect and antitumor activity. Furthermore, IL-MAE was the most efficient extracting method compared with MAE and Soxhlet extraction, which could improve extraction efficiency in a shorter time and at a lower temperature. In general, ILs-MAE was first adopted to establish a novel and green extraction process on the yields of total biflavonoids from S. doederleinii. In addition, the extract of containing biflavones showed potent antioxidant and anticancer capacity as a utilized valuable bioactive source for natural medicine.

AB  - Temperature plays a significant role in the survival and transmission of SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and SARS-CoV-2. To reveal the binding differences of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domains (RBDs) to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) at different temperatures at atomic level, 20 molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complexes at five selected temperatures, i.e. 200, 250, 273, 300 and 350 K. The analyses on structural flexibility and conformational distribution indicated that the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was more stable than that of the SARS-CoV RBD at all investigated temperatures. Then, molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area and solvated interaction energy approaches were combined to estimate the differences in binding affinity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to ACE2; it is found that the binding ability of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD was stronger than that to the SARS-CoV RBD at five temperatures, and the main reason for promoting such binding differences is electrostatic and polar interactions between RBDs and ACE2. Finally, the hotspot residues facilitating the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs to ACE2, the key differential residues contributing to the difference in binding and the interaction mechanism of differential residues that exist at all investigated temperatures were analyzed and compared in depth. The current work would provide a molecular basis for better understanding of the high infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 and offer better theoretical guidance for the design of inhibitors targeting infectious diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The intertidal salinity fluctuations provide pose a significant physical challenge for the crustaceans that live here. In the present study, Charybdis japonica was selected as the research species to explore the genetic regulatory mechanisms of intertidal crustaceans responding to salinity fluctuations. We cultured C. japonica s with three salinity gradients (the salinity of 15 parts per thousand, 25 parts per thousand, and 35 parts per thousand) and 68.90 Gb clean transcriptome reads were obtained by RNA-seq. All clean reads were then de novo assembled to 41,058 unigene with a mean length of 1,179.39 bp and an N50 length of 2,033 bp. Furthermore, a total of 18,100 (24.74%) unigenes were successfully matched with the sequences from at least one database. We further analyzed the transcriptome structure of C. japonica and a total of 26,853 CDSs and 12,190 SSRs were predicted. The gene expression levels of C. japonica at 25 parts per thousand were used as control, and 204 and 5,392 DEGs were found at the salinity of 35 parts per thousand and 15 parts per thousand, respectively. Based on the annotated information of DEGs, we speculated that C. japonicas were subjected to greater stress under the salinity of 35 parts per thousand and isotonic intracellular regulation was activated. Furthermore, neuronal activity, oxidation response, intracellular regulatory activity and osmotic regulation-related genes were speculated to be critical genes for C. japonica to cope with salinity fluctuations. The present results will provide fundamental information for revealing the salinity fluctuation-related genetic regulatory mechanisms of C. japonica and other intertidal crustaceans, and then help us predict how future salinity changes will affect the survival of crustaceans.

AB  - The members of the Nesterenkonia genus have been isolated from various habitats, like saline soil, salt lake, sponge-associated and the human gut, some of which are even located in polar areas. To identify their stress resistance mechanisms and draw a genomic profile across this genus, we isolated four Nesterenkonia strains from the lakes in the Tibetan Plateau, referred to as the third pole, and compared them with all other 30 high-quality Nesterenkonia genomes that are deposited in NCBI. The Heaps' law model estimated that the pan-genome of this genus is open and the number of core, shell, cloud, and singleton genes were 993 (6.61%), 2782 (18.52%), 4117 (27.40%), and 7132 (47.47%), respectively. Phylogenomic and ANI/AAI analysis indicated that all genomes can be divided into three main clades, named NES-1, NES-2, and NES-3. The strains isolated from lakes in the Tibetan Plateau were clustered with four strains from different sources in the Antarctic and formed a subclade within NES-2, described as NES-AT. Genome features of this subclade, including GC (guanine + cytosine) content, tRNA number, carbon/nitrogen atoms per residue side chain (C/N-ARSC), and amino acid composition, in NES-AT individuals were significantly different from other strains, indicating genomic adaptation to cold, nutrient-limited, osmotic, and ultraviolet conditions in polar areas. Functional analysis revealed the enrichment of specific genes involved in bacteriorhodopsin synthesis, biofilm formation, and more diverse nutrient substance metabolism genes in the NES-AT clade, suggesting potential adaptation strategies for energy metabolism in polar environments. This study provides a comprehensive profile of the genomic features of the Nesterenkonia genus and reveals the possible mechanism for the survival of Nesterenkonia isolates in polar areas.

AB  - Understanding what determine plants ability to survive drought and cold is crucial for predicting how plants may respond to ongoing climate change. Plant survival strategies are usually characterized by morphological and physiological adaptations, while their underlying anatomical settings are largely unknown. Woody angiosperms and herbaceous dicots have repeatedly evolved small water transporting conduits and large storage parenchyma tissues at colder or drier places to cope with freezing- and drought-induced damages. However, whether these adaptations are also valid for graminoids remains unclear. Here we show that stem anatomical variations in grasses, sedges and rushes dominating in western Himalayan grasslands are driven by elevation and soil moisture via control over aboveground plant stature and belowground clonal growth, while phylogenetic constraints have only a weak effect. Phylogenetic comparative analyses controlling for confounding factors showed that the elevation-related cooling controls the conductive system through reduced vessel diameter and extended assimilatory and storage tissues with more chlorenchyma and less sclerenchyma around vessels. The soil moisture deficit, on the other hand, determines stabilization structures by promoting short-rhizomatous turf graminoids with hollow stems, thicker epidermis and deep adventitious roots in dry steppes and semi-deserts. Saline wetlands and moist alpine pastures promote long-rhizomatous short-stature plants with lower need for mechanical support (absence of hollow stem) and exposure to high evaporative forcing (thinner epidermis). Observed trends of decreasing vessel sizes and lignification rate with elevation supports the existing knowledge that narrower vessels and extensive parenchyma assist plants to grow in cold environments by avoiding freezing-induced cavitation. Our results bring novel information on ecological drivers influencing the evolution of anatomical adaptations in high mountain graminoids. Distinct grassland types, covering elevations from 2650 to 6150 m, harbor unrelated species with different evolutionary histories that have converged towards similar anatomical structures.

AB  - Similar to Escherichia coli O157, non-O157 also inherits certain acid resistance, and its stress response can be induced under acidic conditions, which may be affected by temperature. In this study, O26, the main serotype of non-O157 E. coli, was investigated in order to evaluate the effect of lactic acid stress on its biofilm formation (BF) at different temperatures. Firstly, the BF ability of 22 isolates of E. coli O26 were compared by means of crystal violet staining and the result showed that all strains had certain BF ability with variation among strains. Then, the strain 126Z with strong capacity and strain G13Z2 with medium capacity were selected for BF experiment in acidic TSB (pH 4.0 and 5.0, adjusted with lactic acid) at 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. The results showed that the BF of O26 was decreased with increasing concentration of lactic acid, and the higher the concentration of lactic acid was, the less the amount of biofilm formed. Moreover, the effect of temperature on BF of different capacity strains was related to the pH value, that is, with a lower concentration of lactic acid, the higher the temperature was, the faster the biofilm amount increased. Under a higher acid concentration, the BF of two strains showed different dynamic changes and were inhibited in the later stage, in which the biofilm amount of 126Z decreased significantly at 15 degrees C, while that of G13Z2 decreased more significant at 25 degrees C. This observation was further confirmed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). This finding suggests that combined temperature and lactic acid intervention may be an effective method to prevent BF, and the results of present work would provide scientific basis for the risk assessment of E. coli O26 in food processing.

AB  - The subfamily Bromelioideae is one of the most diverse groups among the neotropical Bromeliaceae. Previously, key innovations have been identified which account for the extraordinary radiation and species richness of this subfamily, especially in the so-called core Bromelioideae. However, in order to extend our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms, the genomic mechanisms (e.g.polyploidy, dysploidy) that potentially underlie this accelerated speciation also need to be tested. Here, using PI and DAPI staining and flow cytometry we estimated genome size and GC content of 231 plants covering 30 genera and 165 species and combined it with published data. The evolutionary and ecological significance of all three genomic characters was tested within a previously generated dated phylogenetic framework using ancestral state reconstructions, comparative phylogenetic methods, and multiple regressions with climatic variables. The absolute genome size (2C) of Bromelioideae varied between 0.59 and 4.11 pg, and the GC content ranged between 36.73 and 41.43%. The monoploid genome sizes (Cx) differed significantly between core and early diverging lineages. The occurrence of dysploidy and polyploidy was, with few exceptions, limited to the phylogenetically isolated early diverging tank-less lineages. For Cx and GC content Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models outperformed the Brownian motion models suggesting adaptive potential linked to the temperature conditions. 2C-values revealed different rates of evolution in core and early diverging lineages also related to climatic conditions. Our results suggest that polyploidy is not associated with higher net diversification and fast radiation in core bromelioids. On the other hand, although coupled with higher extinction rates, dysploidy, polyploidy, and resulting genomic reorganizations might have played a role in the survival of the early diverging bromelioids in hot and arid environments.

AB  - Variable hydropower production leads to hydropeaking, which causes discharge fluctuations that are potentially harmful to aquatic organisms. In this study, an experimental approach was used to investigate hydropeaking effects and associated hydraulic and habitat conditions on the home range and movement of juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. Prior studies examined the responses of Atlantic salmon and brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis to experimental hydropeaking during summer and autumn. The present study focused on Atlantic salmon, involved more rapid and extreme discharge manipulation, and included winter experiments to reflect influences of reduced temperature, ice conditions, and seasonal differences in behavior and habitat selection. Experiments were conducted over a range in discharge (0.5-5.0 m(3)/s) that resulted in dramatic habitat changes in the wide, shallow, boulder-strewn study reach. Experiments were repeated in summer and winter; however, the winter range in discharge was narrower due to constraints on water release. Fish response was monitored using manual telemetry in both seasons, and fixed telemetry was used to monitor fine-scale diet winter movements. Atlantic salmon had larger home ranges and were more mobile during all flow conditions and over diet cycles in summer than in winter, and there was anecdotal evidence of stranding in isolated pools in summer. Stream morphology, in addition to the magnitude of discharge change, was an important determinant of the propensity to move. In our study, there were considerable refugia from increased velocity and dewatering, which may have reduced the need to move. In winter, fish remained relatively sedentary in comparison with the summer foraging period, and this behavior may increase the likelihood for dewatering, stranding, and freezing. A secondary concern with hydropeaking regimes is the energetic cost to fish of moving to find suitable habitats, and during summer this cost could affect stored energy reserves, which could, in turn, affect overwinter survival.

AB  - At the FRS Ion Catcher at GSI, projectile and fission fragments are produced at relativistic energies, separated in-flight, range-focused, slowed down and thermalized in a cryogenic stopping cell. A multiple-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MR-TOF-MS) is used to perform direct mass measurements and to provide an isobarically clean beam for further experiments, such as mass-selected decay spectroscopy. A versatile RF quadrupole transport and diagnostics unit guides the ions from the stopping cell to the MR-TOF-MS, provides differential pumping, ion identification and includes reference ion sources. The FRS Ion Catcher serves as a test facility for the Low-Energy Branch of the Super-FRS at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR), where the cryogenic stopping cell and the MR-TOF-MS will be key devices for the research with stopped projectile and fission fragments that will be performed with the experiments MATS and LaSpec. Off-line tests of the stopping cell yield a combined ion survival and extraction efficiency for Rn-219 ions of about 30% and an extraction time of about 25 ms. The stopping cell and the MR-TOF-MS were commissioned on-line as part of the FRS Ion Catcher. For the first time, a stopping cell for exotic nuclei was operated on-line at cryogenic temperatures. Using a gas density almost two times higher than ever reached before for a stopping cell with RF ion repelling structures, various U-238 projectile fragments were thermalized and extracted with very high efficiency. Direct mass measurements of projectile fragments were performed with the MR-TOF-MS, among them the nuclide Rn-213 with a half-life of 19.5 ms only. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The performance of two potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains from olive microbiota, namely L pentosus B281 and L plantarum B282 was assessed as starter cultures in Spanish-style fermentation of heat shocked green olives cv. Halkidiki. Two different initial salt levels were studied, 10% (w/v) and 8% (w/v) NaCl, and the brines were inoculated with (a) L. pentosus B281, (b) L plantarum B282, and (c) a mixture of both strains. A spontaneous fermentation was also taken into account as control treatment Prior to brining, olives were heat shocked at. 80 degrees C for 10 min to reduce the level of the indigenous microbiota on olive drupes and facilitate the dominance of the inoculated cultures. Microbiological, physicochemical and sensory analyses were conducted throughout fermentation. The composition of LAB population and the evolution of added inocula were assessed by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). The final population of LAB was maintained above 6 log cycles in olive flesh. Both L pentosus B281 and L plantarum B282 were able to dominate over indigenous LAB, albeit strain B281 exhibited higher recovery percentages (100 or 94.7% for B281 and 58.8% or 55.0% for B282 in 10% or 8% NaCl, respectively). L pentosus B281 also dominated over L plantarum B282, when the two strains were co-inoculated in olive fermentations. The sensory assessment showed higher preference for inoculated fermentations of L pentosus and L plantarum separately in 8% NaCl, followed by the L plantarum in 10% NaCl.

AB  - Movements, distribution, and roosting requirements of most species of temperate-zone bats in autumn are poorly understood. We conducted the 1st radiotelemetry study of autumn migrations and prehibernation roost selection of bats in western North America. Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus, n = 55) in the Poudre River watershed, Colorado, moved from low-elevation summer ranges to high-elevation locations in autumn, where they roosted in rock crevices during the period leading up to winter hibernation. We characterized rock crevices used as roosts in autumn at these higher elevations at microhabitat and landscape scales. We used logistic regression combined with an information theoretic approach to determine which variables were most important in roost selection. At the microhabitat scale, autumn roosts were higher to the ground above and below the exit point and were in deeper crevices that had more constant temperatures than randomly selected crevices. At the landscape scale, aspect of the hillside was important, with autumn roosts typically facing north-northwest. Autumn roosts fell into 2 categories: those used for a few days (transient roosts) and those used for >= 7 days and presumed to be hibernacula. Temperature regimes in the presumed hibernacula appear to provide optimal conditions for use of winter torpor, whereas transient roosts may offer passive rewarming and energy savings for bats still active in early autumn. Elevational segregation of sexes also was documented in our region, with a preponderance of females found at lower elevations and males at higher elevations in summer. Sex ratios at higher elevations became even in autumn. Use of short elevational migrations and selection of hibernation sites in rock crevices may be a common overwintering strategy of insectivorous bats of western North America.

AB  - Lodgepole pines, Pinus contorta Douglas ex Louden var. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Watson, are encountering increased abiotic stress and pest activity due to recent increases in temperature and changes in precipitation throughout their range. This tree species counters these threats by producing secondary metabolites, including phenolics and terpenoids. We examined foliar levels of lignin, soluble phenolics, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and diterpenoids in 12 stands in British Columbia, Canada. We used these data to assess associations among foliar secondary metabolite levels and ecosystem, geographic, and climatic variables. Regressions were also performed to observe which combinations of variables best explained secondary metabolite variance. Stands of P. c. latifolia in the Coastal Western Hemlock and Interior Cedar/Hemlock biogeoclimatic zones had consistently greater foliar levels of almost all measured secondary metabolites than did other stands. Lignin was present in greater amounts in Boreal White/Black Spruce ecosystem (i.e., northern) stands than in southern stands, suggesting a role for this metabolite in pine survival in the boreal forest. Attempts to develop regression models with geographic and climatic variables to explain foliar secondary metabolite levels resulted in multiple models with similar predictive capability. Since foliar secondary metabolite levels appeared to vary most between stand ecosystem types and not as much due to geographic and climatic variables, metabolic profiles appeared best matched to the stress levels within local environments. It is unknown if differences in secondary metabolite levels are the result of genetic adaptation or phenotypic plasticity, but results from this and other studies suggest that both are important. These results are interpreted in light of ongoing efforts to assist in the migration of certain populations of P. c. latifolia northward in an effort to counter predicted effects of climate change.

AB  - Fishborne diseases are among the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Contamination of the aquatic ecosystem and unhygienic handling practices along the fish supply chain can lead to a contaminated fish. Consumption of raw or under cooked fish and fish products is a major source of fishborne infections in humans. Despite reports of fish contamination with foodborne pathogens in Ethiopia, information regarding the hygienic status of fish handling practices is limited. We assessed fish hygienic handling practices at production sites and along the fish supply chain in three towns in east Shewa zone of Oromia. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire interviews and personal observations. The study consisted of purposively selected respondents comprising of 50 fishermen, 10 retailers, 20 food establishments serving fish, and 120 consumers. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were used to present the proportion of various actors along the fish production and supply chain and to compare the proportions of observations among the different categories respectively. We observed that the lakes were accessible to animals and exposed to chemical and microbial contaminations through rainwater run-off. Fish were processed under unhygienic practices like washing of filleted fish with lake water, indiscriminate processing at unhygienic landing sites, use of a single knife for processing all fish with infrequent washing and with no disinfection in between. Majority (70%; n = 10) of the retailers and all the food establishments transported fish in vehicles with no cold chain facilities. Good hygienic practices we observed were the use of refrigerators for storage in all retailers and 70% (n = 20) of the food establishments; 30% of retailers used vehicles with a cold chain facility for the transportation of fish. Over three-fourths (77%; n = 120) of the consumers preferred consuming raw fish; 80% of them lacked the knowledge of fishborne diseases. The study revealed a wide range of unhygienic handling practices along fish production and supply chain; lack of infrastructure for post-harvest fish handling and processing, lack of appropriate transportation facilities and presence of knowledge gaps regarding fish borne diseases.

AB  - The effects of fresh thalli and culture medium filtrates from two species of marine macroalgae, Ulva pertusa Kjellm (Chlorophyta) and Gracilaria lemaneiformis (Bory) Dawson (Rhodophyta), on growth of marine microalgae were investigated in co-culture under controlled laboratory conditions. A selection of microalgal species were used, all, being identified as bloom-forming dinoflagellates: Prorocentrum donghaiense Lu sp., Alexandrium tamarense (Lebour) Balech, Amphidinium carterae Hulburt and Scrippsiella trochoide (Stein) Loeblich III. Results showed that the fresh thalli of either U. pertusa or G. lemaneiformis significantly inhibited the microalgal growth, or caused mortality at the end of the experiment. However, the overall effects of the macroalgal culture filtrates on the growth of the dinoflagellates were species-specific (inhibitory, stimulatory or none) for different microalgal species. Results indicated an allelopathic effect of macroalga on the co-cultured dinoflagellate. We then took P. donghaiense as an example to further assess this hypothesis. The present study was carried out under controlled conditions, thereby excluded the fluctuation in light and temperature. Nutrient assays showed that nitrate and phosphate were almost exhausted in G. lemaneiformis co-culture. but remained at enough high levels in U pertusa co-culture, which were well above the nutrient limitation for the microalgal growth, when all cells of P. donghaiense were killed in the co-culture. Daily f/2 medium enrichment greatly alleviated the growth inhibition on P. donghaiense in G. lemaneiformis co-culture, but could not eliminate it. Other environmental factors, such as carbonate limitation, bacterial presence and the change of pH were also not necessary for the results. We thus concluded that allelopathy was the most possible reason leading to the negative effect of U. pertusa on P. donghaiense, and the combined roles of allelopathy and nutrient competition were essential for the effect of G. lemaneiformis on P. donghaiense.

AB  - Africanized honey bee populations (Apis mellifera L.) have been decreasing mainly due to the intense use of synthetic insecticides associated with pollution and climate change. To minimize these impacts on the environment and bee populations, the use of biological control agents has been intensified. These products are generally safer for non-target insects, such as bees, which are important pollinating insects. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of entomopathogenic nematodes on the longevity of the Africanized honey bee A. mellifera workers. Seven treatments were used: Heterorhabditis amazonensis, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, Heterorhabditis indica, Steinernema carpocapsae, Steinernema feltiae, and Steinernema rarum, at a concentration of 40 infective juveniles per cm(2) (IJs/cm(2)), and a control in which autoclaved distilled water was used. Two bioassays were performed: 1) spraying nematodes on the workers and 2) spraying nematodes on glass plates, in which the bees remained for two hours. Each treatment consisted of five replicates with 20 bees each. Bees were kept in cages of PVC (20 x 10 cm) covered with a voile fabric and provided pieces of cotton soaked in water and Candy paste. The cages were kept in a climatized room (27 +/- 2 degrees C temperature, 60 +/- 10% relative humidity, and 12 h photophase) and the mortality was evaluated from 12 to 240 hours. In bioassay 1, the three treatments with nematodes of the genus Steinernema reduced the longevity of the workers (103.9, 96.3, and 99.6 h) when compared to treatments with Heterorhabditis (149.7, 126.8, and 134.7 h), of which, only H. amazonensis (149.7 h) did not differ from the control (166.0 h). In bioassay 2, all treatments reduced the longevity of honey bees (155.4 to 93.9 h) in relation to the control (176.1 h). Entomopathogenic nematodes, especially Heterorhabditis, need to be tested using other methodologies and for different durations of exposure and application because in the laboratory, they were less selective to A. mellifera.

KW  - DEFINITION
AB  - P>1. Climate extremes, such as severe drought, heat waves and periods of heavy rainfall, can have profound consequences for ecological systems and for human welfare. Global climate change is expected to increase both the frequency and the intensity of climate extremes and there is an urgent need to understand their ecological consequences.
   2. Major challenges for advancing our understanding of the ecological consequences of climate extremes include setting a climatic baseline to facilitate the statistical determination of when climate conditions are extreme, having sufficient knowledge of ecological systems so that extreme ecological responses can be identified, and finally, being able to attribute a climate extreme as the driver of an extreme ecological response, defined as an extreme climatic event (ECE).
   3. The papers in this issue represent a cross-section of the emerging field of climate extremes research, including an examination of the palaeo-ecological record to assess patterns and drivers of extreme ecological responses in the late Quaternary, experiments in grasslands assessing a range of ecological responses and the role of ecotypic variation in determining responses to climate extremes, and the quantification of the ecological consequences of a recent ECE in the desert Southwest of the USA.
   4. Synthesis. The papers in this Special Feature suggest that although the occurrence of ECEs may be common in palaeo-ecological and observational studies, studies in which climate extremes have been experimentally imposed often do not result in ecological responses outside the bounds of normal variability of a system. Thus, ECEs occur much less frequently than their potential drivers and even less frequently than observational studies suggest. Future research is needed to identify the types and time-scales of climate extremes that result in ECEs, the potential for interactions among different types of climate changes and extremes, and the role of genetic, species and trait diversity in determining ecological responses and their evolutionary consequences. These research priorities require the development of alternative research approaches to impose realistic climate extremes on a broad range of organisms and ecosystems.

AB  - As global climate change continues to impact regional water cycles, we may expect further shifts in water availability to forests that create challenges for certain species and biomes. Lowland deciduous riparian forests are particularly vulnerable because tree species cannot migrate out of the stream corridor, and they rely on root zone water availability that is controlled by variations in both local climate conditions (e.g. precipitation, evaporation, and infiltration) and non-local hydroclimatic forcing (e.g. streamflow, snowmelt, recharge). To determine how the seasonal water source usage of riparian trees is controlled by local versus non-local variability in hydroclimatic regime, we reconstructed the seasonal oxygen isotope (delta (18) O) signature of water used by two riparian tree species with contrasting rooting depths, comprising similar to 800 delta (18) O tree-ring cellulose measurements from 12 tree-level decadal time-series at sub-annual resolution (six samples per year), along a strong hydroclimatic gradient within the Rhone River basin, SE France. These results were evaluated alongside delta (18) O measurements made from potential endmember water sources and independent hydroclimatic metrics. Thus we characterize the seasonal evolution of both potential water availability at distinct rooting depths and tree water source use and investigate the generalized riparian tree response to seasonal variations in local versus non-local hydroclimatic forcing over a decade. We show: (a) distinct seasonal water use between species, based on differential access to groundwater; (b) substantial source switching in both species based on evolving water availability; and (c) that riparian trees are more dependent on locally controlled soil moisture with distance downstream, creating increased vulnerability to locally increasing temperatures. We also find that deeply rooted trees in lowland riparian floodplains are potentially vulnerable to climate change because of their high dependence on water supply from mountains. This effect is more pronounced downstream, where seasonal water table decline may lead to loss of water required for deeply rooted trees.

AB  - The growth behavior of coexisting tree species under climate change is important from an ecological, silvicultural and economic perspective. While many previous studies are concerned with climatic limits for species occurrence, we focus on climate related shifts in interspecific competition. A landmark for these changes in competition is the 'climatic turning point' (CTP): those climate conditions under which a rank reversal between key tree species occurs. Here, we used a common type of temperate mixed forest in Central Europe with European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) to explore the CTP under a future climate projection of increasing temperature and aridity. We selected a dry region where the prerequisite of differential climate sensitivity in mixed beech-oak forests was fulfilled: In-situ dendrochronological analyses demonstrated that the currently more competitive beech was more drought sensitive than sessile oak. We then used two complementary forest growth models, namely SILVA and LandClim, to investigate the climate induced rank-reversal in species dominance and to quantify it as the CTP from beech to oak by simulating future forest development from the WETTREG 2010 A1B climate projection. Utilizing two models allowed us to draw conclusions robust against the assumptions of a particular model. Both models projected a CTP at a mean annual temperature of 11-12 degrees C (July temperature > 18 degrees C) and a precipitation sum of 500-530 mm. However, the change in tree species composition can exhibit a time-lag of several decades depending on past stand development and current stand structure. We conclude that the climatic turning point is a simple yet effective reference measure to study climate related changes in interspecific competition, and confirm the importance of competition sensitivity in climate change modeling.

AB  - The San Rafael Sn-Cu deposit, located at lat 14degrees13'58" S, long 70degrees19'18".W, on the upper slopes of the Cordillera de Carabaya, nor-them Puno Department, southeastern Peru, yielded 38,182 t of fine tin in 2001 and, with reserves of 14.460 Mt at 5.14 percent Sri, the main San Rafael Lode constitutes, both at present and historically, the largest-known bonanza-grade cassiterite repository. Sri and subordinate Cu mineralization were confined to laterally and vertically extensive brittle shear zones generated by regional tectonism that transect a small 24.65 +/- 0.20 Ma, epizonal stock of strongly peraluminous, Lachlan S-type cordierite-biotite monzogranite and granodiorite. Early, barren, stage I quartz-tourmaline veins and breccias were emplaced at 24.10 +/- 0.15 Ma by high-temperature (less than or equal to580degreesC), boiling, saline fluids that plausibly directly exsolved from the granitic melt, whereas both cassiterite (stage II) and, at higher elevations, chalcopyrite (stage III) ores were precipitated from largely nonboiling, cooler (T-h = 215degrees-420degreesC), and less saline (0-20 wt % NaCl equiv) fluids at 21.9 to 22.7 +/- circa 0.5 Ma.
   Only narrow (less than or equal to2 m) envelopes of chlorite and weaker sericite and silica are associated with stages II and III veins, but more than 80 percent of the upper 750 m of the San Rafael stock experienced quasipervasive hydrothermal alteration. Early K metasomatism is recorded by widespread replacement of magmatic plagioclase and perthitic alkali feldspar by Na-free orthoclase, while broadly coeval alteration to albite more erratically affected groundmass plagioclase and the rims of alkali feldspar phenocrysts. Despite the intensity of the alkali metasomatism, only minor redistribution of dispersed, magmatic Sn occurred, largely during alteration to orthoclase. Other petrographically similar granitic bodies in the region experienced more intense Na metasomatism, and they host argentian base metal rather than Sn-dominated veins. Superimposed hydrolytic alteration, most intense within 20 to 30 m of the San Rafael Lodes, converted biotite to Fe-rich chlorite and converted alkali feldspar and plagioclase to fine-grained muscovite, but there is no significant dispersed cassiterite or chalcopyrite.
   Secondary fluid inclusions trapped in quartz phenocrysts of the granitic rocks range in salinity from 0 to 65 wt percent NaCl equiv and in T-h from 200degrees to 530degreesC; fluid boiling is evident in the higher-temperature populations. First-melting temperatures and decrepitate analyses reveal, in addition to NaCl, widely variable concentrations of KCl, CaCl2 (attaining 40 wt % of the solute) and, apparently most abundant in proximity to the lodes, FeCl2. Entrapment pressures are estimated to have fluctuated in the range 150 to 615 bars for much of the hydrothermal history, but fluid overpressuring to at least 2 kbar occurred, probably cyclically, during the evolution of the hydrothermal system. The salinity vs. homogenization temperature range for the phenocryst-hosted inclusions closely matches that of primary inclusions in quartz and cassiterite in the lodes and, remarkably, small clusters of the former record the entire thermal and compositional trajectory of the mineralizing fluids. Early magmatic brines are inferred to have permeated much of the stock whereas, circa 2 my. later, Sn- and Cu-rich, lower-temperature, lower-pH fluids were largely channeled along the evolving shear zones where they mixed with cool, nonsaline, tectonically driven ground water. In conjunction with fluid neutralization through hydrolytic alteration, this channeling resulted in catastrophic precipitation of botryoidal and coarsely crystalline cassiterite and, subsequently, chalcopyrite. The hiatus between initial retrograde boiling and ore deposition, a feature documented in several world-class, high-grade lithophile-element deposits, may record protracted storage of metal-rich brines at depth, perhaps in association with small volumes of highly fractionated melt, such as is represented by small bodies of tourmaline leucogranite exposed on the upper margin of the San Rafael stock. However, the parallel evolution in temperature and salinity exhibited by the early nonmineralizing and later fertile hydrothermal fluids may also indicate that Sn and Cu were largely introduced into the subjacent magma chamber at a late stage.

AB  - In order to better understand continental growth history, we have determined the U-Pb age of about 1500 detrital zircons from river sands in three major rivers in North America and South America, and have estimated the rate of continental growth in order to discuss the linkage between continental growth and the thermal evolution of the mantle. The method for estimating continental growth from the age population of a significant number of detrital zircons in river sands has three advantages; (1) the almost even collection of zircons from sedimentary rocks and granitic basements in the hinterlands of the major rivers, (2) determination of the age of juvenile crust due to the high closure temperature of the U-Pb systematics of zircons, and the removal of the influence of recycling of crustal materials within the continental crust, and (3) direct determination of the age of continental formation.
   The age population of zircons in the river sands of the Mississippi River shows four peaks at 2.6-2.8, 1.7-1.8, 1.1-1.5 and 0.2-0.5 Ga, the peaks corresponding to periods of major crustal formation of the Ouachita orogenic belt, the Grenville orogenic belt, the Yavapai-Mazatzal orogenic belt and Wyoming province in North America. The areal distribution of each orogenic belt is 11, 20, 3 3, and 14%, respectively, and this agrees with the age population of the zircons. This fact confirms the validity of the calculation of continental formation from the age population of zircons in river sands. In contrast, the age population of zircons in river sands of the Mackenzie and Amazon Rivers displays major peaks at 2.4-2.7, 1.0-1.9 and 0.2 Ga, and at 2.4-2.7, 1.9-2.2 and 1.0-1.5 Ga, respectively. However, the age distribution of the surface rocks in the drainage basins of the Mackenzie and Amazon Rivers also comprises widely-distributed young orogenic belts. This discrepancy suggests that the young orogenic belts were formed through recycling of older materials, and that essentially no juvenile continental crusts grew at those times. Our new continental growth curve estimated from the age populations of zircons in the river sands of the Mississippi, Mackenzie and Amazon Rivers indicates continuous growth of continental crust since the Archean and major abrupt increases in the Late Archean and early Proterozoic. The continental growth curve reflects episodic increase of the volume of continental crust at 1.9-2.3 and 2.5-2.8 Ga.
   The mantle overturn model provides the best explanation for the episodic growth of the continents. Accordingly, our data suggest that mantle overturn occurred at 1.9-2.3 and 2.5-2.8 Ga. If the mantle temperature were high enough in the Archean, indicated by geologic records to be ca. 150 K higher than that of modem MORB-source mantle (e.g., [Lithos 37 (1996) 199; Phys. Earth Planet. Int., in this issue]), a consequent higher Rayleigh number than at present would have favored double-layered mantle convection. If this were the case, the upper mantle would have behaved as a stagnant lid. On the other hand, it was also responsible for the production of large quantities of MORB that were later subducted beneath island arcs. The subducted material accumulated on the boundary between the upper and lower mantle, and consequently caused catastrophic downwelling into the lower mantle. The catastrophic sinking of the material induced a new influx of recycled material from the lower mantle, resulting in mantle overturn. As a consequence, superplumes and plumes ascended from the core-mantle boundary and the deep mantle, to give rise to large igneous provinces, flood basalts and oceanic plateaus. Episodic continental growth resulted from the mantle overturn because the influx of hotter and fertile materials from the lower mantle revitalized the upper mantle to produce large quantities of MORB and subsequent sialic continental crust through slab-melting.

AB  - Glauconite is the dioctahedral micaceous mineral with a high Fe content and structure of 2:1 layers linked by interlayer K cations. Wide distribution among marine sedimentary deposits and specific structural and chemical features of glauconites attract considerable attention of scientists both for paleogeographic reconstructions and for practical economical applications.
   The main aim of the study is a detailed investigation of mineralogical and structural-chemical characteristics of glauconite from the Upper Cretaceous formations of the Varvarinskoe deposit to determine origin of glauconite and to obtain initial information about possibilities of its practical applications.
   The methods: scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence analysis, optical microscopy and petrographic analysis. As a result of this investigation the following main conclusions vvere obtained. The formation of glauconite-quartz sandstones and sands occurred in coastal fades near the terrigenous input in dysoxic and anoxic conditions. The studied rocks mainly consist of glauconite (9,2...9,4 %) and terrigenous quartz (82,6...86,8 %). Glauconite is characterized by the following chemical composition (%): K20 6,73_8,89, 5i02- 49,67_55,99, Fe202;,,,,)- 19,36...26,85, MgO- 3,26...4,91, At0,- 3,90...7,31. The total content of adsorption and crystallization water is 3,46 and 412 %, respectively, according to the thermal analysis. Glauconite is evolved and highly evolved by degree of maturity. Glauconite is in situ origin. The glauconitization proceeded along the organic substrate according to the verdissement model due to chemical diffusion and transformation of the initial ferrous and ferrous-aluminum smectite, as evidenced by the structural and crystallochemical characteristics of glauconite. The studied structural and chemical characteristics of glauconite of the Varvarinskoe deposit indicate the possibility of its practical applications.

AB  - Mineral systems with their core of ore deposits require a rare conjunction of geodynamic settings, crustal or lithospheric fertility, crustal architecture and suitable host rocks, and preservation potential. They are thus an integral component of Earth's thermal and tectonic evolution which also control the supercontinent cycles with progressive assembly and breakup of Ur, Kenorland, Columbia, Rodinia, Gondwana, and Pangea. Despite the ongoing debate, some form of plate tectonics has operated on Earth since the Eoarchean. However, the hotter Archean mantle generated a long-term double-layered convection system which was disrupted by episodic mantle overturns, with the largest in the early Neoarchean potentially enriching the mantle in metals that form the Earth's core. Cratons with thick subcontinental mantle lithosphere (SCLM) or tectosphere keels commenced to form in the Mesoarchean as small continents amalgamated. The conjunction of pre-4.0 Ga crust, giant Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni and PGE-enriched layered mafic intrusions and major diamond fields provide strong evidence that the Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe Cratons and Wyoming Craton formed part of Ur with its early potentially core-metal-fertilized SCLM. Orogenic gold deposits and VMS Cu-Zn-Pb deposits with their high preservation potential were deposited in subduction-related convergent margins that activated the assembly of all supercontinents with giant provinces related to assembly of Kenorland, Columbia and Gondwana-Pangea. Erosion-susceptible porphyry Cu-Au and epithermal Au-Ag deposits were most abundant at the time of Gondwana and Pangea and in Cenozoic convergent margins and collisional orogens, although there are rare examples associated with assembly of all supercontinents. Magmatic intrusion-related Ni-Cu-PGE, and magmatic-hydrothermal IOCG Cu-Au and Kiruna-type Fe-P deposits formed near craton margins. However, although giant Ni-Cu-PGE deposits formed during the breakup of all supercontinents, giant IOCG deposits were largely restricted to extensional episodes related to Kenorland and Columbia and Kiruna-type deposits to those involved in Columbia. The evolution of the Earth's atmosphere-hydro sphere-biosphere was an additional influence on that of the supercontinent cycle in terms of the evolution of metallogenic provinces. The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) at ca. 2.4-2.0 Ga witnessed the end of the great era of deposition of BIFs that became the hosts to high-grade Fe and Mn deposits which formed under more oxidizing conditions, with Oligocene sediment-hosted Mn deposits and late-Cenozoic Mn nodules becoming the dominant Mn resources and potential resource, respectively. The GOE was also responsible for the evolution of U deposits from the Mesoarchean paleoplacer uraninite deposits of the Witwatersrand, through Mesoproterozoic unconformity-related deposits to Phanerozoic sandstone roll deposits. The Cambrian 'explosion of life', following a second GOE event, magnified the importance of organisms, particularly those secreting Ca and Mg, carbonate in the formation or ore deposits in sedimentary basins. Late Paleoproterozoic-Mesoproterozoic shale-hosted SEDEX Zn-Pb-Cu deposits were progressively replaced by Phanerozoic carbonate-hosted MVT Pb-Zn deposits and Neoproterozoic-Cambrian Zambian-type Cu-Co deposits hosted in calcareous sedimentary sequences. Carlin-type Au-Ag deposits hosted by calcareous and carbonaceous sequences appeared in the Cretaceous to Paleogene epochs to rival the more ubiquitous orogenic gold deposits in terms of global importance.
   It is evident that the evolution of the great metallogenic belts of the Earth was intrinsically linked to the thermal and tectonic evolution of the Earth and particularly to plate tectonics and the supercontinent cycles. The nature of contained mineral deposits of elements with multiple valency states and those requiring particularly reactive host rocks was strongly influenced by the evolution of the atmosphere-hydrosphere-biosphere system.

AB  - Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) occur in marine water of different salinities: from oceanic waters at salinity of 35 to Baltic Sea waters where the lowest level of salinity reaches 5-6. The stress response to different salinities in the eastern and western Baltic cod populations was examined. Two genes of Na+, K+ -ATPase 1a (atp1 a) and heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) expression, plasma cortisol and osmolality were used as markers of osmotic stress to characterize the reaction profiles of two populations of G. morhua from the western and eastern parts of the Baltic Sea. Atlantic cod were sampled in November 2012 from western Kiel Bight (KIEL, salinity of 18) and eastern Gdansk Bay (GDA, salinity of 8). Live fish were transported to the Marine Station of the University of Gdansk in Hel and were settled in tanks (3500 L). Cod were kept at 10 degrees C in recirculated water, which simulated the natural salinities of the geographic source region of the fish. Results showed that in the reduced and elevated salinity water of the KIEL group, we observed no change in expression of atp 1a and slightly increased expression of hsp70. In the GDA group, there were no significant changes of hsp70 expression but the level of atp 1a was significantly increased in both salinities. In both groups, concentration of cortisol increased after exposure to elevated salinity, while in fish exposed to reduced salinity, a significantly higher concentration of cortisol was observed after 72 h. The high expression of atp la that observed in the eastern group (GDA) supports the thesis of a genetic background to the adaptation to variable salinity. This adaptation may protect this species against an osmotic stress caused by daily vertical migrations and long-distance migration to spawning areas. At the same life-time, salinity is a barrier maintaining the genetic and physiological separations between G. morhua stocks and affecting the structure of this fish subpopulation in the Baltic Sea.

AB  - Organic acid contents of acidified and fermented fish silages made from gibel carp (Caracius gibelio) and klunzinger's ponyfish (Equulites klunzingeri) fishes, and from fish processing residues or by-products, were determined and studied. The silages were undertaken in wet and spray-dried fish-based raw-materials for 3 weeks at room temperature (ca. 25 degrees C). Selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) of Enterococcus gallinarum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Streptococcus spp. were employed to produce fermented fish-based silages, while acidified silage was prepared resorting to the addition of formic acid (3%, v/v). Lactic and propionic acids were the dominant produced organic acids, while succinic acid was formed at the smallest amounts in fermented silages. In the acidified silage, lactic and formic acids were produced in amounts higher than 800 and 1000 mg (organic acid)/100 g (samples) respectively. Among the fermented fish-based silages, LAB strains unfolded considerable ability to presumptively produce propionic acid in gibel carp silage (>2370 mg (organic acic)/100 g sample). Spray-dried fermented silages displayed significantly higher organic acid content than wet silages. Propionic acid accumulation was found at the highest levels in gibel carp silage fermented with L. plantarum (6335.40 mg (propionic acic)/100 g sample). This research effort pointed out the good capability of various selected lactic acid bacteria strains to produce significant amounts of organic acids especially lactic, acetic, and propionic acids- during the fermentation of fish-based silages. In terms of food safety and quality, such a production of relatively high amounts of organic acids in wet and spray-dried fish-based silages clearly indicated their suitableness to be used for animal feed.

AB  - In freeze tolerant wood frog Rana sylvatica, the freeze-induced liberation of glucose plays a critical role in survival in response to sub-zero temperature exposure. We have shown that the glycaemic response is linked to selective changes in the expression of hepatic adrenergic receptors through which catecholamines act to produce their hepatic glycogenolytic effects. The purpose of the present study was to determine if skeletal muscle, another catecholamine-sensitive tissue with glycogenolytic potential, displayed similar or different changes. In order to achieve these objectives, skeletal muscle derived from Rana sylvatica was studied in control, frozen and thawed states. In isolated sarcolemmal fractions, freezing effected an 88% decrease in beta (2)-adrenergic receptor expression but was without effect on the calcium pump; while thawing resulted in a recovery of the beta (2)-adrenergic receptor to 60% of control levels and a 2.4-fold increase in calcium transport. In isolated sarcoplasmic reticular fractions, freezing effected a 52% decrease in calcium binding and a 92% decrease in oxalate-stimulated calcium uptake: while thawing elicited partial normalization to control levels to 70% with respect to calcium binding and to 47% with respect to calcium uptake. Freezing and thawing were associated with increases and decreases, receptively, in blued glucose levels but were without effect on skeletal muscle glycogen content. Thus these muscle changes in Rana sylvatica in freezing and thawing are not linked to glycogen breakdown, are different from those previously seen in liver, and may provide a role in recovery of muscle function during thawing by protecting glycogen stores for contraction and maximizing extracellular calcium for excitation-contraction coupling in the frozen state. The involvement of thyroid hormone in triggering these muscle changes is discussed. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Climate driven species' range shifts may interfere with existing protected area (PA) networks, resulting in a mismatch between places where species are currently protected and places where they can thrive in the future. Here, we assess the climate-smartness of the Austrian PA network by focusing on endemic species' climatic niches and their future representation within PAs. We calculated endemic species' climatic niches and climate space available in PAs within their dispersal reach under current and future climates, with the latter represented by three climate change scenarios and three time-steps (2030, 2050, and 2080). Niches were derived from the area of occupancy of species and the extent of PAs, respectively, and calculated as bivariate density kernels on gradients of mean annual temperature and annual precipitation. We then computed climatic representation of species' niches in PAs as the proportion of the species' kernel covered by the PA kernel. We found that under both a medium (RCP 4.5) and severe (RCP 8.5) climate change scenario, representation of endemic species' climatic niches by PAs will decrease to a sixth for animals and to a third for plants, on average, toward the end of the century. Twenty to thirty percent of Austrian endemic species will then have no representation of their climatic niches in PAs anymore. Species with larger geographical and wider elevational ranges will lose less climatic niche representation. The declining representation of climatic niches in PAs implies that, even if PAs may secure the persistence of a part of these endemics, only a small portion of intraspecific diversity of many species may be represented in PAs in the future. We discuss our findings in the context of the varied elevational gradients found in Austria and suggest that the most promising strategies for safeguarding endemic species' evolutionary potential are to limit the magnitude of climate change and to reduce other pressures that additionally threaten their survival.</p>

AB  - Rapid adaptation/accommodation to changing environments largely contributes to maximal survival of invaders during biological invasions, usually leading to success in crossing multiple barriers and finally in varied environments in recipient habitats. Gene expression is one of the most important and rapid ways during responses to environmental stresses. Selection of proper reference genes is the crucial prerequisite for gene expression analysis using the common approach, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Here we identified eight candidate novel reference genes from the RNA-Seq data in an invasive model ascidian Ciona savignyi under temperature and salinity stresses. Subsequently, the expression stability of these eight novel reference genes, as well as other six traditionally used reference genes, was evaluated using RTq-PCR and comprehensive tool RefFinder. Under the temperature stress, two traditional reference genes, ribosomal proteins S15 and L17 (RPS15, RPL17), and one novel gene Ras homolog A (RhoA), were recommended as the top three stable genes, which can be used to normalize target genes with a high and moderate expression level, respectively. Under the salinity stress, transmembrane 9 superfamily member (TMN), MOB kinase activator 1A-like gene (MOB) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBQ2) were suggested as the top three stable genes. On the other hand, several commonly used reference genes such as alpha-tubulin (TubA), beta-tubulin (TubB) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) showed unstable expressions, thus these genes should not be used as internal controls for gene expression analysis. We also tested the expression level of an important stress response gene, large proline-rich protein bag6-like gene (BAG) using different reference genes. As expected, we observed different results and conclusions when using different normalization methods, thus suggesting the importance of selection of proper reference genes and associated normalization methods. Our results provide a valuable reference gene resource for the normalization of gene expression in the study of environmental adaptation/accommodation during biological invasions using C. savignyi as a model.

AB  - The outbreak of Oriental Migratory Locust(Locusta migratoria manilensis) causes devastating disasters to agriculture. With the impact of climate changes and human activities, the distribution of locust habitat (locust habitat is the environment in which locusts live and survive) in China is constantly changing. Monitoring and extracting locust habitat are of great significance for guiding large-scale agricultural production. The occurrence of the locust is closely related to their habitat. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of habitat factors that affect locust survival is carried out to monitor locust habitat distribution. Besides, the landscape structure also affects distribution. This study explored a model for analyzing multi-temporal Landsat and MODIS images, which combined multiple habitat factors and landscape structure to analyze locust habitat. The locust habitat near North Dagang Reservoir in Tianjin is the research object. First, the habitat factors that affect locust oviposition and growth were analyzed, and vegetation coverage, land cover class, soil moisture, soil salinity, and land surface temperature were selected as five habitat factors. The weights of five habitat factors were evaluated according to the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model. Then, considering the impact of landscape structure on locust habitat, a moving-window was used to correlate locust habitat factors at pixel scale with locust habitat at patch scale. Finally, the distribution map of the locust habitat at patch scale was generated. The Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP) was used to compare and test the results. Our research shows that the Patch based - Analytic Hierarchy Process (PB-AHP) can monitor locust habitat. The overall accuracy reached 88%, which is 10% higher than the result based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process(AHP). These results show that the Patch based - Analytic Hierarchy Process (PB-AHP) model has strong robustness and generalization ability in identifying locust habitat and can provide scientific guidance for locust monitoring and control.

AB  - Deciphering the pre-orogenic evolution of subducted continental basement is challenging due to pervasive reworking of crust during subduction and exhumation. Survival of such polycyclic basement may occur locally in low strain domains bounded by intensely overprinted rocks. The Palaeozoic history of basement involved in Alpine continental subduction is investigated in the northern Dora-Maira Massif where a kilometre-scale domain of low strain preserves a pre-Alpine amphibolite-facies foliation in garnet-biotite orthogneiss and garnet-staurolite micaschist. By contrast, a first generation garnet is the only pre-Alpine relict in pervasively reworked domains surrounding the low-strain domain. Thermodynamic modelling based on garnet isopleths in micaschist constrains the pre-Alpine pressure-temperature (P-T) evolution from 4 to 5 kbar and similar to 500 degrees C to 6-7 kbar and similar to 650 degrees C, which is consistent with Barrovian metamorphism up to the staurolite zone. In this micaschist, monazite included in garnet rims provide an age of 324 +/- 6 Ma (95% confidence interval; c.i.). On the basis of textural and chemical data, this is interpreted as recording peak Barrovian metamorphic conditions. Low Th/U metamorphic zircon overgrowths and crystals yield an age of 304 +/- 2 Ma (95% confidence interval). On the basis of the trace element concentrations and rare earth element (REE) patterns measured in garnet and metamorphic zircon, the latter is tentatively interpreted as having grown during early exhumation or cooling, involving garnet consumption and fluid infiltration. The reconstructed Variscan Barrovian metamorphism of the northern Dora-Maira basement is consistent with that documented in the External Crystalline Massifs and in the Austroalpine domain of the Alps. The Palaeozoic basement of the Dora-Maira Massif likely represents upper crustal material, later involved in Alpine continental subduction under high- to ultra-high-pressure conditions.

AB  - In the late sixties the first randomized placebo controlled study with cyclophosphamide demonstrated improved survival inpatients with extensive small cell king cancer (SCLC). Since then chemotherapy has become the mainstay of treatment of SCLC. A number of active combination chemotherapy programs for SCLC were developed during the 1970s and early 1980s. Administration of three or four effective drugs simultaneously appeal ed to be required for optimal results, but the particular regimen selected was of less importance than the delivery of doses that induced moderately severe but not life-threatening myelosuppression. The drugs chosen for a combination were justified on the basis of single agent activity, difference in mechanism of action and non-overlapping toxic effects. The actual doses were usually the result of feasibility studies in which the doses of all except one drug were held constant. Certain combinations became popular quickly, long before it was appreciated that one of the drugs in the combination added more toxicity than benefit. It is therefore not surprising that the old concept that two drugs in combination are better than one, or three drugs in combination are better than two, is being increasingly criticized. There is recognition that at the time of diagnosis SCLC may already be partially resistant to multiple chemotherapeutic agents and that the strategy simulated by Goldie and Coldman may only partly be applicable to SCLC. Moreover, the development of hematopoietic growth factors hs provided a reason to re-evaluate the doses of individual cytostatic agents in current combination regimes and to combine drugs that previously, were thought to be incompatible. But even without growth factors, recent investigations with the single agent etoposide and the combination of etoposide and cisplatin have provided arguments against the old theories of <<more is better>>. Drug combinations must preferably be selected on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies. Dose intensity has to be revised and fascinating opportunities will arrive as soon as efficient oral formulations of active drugs, such as platinum, ifosfamide and etoposide become available.

AB  - The recent discovery of large porphyry copper deposits (PCDs) associated with Miocene (22-12 Ma) granitoid magmas in the eastern section of the Paleocene-Eocene Gangdese magmatic arc in the Himalaya-Tibetan orogenic belt raises new questions about the origin of water-rich (>= 4.5 wt.%), oxidized (Delta FMQ 1-3) magmas in continental collisional settings and their mineralization potential. We review the literature and compile available data on whole rock and isotope geochemistry for Cenozoic igneous rocks from Tibet, and add new zircon Ce4+/Ce3+ and Ti-in-zircon thermometry data to better understand variations in oxidation state and thermal evolution of these suites, which are key controls on Cu mineralization. Six distinct Cenozoic igneous suites are defined: Paleocene-Eocene syn-collisional Gangdese magmatic arc rocks (Delta FMQ = -1.2 to +0.8) (suite I), and five broadly contemporaneous Miocene suites. A distinct change in magmatism along the length of the belt occurs at around 88 degrees E in the Miocene suites: to the east, porphyry copper mineralization is associated with a moderately oxidized, high-Sr/Y granitoid suite (suite II, Delta FMQ = + 0.8 to + 2.9) with minor occurrences of transitional (hybrid) monzonitic (suite III) and trachytic rocks (suite IV; both with zircon Ce4+/Ce3+ > 50-100, Eu-N/Eu-N* = similar to 0.5, and Delta FMQ = +1 to + 2). To the west of 88 degrees E, trachytic volcanic rocks (suite V) are more voluminous but more reduced (zircon Ce4+/Ce3+ < 50, Delta FMQ < + 1), and are associated with sparse, poorly mineralized high-Sr/Y granitoids (suite VI) which are moderately oxidized (zircon Ce4+/Ce3+ = 20-100, Delta FMQ = + 1 to + 3).
   The Miocene high-Sr/Y granitoids have many compositional and isotopic similarities to the Paleocene-Eocene Gangdese arc rocks, and are interpreted to have been derived by melting of the hydrated arc root, with minor mantle input. In contrast, the highly evolved isotopic signatures of the Miocene trachytic rocks, combined with deep seismic profiles and a xenolith-derived geotherm, suggest their derivation from the underthrust Indian Proterozoic subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) or old fore-arc Tibetan SCLM during phlogopite breakdown at temperatures of similar to 1100 degrees C.
   Based on published geophysical data and tectonic reconstructions, we develop a model that explains the origin of the various Miocene magmatic suites, their spatial differences, and the origin of related PCDs. Following the early stages of continental collision (Eocene Oligocene), shallow underthrusting of the Indian continental lithosphere and subcretion of Tethyan sediments (including oxidized carbonates and possibly evaporites) under eclogite facies conditions promoted the release of aqueous fluids, which hydrated and oxidized the base of the overlying Tibetan plate. This metasomatism rendered the Tibetan lower crust fusible and fertile for metal remobilization.
   During the mid-Miocene, the Indian slab steepened in the eastern sector (east of similar to 88 degrees E). In this eastern belt, deeply derived trachytic magmas were trapped in melt zones at the base of the Tibetan crust, and variably mixed with the crustally-derived, high Sr/Y granitoid magmas. They may also have released water that contributed to fluid-fluxed melting of the lower crust, producing voluminous high-Sr/Y granitoid magmas, which were associated with significant PCD mineralization. Hybridization between the trachytic magmas and lower crustal partial melts is indicated by intermediate isotopic compositions, enriched Cr and Ni contents, and high Mg-# in some intermediate-to-felsic (56-70 wt. % SiO2) high-Sr/Y granitoids. Trapping of the trachytic melts in deep crustal melt zones explains the relatively small volumes of trachytic magmas erupted at surface in the east.
   In contrast, to the west of similar to 88 degrees E, subduction of the Indian plate has remained flat to the present day, preventing incursion of hot asthenosphere. Consequently, cooler conditions in the deep Tibetan lithosphere resulted in limited crustal melting and the production of only small volumes of high-Sr/Y granitic magmas. Trachytic melts ascending from the underthrust Indian or Tibetan plate were able to pass through the cooler lower crust and erupted in greater volume at surface, whereas only small volumes of high-Sr/Y granitoid magma were generated and are not associated with significant PCD mineralization.

AB  - An origin of the Moon by a Giant Impact is presently the most widely accepted theory of lunar origin. It is consistent with the major lunar observations: its exceptionally large size relative to the host planet, the high angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system, the extreme depletion of volatile elements, and the delayed accretion, quickly followed by the formation of a global crust and mantle.
   According to this theory, an impact on Earth of a Mars-sized body set the initial conditions for the formation and evolution of the Moon. The impact produced a protolunar cloud. Fast accretion of the Moon from the dense cloud ensured an effective transformation of gravitational energy into heat and widespread melting. A "Magma Ocean" of global dimensions formed, and upon cooling, an anorthositic crust and a mafic mantle were created by gravitational separation.
   Several 100 million years after lunar accretion, long-lived isotopes of K, U and Th had produced enough additional heat for inducing partial melting in the mantle; lava extruded into large basins and solidified as titanium-rich mare basalt. This delayed era of extrusive rock formation began about 3.9 Ga ago and may have lasted nearly 3 Ga.
   A relative crater count timescale was established and calibrated by radiometric dating (i.e., dating by use of radioactive decay) of rocks returned from six Apollo landing regions and three Luna landing spots. Fairly well calibrated are the periods approximate to 4 Ga to approximate to 3 Ga BP (before present) and approximate to 0.8 Ga BP to the present. Crater counting and orbital chemistry (derived from remote sensing in spectral domains ranging from gamma- and x-rays to the infrared) have identified mare basalt surfaces in the Oceanus Procellarum that appear to be nearly as young as 1 Ga. Samples returned from this area are needed for narrowing the gap of 2 Ga in the calibrated timescale. The lunar timescale is not only used for reconstructing lunar evolution, but it serves also as a standard for chronologies of the terrestrial planets, including Mars and possibly early Earth.
   The Moon holds a historic record of Galactic cosmic-ray intensity, solar wind composition and fluxes and composition of solids of any size in the region of the terrestrial planets. Some of this record has been deciphered. Secular mixing of the Sun was constrained by determining He-3/He-4 of solar wind helium stored in lunar fines and ancient breccias. For checking the presumed constancy of the impact rate over the past approximate to 3.1 Ga, samples of the youngest mare basalts would be needed for determining their radiometric ages.
   Radiometric dating and stratigraphy has revealed that many of the large basins on the near side of the Moon were created by impacts about 4.1 to 3.8 Ga ago. The apparent clustering of ages called "Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB)" is thought to result from migration of planets several 100 million years after their accretion.
   The bombardment, unexpectedly late in solar system history, must have had a devastating effect on the atmosphere, hydrosphere and habitability on Earth during and following this epoch, but direct traces of this bombardment have been eradicated on our planet by plate tectonics. Indirect evidence about the course of bombardment during this epoch on Earth must therefore come from the lunar record, especially from additional data on the terminal phase of the LHB. For this purpose, documented samples are required for measuring precise radiometric ages of the Orientale Basin and the Nectaris and/or Fecunditatis Basins in order to compare these ages with the time of the earliest traces of life on Earth.
   A crater count chronology is presently being built up for planet Mars and its surface features. The chronology is based on the established lunar chronology whereby differences between the impact rates for Moon and Mars are derived from local fluxes and impact energies of projectiles. Direct calibration of the Martian chronology will have to come from radiometric ages and cosmic-ray exposure ages measured in samples returned from the planet.

AB  - With the emergence of Low-Cost Sensor (LCS) devices, measuring real-time data on a large scale has become a feasible alternative approach to more costly devices. Over the years, sensor technologies have evolved which has provided the opportunity to have diversity in LCS selection for the same task. However, this diversity in sensor types adds complexity to appropriate sensor selection for monitoring tasks. In addition, LCS devices are often associated with low confidence in terms of sensing accuracy because of the complexities in sensing principles and the interpretation of monitored data. From the data analytics point of view, data quality is a major concern as low-quality data more often leads to low confidence in the monitoring systems. Therefore, any applications on building monitoring systems using LCS devices need to focus on two main techniques: sensor selection and calibration to improve data quality. In this paper, data-driven techniques were presented for sensor calibration techniques. To validate our methodology and techniques, an air quality monitoring case study from the Bradford district, UK, as part of two European Union (EU) funded projects was used. For this case study, the candidate sensors were selected based on the literature and market availability. The candidate sensors were narrowed down into the selected sensors after analysing their consistency. To address data quality issues, four different calibration methods were compared to derive the best-suited calibration method for the LCS devices in our use case system. In the calibration, meteorological parameters temperature and humidity were used in addition to the observed readings. Moreover, we uniquely considered Absolute Humidity (AH) and Relative Humidity (RH) as part of the calibration process. To validate the result of experimentation, the Coefficient of Determination (R-2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were compared for both AH and RH. The experimental results showed that calibration with AH has better performance as compared with RH. The experimental results showed the selection and calibration techniques that can be used in designing similar LCS based monitoring systems.

AB  - As is clear from weather data, the climate of the inner Strandja, Bulgaria, has grown dryer since 1970. As a result, some relic species having low environmental adaptation potential either have been subjected to the risk of mortality from drought, or have migrated upward, to more humid conditions. The aim of our work was to reveal the effect of recent climatic changes on the vascular systems of relic Vaccinium arctostaphylos L., Rhododendron ponticum L. and Ilex colchica Poj. growing in Strandja. These species are recognized to need conservation.
   The xylem features were studied by Image Analysis set-up using the dated cross sections of the woody samples. Vessel characters were measured ring by ring. Correlations were calculated between the chronologies of the vessel parameters (mean vessel area and vessel density per a growth ring) and daily average temperature and precipitation recorded at Burgas weather station. These correlations were analyzed using a 20-day moving window technique whereby the climatic variables were shifted at 10-day steps from April 1-st to October 30.
   It was revealed that from 1996 to 2008, V. arctostaphylos mean vessel area, S, (mu m(2)) was rising while the mean vessel density, N/mm(2), was dropping. The same trends but at considerably lower rates were revealed for R. ponticum in 2001-2008. In I. colchica, the former feature, on the contrary, dropped slightly and the latter rose in 2004-2008. In all three species, relative water conductive area within a growth ring, sw (sum of the vessel areas located in the growth ring /growth ring area), remained constant in R. ponticum, on the contrary, dropped slightly in V. arctostaphylos and rose in I. colchica.
   Climate signals recorded in vessels showed that April-May air temperatures influenced in xylem of all three species, while June-July temperatures influenced only archaic R. ponticum and V. arctostaphylos. Spring (April) and summer (June 20 - July 10) precipitation had significant positive effect only on these two species but not on I. colchica.
   The results clearly showed V arctostaphylos, the most ancient species, were extremely vulnerable to unfavorable climate. When available water diminishes and transpiration rises, increasing vessel area is unfavorable for plant health, because it makes embolism in vascular system highly probable.

AB  - Forests provide important ecosystem services and renewable materials. Yet, under a future climate, optimal conditions will likely shift outside the current range for some tree species. This will challenge the persistence of populations to rely on inherent plasticity and genetic diversity to acclimate or adapt to future uncertain conditions. An opportunity to study such processes is offered by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), a forest tree with a large distribution range including populations locally adapted to a wide variety of environments, which hinders a range-wide assessment of the species to climate change. Here we evaluate tree height growth uncertainty of Scots pine marginal populations in Spain and the Nordic countries linked to their genetic adaptation promoted by different climatic drivers. Our aims are to: (i) review the main climatic drivers of Scots pine adaptation across its range; (ii) undertake provenance-based modeling and prediction of tree height under current and future climate scenarios including four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and five general circulation models (GCMs) at two extremes of its climatic niche; (iii) estimate uncertainty in population tree height linked to the main drivers of local adaptation that may change among RCPs and GCMs in the Nordic countries and Spain. Our models revealed that tree height adaptation is mostly driven by drought in Spain and by photoperiod in the Nordic countries, whereas the literature review also highlighted temperature as a climatic driver for the Nordic region. Model predictions for the Nordic countries showed an overall increase in tree height but with high uncertainty in magnitude depending on the RCPs and GCMs whereas predictions for Spain showed tree height to be maintained in the north and reduced in the south, but with similar magnitudes among RCPs and GCMs. Both models predicted tree height outside the data range used to develop the models (extrapolation). Predictions using higher emission RCPs resulted in larger extrapolated areas, constituting a further source of uncertainty. An expanded network of Scots pine field trials throughout Europe, facilitated by data collection and international research collaboration, would limit the need for uncertain predictions based on extrapolation.

AB  - This paper describes the design, testing, installation, and performance of the first fully completed well by use of an intelligent inner completion inside an uncemented liner with openhole packers for zonal isolation. The well-design concept evolved from technical challenges associated with completing long cased-and-cemented laterals in the mature Ekofisk waterflood. The term fully completed implies full reservoir access along the pay length for production and high-rate matrix acid stimulation by use of limited entry for fluid diversion within well segments.
   The paper covers the development and qualification of custom openhole 75/8-in.-liner components that can handle high differential pressures and severe temperature fluctuations of 200 degrees F; the marriage of this complex liner with a five-zone intelligent-completion system; and results from 1 year of system-integration testing. The paper also discusses the strategic placement of both mechanical openhole and inner-string packers based on caliper and drilling logs; challenges met and overcome during installation; and comprehensive downhole-gauge data that confirms the performance of each component before, during, and after the stimulation.
   The Ekofisk field waterflood began in 1987 and continues to date, exceeding expectations for improved oil recovery while mitigating reservoir compaction. As the waterflood matures, new wells are more often found partially water-swept. Limited infrastructure for lifting and handling the high water production has led to increased emphasis on isolating these water-swept intervals. Cased, cemented, and perforated completions have traditionally been used for this service. Effective placement of cement is challenging in horizontals 4,000-8,000 ft in length, where rotation of the liner is not possible and high effective-circulating densities limit rates during cementing. Wide variations in reservoir pore pressures, often in excess of 2,000-psi difference along the lateral, are typical of the Ekofisk chalk and compound the difficulties of cementing. As a result, a new method for zonal isolation has been developed to ensure the success of future infill-drilling campaigns.
   The design and careful planning that went into the fully completed openhole uncemented-liner strategy resulted in a successful field trial and has proved this solution to be an effective alternative to cemented reservoir liners in long horizontals where zonal isolation is critical. Use of the intelligent-well system (IWS) allowed offline acid stimulation without rig, coiled-tubing, or wireline intervention. What would have traditionally been a significant water producer, with three water-swept zones totaling nearly 2,000 ft across a 4,000-ft reservoir section, has turned out to be one of the best oil producers in the field, with nearly zero water cut. Production results show high productivity with highly negative acidized-completion skins.
   With large investments in intelligent completions to provide zone-specific inflow control and water shutoff, isolation outside the liner becomes much more important. Over recent years, the Ekofisk wells have illustrated the difficulty of achieving effective cement along lengthy reservoir targets. The openhole fully completed solution combining an accessorized uncemented liner with an inner intelligent-completion string will allow operators to push the limits in terms of lateral length while maintaining full control over producing and nonproducing zones.

AB  - We try to address in this paper our current work toward the generation of synthetic time series of rain rate, R, in mm/h with an integration time of 1 min This is the ITU-R, standard for predicting rain induced attenuation [1]. For one, the availability of rain intensity records adapted to the ITU-R requirements is very limited given that the main users of rain information (weather prediction, water management, etc.) do not require such a short integration time and data with longer accumulation periods, even exceeding 1 hour, are commonly found. In this respect, there is recent published work where a method based on a physical model (EXCELL) [2] has been proposed for converting recordings with longer integration times to the standardized 1-min period.
   On the other hand, even using 1-second resolution rain gauge data, it is rather difficult to agree on how to produce R(t) series from which reliable yearly complementary cumulative distributions, CCDFs, are obtained. From such statistics, CCDFs of rain-induced attenuation, A (dB), are generated for use in link budgets. Several methods have been compared in [3] showing important discrepancies in critical outage probability levels.
   Moreover, if the interest is in generating instantaneous time series of A(t) for simulation purposes, for example making use of Matricciani's Synthetic Storm Technique [4], the resulting series would consist of frequent, unrealistic signal plateaus as a consequence of the somehow unrealistic rain rate series. The latter are produced with the current tipping bucket data processing methods [3], [5-6]. Fig. 1 illustrates an example of an R(t) series obtained from bucket tip series using [6].
   Note the presence of frequent plateaus, especially in the lower intensity sections. However, one would expect that the series of both R and A should contain an additional, superposed random component, not present using with the actual processing techniques.
   It is thus important to investigate the smaller scale nature of the precipitation phenomenon in order to being able to reproduce it more accurately. Additionally, we need to find a better approach toward the conversion of bucket tip data into rain intensity and then on to obtaining cumulative statistics.
   Our current approach to the above issues is developing a model capable of simulating the occurrence of rain gauge tips according to an it-state hidden Markov model representing it rainy regimes within which different arrival (tip) rates are defined. Moreover, the idea is to further complement the above approach with a similar model which derives rain drop arrivals of different sizes associated to each tip.
   Thus, we are exploring the application of a class of stochastic point process models, Markovian Arrival Process (1VIAPs) [7], in the analysis of fine time-scale rain rate. MAPs can model statistics of any order of inter-arrival times between measured events. We are using these models to generate synthetic tippingbucket rain gauge data at a specific site. Since R(t) series derived from tipping series are strongly dependent on the processing methodology, five methods are being used to calculate R(t) and their corresponding CCDFs for comparison with those provided by the ITU-R for the same location.
   In this application, the arrival pattern of rain gauge bucket tip times, {NO}, is viewed as a MAP whose rate of occurrence varies according to an unobserved finite state irreducible Markov process.
   An it-state MAP is specified by two nxn matrices: (1) a stable matrix Do with non-negative off-diagonal entries, and (2) a non-negative matrix D1 describing the transition rates between the it states. Each transition in D1 produces an arrival event (tip). Matrix Do describes the background transitions, not associated with arrivals. The matrix Q=Do+D-i is the infinitesimal generator of the underlying Markov process.
   Here, we are considering a special case of MAP where D-1 is a diagonal matrix: a Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPPs) [8]. In particular, for our initial work we are using the MMPP model parameters listed in Table 1 of [9] corresponding to 13 years of 0.2 mm rainfall tip time data for Heathrow, West of London, UK. Twelve parameters sets, one for each month of the year, are available. The model assumes three states: (1) intense rainy state, (2) wet state, and (3) dry state (little or no rain). A realization of this model is illustrated in Fig. 2, the state series on the top line and the actual tips on the bottom line, with the highest tipping rate corresponding to the state 1.
   The synthetic rain gauge data generated with the above 3-state MIVIPP model was used to generate R(t) series. Five methods were considered for producing R(t): Natural, Usual meteorological, First IAP, Novel IAP, Novel IAP-RM, and D'Amico et al. [3],[5-6]. Fig. 1 shows an example result using the Novel IAP-RM method [6]. As indicated earlier, the generated R(t) series does not provide the expected realism: lack of random variability. The same happens for the other processing methods. This is due to the fact that most of the above studied techniques correspond to some sort of convolution between a rectangular window with a train of Dirac deltas (tips), which are later accumulated in 1-min integration intervals. We would assume that an experimentally derived, random window should give rise to more realistic R(t) series. One of our current lines of work involves the derivation of one or a family of such windows from fine time resolution disdrometer data.
   After all R(t) series are obtained through the different data processing methods, the final step involves the analysis of results by comparing the yearly CCDFs with that for Heathrow according to ITU-R P.837-6 [1].
   It has been observed that the model parameters proposed in [9] give rise to an average CCDF that follows quite well that provided by the ITU-R for the lower intensities. However, the higher intensities produced seem to be underestimated. We suspect that this originates from the fact that the optimization process used for extracting the model parameters targeted matching the yearly mean amount of rain. We are working toward a parameter extraction method that overcomes this problem and that could be used in other climatic areas.
   In conclusion, a summary of our current work toward the study and characterization of rain intensity at a finer scale that can be used both for simulation purposes and for the generation of yearly or other periods (seasonal, monthly, ...) cumulative distributions for link budget applications has been presented. It is expected that through the study of arrivals: first of rain gauge tips and, possibly, drop arrivals, a more faithful reproduction of rain induced effects on radio links could be achieved.

AB  - Cultural heritage,understood as the selection of sites or cultural manifestations transmitted for future generations, is rooted in the nationalist projects of states during European modernity. After the terrible consequences of the world wars this conservation model was universalized searching to preserve the heritage of mankind and supporting, at the same time, the construction of a liberal international order. Since then, international organizations have sought to direct efforts towards this goal. In 1972 the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage emerged as a result of discussions at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). This convention was concerned about the deterioration or disappearance of cultural or natural heritage, something viewed as harmful and an impoverishment of the heritage of all the nations of the world.This is why the agreement summoned the states to participate in the protection of world heritage of outstanding universal value, by cultivating collective cooperation and assistance.A list of monuments and sites that form part of world heritage was established,in terms of aesthetic,historical, artistic or scientific criteria. However, over time, in the selection process of world heritage sites disputes and power asymmetries have arisen between countries around the control of space.
   This problem can be analyzed through Critical Heritage and Critical Geopolitics approaches, spanning the historical changes and current critical debates about heritage, as well as the political processes of narratives, metaphors and social image constructions around territory. We propose that nominating a territory as a world heritage site generates its alienation. That is, states absorb local territories (understood as a social construct) into dominant national narratives and images, subsequently, countries consolidate their appropriation by enlisting their nationalized territories within the meta-narrative of world heritage. In this process, countries must participate in a highly politicized and structurally unequal international negotiation that reproduces spatial hierarchies. Ultimately, these local territories and practices suffer a process of assimilation into the allegory of world heritage.With this in mind, the aim of this study is to analyze the territorial alienation of properties inscribed on the World Heritage List by Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries as a case study. This alienation occurs because, given the conditions of UNESCO, the countries of the region must adopt an artificial set of categories, typologies and narratives, absorbing or denying other territorial practices. This paper is divided in two sections. The first section gives a brief overview of world heritage origins centered on national projects within a specific European context, and explains Critical Heritage and Critical Geopolitics approaches.
   A discussion of the evolution of world heritage categories and symbolic aspects of power is reviewed, highlighting the imposition of historical narratives in official documents, the reproduction of aesthetic codes and the construction of imaginaries around the past of territories.The second section analyses the particular case of the World Heritage List in Latin America and the Caribbean. In order to study territorial alienations, methodologically we review countries ratifications of the 1972 convention, the total number of sites, obstacles in international negotiations, narratives, as well as historical events commemorated by the world heritage officially recognized in this part of the planet. The inscription of a site on the World Heritage List requires a nomination file. We used the UNESCO's files to detect these historical narratives and discourses. Some conclusions are drawn, our findings would seem to show that world heritage sites in LatinaAmerica and the Caribbean are underrepresented compared to Europe and North America. In addition, these sites are geographically concentrated in South America, with the Caribbean as the least favored sub-region. At the beginning, countries were reluctant to ratify the 1972 convention due to the prevailing Cold War context,but gradually all countries in the region accepted the commitment. States like Mexico top the List of World Heritage sites, but others have no sites recognized; differences in the number of sites registered by the countries do not only stem from their geographical attributes and their historical past, but also because of the political, technical and economic potential to participate in diplomatic negotiations at UNESCO.
   Arguments for inscribing a site as world heritage in this region highlights the relevance of natural and exotic places. This looks like a continuity of dominant imperialist narratives during the conquest and colonization of the continent America. The separation between natural and cultural world heritage is an artificial division adopted, but contrary to some local traditions in the region. The arrival of Europeans to LatinAmerica has been established as a time marker used for example to talk about "pre-Columbian" cultures. In any case, few sites commemorate pre-Columbian civilizations, with the exception of the Mayas and the Incas,which contrasts with the cultural diversity and traditional groups that are not part of these dominant versions of the past. It may be assumed that in historical commemorations of world heritage sites in this region, the colonial past is notoriously overvalued and magnified; that is, it is presented as a favorable stage indicating a kind of cultural sophistication for indigenous people. Amazingly, territories essential to fulfilling their goal of extracting natural resources for the European settlers are now uncritically recognized as world heritage (for example mining centers, plantations, seaports or strategic villages). Similarly, cultural sites of Roman Catholic Christianity are evoked as a favorable contribution for the historical regional memory, but denying impositions around the conflictive and complex process of evangelization; in the same way other religions and beliefs are omitted. There are many colonial sites enlisted as world heritage but very few referring to the modern history of the region, significantly reformist narratives are absent: independence movements, abolition of slavery or contemporary indigenous and black population claims are not raised.
   In summary, these results suggest that,from a critical perspective,the world heritage sites in Latina America and the Caribbean allow dominant relations to continue through values of European origin, selective historical narratives and illusory images as a colonized region. As long as other relevant regional historical events or social actors are ignored, the regional past and cultural heritage will be incomplete. The region reaffirms its peripheral and subordinated position in the international system through historical narratives acritically adopted. Latin American and Caribbean territories are more than exotic landscapes and places of colonial splendor for tourism. Analyzing world heritage from a critical perspective is a way to re-center the territory as a key axis in this dynamic and to recognize other memories and spatial relations.

AB  - Human activities are altering a wide range of key marine cues at local and global scales, and it is important to know how animals may respond. Species survival and performance depend on the ability of individuals to successfully extract and interpret information from their environment about preferred abiotic conditions and the presence of prey, predators, competitors, mates and suitable habitats. Such information is made available via a wide range of abiotic and biotic cues that can be detected by organisms through various sensory modalities. Global anthropogenic changes, however, are rapidly altering the sensory landscape ('cuescape') and behaviour of animals by modifying the production, transmission and interpretation of critical natural cues, as well as introducing novel anthropogenic cues. To date, most studies have focussed on how animals respond to such changes rather than investigating how the cues themselves are changing. Because the responses that individuals show ultimately depend on factors affecting both the generation and reception of cues, better integration is needed to understand how these factors ultimately affect individual performance. This review provides a holistic assessment of how multiple cues (e.g. sounds, visual cues, chemicals, salinity, temperature and electromagnetism) are being altered at different spatial and temporal scales in marine habitats. Natural cuescapes are being modified by humans and novel anthropogenic cues are being introduced into the ocean, both of which can directly and indirectly alter the diversity and strength of natural cues. Examples are provided of how species might respond to such changes, focussing on what coping and adaptation mechanisms are available for species to persist in a future ocean. While `sensory generalist' species may prevail in marine environments with diminishing or masked natural cues, some `sensory specialists' might sustain themselves via sensory compensation, behavioural plasticity or avoidance of detrimental cues in the short term, or via genetic adaptation in the longer term. Due to the rapid loss of natural cuescapes, alternative research agendas are needed to monitor and measure multicue changes throughout the oceans. Together with mechanistic and field studies of animal responses, such research can inform management by identifying the species most at risk and the areas that may be suitable for cuescape preservation.

AB  - Poly-extremophiles microorganisms have the capacity to inhabit hostile environments and can survive several adverse conditions that include as variations in temperature, pH, and salinity, high levels UV light and atmospheric pressure, and even the presence of toxic compounds and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A halotolerant Exiguobacterium strain was isolated from Salar de Huasco (Chilean Altiplano), a well-known shallow lake area with variable salinity levels, little human intervention, and extreme environmental conditions, which makes it ideal for the study of resistant mechanisms and the evolution of adaptations. This bacterial genus has not been extensively studied, although its cosmopolitan location indicates that it has high levels of plasticity and adaptive capacity. However, to date, there are no studies regarding the tolerance and resistance to salinity and osmotic pressure. We set out to characterize the Exiguobacterium sp. SH31 strain and describe its phenotypical and genotypical response to osmotic stress. In this context, as a first step to characterize the response to the SH31 strain to salinity and to establish the bases for a molecular study, we proposed to compare its response under three salt conditions (0, 25, and 50 g/l NaCl). Using different physiology, genomic, and transcriptomic approaches, we determined that the bacterium is able to grow properly in a NaCl concentration of up to 50 g/l; however, the best growth rate was observed at 25 g/l. Although the presence of flagella is not affected by salinity, motility was diminished at 25 g/l NaCl and abolished at 50 g/l. Biofilm formation was induced proportionally with increases in salinity, which was expected. These phenotypic results correlated with the expression of related genes: fliG and fliS Motility); opuBA and putP (transport); glnA, proC, gltA, and gbsA (compatible solutes); ywqC, bdlA, luxS y pgaC (biofilm and stress response); and therefore, we conclude that this strain effectively modifies gene expression and physiology in a differential manner when faced with different concentrations of NaCl and these modifications aid survival.

AB  - Background: Ranaviruses (family Iridoviridae, nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses) have been reported as promiscuous pathogens of cold-blooded vertebrates. Rana grylio virus (RGV, a ranavirus), from diseased frog Rana grylio with a genome of 105.79 kb and Andrias davidianus ranavirus (ADRV), from diseased Chinese giant salamander (CGS) with a genome of 106.73 kb, contains 99% homologous genes.
   Results: To uncover the differences in virus replication and host responses under interspecies infection, we analyzed transcriptomes of CGS challenged with RGV and ADRV in different time points (1d, 7d) for the first time. A total of 128,533 unigenes were obtained from 820,858,128 clean reads. Transcriptome analysis revealed stronger gene expression of RGV than ADRV at 1 d post infection (dpi), which was supported by infection in vitro. RGV replicated faster and had higher titers than ADRV in cultured CGS cell line. RT-qPCR revealed the RGV genes including the immediate early gene (RGV-89R) had higher expression level than that of ADRV at 1 dpi. It further verified the acute infection of RGV in interspecies infection.
   The number of differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways from RGV were lower than that from ADRV, which reflected the variant host responses at transcriptional level. No obvious changes of key components in pathway "Antigen processing and presentation" were detected for RGV at 1 dpi. Contrarily, ADRV infection down-regulated the expression levels of MHC I and CD8. The divergent host immune responses revealed the differences between interspecies and natural infection, which may resulted in different fates of the two viruses. Altogether, these results revealed the differences in transcriptome responses among ranavirus interspecies infection of amphibian and new insights in DNA virus-host interactions in interspecies infection.
   Conclusion: The DNA virus (RGV) not only expressed self-genes and replicated quickly after entry into host under interspecies infection, but also avoided the over-activation of host responses. The strategy could gain time for the survival of interspecies pathogen, and may provide opportunity for its adaptive evolution and interspecies transmission.

AB  - A large body of literature has recently recognized the role of microclimates in controlling the physiology and ecology of species, yet the relevance of fine-scale climatic data for modeling species performance and distribution remains a matter of debate. Using a 6-year monitoring of three potato moth species, major crop pests in the tropical Andes, we asked whether the spatiotemporal resolution of temperature data affect the predictions of models of moth performance and distribution. For this, we used three different climatic data sets: (i) the WorldClim dataset (global dataset), (ii) air temperature recorded using data loggers (weather station dataset), and (iii) air crop canopy temperature (microclimate dataset). We developed a statistical procedure to calibrate all datasets to monthly and yearly variation in temperatures, while keeping both spatial and temporal variances (air monthly temperature at 1 km(2) for the WorldClim dataset, air hourly temperature for the weather station, and air minute temperature over 250 m radius disks for the microclimate dataset). Then, we computed pest performances based on these three datasets. Results for temperature ranging from 9 to 11 degrees C revealed discrepancies in the simulation outputs in both survival and development rates depending on the spatiotemporal resolution of the temperature dataset. Temperature and simulated pest performances were then combined into multiple linear regression models to compare predicted vs. field data. We used an additional set of study sites to test the ability of the results of our model to be extrapolated over larger scales. Results showed that the model implemented with microclimatic data best predicted observed pest abundances for our study sites, but was less accurate than the global dataset model when performed at larger scales. Our simulations therefore stress the importance to consider different temperature datasets depending on the issue to be solved in order to accurately predict species abundances. In conclusion, keeping in mind that the mismatch between the size of organisms and the scale at which climate data are collected and modeled remains a key issue, temperature dataset selection should be balanced by the desired output spatiotemporal scale for better predicting pest dynamics and developing efficient pest management strategies.

AB  - The International Space Station (ISS) is the largest technical vehicle ever built by mankind. It provides a living area for six astronauts and also represents a laboratory in which scientific experiments are conducted in an extraordinary environment. The deployed sensor technology contributes significantly to the operational and scientific success of the station. The sensors on board the ISS can be thereby classified into two categories which differ significantly in their key features: (1) sensors related to crew and station health, and (2) sensors to provide specific measurements in research facilities. The operation of the station requires robust, long-term stable and reliable sensors, since they assure the survival of the astronauts and the intactness of the station. Recently, a wireless sensor network for measuring environmental parameters like temperature, pressure, and humidity was established and its function could be successfully verified over several months. Such a network enhances the operational reliability and stability for monitoring these critical parameters compared to single sensors. The sensors which are implemented into the research facilities have to fulfil other objectives. The high performance of the scientific experiments that are conducted in different research facilities on-board demands the perfect embedding of the sensor in the respective instrumental setup which forms the complete measurement chain. It is shown that the performance of the single sensor alone does not determine the success of the measurement task; moreover, the synergy between different sensors and actuators as well as appropriate sample taking, followed by an appropriate sample preparation play an essential role. The application in a space environment adds additional challenges to the sensor technology, for example the necessity for miniaturisation, automation, reliability, and long-term operation. An alternative is the repetitive calibration of the sensors. This approach, however, increases the operational overhead significantly. But meeting especially these requirements offers unique opportunities for testing these sensor technologies in harsh and dedicated environments which are not available on Earth, therefore pushing the related technologies and methodologies to their limits. The scientific objectives for selected experiments, representing a wide range of research fields, are presented, including the instrument setups and the implemented sensor technologies, and where available, the first scientific results are presented.

AB  - Bathyal cold seeps are isolated extreme deep-sea environments characterized by low species diversity while biomass can be high. The Hakon Mosby mud volcano (Barents Sea, 1,280 m) is a rather stable chemosynthetic driven habitat characterized by prominent surface bacterial mats with high sulfide concentrations and low oxygen levels. Here, the nematode Halomonhystera hermesithrives in high abundances (11,000 individuals 10 cm(-2)). Halomonhystera hermesi is a member of the intertidal Halomonhystera disjuncta species complex that includes five cryptic species (GD 1-5). GD1-5's common habitat is characterized by strong environmental fluctuations. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of H. hermesi and GD1, H. hermesi's closest relative. Genes encoding proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation are more strongly expressed in H. hermesi than in GD1, and many genes were only observed in H. hermesi while being completely absent in GD1. Both observations could in part be attributed to high sulfide concentrations and low oxygen levels. Additionally, fatty acid elongation was also prominent in H. hermesi confirming the importance of highly unsaturated fatty acids in this species. Significant higher amounts of transcription factors and genes involved in signaling receptor activity were observed in GD1 (many of which were completely absent in H. hermesi), allowing fast signaling and transcriptional reprogramming which can mediate survival in dynamic intertidal environments. GC content was approximately 8% higher in H. hermesi coding unigenes resulting in differential codon usage between both species and a higher proportion of amino acids with GC-rich codons in H. hermesi. In general our results showed that most pathways were active in both environments and that only three genes are under natural selection. This indicates that also plasticity should be taken in consideration in the evolutionary history of Halomonhystera species. Such plasticity, as well as possible preadaptation to low oxygen and high sulfide levels might have played an important role in the establishment of a cold-seep Halomonhystera population.

AB  - center dot Key message Understanding the adaptive mechanisms of forest species is vital to ensure their survival in a climate change scenario. This study aimed at uncovering the relationship between genetic variability and environmental variables in naturalCastanea sativapopulations, unveiling how different climate scenarios drove local adaption processes using a landscape genomics approach. Our findings provide useful data for future management of this species. center dot Context Temperate forest species, such as chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.), are currently threatened by increasing temperature together with disruption and reduction of precipitation due to climate change. In this context, understanding the adaptation processes of species will help to manage and ensure the conservation of forests. center dot Aims We studied the relationship between genetic variability and climate variables in natural populations of C. sativa using a landscape genomics approach aimed to identify local adaption processes. center dot Methods Using five genomic SSRs and eight functional EST-SSRs markers, 268 individuals belonging to ten different natural European chestnut populations distributed in contrasting climatic sites were genotyped. In addition, associations between allelic variation and climatic variables (environmental association analyses approach) were performed using Sam beta ada and LFMM. center dot Results Results highlighted a strong inter-relationship between climate variables and evolutionary processes resulting in adaptive variation. STRUCTURE analysis based on functional markers split the populations in three separate gene pools (K = 3), mostly in agreement with the different climatic conditions existing in the studied areas. Divergent spatial patterns of genetic variation between rainy and arid areas were found. We detected a total of 202 associations with climate among 22 different alleles, 9% of which related with the outlier locus FIR059, known to be implicated in regulatory mechanisms during water stress adaptation processes. center dot Conclusion Landscape genomics analyses revealed a pattern of adaptive variation, where specific climatic variables influenced the frequencies distribution and fixation of several alleles, resulting in local adaptation processes of the populations in the investigated areas. Our findings underline the close inter-relationship existing between climate and genetic variability and indicate how this approach could provide valuable information for the management of forest species in a rapidly changing environment.

AB  - Aim Climate changes are thought to be responsible for the retreat and eventual extinction of subtropical lauroid species that covered much of Europe and North Africa during the Palaeogene and early Neogene; little is known, however, of the spatial and temporal patterns of this demise. Herein we calibrate ecological niche models to assess the climatic requirements of Laurus L. (Lauraceae), an emblematic relic from the Tethyan subtropical flora, subsequently using these models to infer how the range dynamics of Laurus were affected by Plio-Pleistocene climate changes. We also provide predictions of likely range changes resulting from future climatic scenarios.
   Location The Mediterranean Basin and Macaronesian islands (Canaries, Madeira, Azores).
   Methods We used a maximum-entropy algorithm (Maxent) to model the relationship between climate and Laurus distribution over time. The models were fitted both to the present and to the middle Pliocene, based on fossil records. We employed climatic reconstructions for the mid-Pliocene (3 Ma), the Last Glacial Maximum (21 ka) and a CO2-doubling future scenario to project putative species distribution in each period. We validated the model projections with Laurus fossil and present occurrences.
   Results Laurus preferentially occupied warm and moist areas with low seasonality, showing a marked stasis of its climatic niche. Models fitted to Pliocene conditions successfully predicted the current species distribution. Large suitable areas existed during the Pliocene, which were strongly reduced during the Pleistocene, but humid refugia within the Mediterranean Basin and Macaronesian islands enabled long-term persistence. Future climate conditions are likely to re-open areas suitable for colonization north of the current range.
   Main conclusions The climatic requirements of Laurus remained virtually unchanged over the last 3 Myr. This marked niche conservatism imposed largely deterministic range dynamics driven by climate conditions. This species's relatively high drought tolerance might account for the survival of Laurus in continental Europe throughout the Quaternary whilst other Lauraceae became extinct. Climatic scenarios for the end of this century would favour an expansion of the species's range towards northern latitudes, while severely limiting southern populations due to increased water stress.

AB  - Ocean acidification, the decrease in seawater pH due to the absorption of atmospheric CO2, profoundly threatens the survival of a large number of marine species. Cold-water corals are considered to be among the most vulnerable organisms to ocean acidification because they are already exposed to relatively low pH and corresponding low calcium carbonate saturation states (Omega). Lophelia pertusa is a globally distributed cold-water scleractinian coral that provides critical three-dimensional habitat for many ecologically and economically significant species. In this study, four different genotypes of L. pertusa were exposed to three pH treatments (pH = 7.60, 7.75, and 7.90) over a short (2-week) experimental period, and six genotypes were exposed to two pH treatments (pH = 7.60 and 7.90) over a long (6-month) experimental period. Their physiological response was measured as net calcification rate and the activity of carbonic anhydrase, a key enzyme in the calcification pathway. In the short-term experiment, net calcification rates did not significantly change with pH, although they were highly variable in the low pH treatment, including some genotypes that maintained positive net calcification in undersaturated conditions. In the 6-month experiment, average net calcification was significantly reduced at low pH, with corals exhibiting net dissolution of skeleton. However, one of the same genotypes that maintained positive net calcification (+0.04% day(-1)) under the low pH treatment in the short-term experiment also maintained positive net calcification longer than the other genotypes in the long-term experiment, although none of the corals maintained positive calcification for the entire 6 months. Average carbonic anhydrase activity was not affected by pH, although some genotypes exhibited small, insignificant, increases in activity after the sixth month. Our results suggest that while net calcification in L. pertusa is adversely affected by ocean acidification in the long term, it is possible that some genotypes may prove to be more resilient than others, particularly to short perturbations of the carbonate system. These results provide evidence that populations of L. pertusa in the Gulf of Mexico may contain the genetic variability necessary to support an adaptive response to future ocean acidification.

AB  - Cool climate biomes in the Northern Hemisphere have evolved relatively recently. Temperature decline between the late Eocene and the Pliocene contributed to the evolution of many plant groups in modern cool climate biomes, such as mosses belonging to the Brachythecium novae-angliae-complex. The Brachythecium novae-angliae-complex comprises three species that have a disjunct distribution in temperate and boreal regions in the Northern Hemisphere. The core species in the complex have only recently been transferred from Bryhnia to Brachythecium and the delimitation of the complex and of species within it still remains uncertain. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of the group using molecular data and estimated the timing of the diversifications in the tree. In addition, we examined the morphology and compared morphological diversification with genetic diversity. The Brachythecium novae-angliae-complex diversified in East Asia in the middle Miocene, 9.1 Ma (HPD 95% 3.9-14.8 Myr). Bryhnia trichomitria and B. graminicolor were revealed not to be close relatives of the complex and are therefore transferred to Brachythecium and Koponeniella gen. nov., respectively. Both morphology and molecular data supported the position of Asian Brachythecium noesicum as sister to the Brachythecium novae-angliae crown clade that includes two species, B. hultenii and B. novae-angliae. The crown clade diverged at the end of the Miocene, 6.4 Ma (HPD 95% 2.4-11.6 Myr) and its taxa have a disjunct distribution in cool temperate and boreal areas in the Beringia region (B. novae-angliae subsp. hultenii), and eastern North America and northwestern Europe (B. novae-angliae subsp. novae-angliae). In the crown clade the majority of populations belong to one common haplotype present in all three disjunct parts of the distribution area. Despite low variation in DNA sequence data, morphology allows the distinction between B. novae-angliae subsp. hultenii and B. novae-angliae subsp. novae-angliae. Because of weak morphological and genetic differentiation, European Bryhnia scabrida is treated here as a synonym of Brachythecium novae-angliae subsp. novae-angliae. Glacial survival during the Quaternary and climatic oscillations during the late Tertiary and Quaternary in East Asia may have resulted in diversification of the complex and enabled adaptation to cool temperate and boreal climates.

AB  - Adaptation potential of forests to rapid climatic changes can be assessed from vegetation dynamics during past climatic changes as preserved in fossil pollen data. However, pollen data reflect the integrated effects of climate and biotic processes, such as establishment, survival, competition, and migration. To disentangle these processes, we compared an annually laminated late Wurm and Holocene pollen record from the Central Swiss Plateau with simulations of a dynamic forest patch model. All input data used in the simulations were largely independent from pollen data; i.e. the presented analysis is non-circular. Temperature and precipitation scenarios were based on reconstructions from pollen-independent sources. The earliest arrival times of the species at the study site after the last glacial were inferred from pollen maps. We ran a series of simulations under different combinations of climate and immigration scenarios. In addition, the sensitivity of the simulated presence/absence of four major species to changes in the climate scenario was examined. The pattern of the pollen record could partly be explained by the used climate scenario, mostly by temperature. However, some features, in particular the absence of most species during the late Wurm could only be simulated if the winter temperature anomalies of the used scenario were decreased considerably. Consequently, we had to assume in the simulations, that most species immigrated during or after the Younger Dryas (12000 years BP), Abies and Fagus even later. Given the timing of tree species immigration, the vegetation was in equilibrium with climate during long periods, but responded with lags at the time-scale of centuries to millennia caused by a secondary succession after rapid climatic changes such as at the end of Younger Dryas, or immigration of dominant taxa. Climate influenced the tree taxa both directly and indirectly by changing inter-specific competition. We concluded, that also during the present fast climatic change, species migration might be an important process, particularly if geographic barriers, such as the Alps are in the migrational path.

AB  - The predatory behavior of Myxococcus xanthus has attracted extensive attention due to its unique social traits and inherent biological activities. In addition to group hunting, individual M. xanthus cells are able to kill and lyse prey cells; however, there is little understanding of the dynamics of solitary predation. In this study, by employing a bacterial tracking technique, we investigated M. xanthus predatory dynamics on Escherichia coli at the single-cell level. The killing and lysis of E. coli by a single M. xanthus cell was monitored in real time by microscopic observation, and the plasmolysis of prey cells was identified at a relatively early stage of solitary predation. After quantitative characterization of their solitary predatory behavior, M. xanthus cells were found to respond more dramatically to direct contact with live E. coli cells than heat-killed or UV-killed cells, showing slower predator motion and faster lysing of prey. Among the three contact-dependent killing modes classified according to the major subareas of M. xanthus cells in contact with prey, leading pole contact was observed most. After killing the prey, approximately 72% of M. xanthus cells were found to leave without thorough degradation of the lysed prey, and this postresidence behavior is described as a lysis-leave pattern, indicating that solitary predation has low efficiency in terms of prey-cell consumption. Our results provide a detailed description of the single-cell level dynamics of M. xanthus solitary predation from both prey and predator perspectives.
   IMPORTANCE Bacterial predation plays multiple essential roles in bacterial selection and mortality within microbial ecosystems. In addition to its ecological and evolutionary importance, many potential applications of bacterial predation have been proposed. The myxobacterium Myxococcus xanthus is a well-known predatory member of the soil microbial community. Its predation is commonly considered a collective behavior comparable to a wolf pack attack; however, individual M. xanthus cells are also able to competently lead to the lysis of a prey cell. Using a bacterial tracking technique, we are able to observe and analyze solitary predation by M. xanthus on Escherichia coli at the single-cell level and reveal the dynamics of both predator and prey during the process. The present study will not only provide a comprehensive understanding of M. xanthus solitary predation but also help to explain why M. xanthus often displays multicellular characteristic predatory behaviors in nature, while a single cell is capable of predation.

AB  - The predicted increase in frequency and intensity of climatic extremes, like drought episodes, imposes a challenge on the choice of commercial forest trees under climate change conditions. The present study aims at quantifying the impact of summer drought on growth of spruce, pine, silver fir, beech and oak as the main forest tree species in Southern Germany, and includes Douglas fir as a possible alternative for spruce.
   Series of tree-ring widths from more than 1400 trees from 48 sites all over Bavaria and adjacent states are employed for growth/climate modeling and pointer year analysis to derive predications about the climatic limitation of tree growth subject to species, regional climate and site quality. Response functions relating tree growth to climatic variables in monthly resolution have been applied. The obtained parameters were subject to principal component analysis to derive a more condensed representation of climatic constraints on tree growth. Soil water balance modeling was applied to refine the connections between regional climate and growth reactions to drought in terms of site quality. A modification of Brook90 (Brook90-LWF) has been employed for water balance modeling. Pointer years were choosen a priori according to documented drought years and used to calculate short- and long-term impact of drought on tree-growth.
   For all species under investigation, critical areas for tree growth could be identified. Generally, the warmer and drier northern part of the investigation area is more unfavorable, with spruce generally being more affected than other species in terms of short- and long-term impact of summer drought on tree-growth (Figure 1). Furthermore, in a condensed view of dendroclimatic forcings, spruce depicts the strongest connection to the aspect "summer drought" throughout the investigation area, whereas oak shows the weakest connection (Figure 5). As a main result, oak is superior to all other species under investigation regarding drought tolerance throughout the investigation area. But also silver fir could replace the most critical spruce on a wide range of sites.
   Furthermore, the surprisingly high variability in reaction to drought observed on regional and stand level (Figure 3) implies a high adaptive potential of the populations within the possibilities of their inherent genetic diversity, hampering the derivation of clear climatic or site-related thresholds (compare Figure 2).

AB  - Background: Ticks of the species Ixodes ricinus are the main vectors of Lyme Borreliosis and Tick-borne Encephalitis - two rapidly emerging diseases in Europe. Repellents provide a practical means of protection against tick bites and can therefore minimize the transmission of tick-borne diseases. We developed and tested seven different dodecanoic acid (DDA)-formulations for their efficacy in repelling host-seeking nymphs of I. ricinus by laboratory screening. The ultimately selected formulation was then used for comparative investigations of commercially available tick repellents in humans.
   Methods: Laboratory screening tests were performed using the Moving-object (MO) bioassay. All test formulations contained 10% of the naturally occurring active substance DDA and differed only in terms of the quantitative and qualitative composition of inactive ingredients and fragrances. The test procedure used in the human bioassays is a modification of an assay described by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and recommended for regulatory affairs. Repellency was computed using the equation: R = 100 - N-R/N x 100, where N-R is the number of non-repelled ticks, and N is the respective number of control ticks. All investigations were conducted in a controlled laboratory environment offering standardized test conditions.
   Results: All test formulations strongly repelled nymphs of I. ricinus (100-81% protection) as shown by the MO-bioassay. The majority of ticks dropped off the treated surface of the heated rotating drum that served as the attractant (1 mg/cm(2) repellent applied). The 10% DDA-based formulation, that produced the best results in laboratory screening, was as effective as the coconut oil-based reference product. The mean protection time of both preparations was generally similar and averaged 8 hours.
   Repellency investigations in humans showed that the most effective 10% DDA-based formulation (similar to 1.67 mg/cm(2) applied) strongly avoided the attachment of I. ricinus nymphs and adults for at least 6 hours. The test repellent always provided protection (83-63%) against I. ricinus nymphs equivalent to the natural coconut oil based reference product and a better protection (88-75%) against adult ticks than the synthetic Icaridin-containing reference repellent.
   Conclusion: We found that the 10% DDA-based formulation (ContraZeck (R)) is an easily applied and very effective natural repellent against I. ricinus ticks. By reducing the human-vector contact the product minimises the risk of transmission of tick-borne diseases in humans.

AB  - Knowledge of juvenile recruitment (defined here as the quantitative addition of early benthic life stages to a local population) is important for conserving heavily harvested species and their critical habitats. Stone crabs (genus Menippe) are commercially and ecologically important throughout the Gulf of Mexico nearshore waters off Florida, but very little is known about their recruitment. Using standard commercial stone crab traps, megalopal and postsettlement juvenile (collectively, youngof-the-year, "YOY") stone crabs were sampled at multiple spatial scales and for multiple stone crab generations to characterize geographical, seasonal, and interannual variation in their distribution and relative abundance (numbers collected on traps) in the Gulf of Mexico off peninsular Florida and north of the Florida Keys (the "Florida Gulf"). The influences of potentially relevant oceanographic and biological variables [temperature, salinity, benthic community on the traps (trap fouling community), depth, distance from shore] on YOY stone crabs were investigated at locations distributed throughout the study area. Trap fouling communities had never been analyzed in detail prior to this study; an importance index was developed to quantify the seasonality, commonality, and density of the fouling communities and organisms composing the communities. Continuous, long-term data from the Tampa Bay location allowed investigation of the effects of biological relationships [relative abundance of female Menippe carrying eggs (ovigerous), occurrences of red tide (Karenia brevis, a toxic dinoflagellate) blooms] and meteorological events [tropical cyclones, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurrences] on temporal patterns of variation in recruitment. High relative abundances of YOY stone crabs were collected off peninsular Florida from dense, complex benthic biota that grew on crab traps located off large, pristine estuaries in relatively turbid water less than 5 m deep, where salinity ranged 24-36 and water temperature averaged 29 degrees C-32 degrees C. Two major recruitment locations, stable through decades, consistently accounted for approximately 50% of the YOY stone crabs collected; two secondary recruitment locations similarly accounted for another 25%. Relative abundance of YOY stone crabs was highest nearshore at the major recruitment locations, particularly during years of high relative abundance. Approximately 65%-75% of the recruits were collected August to October; however, the timing of both peak relative abundance and lowest relative abundance shifted to later in the year as latitude decreased. Patterns of change among months in relative abundance differed among locations within years and among years within locations. Water temperature, salinity, and trap fouling community were the important determinants of temporal and spatial variation in YOY stone crab relative abundance; depth and distance from shore were also important in areas where they varied notably among stations within locations and across broader expanses of the study area. At Tampa Bay, a sharp increase in relative abundance of ovigerous females in spring was followed by a similarly sharp increase in YOY stone crab relative abundance (principally stage 3-5 crabs) 3 mo later; whereas a sharp decrease in ovigerous female relative abundance in autumn was followed by a similarly sharp decrease in YOY stone crab relative abundance 1 mo later.
   Coincidence of the normal autumnal decrease in YOY stone crab relative abundance with red tides and tropical cyclones prevented assigning clear relationships between seasonal change in relative abundance and these potential external influences. Annual decreases in relative abundance were significantly related to the occurrence of tropical cyclones that came near Tampa Bay during the previous year. Twice, confluences of multiple hurricanes, timely red tides, and ENSO events were followed by nearly complete, 1- to 2-y recruitment collapses. In contrast, a single meteorologically and oceanographically highly anomalous year coincided with exceptionally high abundances of both YOY and ovigerous female stone crabs. A relationship between YOY stone crabs and subsequent fishery harvest was not evident, possibly due to a variety of fishery practices. Because stone crabs are subjected to intense fishing pressure throughout the Florida Gulf, the YOY stone crab recruitment grounds and their associated estuaries should be protected from the effects of development, agriculture, aquaculture, and commercial and recreational crabbing.

AB  - A comprehensive review of U-Pb geochronology and Hf isotopes of zircons separated from granulite xenoliths entrained in Phanerozoic magmatic rocks and inherited xenocrysts from the associated lower crust rocks from various domains of the North China Craton (NCC) provides new insights into understanding the evolution of the lower crust in this part of the Precambrian nucleus of Asia. The oldest zircons recorded in granulite xenoliths show ages up to 3.6 Ga, slightly younger than the oldest zircons (3.8 Ga) from samples of the exposed Archean upper crust. However, the Hf isotope features indicate that the oldest lower crust might have been derived from a 4.0 to 4.1 Ga primordial crust as indicated by the data from an inherited zircon in the North Qinling Orogenic Belt at the southern part of the NCC. Our synthesis also suggests that ca. 2.5 Ga mark an important period for the evolution of the lower crust of the NCC and the cratonization of the Archean blocks in the NCC, at least for the Eastern Block, with a possible link to mantle plume activity. The occasional presence of zircons with 2.6-3.1 Ga ages in the lower crustal granulite xenoliths suggests a continuous reworking of the Paleoarchean lower crust during the Archean. The comprehensive data also show that 1.8-2.0 Ga period was the first significant event for the evolution of the lower crust after the cratonization of the Archean blocks of the NCC, which affected the whole lower crust of the Eastern NCC. Episodic growth or rejuvenation of the Precambrian lower crust beneath the NCC is also revealed by U-Pb and Hf isotope data, resulting from the corresponding addition of juvenile materials from mantle to lower crust, with a mixing of the old crust with juvenile magma. This compositional modification of the lower crust resembles the compositional transformation from the refractory lithospheric mantle to a fertile one through the refractory peridotite - infiltrated melt reaction as revealed in the lithospheric mantle beneath the NCC.

AB  - Background Barnacles are specialized marine organisms that differ from other crustaceans in possession of a calcareous shell, which is attached to submerged surfaces. Barnacles have a wide distribution, mostly in the intertidal zone and shallow waters, but a few species inhabit the deep-sea floor. It is of interest to investigate how such sessile crustaceans became adapted to extreme deep-sea environments. We sequenced the transcriptomes of a deep-sea barnacle, Glyptelasma gigas collected at a depth of 731 m from the northern area of the Zhongjiannan Basin, and a shallow-water coordinal relative, Octolasmis warwicki. The purpose of this study was to provide genetic resources for investigating adaptation mechanisms of deep-sea barnacles. Results Totals of 62,470 and 51,585 unigenes were assembled for G. gigas and O. warwicki, respectively, and functional annotation of these unigenes was made using public databases. Comparison of the protein-coding genes between the deep- and shallow-water barnacles, and with those of four other shallow-water crustaceans, revealed 26 gene families that had experienced significant expansion in G. gigas. Functional annotation showed that these expanded genes were predominately related to DNA repair, signal transduction and carbohydrate metabolism. Base substitution analysis on the 11,611 single-copy orthologs between G. gigas and O. warwicki indicated that 25 of them were distinctly positive selected in the deep-sea barnacle, including genes related to transcription, DNA repair, ligand binding, ion channels and energy metabolism, potentially indicating their importance for survival of G. gigas in the deep-sea environment. Conclusions The barnacle G. gigas has adopted strategies of expansion of specific gene families and of positive selection of key genes to counteract the negative effects of high hydrostatic pressure, hypoxia, low temperature and food limitation on the deep-sea floor. These expanded gene families and genes under positive selection would tend to enhance the capacities of G. gigas for signal transduction, genetic information processing and energy metabolism, and facilitate networks for perceiving and responding physiologically to the environmental conditions in deep-sea habitats. In short, our results provide genomic evidence relating to deep-sea adaptation of G. gigas, which provide a basis for further biological studies of sessile crustaceans in the deep sea.

AB  - We present a quantum-mechanical study of absorption cross sections and correlation functions of the title system, using a spinless Hamiltonian that includes the nonadiabatic Renner-Teller (RT) coupling between the electronic states, and taking into account the nuclear-spin statistics. We consider also the stimulated emission, assuming a Boltzmann distribution of the molecular levels, and we express correlation functions in terms of wave-packet (WP) overlaps. Assuming that the body-fixed z component of the angular momentum is a constant of motion of isolated NH2, we calculate (X) over tilde rotational and rovibrational, and (X) over tilde+(A) over tilde rovibronic cross sections and correlation functions at 4.2 and 300 K, up to 26 000 cm(-1) and 3000 fs. We also report the rotational spectrum at 3000 K. The number of absorbing states is large at high T, and the number of lines with appreciably intensity thus increases remarkably with T, from 67 at 4.2 K, to 847 at 300 K, and up to 10 609 at 3000 K. The cold spectrum consists only of Pi lines, due to ground-level absorption. At room and higher T, the hot spectrum presents long progressions of rovibronic lines. The strongest spectral intensities are X Pi and Phi rotational lines and (A) over tilde bending Sigma and Pi lines. We also find many Fermi resonances between (A) over tilde bending and combination states, and that similar to 50% of the lines belong to both electronic states. This latter result points out many RT couplings above 11 000 cm(-1). The theoretical intensities agree very well with the few available experimental data. The time evolution of the correlation functions reflects all internal motions, with periods ranging from similar to 750 to 2 fs, from slow rotational modes to ultrafast electronic dynamics. At low T, the correlation function is proportional to the survival probability of an initial WP, it has many recursions, and can be very regular, without decaying on the average. At high T, the correlation function is associated with the dynamics of many WPs, which present different dephasing times, and the dynamics thus becomes very irregular. The internal dynamics is nonadiabatic above 11 000 cm(-1), because the WPs move from the vertical to the linear region of the excited surface, and can jump to the ground surface owing to RT couplings.

AB  - The response of deltas to sea level rise (SLR) has mostly been studied from a perspective of human impacts like global warming and impoundment, or from a perspective of natural changes associated with glacial cycles. Here we synthesize the response of deltas to SLR by integrating research looking at past and future evolution to improve the potential to manage deltas to adapt to high rates of SLR. We hypothesize that fluvial-dominated deltas can be managed to survive high rates of SLR (>1 cm year(-1)) that characterized the post-glacial period and will likely characterize coming centuries due to global warming. There are three known mechanisms for deltas to cope with SLR that are self-reinforcing as the rates increase, tending to enhance the efficiency of the deltaic sedimentary trap:
   (a) an increase in the frequency of delta lobe switching with accelerated SLR leading to the formation of new lobes in shallow areas
   (b) an increase in the frequency and magnitude of flood events in the delta plain as a consequence of an increased crevassing through the river natural levees, leading to enhanced sediment deposition
   (c) an increase in the frequency and magnitude of overwash events in the delta fringe enhancing the ability of sandy beaches to adapt to SLR.
   The current view by much of the management community is that coastal protection is the best strategy for future SLR up to 2-5 m, and beyond 5 m that retreat would be the best (or the only) strategy. However, for the case of deltas a more functional adaptation strategy based on restoration can be envisioned provided that natural processes and ecosystem functions can be managed to increase system's resilience. The central element of this alternative strategy is the idea of "rising grounds" (vertical aggradation), instead of "rising dikes", but a combination of both can also be foreseen and may be needed in many cases. This means that "rising dikes" will be only feasible if "rising grounds" is also implemented; if not, retreat will be the only long-term alternative. We propose that "rising grounds" is the best adaptation strategy inmost deltas for high-end scenarios of SLR, though in some cases the option of retreating may be necessary in combination with structural and functional measures.

   The resistance of organisms to trace metals can have a genetic or a plastic origin. Indeed, differential environmental conditions experienced before the exposure to trace metals could physiologically condition organisms and plastically enhance their subsequent resistance to trace metals. In this study on the ant Temnothorax nylanderi, we investigated whether the better cadmium resistance of urban colonies relative to forest colonies could originate from the distinct hibernation conditions that they experienced prior to cadmium exposure. We compared the ability of urban and forest colonies to resist cadmium depending on whether they had hibernated in their respective urban or forest habitats or under a laboratory common garden setup. We found that urban colonies resisted cadmium better than forest colonies when they had hibernated under a common garden. Surprisingly, this difference was not observed between urban and forest colonies that had hibernated in the field, in contrast with a previous study. One reason may be that winter was particularly mild on the year of our experiment. Our results therefore support the idea that urban colonies are genetically adapted to resist trace metals, but that this adaptation is only revealed under specific environmental conditions.
   Trace metals such as cadmium are found in high concentrations in urban environments. Animal and plant populations living in heavily contaminated environments could adapt to trace metals exposure. A recent study shows that urban populations of the acorn ant Temnothorax nylanderi are more resistant to cadmium than their forest counterparts. However, this study was performed using field colonies that had just come out of hibernation. Because urban and forest hibernation environments differ, the differential resistance to trace metals may originate either from differential hibernation conditions or from a different resistance baseline to cadmium. In this study, we tested these two hypotheses using laboratory common garden hibernation conditions. We let urban and forest colonies of the ant T. nylanderi hibernate under the same laboratory conditions for four months. After this hibernation period, we also collected field-hibernating colonies and we compared cadmium resistance between urban and forest colonies depending on the hibernation condition. We found a differential response to cadmium under common garden, with urban colonies displaying less larval mortality and lower size reduction of the produced individuals. This suggests a different resistance baseline of urban colonies to cadmium. However, unexpectedly, we did not detect the differential response between urban and forest colonies in the field, suggesting a more complex scenario involving both genetic and environmental influences.

AB  - Climate change will strongly affect the developmental timing of insects, as their development rate depends largely on ambient temperature. However, we know little about the genetic mechanisms underlying the temperature sensitivity of embryonic development in insects. We investigated embryonic development rate in the winter moth (Operophtera brumata), a species with egg dormancy which has been under selection due to climate change. We used RNA sequencing to investigate which genes are involved in the regulation of winter moth embryonic development rate in response to temperature. Over the course of development, we sampled eggs before and after an experimental change in ambient temperature, including two early development weeks when the temperature sensitivity of eggs is low and two late development weeks when temperature sensitivity is high. We found temperature-responsive genes that responded in a similar way across development, as well as genes with a temperature response specific to a particular development week. Moreover, we identified genes whose temperature effect size changed around the switch in temperature sensitivity of development rate. Interesting candidate genes for regulating the temperature sensitivity of egg development rate included genes involved in histone modification, hormonal signalling, nervous system development and circadian clock genes. The diverse sets of temperature-responsive genes we found here indicate that there are many potential targets of selection to change the temperature sensitivity of embryonic development rate. Identifying for which of these genes there is genetic variation in wild insect populations will give insight into their adaptive potential in the face of climate change.

AB  - Six porous carbons (PCs) were prepared via thermochemical methodology from cotton-stalk crop residue, collected from diverse geographical locations in India. Although similar in nature, the precursor collection sites majorly influenced the properties of the generated PCs, possibly due to variations in soil characteristics and fertilizer usage patterns. The microstructures were characterized by a series of analytical data, including FT-IR and Raman Spectra, XRD, TGA, SEM imaging, and in-depth XPS studies. Nitrogen sorption isotherms at 77 K of all PCs revealed well-defined microporosity and high specific surface area, varying from 1706 to 2438 m(2)/g under similar synthetic conditions. Further, gaseous CO2 adsorption studies showed that the PCs exhibited diverse uptake performances at 1 bar under varied temperatures. The maximum uptake capacity of 6.23 mmol/g (273 K), 3.85 mmol/g (298 K), and 3.28 mmol/g (313 K) defined superior values over contemporary adsorbents. A critical-point drying technique was employed further to enhance the CO2 uptake capacity of these carbons. Importantly, all the carbons revealed moderate to good CO2/N-2 separation selectivity at low temperature (similar to 25 at 273 K) that experienced a unique enhancement under elevated temperature, as calculated from ideal adsorbed solution theory. After vacuum regeneration, the activated carbons exhibited stable CO2 adsorption up to five cycles, validating their potential reusability for CO2 capture. Precisely, the cotton stalk crop residue-derived PCs represent one-of-a-kind low cost, eco-friendly, abundant, and scalable absorbents for regenerable CO2 capture with moderate heat of adsorption and selectivity values, with promises of practical usability.

AB  - Tarakihi (Nemadactylus macropterus) is an important fishery species with widespread distribution around New Zealand and off the southern coasts of Australia. However, little is known about whether the populations are locally adapted or genetically structured. To address this, we conducted whole-genome resequencing of 175 tarakihi from around New Zealand and Tasmania (Australia) to obtain a dataset of 7.5 million genome-wide and high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Variant filtering, F-ST-outlier analysis, and redundancy analysis (RDA) were used to evaluate population structure, adaptive structure, and locus-environment associations. A weak but significant level of neutral genetic differentiation was found between tarakihi from New Zealand and Tasmania (F-ST = 0.0054-0.0073, P <= 0.05), supporting the existence of at least two separate reproductive stocks. No clustering was detected among the New Zealand populations (phi(ST) < 0.001, P = 0.77). Outlier-based, presumably adaptive variation suggests fine-scale adaptive structure between locations around central New Zealand off the east (Wairarapa, Cape Campbell, and Hawke's Bay) and the west coast (Tasman Bay/Golden Bay and Upper West Coast of South Island). Allele frequencies from 55 loci were associated with at least one of six environmental variables, of which 47 correlated strongly with yearly mean water temperature. Although genes associated with these loci are linked to various functions, the most common functions were integral components of membrane and cilium assembly. Projection of the RDA indicates the existence of a latitudinal temperature cline. Our work provides the first genomic insights supporting panmixia of tarakihi in New Zealand and evidence of a genomic cline that appears to be driven by the temperature gradients, together providing crucial information to inform the stock assessment of this species, and to widen the insights of the ecological drivers of adaptive variation in a marine species.

AB  - The widespread application of 'two-line' hybrid rice, based on temperature- and photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile lines, plays an important role in ensuring global food security. Such lines are fertile in short-day/low-temperature conditions when used for self-breeding, and sterile in long-day/high-temperature conditions when used for hybrid seed production. However, fertility instability and low hybrid seed production of sterile lines are urgent problems. The aim of this study was to increase the stability of pollen sterility by studying the critical sterile-inducing temperature and stigma vitality of 97 newly selected male-sterile lines in China from 2017 to 2020. Sterility gene source analysis showed that 89.7% of the materials contained the tms5 sterile gene. After 6 days of treatment at 23.5 degrees C during the reproductive period, 42 male-sterile lines were sterile. After 10 days of treatment at 23.5 degrees C, the sterility of 12 sterile lines remained stable, indicating a high level of safety for hybrid seed production. After 10 days of low-temperature treatment at 19 degrees C, the fertile pollen rate of 47 of the 97 sterile lines was >70%, indicating a high level of seed reproduction safety. Only six of these 47 male-sterile lines could maintain low fertility after 10 days of treatment at 23.5 degrees C, indicating that they could be used safely for both hybrid seed production and sterile line reproduction. The results of delayed pollination showed that among the six lines, only Zhong 7S had high stigma vitality, and BYXA IS and HIOS-2 had medium stigma vitality. Therefore, those three sterile lines have the potential for safe hybrid seed production and high-yield seed reproduction. Based on our research, we propose a new breeding standard of dual-purpose male-sterile lines to promote the development of two-line hybrid rice.

AB  - Seasonal temperatures select for eclosion timing of temperate insects and their parasitoids. In western North America, the fruit fly Rhagoletis zephyria Snow (Diptera:Tephritidae) is parasitized by the hymenopterous wasps Utetes lectoides (Gahan), an egg parasite, and Opius downesi Gahan, a larval parasite (both Braconidae). Eclosion of wasps should be timed with the presence of susceptible fly stages, but reports indicate U. lectoides ecloses in the absence of flies under no-chill conditions. Based on this, we tested the hypotheses that chill durations and no-chill temperatures both differentially regulate eclosion times of R. zephyria and its parasitic wasps. When fly puparia were chilled at similar to 3 degrees C for 130-180 d, U. lectoides and O. downesi always eclosed on average later than flies. However, after 180-d chill, flies eclosed on average earlier than after 130- and 150-d chill, whereas eclosion times of U. lectoides and O. downesi were less or not affected by chill duration. When fly puparia were exposed to 20-22 degrees C (no chill), U. lectoides eclosed before flies, with 88.9% of U. lectoides versus only 0.61% of flies eclosing. Taken together, findings show that eclosion times of flies are more sensitive to changes in chill duration than those of wasps. Flies are less sensitive than wasps to no-chill in that most flies do not respond by eclosing after no-chill while most wasps do. Our results suggest that shorter winters and longer summers due to climate change could cause mismatches in eclosion times of flies and wasps, with potentially significant evolutionary consequences.

AB  - Shifting range limits are predicted for many species as the climate warms. However, the rapid pace of climate change will challenge the natural dispersal capacity of long-lived, sessile organisms such as forest trees. Adaptive responses of populations will, therefore, depend on levels of genetic variation and plasticity for climate-responsive traits, which likely vary across the range due to expansion history and current patterns of selection. Here, we study levels of genetic and plastic variation for phenology and growth traits in populations of red spruce (Picea rubens), from the range core to the highly fragmented trailing edge. We measured more than 5000 offspring sampled from three genetically distinct regions (core, margin and edge) grown in three common gardens replicated along a latitudinal gradient. Genetic variation in phenology and growth showed low to moderate heritability and differentiation among regions, suggesting some potential to respond to selection. Phenology traits were highly plastic, but this plasticity was generally neutral or maladaptive in the effect on growth, revealing a potential liability under warmer climates. These results suggest future climate adaptation will depend on the regional availability of genetic variation in red spruce and provide a resource for the design and management of assisted gene flow. This article is part of the theme issue 'Species' ranges in the face of changing environments (Part II)'.

AB  - Alkaline pretreatment is a simple and effective method for removing lignin at low temperatures and normal pressure, but this process consumes large amounts of water and produces wastewater, both of which limit its industrial applications. To develop a process with zero discharge of black liquor and wastewater, in this study, KOH/urea-treated bagasse was directly subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis without detoxification or washing after adjusting the pH. Adaptive Laboratory Evolved (ALE) Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y2034, which can endure threefold diluted black liquor, was obtained. The results showed that SCB treated with 1.5% KOH/urea (1.5% KOH/ 1.5% urea) for 4 h could be directly enzymatically hydrolyzed and fermented. The enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency and ethanol yield reached 89.9% and 97%, respectively. The cellulosic ethanol production method developed in this research provides a possibility for industrial application.

AB  - Neotropical black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) is expanding poleward into temperate salt marsh along Atlantic Florida, USA, with field evidence of trait shifts consistent with greater cold tolerance within range margin populations. However, whether these shifts have a genetic basis remains unanswered. To address this gap, we measured multiple phenotypic traits of twenty A. germinans maternal cohorts from areas in both the Atlantic Florida range core and margin in a 2-year greenhouse common garden with annual temperatures analogous to range margin conditions. Compared to those from the range core, range margin cohorts survived in greater numbers, established (i.e., produced first true leaves) more quickly, and were less stressed under winter temperatures. Range margin cohorts were not taller, but invested more into lateral growth and biomass accumulation that presumably reflects adaptation to their colder and open-canopy environment. Range margin cohorts also exhibited leaf traits consistent with greater resource acquisition that may compensate for a shorter growing season and reduced light quality at higher latitude. Our results suggest that genetically based phenotypic differences better enable these range margin mangroves to thrive within their stressful environment and may facilitate further poleward expansion. An improved understanding of adaptive trait variation within ecologically important mangrove foundation species should also help inform coastal restoration initiatives.

AB  - Laser powder bed fusion exhibits many advantages for manufacturing complex geometries from hard to machine alloys such as IN625. However, a major drawback is the formation of high tensile residual stresses, and the complex relationship between the process parameters and the residual stresses has not been fully investigated. The current study presents multi-scale models to examine the variation of process parameters on melt pool dimensions, cyclic temperature evolutions, cooling rate, and cyclic stress generation and how they affect the stress end state. In addition, the effect of the same energy density, which is often overlooked, on the generated residual stresses is investigated. Multi-level validation is performed based on melt pool dimensions, temperature measurements with a two-color pyrometer, and finally, in-depth residual stress measurement. The results show that scan speed has the strongest effect on residual stresses, followed by laser power and hatch spacing. The results are explained in light of the non-linear temperature evolution, temperature gradient, and cooling rate during laser exposure, cooling time, and the rate during recoating time.

AB  - The devastating infectious disease chytridiomycosis has caused declines of amphibians across the globe, yet some populations are persisting and even recovering. One understudied effect of wildlife disease is changes in reproductive effort. Here, we aimed to understand if the disease has plastic effects on reproduction and if reproductive effort could evolve with disease endemism. We compared the effects of experimental pathogen exposure (trait plasticity) and population-level disease history (evolution in trait baseline) on reproductive effort using gametogenesis as a proxy in the declining and endangered frog Litoria verreauxii alpina. We found that unexposed males from disease-endemic populations had higher reproductive effort, which is consistent with an evolutionary response to chytridiomycosis. We also found evidence of trait plasticity, where males and females were affected differently by infection: pathogen exposed males had higher reproductive effort (larger testes), whereas females had reduced reproductive effort (smaller and fewer developed eggs) regardless of the population of origin. Infectious diseases can cause plastic changes in the reproductive effort at an individual level, and population-level disease exposure can result in changes to baseline reproductive effort; therefore, individual- and population-level effects of disease should be considered when designing management and conservation programs for threatened and declining species.

AB  - Understanding how species adapt to extreme environments is an extension of the main goals of evolutionary biology. While alpine plants are an ideal system for investigating the genetic basis of high-altitude adaptation, genomic resources in these species are still limited. In the present study, we generated reference-level transcriptomic data of five Saussurea species through high-throughput sequencing and de novo assembly. Three of them are located in the highland of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), and the other two are close relatives distributed in the lowland. A series of comparative and evolutionary genomics analyses were conducted to explore the genetic signatures of adaptive evolution to high-altitude environments. Estimation of divergence time using single-copy orthologs revealed that Saussurea species diversified during the Miocene, a period with extensive tectonic movement and climatic fluctuation on the QTP. We characterized gene families specific to the alpine species, including genes involved in oxidoreductase activity, pectin catabolic process, lipid transport, and polysaccharide metabolic process, which may play important roles in defense of hypoxia and freezing temperatures of the QTP. Furthermore, in a phylogenetic context with the branch model, we identified hundreds of genes with signatures of positive selection. These genes are involved in DNA repair, membrane transport, response to UV-B and hypoxia, and reproductive processes, as well as some metabolic processes associated with nutrient intake, potentially responsible for Saussurea adaptation to the harsh environments of high altitude. Overall, our study provides valuable genomic resources for alpine species and gained helpful insights into the genomic basis of plants adapting to extreme environments.

AB  - The 4 per 1000 initiative aims to maintain and increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks for soil fertility, food security, and climate change adaptation and mitigation. One way to enhance SOC stocks is to increase carbon (C) inputs to the soil.
   In this study, we assessed the amount of organic C inputs that are necessary to reach a target of SOC stocks increase by 4 parts per thousand yr(-1) on average, for 30 years, at 14 long-term agricultural sites in Europe. We used the Century model to simulate SOC stocks and assessed the required level of additional C inputs to reach the 4 per 1000 target at these sites. Then, we analyzed how this would change under future scenarios of temperature increase. Initial stocks were simulated assuming steady state. We compared modeled C inputs to different treatments of additional C used on the experimental sites (exogenous organic matter addition and one treatment with different crop rotations). The model was calibrated to fit the control plots, i.e. conventional management without additional C inputs from exogenous organic matter or changes in crop rotations, and was able to reproduce the SOC stock dynamics.
   We found that, on average among the selected experimental sites, annual C inputs will have to increase by 43.15 +/- 5.05 %, which is 0.66 +/- 0.23 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) (mean +/- standard error), with respect to the initial C inputs in the control treatment. The simulated amount of C input required to reach the 4 %0 SOC increase was lower than or similar to the amount of C input actually used in the majority of the additional C input treatments of the long-term experiments. However, Century might be overestimating the effect of additional C inputs on SOC stocks. At the experimental sites, we found that treatments with additional C inputs were increasing by 0.25 % on average. This means that the C inputs required to reach the 4 per 1000 target might actually be much higher. Furthermore, we estimated that annual C inputs will have to increase even more due to climate warming, that is 54 % more and 120 % more for a 1 and 5 degrees C warming, respectively. We showed that modeled C inputs required to reach the target depended linearly on the initial SOC stocks, raising concern on the feasibility of the 4 per 1000 objective in soils with a higher potential contribution to C sequestration, that is soils with high SOC stocks. Our work highlights the challenge of increasing SOC stocks at a large scale and in a future with a warmer climate.

AB  - The hyperdiverse order Coleoptera comprises a staggering similar to 25% of known species on Earth. Despite recent breakthroughs in next generation sequencing, there remains a limited representation of beetle diversity in assembled genomes. Most notably, the ground beetle family Carabidae, comprising more than 40,000 described species, has not been studied in a comparative genomics framework using whole genome data. Here we generate a high-quality genome assembly for Nebria riversi, to examine sources of novelty in the genome evolution of beetles, as well as genetic changes associated with specialization to high-elevation alpine habitats. In particular, this genome resource provides a foundation for expanding comparative molecular research into mechanisms of insect cold adaptation. Comparison to other beetles shows a strong signature of genome compaction, with N. riversi possessing a relatively small genome (similar to 147 Mb) compared to other beetles, with associated reductions in repeat element content and intron length. Small genome size is not, however, associated with fewer protein-coding genes, and an analysis of gene family diversity shows significant expansions of genes associated with cellular membranes and membrane transport, as well as protein phosphorylation and muscle filament structure. Finally, our genomic analyses show that these high-elevation beetles have endosymbiotic Spiroplasma, with several metabolic pathways (e.g., propanoate biosynthesis) that might complement N. riversi, although its role as a beneficial symbiont or as a reproductive parasite remains equivocal.

AB  - A consequence of urbanization is the loss of vegetation cover, replaced by urban areas. This study investigates the evolution of the built-up areas and its influence on increasing the surface temperature through methodology applicable to small and medium-sized municipalities where urbanization process monitoring is limited. For the case study, the municipality of Penedo, located in the State of Alagoas, was selected. Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 images were used to evaluate urban landscape through normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and the land surface temperature (LST). A simple tool that summarizes NDBI and LST changes was proposed - the Change Detection Index (CDI). It was possible to highlight areas where the increase in temperatures is associated with the built area's intensification. Furthermore, the machine learning k-means clustering tool was applied to create groups and analyze the relationship between urbanization and temperature increase, confirming the CDI values and validating this tool. An evident increase in the built area was highlighted by CDI and cluster analysis, indicating a heat island's potential formation at the implantation area of a housing complex in the municipality. The spatial analysis indicates priority areas for intervention by a simple methodology that facilitated dialogue and understanding between stakeholders, associated with a low-cost tool with the potential for reproduction and adaptation, providing indicators to urban studies and decision-makers and handle the lack of monitoring data in small and medium-sized municipalities.

AB  - The short shelf-life of pasteurized liquid whole egg (LWE) has been a technical problem of the industry for a long time, and there was an urgent need to develop relevant methodologies for the control of spoilage bacteria. In this study, the spoilage potential of the selected strains at low temperature and the inhibition of cell-free supernatant (CFS) of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on the representative strains with strong spoilage ability was both investigated. The results showed that some high abundance strains such as Pseudomonas and Microbacterium had the strong spoilage ability which might dominate the spoilage of liquid egg products. Meanwhile, the CFS of the selected LAB had a good inhibitory effect on them, and the result was: CFS of Lactobacillus plantarum 90 > CFS of Lactobacillus rhamnosus 05 > CFS of Pediococcus pentosaceus L28-8. Also, the CFS of L. plantarum 90 had a good bacteriostatic effect on the selected representative spoilage bacteria in LWE in a dose-dependent manner. Combined with the experimental results, it is speculated that this was the result of synergistic action of many bacteriostatic substances such as organic acids and bacteriocins. Overall, this study provides a possibility for the application of CFS of LAB in pasteurized liquid egg products to extend the shelf-life.

AB  - Numerous strategies for mitigating ammonia volatilization (AV) from agricultural land have been investigated with limited evaluation of their efficacy and response to differing field conditions across China. Therefore, this meta-analysis seeks to draw conclusions about AV in China, and assess the effect of crop type (wheat, maize, and rice as staple crops), climatic conditions, and soil properties on AV and variations in responses that can guide selection of appropriate strategies under different conditions. Novel analysis indicates nitrogen (NH3-N) losses of 7.62 Tg due to AV from these three crops in China. AV is 12.8 and 18.0% (95% CI) higher from maize than from wheat and rice, respectively, without N application under warm and sub-humid conditions (MM), and 13.8 and 2.8% higher under hot and humid conditions (HH). AV increases notably under HH as compared with cold and sub-arid conditions (LL) by 11.5% and 28.4% under the control treatment and application of 150 kg N ha(-1), respectively in rice fields while it is most substantially under maize (52.5%) with application of 150 kg N ha(-1). The ratio of change in AV between soil grades 3 and 1 (potential AV 1.0 and < 0 cmol kg(-1)) is significantly greater for wheat and rice (2.5%) than for maize (1.9%). The strategy of reducing N rate is more effective for maize and rice than wheat, where applying N at a rate of 150-220 kg N ha(-1) to them has similar effects to applying 300 kg N ha(-1) to wheat. For wheat and maize, urea should be partially substituted with organic amendments, while improved urea is the preferable N source for rice. Subsurface application has competitive efficacy, especially for maize, and higher N rates. Applying inhibitors achieves the highest AV reduction, especially with rice under various conditions, creating more actively options for future research to increase applicability.

AB  - Introduction. Understanding the biophysical phenomena related to the Hofmeister series or cosmotropic/chaotropic properties of ions requires experimental data on specific ion effects of large organic molecules.
   Problem Statement. Specific ion effects are of significant importance for biophysics and medicine. It is interesting to find out if additives with biologically relevant anions can interact with proteins and avoid aggregation.
   Purpose. The purpose of this research is to study the stabilizing/destabilizing effects in Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM)/water, hen egg white/water systems under influence of substances of various classes of different hydrophobia.
   Materials and Methods. Materials: sodium salts: salicylate, ferulate, benzoate, vanillate, cinnamate; humic acid sodium salt, hydroxy-sodium benzoate, glycine, L-alanine, sodium L-glutamate, D-(-)-quinnic acid, PNIPAM, egg white. Methods: measurement of the transition temperature (TT) of PNIPAM/water and the denaturation temperature of the egg white / water systems.
   Results. Ion-specific effects have been studied with the use of models based on the research of the transition temperature (TT) evolution of binary PNIPAM / water mixtures (for heating from 0 to 35 degrees C) and the denaturation temperature of the egg white / water (for heating from 48 to 65 degrees C). The dependences of these temperatures on the content of substances that occur in live nature have been received at pH = 7.4.
   Conclusions. The results have shown the tendencies of the additive solubilizing effects on PNIPAM and egg white. The majority of substances studied has the salting-out effect on PNIPAM / water in the order NaBz similar to Na-Cinn < L-NaGlu similar to NaFer. For NaSal and NaHum; the salting-in effect has been established. For the egg white, all additives show the salting-in effect. In PNIPAM and egg white systems, NaBz and L-NaGlu demonstrate the opposite effects. The results have been compared with the ones for binary mixtures of water/di-propylene glycol propyl ether (DPnP).

AB  - Estimating the distribution of invasive species and understanding the ecological reasons for their success is crucial for their management. Moreover, their ability to invade biogeographically distinct regions in short timespans poses interesting ecological questions. Lantana camara (sensu lato) is one such invasive species of global concern. In an unprecedented effort, we surveyed 207,100 km(2) of Indian forests by sampling 13715 grids of 5 x 5 km, each with 1-31 plots of 10 m diameter, to record the abundance of Lantana. For India, we modeled occupancy of Lantana in the sampled area by accounting for imperfect detection; and potential invasion outside the sampled area using MaxEnt with covariates of climate, soil, forest and human disturbance. Further, Lantana's response in comparable areas of its native and global invaded range was modeled using MaxEnt to provide a better understanding of its changing relationship with environmental factors. Lantana invaded 154,837 km2 of the surveyed area, and threatened 303,607 km2 of total Indian forests (44%); with preference to warm, humid, fertile areas, degraded by extractive human use. By combining our large-scale ground surveys with published data, we show that Lantana has expanded its climatic niche worldwide, with >11 million km2 suitable for its invasion. Niche comparison revealed that Lantana might have adaptive plasticity in its invaded range; where it was found to be more tolerant to higher temperatures, lower fertility and shade as compared to its native range. In light of Lantana's introduction history that suggest excessive hybridization between previously allopatric populations, and its known genetic diversity in the invaded range, the existing adaptive plasticity is suggestive of contemporary evolution. This adaptive nature can increase area under its invasion and pose an ecological conundrum of managing an evolving neophyte. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The occurrence of refugia beyond the arctic treeline and genetic adaptation therein play a crucial role of largely unknown effect size. While refugia have potential for rapidly colonizing the tundra under global warming, the taxa may be maladapted to the new environmental conditions. Understanding the genetic composition and age of refugia is thus crucial for predicting any migration response.
   Here, we genotype 194 larch individuals from an similar to 1.8 km(2)area in northcentral Siberia on the southern Taimyr Peninsula by applying an assay of 16 nuclear microsatellite markers. For estimating the age of clonal individuals, we counted tree rings at sections along branches to establish a lateral growth rate that was then combined with geographic distance.
   Findings reveal that the predominant reproduction type is clonal (58.76%) by short distance spreading of ramets. One outlier of clones 1 km apart could have been dispersed by reindeer. In clonal groups and within individuals, we find that somatic mutations accumulate with geographic distance. Clonal groups of two or more individuals are observed. Clonal age estimates regularly suggest individuals as old as 2,200 years, which coincides with a major environmental change that forced a treeline retreat in the region.
   We conclude that individuals with clonal growth mode were naturally selected as it lowers the likely risk of extinction under a harsh environment. We discuss this legacy from the past that might now be a maladaptation and hinder expansion under currently strongly increasing temperatures.

AB  - Mating songs and preferences for these songs have to match for communication to function. Since this match restricts variation, understanding how phenotypic variation is introduced in communication systems is essential for understanding their evolution. The environment, through phenotypic plasticity or parental effects, is an important catalyst for phenotypic variation. In Kentucky, the cricket Gryllus rubens has one reproductive generation in the spring and one in the fall and the mating songs differ substantially between generations. I tested whether these differences in songs are the result of intergenerational (i.e., parental effects) or intragenerational phenotypic plasticity. To test for the role of parental effects on songs, I reared offspring of field-collected spring and fall females in a common garden environment and recorded their songs. None of the analyzed song characters differed between the sons of fall and spring parents, suggesting that parental effects do not play a role in song development. To test for the effect of phenotypic plasticity on songs, I reared juvenile and adult males in two separate sets of experiments at two different levels of temperature and daylength. Rearing temperature affected every analyzed song character: The higher adult rearing temperature (32 degrees C) induced significantly faster pulse rates, shorter pulse durations, and higher dominant frequency compared with the lower rearing temperature (24 degrees C). The higher juvenile temperature induced significantly shorter pulse durations, longer interval durations, and lower pulse duty cycles than the lower rearing temperature. Rearing photoperiod did not affect male song development. The changes induced by the temperature treatments paralleled those observed in the wild, suggesting that the seasonally different songs in Kentucky are primarily the result of seasonal temperatures. Possible evolutionary consequences of the temperature-related phenotypic plasticity are discussed.

AB  - As-Selective Laser Melted (as-SLMed) Ti6Al4V in horizontal direction possess poor ductility because of acicular alpha' martensite and columnar beta grains in microstructure. However, traditional ductility improvement methods including high-temperature preheating or heat treatment will decrease not only strength but also the efficiency of SLM fabrication to application. For a satisfactory mechanical property of as-SLMed Ti6Al4V alloy, some special temperature evolution conditions brought about from processing parameters such as layer thickness, hatch spacing, energy density and area ratios between support structure and part, were carried out in the paper. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to characterize the microstructure. The microstructure of as-SLMed specimens are found to be different extent decomposing of alpha' martensite. Also, the formation mechanisms of such microstructural variables are proposed based on temperature evolution vs time during SLM process. Moreover, the tensile test presents high elongation (>8%) is achieved for horizontally as-SLMed Ti6Al4V specimens without lowering their strength (the ultimate tensile strength similar to 1260 +/- 30 MPa and yield strength similar to 1160 +/- 50 - MPa), which markedly exceed ASTM standard for castings. The mechanical proper- ties and fracture mechanisms of specimens are obviously affected by the width of alpha'/alpha martensite and the content of beta phase. This work marks an important step forward in the understanding of microstructural tailoring in SLM process for a high-performance Ti6Al4V alloy. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The infestation dynamics of Drosophila suzukii in vineyards and the vulnerability of a wide range of grapevine varieties to this pest in Austria were studied in field and laboratory studies. Oviposition of D. suzukii in the field was investigated on 19 vine varieties at two locations from calendar weeks 33 to 42 in the years 2015 to 2017. The field studies were complemented by laboratory no-choice and free-choice oviposition experiments. In the field in 2015 virtually no oviposition was recorded, in 2016 and 2017 oviposition was detected from calender week 36 and 37 onwards. Significant differences between varieties in regard to oviposition were noticed, 'Blauer Portugieser, 'Fruhroter Veltliner' and 'St. Laurent' were the most sensitive ones and their vulnerability increased with progressed ripening. Medium susceptibility was recorded for 'Zweigelt' ('Rotburger') and 'Roesler. No or almost no eggs were recorded on berries of 'Cabernet Sauvignon', 'Pinot Gris', 'Roter Veltliner, 'Blaufrankisch', 'Blauer Wildbacher', 'Pinot noir', 'Syrah', 'Cabernet franc', 'Chardonnay', 'Gruner Veltliner' and Welschriesling'. In laboratory no-choice experiments with visually undamaged berries the flies penetrated the skins of all 12 varieties in the test already from calendar week 33 and 34. Selection behavior in laboratory free-choice experiments confirmed the field results as the flies laid significantly more eggs on 'Fruhroter Veltliner', 'St. Laurent', 'Blauer Portugieser' and sometimes also on 'Zweigelt' ('Rotburger').

AB  - The influence of the lunar cycle on the feeding habits, feeding success and selectivity was tested in situ on larval stages of the clingfish Gobiesox marmoratus (Gobiesocidae). Gobiesox marmoratus larvae and their prey were collected in the water column during the lunar cycle in austral spring 2015 and 2016, in shallow waters (<30 m depth) of El Quisco, central Chile. Feeding incidence was high (80-100%) throughout the moon cycle. The diet was composed of 32 prey items, being gastropod larvae and invertebrate eggs the most important. Prey composition varied among lunar phases with the lowest prey richness during new moon. During 2016, G. marmoratus larvae ingested the lowest number, but the largest prey during new moon. In spring 2015, there were no significant changes in the abundance of each prey taxon in the water column among moon phases, but in spring 2016 there were significant differences in the abundance of cypris and copepod nauplii, particularly between full and new moon. Feeding selectivity index showed that gastropod larvae were positively selected throughout the lunar cycle during spring 2015. In spring 2016, invertebrate eggs were selectively ingested in full moon and third quarter, but at a new moon G. marmoratus larvae selected gastropod larvae. Mean temperature of the water column and its vertical gradient and nocturnal cloud cover influences the feeding success of larval G. marmoratus. Lunar illumination favoured only an increase of richness of prey items. Therefore, nocturnal cloud cover precludes a greater influence of lunar illumination in the larval trophic ecology of this cryptobenthic fish.

AB  - Sceloporus (S. aenus and S. scalaris) are oviparous sibling lizard species inhabiting high mountain zones (>2700 m) in central Mexico. Females of these species lay their eggs in soil mounds left by burrowing gophers (Pappogeomys). Numerous abiotic factors can affect site selection and subsequent development of the lizard embryos, but little is known of the relationship between the optimal physical and chemical variables of the surrounding soil that allow development and successful hatching of the eggs, especially in high-elevation environments. We hypothesized that soil parameters and temperature drive site selections by females seeking nest locations favorable to embryonic development. We recorded differences in the abiotic parameters of soil mounds between dry and rainy seasons, irrespective of whether the mounds contained eggs. Statistical analyses revealed that an environment of high relative humidity and stable temperatures necessary for mound selection as a nesting site were associated with intermediate moisture content, high organic matter content, high values of cation exchange capacity, and relatively high porosity of the soil substrate. Collectively, these values of abiotic soil traits prevent sudden changes in temperature and humidity at the nest depth, providing conditions that promote successful development and hatching. Understanding the relative importance of these abiotic factors in nest site selection by Sceloporus should contribute to an understanding of the adaptations of oviparous reptiles that reproduce in different environments.

AB  - Winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus, were collected from three fishery stocks in the United States (U.S.) during 2009-2013 to describe spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis included rapid, synchronous transitions during autumn from mitotic spermatogonia to meiotic spermatocytes, then to haploid spermatids, and the release of spermatozoa into lobule lumen. As these transitions occurred several months prior to the spring spawning season, maturity of the testes are a poor indicator of spawning season, however, individuals can be readily evaluated prior to the spawning season for evidence of skipped spawning. Throughout this process, the gonad weight increased dramatically, with spawning-season maxima from 11 to 17% relative to individual somatic weight, suggesting considerable reproductive investment relative to other flatfishes. Fish condition also cycled seasonally, which indicated that males follow a capital breeding pattern that has been reported for female winter flounder. The timing of spermiogenesis was very similar in the fish among each U.S. stock (Southern New England [SNE], Georges Bank [GB], and the Gulf of Maine [GOM]) and published data from coastal Newfoundland, even though U.S. winter flounder spawned earlier in spring than fish in the Canadian stock. Male maturity varied in relation to both size and age, and over time, in patterns similar to those reported for female winter flounder, but at smaller and younger sizes than females. These intra-specific variations in reproductive seasonality, maturation, and skipped spawning suggest that winter flounder have the potential to adaptively respond to a dynamic environment in a region where ocean warming is occurring rapidly.

AB  - For Lasius japonicus Santschi (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), a common ant species in Japan, diapause induction is temperature dependent. To elucidate the geographic variation of its temperature dependence, new L. japonicus queens were collected immediately after nuptial flight from four sites at different latitudes: Kitami (44.1 degrees N), Hakodate (41.8 degrees N), Shizuku-ishi (39.7 degrees N), and Okayama (34.7 degrees N). The collected queens were reared for 100days at four constant-temperature conditions (25 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 17.5 degrees C, and 15 degrees C) under a 12L:12D photoperiod. The queens began founding colonies immediately in all conditions. For all temperature conditions, daily change patterns of the average numbers of eggs, larvae, and pupae were similar among the Hakodate, Shizuku-ishi, and Okayama populations, but the development patterns of the Kitami colonies differed from those of the other three sites. Low temperatures strongly suppressed colony development of the Kitami population; development was weak even at moderate temperatures. For new queens of L. japonicus, solitary overwintering without rearing larvae is regarded as serving an important role in successful colony foundation under cool climate conditions. Results reported herein suggest that local temperatures exert important selective pressure on the timing of diapause induction and on colony development in northern populations.

AB  - The amh, a member of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family, is known to play a critical role in vertebrate male sex differentiation, with its paralogue/s evolving to determine sex in few heterogametic (XX/XY) teleosts. However, it remains relatively unexplored in the reproductively unique live bearing teleosts. Therefore, this study comparatively examined the structure and content of G. holbrooki amh as well as characterised its expression. A paralogous Y-specific antis (amhy) was not detected, suggesting an unlikely role in sex determination. Two transcripts (1.4 and 1.5 kb) were detected in adults: the larger (1.5 kb) retaining intron 5, coding for a truncated AMH-N and no TGF-beta domain. The small (1.4 kb) transcript, had both domains intact and clustered with members of Poeciliidae. In contrast to other vertebrates, a higher conservation between the N- rather than the C- terminus of amh in Poeciliidae was observed, suggesting an adaptation that may be unique to live bearing teleosts. The amh expression was 6 times higher in brain of both sexes and testis compared with ovaries (p = .001). Intriguingly, female splenic tissues showed 10 times higher expression (p = .006) and such female bias splenic expression has not been reported in any teleosts. Ontogenic expression was 25 times higher in male embryos at gastrulation stage (p = .001), much earlier than those reported in egg-laying teleosts. Such heightened expression in male embryos suggests a repressive role associated with proliferation and migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) that are known to occur earlier at blastulation in teleosts potentially influencing gonadal fate.

AB  - Astyanax mexicanus is emerging as a model organism for a variety of research fields in biological science. Part of the recent success of this teleost fish species is that it possesses interfertile cave and river-dwelling populations. This enables the genetic mapping of heritable traits that were fixed during adaptation to the different environments of these populations. While this species can be maintained and bred in the lab, it is challenging to both obtain embryos during the daytime and create hybrid embryos between strains. In vitro fertilization (IVF) has been used with a variety of different model organisms to successfully and repeatedly breed animals in the lab. In this protocol, we show how, by acclimatizing A. mexicanus to different light cycles coupled with changes in water temperature, we can shift breeding cycles to a chosen time of the day. Subsequently, we show how to identify suitable parental fish, collect healthy gametes from males and females, and produce viable offspring using IVF. This enables related procedures such as the injection of genetic constructs or developmental analysis to occur during normal working hours. Furthermore, this technique can be used to create hybrids between the cave and surface-dwelling populations, and thereby enable the study of the genetic basis of phenotypic adaptations to different environments.

AB  - The direct conversion of biorenewable alcohols into value-added graphene and pure hydrogen (H-2) at benign conditions is an important challenge, especially, considering the open carbon-reduced cycle. In this study, it is demonstrated that inexpensive calcium oxide (CaO, from eggshells) can transform alcohols into bulky nanoporous graphene and pure hydrogen (approximate to 99%) with robust selectivity at the temperature as low as 500 degrees C. Consequently, the growth of graphene can follow the direction of alcohol flow and uniformly penetrate into bulky nanoporous CaO platelets longer than 1 m without clogging. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that alcohol molecules can be catalytically carbonized on the surface of CaO at low temperature. The concept of the comprehensive utilization of biomass-derived alcohols offers a carbon-negative cycle for mitigating global warming and the energy demand.

AB  - In the complex granular flow, the shear and flow of particles lead to increase in temperature that can enchain behavioral modifications. However, their thermo-mechanical and electrical behavior is of great interest for applications such as rail transport, grinding, and granular material reproduction systems. To study these behaviors, a numerical experiment is carried out on a rotating drum model. This device makes it possible to generate continuous and controlled free surface flows. Relying on the NSCD approach, the location of the hottest zone and the evolution of the temperature are correlated with the evolution of the velocity field.

AB  - Ammonia is widely needed in the chemical industry as well as in fertilizers for agriculture. However, in small as well as large quantities, it is not only hazardous for human health but also for our ecosystem. Therefore, ammonia sensing at low concentration with high sensitivity, selectivity and low response time as well as recovery time is important. Here, various nanosensors are fabricated using gold nanoparticles (similar to 15 nm), silica-gold nanoparticles coreshell particles and coreshell particles embedded in polypyrrol. Comparisons with bare polypyrrol and coreshell particles are also made. In fact, two types of coreshell particles with rod (similar to 300 nm x 2 mu m) shape and spheres (200 nm) of silica were used to anchor gold nanoparticles on them. A comparison showed that silica-gold core-shell particle with silica rods had the highest sensitivity (similar to 166% @ 130 ppm) amongst all. The sensor is simple to operate (only resistance change is measured), requires no heater as the sensing occurs at room temperature, and showed no response, except for ammonia, to other gases or humidity. It also has a low response time (4 s) and recovery time (10 s) at the lowest (10 ppm) ammonia concentration measured here. Thus, a simple, economical ammonia sensor has been demonstrated here.

AB  - Most theoretical studies have explored the evolution of plasticity when the environment, and therefore the optimal trait value, varies in time or space. When the environment varies in time and space, we show that genetic adaptation to Markovian temporal fluctuations depends on the between-generation autocorrelation in the environment in exactly the same way that genetic adaptation to spatial fluctuations depends on the probability of philopatry. This is because both measure the correlation in parent-offspring environments and therefore the effectiveness of a genetic response to selection. If the capacity to genetically respond to selection is stronger in one dimension (e.g., space), then plasticity mainly evolves in response to fluctuations in the other dimension (e.g., time). If the relationships between the environments of development and selection are the same in time and space, the evolved plastic response to temporal fluctuations is useful in a spatial context and genetic differentiation in space is reduced. However, if the relationships between the environments of development and selection are different, the optimal level of plasticity is different in the two dimensions. In this case, the plastic response that evolves to cope with temporal fluctuations may actually be maladaptive in space, resulting in the evolution of hyperplasticity or negative plasticity. These effects can be mitigated by spatial genetic differentiation that acts in opposition to plasticity resulting in counter-gradient variation. These results highlight the difficulty of making space-for-time substitutions in empirical work but identify the key parameters that need to be measured in order to test whether space-for-time substitutions are likely to bevalid.

AB  - Biological invasions provide a unique opportunity to investigate rapid adaptation and evolution as the introduced taxa adapt to biogeographic contexts or habitats in which they have not evolved. The capacity of populations to evolve is generally thought to be constrained by their existing heritable genetic variation, which is usually associated with variation in genomic DNA nucleotide sequences. However, there is increasing acceptance that a range of mechanisms-collectively termed 'epigenetics' can alter gene function and affect ecologically important traits. Epigenetic processes may mediate adaptive phenotypic plasticity and provide heritable variation on a finer timescale than DNA sequence-based mutations. This review focuses on DNA methylation, a well-studied epigenetic mechanism known to be associated with biological adaptation to environmental stress. We explore the role of DNA methylation in characterising the adaptive potential of invasive species. We also provide an overview of studies focused on DNA methylation and invasive species to date, and identify knowledge gaps and potential ways to advance understanding of epigenetic-based adaptation. A summary of the literature suggests that DNA methylation could play a key role in the success of invasive species. Introduced populations with reduced genetic diversity often display increased DNA methylation variation in comparison with native populations, which could create phenotypic diversity when it is most required. Recent data show that DNA methylation could contribute to adaptation through both phenotypic plasticity and heritable variation, particularly through clonal reproduction. From a methodological perspective, recent advances in molecular techniques provide an exciting opportunity to explore the functional relevance of DNA methylation to successful biological invasions. Gaining a greater understanding of the adaptive and evolutionary processes that contribute to invasion success is critical for preventing and managing the future introduction, establishment and spread of invasive species.

AB  - The effects of five levels of osmolality and pH as well as three temperatures on Awassi ram sperm motility parameters assessed by computer-aided sperm analyzer (CASA) in tyrode albumin lactate pyruvate (TALP) and egg-yolk-tris (YET) media were studied. Semen obtained from five adult Awassi rams were pooled and diluted in the above two media at 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mOsm/kg at temperatures of 4 degrees, 20 degrees and 37 degrees degree celsius and also at pH levels of 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 at the same temperatures. The osmolality, pH and temperature had a significant effect (P<0.05) on the percent motility (MOT %) and the percent of sperm showing progressive motility (PMOT %). With the exception of lateral head displacement, all the other CASA motility parameters were also significantly affected (P<0.05). Semen incubated in YET was able to tolerate osmolarities within 200 to 400 mOsm/kg range for MOT %. Alkaline condition at pH 9 had higher negative effect than acidic condition at pH 5. Compared to the 20 degrees C and 37 degrees C, the 4 degrees C had negatively affected MOT % and PMOT % and this was more obvious in TALP medium. In conclusion, our results suggest: 1) the significant effects of osmolality, pH and temperature on Awassi sperm incubated in both TALP and YET media and 2) the need for careful selection of temperature by which the semen may be manipulated during artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization experiments in these two media.

AB  - Background: This study was conducted to investigate the heat stress and semen quality among male workers in a steel industry in Iran and investigate the relationship between heat stress indices and semen parameters.
   Methods: The study was conducted on workers exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 14) to heat in a steel industry. After obtaining a brief biography of the selected employees, scrotal temperature, oral temperature, and environmental parameters were measured, and their semen samples were analyzed according to the procedure recommended by the World Health Organization. The heat stress indices, including wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and predicted heat strain (PHS), in their workplace were calculated according to environmental parameters (ISO 7243:1989 and 7933:2004, respectively).
   Results: Time-weighted averages of WBGT and PHS (35.76 degrees C and 491.56 w/m(2) w/m(2), respectively) for the exposed group were higher than threshold limit values. The mean difference of environmental, physiological, and semen parameters (exception: pH of semen), and also WBGT and PHS indices were statistically significant (p < 0.05) between the two groups. Mean semen parameters were in the normozoospermic range. WBGT and PHS indices showed significantly "negative" correlation with physiological parameters (scrotal and oral temperature) and most semen parameters (semen volume, sperm morphology, sperm motility, sperm count; p < 0.05); moreover, the correlation of WBGT with these parameters was stronger than PHS.
   Conclusion: Semen parameters of the studied workers exposed to heat were in the borderline level of normozoospermic range, and their semen parameters were significantly lower than controls. For better assessment of occupational environment concerning physiological and semen parameters in steel industries, WBGT can be a more useful index.

AB  - Apis mellifera intermissa is the native honey bee subspecies of Algeria, and approximates a position among bee races between tropical African and European breeds. This bee is very aggressive, nervous, and produces many broods with many queen cells. It is prone to swarming and exhibits defensive behavior and an abundant use of propolis. In the present study, pure line samples of A. m. intermissa collected from Blida (Algeria; 36 degrees 31N, 2 degrees 58E) with preferable Varroa resistance confirmed their through hygienic cleaning behavior and high temperature adaptation, were selected as a reference sample for full-genome sequencing. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was also performed on the same samples to validate genomic variations. These analyses will be an important source of information for the honey bee research community worldwide. The 240-Mb genome was annotated with 26355 transcripts and analyzed. Analysis of 133 pathways indicated an abundance of pathways related to metabolic processes, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and biodegradation of xenobiotics . In addition to simple sequence repeat markers, variant analysis for beneficial trait genes, transposons, and phylogeny was performed. The mitochondrial genome and genes involved in immunity and chemoreception were identified and compared with those from other sequenced insect models. The indels obtained by sequencing were validated by aCGH. The genome sequence, annotation, and analysis of A. m. intermissa provides new understanding of the function of bee genes, and comparison with the genome of other A. mellifera subspecies promises to yield insights into the evolution of the adaptations to high temperature and resistance to Varroa parasite infestation.

AB  - There is a significant need to understand, analyse and assess moisture transport in cementitious materials exposed to elevated temperatures in order to confidently predict the behaviour and ultimately the development of damage in safety critical applications such as nuclear reactor vessels, structures exposed to fire and well bore grouts.
   In view of this need a rigorous and robust formulation to describe water retention curves (sorption isotherms) as a function of temperature based on the evolution of physical parameters is presented. The model formulation is successfully validated against independent sets of experimental data up to temperatures of 80 degrees C. It is then further validated under isothermal drying conditions and then high temperature conditions through the numerical reproduction of laboratory experiments following implementation in a fully coupled hygro-thermo-mechanical finite element model.
   The new formulation is found to work well under a variety of conditions in a variety of cementitious material types.

AB  - To identify associated agronomic traits and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with high-temperature tolerance in rice (Oryza sativa L.), three backcross inbred populations (BC2F4) of NSIC Rc150/Dular, Gayabyeo/Nagina22 and Gayabyeo/Dular were screened during the 2014 dry season. Analysis of microclimate conditions of near canopy such as temperature, relative humidity, and dew point temperature using Micrometeorological Instrument for Near Canopy Environment of Rice (MINCER) confirmed the presence of high-temperature stress during heading and maturity stages. MINCER data showed high temperatures (37.04 +/- 0.14 degrees C), accompanied by dry to high humidity (89.0-35.03 +/- 1.82%) condition. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis were used to evaluate phenotypic traits associated with fertility. Dehiscent high-temperature was correlated with spikelet fertility in NSIC Rc150/Dular and Gayabyeo/Nagina22. Number of spikelets showed significant correlation with fertility in the cross between Gayabyeo/Nagina22 and Gayabyeo/Dular. The variability explained by the associated traits to the high-temperature tolerance in NSIC Rc150/Dular was 56%, which was higher than the variability (54.0%) in Gayabyeo/Dular populations. The lowest variability (40.0%) explained by the associated traits was observed in Gayabyeo/Nagina22. In a previous study, QTLs were identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5 and 10 (Grospe et al. 2016). The present study further identified QTLs in different mapping populations using the inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) method with IciMapping 4.0 software. Four major QTLs, which were associated with high-temperature tolerance in the new mapping population of Gayabyeo/Dular, were identified, namely, qHTfert3 (17.5%), qHTtof10.1 (14.1%), qHTtof10.2 (15.2%) and qHTspk4 (15.35%). Rice Genome Browser was used to identify the neighboring and coincided genes with the identified QTLs. The co-located/coincided/co-located genes in NSIC Rc150/Dular were qHfert1 (RM9) - LOC_Os01g41200, qHTfert3 (RM16238) - LOC_Os03g64190, qHTfert4 (RM348) - in LOC_Os04g54890, qHTtof10 (RM25213) - LOC_Os10g18740, qHTdht3 (RM16238) - LOC_Os03g64190, qHTdht3 (RM3586) - LOC_Os03g63950, qHTdht4 (RM16742) - LOC_Os04g28100, qHTdht5 (RM480) - LOC_Os05g47660, qHTdht10 (RM25213) - LOC_Os10g18740, qHThd3 (RM16102) - LOC_Os03g59480, and qHThd3 (RM16238) - LOC_Os03g64190. The co-located/coincided/co-located genes in Gayabyeo/Dular were qHTtof10.1 (RM4455) - LOC_Os10g22510 and qHTspk4 (RM17486) - LOC_Os04g52300.
   This study inferred that QTLs for high-temperature tolerance are cross specific, hence QTLs varied depending on parental combination. Moreover, these can be used in fine mapping of novel genes and rice breeding in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for high-temperature tolerance in rice.

AB  - Little research has been done on egg diapause and the embryonic development of water mites. The aim of this study was to check the impact of temperature and periods of light on hatching of larvae of Eylais extendens. Three batches of eggs which were spawned on 30 July were placed at one of three temperatures (4, 10 and 20 A degrees C) and two periods of light (7 and 14 h per day). Egg hatching (both, percentage of hatched larvae and rate of hatching) was found to differ between 4 versus 10 A degrees C and between 4 versus 20 A degrees C, but not between 10 versus 20 A degrees C. The periods of light had no influence on hatching. This synchronization of hatching, enabling the eggs to emerge from diapause in the spring, could be considered an evolutionary adaptation aimed at postponing hatching of late-spawned eggs until a time allowing for completion of the full development cycle, including the parasitic larval stage.

AB  - Reproduction of external fertilizing vertebrates is typically constrained to either fresh or salt water, not both. For all studied amphibians and fishes, this constraint includes immotile sperm that are activated after ejaculation only by the specific chemistry of the fertilizing medium in which the species evolved (fresh, brackish, or salt water). No amphibians can reproduce in the sea. Although diadromous fishes may migrate between salt and fresh water, they are shackled to their natal environment for spawning in part because of sperm activation. Here, we report for the first time among all documented external fertilizing vertebrates, that in the absence of any external media, sperm are motile at ejaculation in a marine spawning fish (Osmeridae, capelin, Mallotus villosus). To illuminate why, we evaluated sperm behavior at different salinities in M.villosus as well as the related freshwater spawning anadromous rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax). Surprisingly, sperm performance was superior in fresh water for both species. M.villosus spend their entire life at sea but our results show that their sperm are deactivated by sea water, suggesting a freshwater ancestry. By circumventing constraining water chemistry, we interpret the unique pre-ejaculatory sperm activation in this species as a novel adaptation that enables fertilization in the marine environment. These findings also contribute to understanding the persistence of anadromy, despite great energetic costs to adult fishes.

AB  - Annealing of block copolymers has become a tool of great importance for the reconfiguration of nanoparticles. Here, we present the experimental results of annealing block copolymer nanoparticles and a theoretical model to describe the morphological transformation of ellipsoids with striped lamellae into onionlike spheres. A good correspondence between the experimental findings and predictions of the model was observed. The model based on finding the steepest direction of descent of an appropriate free energy leads to a set of Cahn-Hilliard equations that correctly describe the dynamical transformation of striped ellipsoids into onionlike spheres and reverse onionlike particles, regardless of the nature of the annealing process. This universality makes it possible to describe a variety of experimental conditions involving nanoparticles underlying a heating process. A notable advantage of the proposed approach is that it enables selective control of the interaction between the confined block copolymer and the surrounding medium. This feature endows the model with a great versatility to enable the reproduction of several combined effects of surfactants in diverse conditions, including cases with reverse affinities for the block copolymer segments. A phase diagram to describe a variety of morphologies is presented. We employ the relationship between the temperature-dependent Flory-Huggins parameter and the width of the interfaces to account for changes in temperature due to the heating process. Simulation results correctly show how the transformation evolves as the temperature increases. This increment in temperature corresponds to progressively smaller values of the interfacial width. We anticipate that the proposed approach will facilitate the design and more precise control of experiments involving various kinds of annealing processes.

AB  - Insects utilise chemical cues for a range of different purposes and the complexity and degree of specificity of these signals is arguably unparalleled in the animal kingdom. Chemical signals are particularly important for insect reproduction and the selective pressures driving their evolution and maintenance have been the subject of previous reviews. However, the world in which chemical cues evolved and are maintained is changing at an unprecedented rate. How ( or indeed whether) chemical signals used in sexual selection will respond is largely unknown. Here, we explore how recent increases in urbanisation and associated anthropogenic impacts may affect how chemical signals are produced and perceived. We focus on four anthropomorphic influences which have the potential to interact with pheromone-mediated sexual selection processes; climatic temperature shifts, exposure to chemical pollutants, the presence of artificial light at night and nutrient availability. Our aim is to provide a broad overview of key areas where the rapidly changing environment of the future might specifically affect pheromones utilised in sexual selection.

AB  - Background: Hatching is modulated by a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Annual killifish are adapted to complete their entire life cycle in annually desiccating habitats. Spending most of their life in the embryonic stage, they have evolved adaptations to survive desiccated conditions and match their hatching with the unpredictable onset of the aquatic phase of the pool. We examined spatial and temporal synchrony of hatching in natural populations of four species of African annual killifish (genus Nothobranchius). We compared differences and variability in hatching dates among years, regions, pools, and species and matched them with data on inundations of individual pools. Results: Inundations typically coincided with peak rainfall in early January. We found considerable spatial and temporal synchrony in 1 year, but less synchrony in the other 2 years. Hatching generally occurred 0-20 days after inundation; fish at most sites hatched synchronously (<1 week) but some sites showed protracted hatching or two age cohorts. One species tended to hatch earlier than the other three. Conclusions: We suggest that hatching of annual killifish in the wild is a result of the interplay between environmental conditions and individual predisposition to respond to threshold environmental cues, ensuring effective bet-hedging against unpredictable inundation.

AB  - Phenotypic expression may be and often is influenced by an organism's developmental environment, referred to as phenotypic plasticity. The sperm cells of teleosts have been found to be inactive in the seminal plasma and are activated by osmotic shock for most fish species, through release in either hypertonic (for marine fish) or hypotonic (for freshwater fish) water. If this is the case, the regulatory system of sperm mobility should be reversed in salt-and freshwater fish. We tested this hypothesis by first activating sperm of salt-and freshwater populations of threespine stickleback in salt-and freshwater. The sperm from saltwater stickleback could be activated in either salinity, which matches the freshwater colonization history of the species, whereas the sperm from the freshwater population acted as predicted by the osmotic shock theory and was activated in freshwater only. As the freshwater population used here was calculated to be thousands of years old, we went on to test whether the trait(s) were plastic and sperm from freshwater males still could be activated in saltwater after individuals were exposed to saltwater. After raising freshwater stickleback in saltwater, we found the mature males to have active sperm in both saltwater and freshwater. Further, we also found the sperm of wild-caught freshwater stickleback to be active in saltwater after exposing those mature males to saltwater for only 2 days. This illustrates that the ability for stickleback sperm to be activated in a range of water qualities is an environmentally induced plastic trait.

AB  - California's Mediterranean agro-ecosystems are a major source of U.S. fruits and vegetables, and vulnerable to future extremes of precipitation and temperature brought on by climate change, including increased drought and flooding, and more intense and longer heat waves. To develop resilience to these threats, strategies are necessary for climate-smart management of soil and water. Long-term, large-scale, replicated ecological experiments provide unique testbeds for studying such questions. At the UC Davis Russell Ranch Sustainable Agriculture Facility (RRSAF), the 100-year Century Experiment, initiated in 1992, is investigating the effects of multiple farming practices in a farm-scale replicated study of 10 row crop cropping systems. It includes different fertility management systems: organic, conventional and hybrid (conventional plus winter cover crop) systems; different crops: wheat, tomatoes, corn, alfalfa, cover crops and grasslands; and different irrigation systems: rainfed, flood irrigated and drip irrigated. We briefly describe and report on a selection of long-term experiments conducted at RRSAF investigating soil management and irrigation practices, which are an important focus for developing climate-smart strategies in Mediterranean systems. For example, long-term monitoring of soil carbon content revealed that most crop systems have experienced a small increase in soil carbon since 1993, and increases in organically managed plots were substantially higher. As RRSAF continues to build upon this rich dataset from one of a very few long-term row crop experiments in Mediterranean ecosystems, it provides a testbed for identifying climate-smart solutions for these agronomically important ecosystems.

AB  - Atlantic herring is an excellent species for studying the genetic basis of adaptation in geographically distant populations because of its characteristically large population sizes and low genetic drift. In this study we compared whole-genome resequencing data of Atlantic herring populations from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. An important finding was the very low degree of genetic differentiation among geographically distant populations (fixation index = 0.026), suggesting lack of reproductive isolation across the ocean. This feature of the Atlantic herring facilitates the detection of genetic factors affecting adaptation because of the sharp contrast between loci showing genetic differentiation resulting from natural selection and the low background noise resulting from genetic drift. We show that genetic factors associated with timing of reproduction are shared between genetically distinct and geographically distant populations. The genes for thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), the SOX11 transcription factor (SOX11), calmodulin (CALM), and estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2A), all with a significant role in reproductive biology, were among the loci that showed the most consistent association with spawning time throughout the species range. In fact, the same two SNPs located at the 5' end of TSHR showed the most significant association with spawning time in both the east and west Atlantic. We also identified unexpected haplotype sharing between spring-spawning oceanic herring and autumn-spawning populations across the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea. The genomic regions showing this pattern are unlikely to control spawning time but may be involved in adaptation to ecological factor(s) shared among these populations.

AB  - The Asian subterranean termite, Coptotermes gestroi, is a tropical species but has increasingly been collected from the subtropics in recent years, making it sympatric to the Formosan subterranean termite, C. formosanus in at least three areas, Taiwan, Hawaii, and Florida. Simultaneous flights by these two species were observed since 2013 in South Florida, during which interspecies tandems were observed. Laboratory mating of C. formosanus and C. gestroi alates produced hybrid incipient colonies of larger population size. Studies are underway to examine the presence in the field of hybrid colonies in sympatric areas of Taiwan and Florida. Other biological characteristics of C. formosanus x C. gestroi hybrids being studied include temperature tolerance and preference, colony growth rate, wood-consumption rate, and reproductive fertility. This current research aims to determine the potential establishment of a hybrid termite population in south Florida and Taiwan. It investigates the risk of introgressive hybridization in field populations, with an emphasis on its potential ecological, evolutionary, and economic consequences.

In this study we analyse inter- and intraspecific differentiation of closely related taxa in the marbled white butterfly species group. Based on genetic and phenotypic characters we test for potential evolutionary drivers and propose a taxonomic revision.
   LocationWestern Palaearctic (including north-western Africa).
   MethodsWe compared distributions of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) sequences, of several allozyme loci, and of the shape of wings and genitalia obtained by applying landmark-based techniques for the three butterfly species Melanargia galathea (central and eastern Europe), M.lachesis (Iberia) and M. lucasi (North Africa).
   ResultsAll studied markers showed a strong spatial structure, although discordance among their patterns was detected. COI sequences, wing shape and genitalia indicated a main split between M. galathea and M. lucasi. A lower differentiation between M. galathea and M. lachesis was found in wing shape and reflected in two mutations of the COI gene, while allozymes indicated a strong divergence. Within M. galathea, allozyme data and COI, but not morphology, revealed the existence of a slightly differentiated lineage in the Italian Peninsula, France and Switzerland. Based on COI, Melanargia lucasi was split into two subgroups, a western and an eastern Maghreb lineage.
   Main conclusionsLong-term isolation of Melanargia populations between North Africa and Europe led to divergence between M. galathea and M. lucasi. This was followed by a recent differentiation among populations isolated during the cold periods of the Pleistocene, such as M. lachesis in Iberia. These lineages are characterized by a tendency not to overlap in secondary sympatry. The different patterns of the four markers may arise from divergent evolutionary processes and pressures: wings may be mainly affected by natural selection, genital structures by sexual selection, whereas long-term isolation and drift may have driven divergence of mitochondrial DNA and allozymes.

AB  - In September 2013, hatchery reared sub-yearling steelhead trout, Oncorhynchusmykiss, juvenileswere separated into three groups andwere reared in 3 differentwater temperature regimes (ambient (14.4-16.9 degrees C), cool (10.6-11.8 degrees C), and warm (20.0-22.3 degrees C)) in circular hatchery tanks for approximately 1.5 weeks. In Experiment 1, an individual steelhead trout juvenile acclimated in ambient water was transferred into a two-choice stream tank where the fish received either ambient (n= 12) or cool (n= 6)/warm(n= 6) water. During a 30min observation, steelhead trout juveniles clearly avoided both cool and warm water areas. In Experiment 2, we transferred an individual steelhead trout juvenile, which was acclimated in cooled water, into the cool two-choice stream tank and introduced ambient water (relative water temperature increase) (n = 6). Such an increase caused the juvenile to stay in cool water, suggesting that once steelhead juvenile have acclimated in cool water for 1.5 weeks, these fishwould avoid relatively higher temperature (ambient) water and stay in a cooler area. In Experiment 3, we transferred an individual steelhead trout juvenile, which was acclimated in warmed water, into the warm two-choice stream tank and introduced ambient water (relative water temperature decrease) (n= 6). As a result, the relative decrease in water temperature did not influence swimming location choice of the juveniles, suggesting that juvenile steelhead trout do not avoid ambient water (relatively cooler water) even after they were acclimated in warm water. Based on these findings, we suggest that water temperature changes may promote swimming location choice in steelhead trout juveniles, depending on the changing patterns.

AB  - The quality of parts produced using powder bed fusion additive manufacturing processes viz. electron beam melting mainly depends on the energy source, raster scan pattern, and stress evolution due to concentrated heat addition. In the present work, effort has been made to analyze the relationship between various process parameters such as input power, penetration depth, raster scan hatch spacing, powder porosity and their effects on the temperature profile, stress evolution and re-melt volume, using a three-dimensional thermo-mechanical simulation of the EBAM process on AISI 316L stainless steel, implemented using the COMSOL (R) multiphysics modelling platform. The volume fraction of re-melt material shows a non-linear and non-monotonic dependence on the electron beam size. The results of this study pave way for robust design of the EBAM process from simulation point of view. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The present study addresses a detailed experimental and numerical investigation on the impact of water droplets on smooth heated surfaces. High-speed infrared thermography is combined with high-speed imaging to couple the heat transfer and fluid dynamic processes occurring at droplet impact. Droplet spreading (e.g. spreading ratio) and detailed surface temperature fields are then evaluated in time and compared with the numerically predicted results. The numerical reproduction of the phenomena was conducted using an enhanced version of a VOF-based solver of OpenFOAM previously developed, which was further modified to account for conjugate heat transfer between the solid and fluid domains, focusing only on the sensible heat removed during droplet spreading. An excellent agreement is observed between the temporal evolution of the experimentally measured and the numerically predicted spreading factors (differences between the experimental and numerical values were always lower than 3.4%). The numerical and experimental dimensionless surface temperature profiles along the droplet radius were also in good agreement, depicting a maximum difference of 0.19. Deeper analysis coupling fluid dynamics and heat transfer processes was also performed, evidencing a strong correlation between maximum and minimum temperature values and heat transfer coefficients with the vorticity fields in the lamella, which lead to particular mixing processes in the boundary layer region. The correlation between the resulted temperature fields and the droplet dynamics was obtained by assuming a relation between the vorticity and the local heat transfer coefficient, in the first fluid cell i.e. near the liquid-solid interface. The two measured fields revealed that local maxima and minima in the vorticity corresponded to spatially shifted local minima and maxima in the heat transfer coefficient, at all stages of the droplet spreading. This was particularly clear in the rim region, which therefore should be considered in future droplet spreading models.

AB  - Size is the most important and valuable quality of the cultured black-lip pearl, Pinctada margaritifera. As this pearl aquaculture is carried out at numerous grow-out sites, this study analyzes the environmental influence on pearl size parameters (nacre weight and thickness) in relation to the recipient oyster biometric parameters (shell thickness, height, width, and oyster weight) at harvest time. Toward this end, an experimental graft was designed by using a homogeneous donor oyster phenotype. The recipient oysters were randomly and equally transferred and reared in five commercial and contrasting grow-out locations. Overall inter-site comparisons revealed that the cultured pearl size (N = 2168) and the biometric parameters of the recipient oysters were highest for sites with warmer temperatures with low seasonal variation in comparison to the southern latitude sites. These results were supported by positive correlations between pearl nacre thickness and recipient oyster shell thickness, height, and width. In parallel, the biomineralization potential of the mantle graft was screened through four genes encoding aragonite (Pif 177, MSI60) and calcite (shematrin 9, aspein). As the gene expression levels were the same among all the donor oysters, this finding demonstrates that: 1) the pearl sac that originated from the mantle graft was not isolated from environmental variations during the culture period and 2) the phenotypic expressions of the two biomineralizing tissues in the recipient oyster were consistent (shell and pearl). In the near future, this knowledge will be helpful at the production sites of genetically selected donor oyster lines for growth produced in hatchery systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Perceptions of climate change by rural communities are centered on observations of variations in temperature and rainfall patterns supported by observations and projections on climate alterations in the form of increased temperatures and scarce rainfall by scientists worldwide. The present study documented perceptions of climate variation and the community's ability to adapt to climate change hazards threatening the production of subsistence crops. Data were collected through interactions with 100 participants. In the study, climate change is explained as variations in temperature and rainfall patterns which resulted in excessive heat, erratic rainfall patterns and drought negatively impacting on subsistence crop production. Community members have the potential to limit the impacts of climate hazards on subsistence crop production. The negative impacts of climate hazards are limited by community members' indigenous knowledge of rainfall prediction, the seasons, crop diversification and mixed cropping. Mulching and the application of kraal manure improve the soil structure and fertility to reduce crop failure. These adaptation measures are resilient to the negative impact of climate hazards and may be helpful in the development of adaptation policies to assist rural communities vulnerable to climate change hazards.

AB  - Low-temperature plasma (LTP) ionization represents an emerging technology in ambient mass spectrometry. LTP enables the solvent-free direct detection of a broad range of molecules and mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). The low energy consumption and modest technical requirements of these ion sources favors their employment in mobile applications and as a means to upgrade existing mass analyzers. However, the broad adoption of LTP is hindered by the lack of commercial devices, and constructing personal devices is tricky. Improper setup can result in equipment malfunction or may cause serious damage to instruments due to strong electromagnetic fields or arcing. With this in mind, we developed a reproducible LTP probe, which is designed exclusively from commercial and 3D printed components. The plasma jet generated by the device has a diameter of about 200 mu m, which is satisfactory for the ambient imaging of macroscopic samples. We coupled the 3D-LTP probe to an ion trap analyzer and demonstrated the functionality of the ion source by detecting organic and chemical compounds from pure reference standards, biological substances, and pharmaceutical samples. Molecules were primarily detected in their protonated form or as water/ammonium adducts. The identification of compounds was possible by standard collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation spectra. The files necessary to reproduce the 3D parts are available from the project page (http://lababi.bioprocess.org/index.php/3d-ltp) under a dual license model, which permits reproduction of the probe and further community-driven development for noncommercial use ("peer production"). Our reproducible probe design thus contributes to a facilitated adaption and evolution of low-temperature plasma technologies in analytical chemistry.

AB  - The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with an Urban Canopy Model (UCM) was used for studying urban environmental issues. Because land use data employed in the WRF model do not agree with the current situation around Guangzhou, China, the performance of WRF/UCM with new land-use data extracted from Remote Sensing (RS) data was evaluated in early August 2012. Results from simulations reveal that experiments with the extracted data are capable of reasonable reproductions of the majority of the observed temporal characteristics of the 2-m temperature, and can capture the characteristics of Urban Heat Island (UHI). The "UCM_12" simulation, which employed the extracted land-use data with the WRF/UCM model, provided the best reproduction of the 2-m temperature data evolution and the smallest minimum absolute average error when compared with the other two experiments without coupled UCM. The contributions of various factors to the UHI effect were analyzed by comparing the energy equilibrium processes of "UCM_12" in urban and suburban areas. Analysis revealed that energy equilibrium processes with new land use data can explain the diurnal character of the UHI intensity variation. Furthermore, land use data extracted from RS can be used to simulate the UHI.

AB  - Breeding designs such as the North Carolina II can be used to identify the sources of genetic and environmental variances in embryo performance. Here this approach is used for the Antarctic sea urchin S. neumayeri to explore how the contribution of sire and dam can influence the performance of cleavage stage embryos and blastulae, and how these contributions differ when exposed to stress from increased temperature and acidification. The interrelationship of sire-dam effects was also compared across developmental stages. The effects of warming (+3 degrees C) and acidification (-0.3 and -0.5 pHT units) on 24 sire-dam crosses were investigated. These stressors decreased cleavage success and the percentage of normal blastulae, with a negative interactive effect between stressors. The response to these factors differed among the sire-dam pairs indicating the influence of gamete compatibility. A positive genetic correlation indicated that genotypes that performed well as blastulae in low pH also performed well at increased temperatures. Performance at cleavage was a good predictor of performance at the later blastula stage. Significant dam by temperature interactions indicated differential performance among maternal half-siblings in response to increased temperature. Adaptation depends on additive genetic variance for stress tolerance being present in populations; however, there were no sire by stressor interactions found. This indicates that S. neumayeri will need to rely on phenotypic plasticity to persist through an ocean decreasing in pH and warming, at least with respect to early development.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that temperature effects on sex ratio in fish species are ubiquitous. Temperature effects on sex ratio could be influenced by parent, strain, and population, whether in fish species with temperature-dependent sex determination or genetic sex determination plus temperature effects. In the present study, effects of genotype-temperature interactions on sex determination in bluegill sunfish were further investigated, based on our previous results, using four geographic strains: Hebron, Jones, Hocking, and Missouri. In the Hebron strain, the two higher-temperature treatment groups (24 degrees C and 32 degrees C) produced more males than the low-temperature treatment group (17 degrees C) from 6 days post-hatching (dph) to 90 dph. In contrast, the low-temperature treatment produced more males than the other two higher-temperature treatments in the Jones strain. No significant effects of temperature on sex ratio were detected in the other two strains. Our results from sex ratio variance in different treatment times suggest that the thermosensitive period of sex differentiation occurs prior to 40 dph. Our results further confirmed that genotype-temperature interactions influence sex determination in bluegill. Therefore, to significantly increase the proportion of males, which grow faster and larger than females, a consumer-and environment-friendly approach may be achieved through selection of temperature sensitivity in bluegill.

AB  - The sea urchin Arbacia lixula is a keystone species in Mediterranean ecosystems that drive landscape changes in littoral communities. However, genomic information available for the whole order Arbacioida is very limited. Using RNA-seq techniques, we have characterized the transcriptome of four different tissue types in A.lixula: the somatic' tissues (coelomocytes and digestive tissue) and the reproductive' tissues (ovary and testis), from two replicated cDNA libraries for each sample. Additionally, we performed a de novo assembly to build the reference' transcriptome, pooling reads of the four tissues, to analyse the differential expression (DE) in pairwise comparisons between tissues. The complete de novo assembly yielded 186084 transcripts, with a sequence size limit of 100nt, being 31% of them spliced isoforms. Approximately 21% of the transcripts had blast hits against proteins of metazoans (E<10(-5)), being less than 2.2% functionally annotated. Between coelomocytes and digestive, 30794 transcripts showed DE (similar to 11.8% of them with blast hit), and 19567 transcripts did so between testis and ovary (similar to 28.5% of them with blast hit). Major GO-term categories upregulated in somatic tissues were those related to muscle contraction and energy generation in digestive, and lipid metabolism associated with immune response in coelomocytes. Between reproductive tissues, the major upregulated GO categories were related to energy generation in testis, and negative regulation of nucleotide metabolism in ovary. We particularly screened for a collection of target genes in each tissue because of their relevance for further studies on evolution and adaptation of echinoids.

AB  - Sharks occupy high trophic levels in marine habitats and play a key role in the structure and function of marine communities. Their populations have been declining worldwide by >= 90 %, and their adaptive potential to future ocean conditions is believed to be limiting. Here we experimentally exposed recently hatched bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) to the combined effects of tropical ocean warming (+4; 30 degrees C) and acidification (Delta pH 0.5) and investigated the respiratory, neuronal and antioxidant enzymatic machinery responses. Thirty days post-hatching, juvenile sharks revealed a significant decrease in brain aerobic potential (citrate synthase activity), in opposition to the anaerobic capacity (lactate dehydrogenase). Also, an array of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase activity and catalase) acted in concert to detoxify ROS, but this significant upregulation was not enough to minimize the increase in brain's peroxidative damage and cholinergic neurotransmission. We argue that the future conditions may elicit deleterious deficiencies in sharks' critical biological processes which, at the longterm, may have detrimental cascading effects at population and ecosystem levels.

AB  - The pace and direction of evolution in response to selection, drift, and mutation are governed by the genetic architecture that underlies trait variation. Consequently, much of evolutionary theory is predicated on assumptions about whether genes can be considered to act in isolation, or in the context of their genetic background. Evolutionary biologists have disagreed, sometimes heatedly, over which assumptions best describe evolution in nature. Methods for estimating genetic architectures that favor simpler (i.e., additive) models contribute to this debate. Here we address one important source of bias, model selection in line cross analysis (LCA). LCA estimates genetic parameters conditional on the best model chosen from a vast model space using relatively few line means. Current LCA approaches often favor simple models and ignore uncertainty in model choice. To address these issues we introduce Software for Analysis of Genetic Architecture (SAGA), which comprehensively assesses the potential model space, quantifies model selection uncertainty, and uses model weighted averaging to accurately estimate composite genetic effects. Using simulated data and previously published LCA studies, we demonstrate the utility of SAGA to more accurately define the components of complex genetic architectures, and show that traditional approaches have underestimated the importance of epistasis.

AB  - Dielectric properties of egg white powder (EWP) in the moisture content range of 5.5-13.4% d.b. were measured with an impedance analyzer employing a coaxial probe technique in the frequency range from 10 to 3000 MHz and temperature range from 20 degrees C to 100 degrees C. The dielectric properties of EWP were maximum in the frequency range of 250-300 MHz for temperatures ranging from 30 degrees C to 100 degrees C at all moisture content levels. The dielectric constant and loss factor values of EWP increased with an increase in moisture content and temperature. The second-order models were fitted for experimental dielectric constant and loss factor data as a function of moisture content and temperature at five selected radio (13.56, 27.12 and 40.68 MHz) and microwave (915 and 2450 MHz) frequencies with coefficients of determination >= 0.939. Penetration depths of EWP were calculated for five selected frequencies at different moisture contents and temperatures. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change is modifying the environmental conditions in all the vineyards across the world. The expected effects on grape and wine production can be positive in some grape growing regions, but under warmer or dryer conditions the volume and quality of the wines produced can be impaired. Adaptation to new climatic conditions includes changes in the cultivation areas, changes in the vineyard or cellar practices, and use of new rootstock x scion combinations. In this article, we provide an overview of the possible effects of climate change on grapevine physiology and berry quality and we describe the more important traits and the genetic variability that can be used in the adaptation process. We also present the modern techniques that can be used by researchers to identify the links between genomic information and behaviors in the field. Finally, we discuss the existing opportunities in the present grapevine collections and the strategies that can be used by breeders to create new varieties.

AB  - Lake Orta experienced for a few decades a unique history of chronic pollution, with extreme changes in pH and copper concentration. Currently, the lake has recovered to its almost pristine oligotrophic conditions, but its sediments still preserve the record of all the changes that happened since the establishment of the first polluting factories in the 1920s, through to the liming activities in 19891990, and to the recovery phase that is still going on. Here we review the current knowledge for Lake Orta regarding rotifers, a diverse component of the zooplankton of the lake, through studies on living organisms and on their resting stages accumulated in the sediments. We also report a brief review of what is known in general on the effects of changes in pH and copper concentration on rotifers at the population, species and community level, providing expectations for such effects on the rotifers of Lake Orta. Then, we conclude our review with a perspective on the potential use of rotifers hatched from the resting stages in the sediment of Lake Orta with the description of experiments that can be performed in the future in the framework of resurrection ecology, in order to understand the mechanisms of past and future changes in the environment.

AB  - The quality of the parts manufactured by selective laser melting is significantly influenced by the transient temperature distribution, which is associated with the process parameters such as laser power, scan speed, hatch distance and powder layer thickness. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element model is developed to investigate the transient temperature distribution and analyze the effect of the laser power and scan speed on the depth of the melt pool. The modelling results show that the temperature becomes higher when the power increases and the higher scan speed leads to larger temperature gradient. In addition, the increasing trend of the depth becomes slow gradually with the ascending of the power and the depth decreases almost linearly after the laser scan speed is raised.

AB  - The results were obtained by measurements in 2014 and 2015 in an apple orchard in Star y Liskovec and Tesetice (South Moravia, Czech Republic, Central Europe) into fertile planting of apple trees. The results show that the bark surface temperature during the year slightly differs from the surrounding air temperature. In addition, it is in average a few tenths of a degrees C higher in the period before the onset of the vegetation and several tenths of a degree lower during vegetation. Causes of these differences appear to be associated with the flow of sap as well as with foliage. Although it can be reasonably assumed that the temperature of the bark surface on the south side will be significantly affected by the global radiation, our measurements did not demonstrate this dependency. It appears that the wind speed had significantly larger influence on the temperature differences in the non-vegetation period as at speeds over 3.5 ms(-1), the drop of temperature is so significant that the bark surface is colder than the surrounding air. Comparison of the development of sums of daily and hourly effective temperatures above 10 degrees C has shown that where daily values do not show significant differences, hourly values differed so prominently that the calculated date of emergence of adult codling moth in the bark surface was approximately one week earlier than with the use of data for air temperatures.

AB  - The southern part of northeast China has experienced a marked warming and drying climate. We provide dendrochronological evidence for atmospheric CO2 fertilization and the impacts of warming on Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) growth. The results of this study show that increased temperature has a negative effect on pine growth during a major part of the growing season and a weakly positive effects on growth during the remaining portion of the year. The monthly temperatures explain ca. 20 % of the total variance in the annual radial growth of Chinese pine from 1901 to 2009. An increase of approximately 3-5 A degrees C is the maximum that Chinese pine can tolerate in this region with an annual rainfall of 500-700 mm. Our results suggest a that there is a proportional response to warming only up to a maximum of 1 A degrees C warming, and indicate the complexitiesof succession in forest ecosystems in terms of adaptation and evolution in local pine populations under a rapid warming condition. In addition, increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations have a positive effect on tree growth. This effect can be detected with conventional dendrochronological methods.

AB  - Re-introduction of large wood for expanding hydraulic variability is an increasingly common practice, yet it is not yet known what elements of hydraulic variability are most beneficial to fish. In an experiment designed to emphasize the minimization of energy expenditure through controlled predation and drift, we investigated whether juvenile coho, under winter conditions, discriminated between microhabitats based primarily on flow strength, depth, distance to wood, or based on temporal or spatial variability of the flow field, with the hypothesis that turbulence would be a strong factor in habitat selection. We conducted physical experiments in a 1:1 scale model of a large wood jam at the Oregon Hatchery Research Center in Alsea, Oregon. We conducted high resolution (0.1 m) mapping of the flow field using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter array and underwater videogrammetry of fish locations. Results indicated that discrimination of microhabitats by juvenile coho salmon in cold, low flows emphasized depth and distance to wood over any hydraulic measures of the flow field. Correlations between hydraulic parameters and distance to wood limited our ability to distinguish the importance of turbulence measures relative to velocities, but highlighted the positive relationships between velocity and turbulence measures and the negative relationships between hydraulics and distance from the roughness elements. Findings suggest areas of further study including potential thresholds of temperature and flow intensity on the importance of turbulence in habitat selection.

AB  - Characterizing hybrid zones and their dynamics is a central goal in evolutionary biology, but this is particularly challenging for morphologically cryptic species. The lack of conspicuous divergence between parental types means intermediate hybrid forms often go undetected. We aimed to detect and characterize a suspected hybrid zone between a pair of morphologically cryptic lineages of the freshwater snail, Radix. We sampled Radix from across a contact zone between two mitochondrial lineages (Radixbalthica and an undescribed lineage termed MOTU3') and detected admixture between two nuclear genotype clusters, which were significantly but not categorically associated with the mitochondrial lineages. Using a model selection approach, we show that the admixture cline is best explained by an interaction between precipitation and temperature gradients over the area, rather than geographic distance. We thus hypothesize that the correlation with climatic gradients suggests environmental selection has played a role in maintaining the hybrid zone. In a 2050 climate change scenario, we furthermore predict an expansion of one of the nuclear clusters and a widening of the hybrid zone as the climate warms and dries.

AB  - The activity of many heterogeneous catalysts is limited by strong correlations between activation energies and adsorption energies of reaction intermediates. Although the reaction is thermodynamically favourable at ambient temperature and pressure, the catalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH3), a fertilizer and chemical fuel, from N-2 and H-2 requires some of the most extreme conditions of the chemical industry. We demonstrate how ammonia can be produced at ambient pressure from air, water, and concentrated sunlight as renewable source of process heat via nitrogen reduction with a looped metal nitride, followed by separate hydrogenation of the lattice nitrogen into ammonia. Separating ammonia synthesis into two reaction steps introduces an additional degree of freedom when designing catalysts with desirable activation and adsorption energies. We discuss the hydrogenation of alkali and alkaline earth metal nitrides and the reduction of transition metal nitrides to outline a promoting role of lattice hydrogen in ammonia evolution. This is rationalized via electronic structure calculations with the activity of nitrogen vacancies controlling the redox-intercalation of hydrogen and the formation and hydrogenation of adsorbed nitrogen species. The predicted trends are confirmed experimentally with evolution of 56.3, 80.7, and 128 mu mol NH3 per mol metal per min at 1 bar and above 550 degrees C via reduction of Mn6N2.58 to Mn4N and hydrogenation of Ca3N2 and Sr2N to Ca2NH and SrH2, respectively.

AB  - The region of Apulia, which is located in the south-east tip of the Italian Peninsula, has a typical Mediterranean climate with mild winters and hot-dry summers. Agriculture, an important sector of its economy, is potentially threatened by future climate change. This study describes the evolution of seasonal temperature and precipitation from the recent past to the next decades and estimates future potential impacts of climate change on three main agricultural products: wine, wheat and olives. Analysis is based on instrumental data, on an ensemble of climate projections and on a linear regression model linking these three agricultural products to seasonal values of temperature and precipitation. In Apulia, precipitation and temperature time series show trends toward warmer and marginally drier conditions during the whole analyzed (1951-2005) period: 0.18 A degrees C/decade in mean annual minimum temperature and -14.9 mm/decade in the annual total precipitation. Temperature trends have been progressively increasing and rates of change have become noticeably more intense during the last 25 years of the twentieth century. Model simulations are consistent with observed trends for the period 1951-2000 and show a large acceleration of the warming rate in the period 2001-2050 with respect to the period 1951-2000. Further, in the period 2001-2050, simulations show a decrease in precipitation, which was not present in the previous 50 years. Wine production, wheat and olive harvest records show large inter-annual variability with statistically significant links to seasonal temperature and precipitation, whose strength, however, strongly depends on the considered variables. Linear regression analysis shows that seasonal temperature and precipitation variability explains a small, but not negligible, fraction of the inter-annual variability of these crops (40, 18, 9 % for wine, olives and wheat, respectively). Results (which consider no adaptation of crops and no fertilization effect of CO2) suggest that evolution of these seasonal climate variables in the first half of the twenty-first century could decrease all considered variables. The most affected is wine production (-20 A center dot -26 %). The effect is relevant also on harvested olives (-8 A center dot -19 %) and negligible on harvested wheat (-4 A center dot -1 %).

AB  - Capelin (Mallotus villosus (Muller, 1776)), a focal forage fish in the north Atlantic, spawn on both beach and demersal (deep-water) sites throughout their circumpolar distribution. Although these habitats rarely occur in close proximity, demersal spawning sites within 4 km of beach spawning sites (subtidal) have recently been discovered in two coastal embayments in Newfoundland, Canada. The physical environment differs considerably between beach and subtidal spawning sites, creating the potential for local adaptation and genetic divergence of capelin from the two habitats, but this has never been investigated on a fine spatial scale. Weuse eight microsatellite loci to test for genetic divergence between capelin spawning at beach and subtidal sites within these two coastal regions in Newfoundland. Wefound no genetic differentiation between fish spawning at beach and subtidal sites or between the two regions. The results from this fine-scale study are in agreement with the lack of habitat-based structure reported in other studies examining beach and demersal sites separated by a larger geographic area. We suggest that instead of showing site fidelity and local adaptation, the facultative use of alternate spawning habitats may be a more successful strategy in an unpredictable environment.

AB  - Genetic diversity of sessile oak (Quercus petraea) populations in Hungary was assessed close to the retracting, low-elevation, low-latitude (xeric) distribution limits.
   We aimed at tracing an assumed effect of climatic factors on genetic diversity, particularly at the southern, low elevation limits of distribution.
   Genetic diversity at isozyme-coding loci was analysed in populations, and related to the climate of the sites where the populations grow. A locus-wise analysis proved to be essential to follow responses.
   A climate-related cline was found at seven isoenzyme-coding gene loci. Declining allelic numbers and heterozygosity indicated lower diversity at warmer and drier sites. The majority of loci were responsive to precipitation factors, others to temperature. Genetic clustering was neither related to geographic distance nor to random or historic effects.
   The results suggest that climatic stress may elicit a genetic diversity loss in populations, which may reduce their plasticity and adaptive potential. The selective pressure may override historic effects and gene flow. With respect to expected climate change, the correlation of diversity with some climatic factors gains specific importance. If supported by further investigations, the results might be utilised for reconsidering conservation strategies and rules for use of forest reproductive material.

AB  - A mechanistic model for baking of unleavened aerated food is proposed. The aerated food was assumed to consist initially of uniformly distributed same sized bubbles. The liquid medium was assumed to be Newtonian. Bubble coalescence, nucleation of bubbles and formation of interconnected channels were neglected. Unsteady state heat conduction and moisture diffusion equations were solved to obtain the evolution of temperature, moisture and air volume fraction profiles as well as cake rise. Consistent with experimental observations reported in the literature, the height of aerated food was found to increase with time, reach a maximum and decreased at longer times. The cake rise was found to be faster and larger at higher oven temperatures and for aerated food of higher initial air fraction and larger sugar content. The model predictions of cake rise agreed fairly well with the experimental data of Pernell, Luck, Foegeding, & Daubert, 2002 for fitted initial air volume fractions with the agreement being better at longer times for decreasing air volume fractions. The calculated air volume fraction profiles indicated an expanded inner region of more or less uniform density and a denser surface crust region whose thickness increased with baking time.

AB  - We review the evidence of how organisms and populations are currently responding to climate change through phenotypic plasticity, genotypic evolution, changes in distribution and, in some cases, local extinction. Organisms alter their gene expression and metabolism to increase the concentrations of several antistress compounds and to change their physiology, phenology, growth and reproduction in response to climate change. Rapid adaptation and microevolution occur at the population level. Together with these phenotypic and genotypic adaptations, the movement of organisms and the turnover of populations can lead to migration toward habitats with better conditions unless hindered by barriers. Both migration and local extinction of populations have occurred. However, many unknowns for all these processes remain. The roles of phenotypic plasticity and genotypic evolution and their possible trade-offs and links with population structure warrant further research. The application of omic techniques to ecological studies will greatly favor this research. It remains poorly understood how climate change will result in asymmetrical responses of species and how it will interact with other increasing global impacts, such as N eutrophication, changes in environmental N:P ratios and species invasion, among many others. The biogeochemical and biophysical feedbacks on climate of all these changes in vegetation are also poorly understood. We here review the evidence of responses to climate change and discuss the perspectives for increasing our knowledge of the interactions between climate change and life.

AB  - To develop seed production techniques for aquaculture of the common Japanese conger, Conger myriaster, we attempted to induce ovarian maturation and ovulation without exogenous hormone treatment and examined the changes in steroid hormones to understand the endocrine condition of the fish during their maturation process. Juveniles caught in November 2001 (20 to 30 cm in total length) were reared for 1.5 years in seawater at temperatures ranging from 10 to 20 degrees C before the experiments. Then, 141 randomly selected female eels (58 to 82 cm in total length) were maintained at a water temperature of 6 degrees C from April 2003 to March 2004. The initial GSI values (5.0 to 12.0) and oocyte diameters (300 to 400 mu m) recorded in April 2003 had increased to maximum values of 30.0 and 650 mu m, respectively, at the end of experiment, in March 2004. In late December 2003, 12 fish with oocytes measuring over 600 mu m in diameter were selected and divided into an elevated temperature group from 6 to 10 degrees C and a control group of 6 degrees C for 43 days. The mean oocyte diameter in the elevated temperature group increased significantly, and one fish (estimated GSI, 47.0) ovulated eggs with an average diameter of 995 +/- 46 mu m on the 41st day at a water temperature of 10 degrees C, in contrast, the control group showed no significant changes in oocyte diameter, and no fish ovulated. Plasma T levels, examined via ELISA, increased with oocyte maturation, with the highest level detected at the migratory nucleus stage, and declined after ovulation. In contrast, plasma E2 was maintained at high levels during the vitellogenic stage, exhibiting the highest value after ovulation. The present study demonstrates that ovarian maturation and ovulation in the common Japanese conger could be achieved through water temperature manipulation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

AB  - Adaptive developmental plasticity can enable an organism to modify its phenotype rapidly, in response to local (and perhaps, unpredictable) conditions, by altering reaction norms during development. Previous studies on this topic have been dominated by western scientists, employing western study systems and approaches. Recently, the expansion of Chinese ecological research has seen a broadening of studies taxonomically (phylogenetically). Here, we briefly summarize research that has been conducted on developmental plasticity in Chinese reptiles over the past two decades, and suggest productive directions for future studies in this field. There are exciting research opportunities in this field in China, and we call for increased collaboration between western and eastern scientists to elucidate the role of developmental plasticity in evolutionary responses of organisms to environmental changes. As human activities increase the intensity and frequency of such changes, the need to understand responses of biological systems becomes an increasingly urgent priority.

AB  - Estuarine-resident fishes are highly susceptible to the effects of environmental and anthropogenic impacts on their assemblages and habitats. We investigated the distribution, movement and spawning behaviour of estuary perch, Macquaria colonorum, in response to selected environmental variables using an acoustic telemetry array in a large tidal river in south-eastern (SE) Australia. Adult M. colonorum were monitored for up to two years, covering two consecutive spawning periods between September 2007 and 2009. Salinity, water temperature and river flows all had a significant relationship with their estuarine distribution. In particular, large-scale movements were influenced by large freshwater inflow events and the resultant reduction in salinity levels, together with the seasonal cooling and warming trends in water temperatures associated with spawning behaviour. During the winter months, male and female M. colonorum migrated from their upper estuarine home ranges to the lower estuarine spawning grounds in synchrony, with numbers of individual visits by both sexes consistently higher in the 'wetter' winter/spring period of 2008. Location, arrival, departure and occupation time within the spawning grounds were similar between sexes and years. Both resident and migrating M. colonorum exhibited strong diel, and to a lesser extent, tidal behavioural patterns, with fish more likely to be detected at night and during the ebb tides. It is postulated that the effect of environmental fluctuations on the distribution and movement of M. colonorum is influenced by behavioural mechanisms in response to osmoregulatory stress, predator-prey interactions and reproductive activity. The results also demonstrate the importance of accounting for autocorrelation inherent in telemetry data, and for developing management strategies that are more robust to the effect of future climate trends on estuarine fish populations.

AB  - There is a general consensus that today's deep-sea biodiversity has largely resulted from recurrent invasions and speciations occurring through homogenous waters during periods of the Phanerozoic eon. Migrations likely continue today, primarily via isothermal water columns, such as those typical of Polar Regions, but the necessary ecological and physiological adaptations behind them are poorly understood. In an evolutionary context, understanding the adaptations, which allow for colonisation to high-pressure environments, may enable us to predict future events. In this investigation, we examine pressure tolerance during development, in the shallow-water neogastropod Buccinum undatum using thermally acclimated egg masses from temperate and sub-polar regions across the species range. Fossil records indicate neogastropods to have a deep-water origin, suggesting shallow-water species may be likely candidates for re-emergence into the deep sea. Our results show population level differences in physiological thresholds, which indicate low temperature acclimation to increase pressure tolerance. These findings imply this species is capable of deep-sea penetration through isothermal water columns prevailing at high latitudes. This study gives new insight into the fundamentals behind past and future colonisation events. Such knowledge is instrumental to understand better how changes in climate envelopes affect the distribution and radiation of species along latitudinal as well as bathymetric temperature gradients.

AB  - Shell calcification in argonauts is unique. Only females of these cephalopods construct the paper nautilus shell, which is used as a brood chamber for developing embryos in the pelagic realm. As one of the thinnest (225 mu m) known adult mollusc shells, and lacking an outer protective periostracum-like cover, this shell may be susceptible to dissolution as the ocean warms and decreases in pH. Vulnerability of the A. nodosa shell was investigated through immersion of shell fragments in multifactorial experiments of control (19 degrees C/pH 8.1; pCO(2) 419; Omega(Ca) = 4.23) and near-future conditions (24 degrees C/pH 7.8-7.6; pCO(2) 932-1525; Omega(Ca) = 2.72-1.55) for 14 days. More extreme pH treatments (pH 7.4-7.2; pCO(2) 2454-3882; Omega(Ca) = 1.20-0.67) were used to assess tipping points in shell dissolution. X-ray diffractometry revealed no change in mineralogy between untreated and treated shells. Reduced shell weight due to dissolution was evident in shells incubated at pH 7.8 (projected for 2070) after 14 days at control temperature, with increased dissolution in warmer and lower pH treatments. The greatest dissolution was recorded at 24 degrees C (projected for local waters by 2100) compared to control temperature across all low-pH treatments. Scanning electron microscopy revealed dissolution and etching of shell mineral in experimental treatments. In the absence of compensatory mineralization, the uncovered female brood chamber will be susceptible to dissolution as ocean pH decreases. Since the shell was a crucial adaptation for the evolution of the argonauts' holopelagic existence, persistence of A. nodosa may be compromised by shell dissolution in an ocean-change world.

AB  - Background: Despite the popularity of zebrafish as a research model, its sex determination (SD) mechanism is still unknown. Most cytogenetic studies failed to find dimorphic sex chromosomes and no primary sex determining switch has been identified even though the assembly of zebrafish genome sequence is near to completion and a high resolution genetic map is available. Recent publications suggest that environmental factors within the natural range have minimal impact on sex ratios of zebrafish populations. The primary aim of this study is to find out more about how sex is determined in zebrafish.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Using classical breeding experiments, we found that sex ratios across families were wide ranging (4.8% to 97.3% males). On the other hand, repeated single pair crossings produced broods of very similar sex ratios, indicating that parental genotypes have a role in the sex ratio of the offspring. Variation among family sex ratios was reduced after selection for breeding pairs with predominantly male or female offspring, another indication that zebrafish sex is regulated genetically. Further examinations by a PCR-based "blind assay" and array comparative genomic hybridization both failed to find universal sex-linked differences between the male and female genomes. Together with the ability to increase the sex bias of lines by selective breeding, these data suggest that zebrafish is unlikely to utilize a chromosomal sex determination (CSD) system.
   Conclusions/Significance: Taken together, our study suggests that zebrafish sex is genetically determined with limited, secondary influences from the environment. As we have not found any sign for CSD in the species, we propose that the zebrafish has a polygenic sex determination system.

AB  - Chemical signals are important for mate and species recognition. If variation in chemical signals occurs between populations of the same species, these differences could later preclude mating between populations and lead to speciation. In the Iberian wall lizard, Podarcis hispanica, the lipophilic fraction of femoral secretions of males is mainly a mix of steroids and fatty acids. Among steroids, the most abundant compounds are cholesterol and cholesta-5,7-dien-3-ol, which are implicated in intraspecific communication and sexual selection. Interpopulational differences in chemical signals of males, and in response to these chemicals, could contribute to reproductive isolation between populations, which would explain the known genetic differences between these populations. Chemical analyses indicated that five distinct populations of this lizard from Madrid (Central Spain) differed in the proportions of two steroids (cholesterol and cholesta-5,7-dien-3-ol) in femoral secretions. Moreover, lizards discriminated and had high chemosensory responses (i.e., high tongue-flick rates) to these steroids, but showed interpopulational differences. Lizards from populations with cold temperatures and high relative humidity (i.e., northern Madrid) elicited higher responses to these steroids, whereas the converse occurred for lizards from populations occupying dry and hot habitats (i.e., southern Madrid). Interestingly, the magnitude of the chemosensory responses to cholesta-5,7-dien-3-ol in each population mirrored the abundance of this compound in secretions of males of that population. These results suggest that the importance of cholesta-5,7-dien-3-ol in males' secretions might be lower for lizards from the southern populations. These differences in the relative importance of chemical signals could explain reproductive isolation and cryptic speciation between populations of this lizard.

AB  - The trailing edges of species ranges are becoming a subject of increasing interest as the environment changes due to global warming. Trailing edge populations are likely to face extinction because of a decline in numbers and an inability to evolve new adaptations with sufficient speed. Discussions of character change in the trailing edge have focused on physiological, exomorphic and phenological traits. The mating pattern within populations has not been part of the discourse, in spite of the fact that the mating pattern may affect the ability of populations to respond to environmental change and to maintain their sizes. In this paper, the case is made that a substantial increase in self-fertilization rates may occur via plastic responses to stress.
   Small populations on the trailing edge are especially vulnerable to environmental change because of inadequate levels of cross-fertilization. Evidence is presented that a deficiency of cross-seed production is due to inadequate pollinator services and a paucity of self-incompatibility alleles within populations. Evidence also is presented that if plants are self-compatible, self-fertilization may compensate in part for this deficiency through a stress-induced increase in levels of self-compatibility and stress-induced alterations in floral morphology that elevate self-pollination. Whereas increased self-fertility may afford populations the time to adapt to their changing environments, it can be concluded that increased selfing is not a panacea for the ills of environmental change, because it will lead to substantial reductions in genetic diversity, which may render adaptation unlikely.

AB  - During the last termination (from similar to 18 000 years ago to similar to 9000 years ago), the climate significantly warmed and the ice sheets melted. Simultaneously, atmospheric CO2 increased from similar to 190 ppm to similar to 260 ppm. Although this CO2 rise plays an important role in the deglacial warming, the reasons for its evolution are difficult to explain. Only box models have been used to run transient simulations of this carbon cycle transition, but by forcing the model with data constrained scenarios of the evolution of temperature, sea level, sea ice, NADW formation, Southern Ocean vertical mixing and biological carbon pump. More complex models (including GCMs) have investigated some of these mechanisms but they have only been used to try and explain LGM versus present day steady-state climates.
   In this study we use a coupled climate-carbon model of intermediate complexity to explore the role of three oceanic processes in transient simulations: the sinking of brines, stratification-dependent diffusion and iron fertilization. Carbonate compensation is accounted for in these simulations. We show that neither iron fertilization nor the sinking of brines alone can account for the evolution of CO2, and that only the combination of the sinking of brines and interactive diffusion can simultaneously simulate the increase in deep Southern Ocean delta C-13. The scenario that agrees best with the data takes into account all mechanisms and favours a rapid cessation of the sinking of brines around 18 000 years ago, when the Antarctic ice sheet extent was at its maximum. In this scenario, we make the hypothesis that sea ice formation was then shifted to the open ocean where the salty water is quickly mixed with fresher water, which prevents deep sinking of salty water and therefore breaks down the deep stratification and releases carbon from the abyss. Based on this scenario, it is possible to simulate both the amplitude and timing of the long-term CO2 increase during the last termination in agreement with ice core data. The atmospheric delta C-13 appears to be highly sensitive to changes in the terrestrial biosphere, underlining the need to better constrain the vegetation evolution during the termination.

AB  - The typical three-host life cycle of most trematodes creates transmission challenges for which a variety of adaptations have evolved to increase the probability of transmission. Some species can abbreviate their life cycle via progenesis, the precocious maturation of the parasite in the second intermediate host resulting in the production of eggs through self-fertilisation without requiring a definitive host. Adoption of the progenetic life cycle may be a conditional strategy in response to different environmental cues related to low probability of transmission to the definitive host. Using high water temperature and/or limited diet as experimental stressors, we tested the effect of body condition and life span of the fish second intermediate host on facultative truncation of the typical three-host life cycle by progenesis in Stegodexamene anguillae. The results suggest that environmental cues, such as temperature and encystment site, may signal transmission opportunities to the parasite so that it may adjust its developmental strategy accordingly. Indeed, a greater proportion of worms became progenetic at higher temperatures, and progenesis was more common among worms encysted in the gonads or body cavity of their fish hosts than among those in other host tissues. These findings highlight the often unrecognised plasticity in parasite developmental and transmission strategies. (C) 2011 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Outlier detection methods were used to scan the genome of the boreal conifer black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) for gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) potentially involved in adaptations to temperature and precipitation variations. The scan involved 583 SNPs from 313 genes potentially playing adaptive roles. Differentiation estimates among population groups defined following variation in temperature and precipitation were moderately high for adaptive quantitative characters such as the timing of budset or tree height (Q(ST) = 0.189-0.314). Average differentiation estimates for gene SNPs were null, with F-ST values of 0.005 and 0.006, respectively, among temperature and precipitation population groups. Using two detection approaches, a total of 26 SNPs from 25 genes distributed among 11 of the 12 linkage groups of black spruce were detected as outliers with F-ST as high as 0.078. Nearly half of the outlier SNPs were located in exons and half of those were nonsynonymous. The functional annotations of genes carrying outlier SNPs and regression analyses between the frequencies of these SNPs and climatic variables supported their implication in adaptive processes. Several genes carrying outlier SNPs belonged to gene families previously found to harbour outlier SNPs in a reproductively isolated but largely sympatric congeneric species, suggesting differential subfunctionalization of gene duplicates. Selection coefficient estimates (S) were moderate but well above the magnitude of drift (>> 1/N-e), indicating that the signature of natural selection could be detected at the nucleotide level despite the recent establishment of these populations during the Holocene.

TI  - Reception Ferrotungsten from Wolframite Concentrate by Alumimotermic Method
T2  - EURASIAN CHEMICO-TECHNOLOGICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - For the smelting ferrotungsten of raw materials (mineral) took us to calculate the charge for each experiment. To optimize the process of obtaining ferrotungsten of wolframite carried out the following activities: to reduce speed and combustion temperature. A change batch positive impact on the development of the combustion process. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the introduction of aluminium additives in excess of stoichiometry because the explosive burning regime turned into stationary. In this work the charge calculated on 300 g volframite concentrate so that as a result of the aluminotermic reaction in the alloy contained 70% of tungsten. Calculations of charge showed that in the case of the smelting of ferro-alloys and master alloys used in this work and have a high melting point (ferrotungsten, ferromolybdenum, etc.) - temperature process of melting alloy is indispensable for the success of melting. To reduce the speed of combustion and the temperature were conducted experiments on selection of ballast additives which allows you to bring the process to a smooth flow of the reaction. As ballast additives used aluminium oxide. It was found that an increase of more than 20 additives reducing the release of the alloy and metal extraction. Also included experiments on selection of warm additives. Use as a warm additive of ammonium nitrate is not desirable because of the rapid reaction and loss of metal slag. The output and the extraction of metal in the application of potassium and sodium nitrate are the same but in the case of kalievoj nitrate slag can be used as a prolonged potash fertilizer. From the x-ray spectrometer alloys were analyzed.

AB  - This study examined the mass loss and CO2 production from Pinus patula (Schlecht et Cham) leaf litter collected from fertilized plots in the Mpumalanga Province. Litter decomposition increased with increasing temperature. Warming between 15 and 18 degrees C significantly increased the amount of CO2 emissions from the litter. Mass loss positively correlated with temperature levels. Nitrogen fertilizer applications had significant effects on litter decomposition rate but a minor effect on litter nitrogen quality. Litter quality was not a strong predictor of decomposition rates implying temperature is the major factor influencing the decomposition rate of Pinus patula needle litter. Results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the rate of nutrient cycling in non-limiting environments will increase, due primarily to an increase in litter decomposition as a result of increased temperatures.

AB  - The question "why sex?" is a longstanding fundamental puzzle in biology. Although there may be several answers, no satisfactory theory has emerged. We present an argument in favour of one function of sex, derived from a study of the population genetics and ecology of the cabbage butterfly, Pieris rapae (L.) (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), on three continents between 1984 and 2009, and from previously published studies of other organisms. We provide evidence that responsiveness to directional selection (RDS), a measure related to "narrow-sense heritability", can be dramatically reduced by truncation selection in a single generation and rapidly restored within a few generations. Viewing a population as a collection of sexual families, we show that rapid restoration of RDS after truncation selection is essential to maintain population variance. The only known mechanism that will rapidly restore RDS is sexual recombination. We therefore conclude that in P. rapae, sex restores the genetic variation that a population needs to match unpredictable environmental variation, despite selection tending to reduce that genetic variation.

AB  - P>The objective of this study was to assess the effects of an activating solution on the sperm motility duration (SMD) of 'curimbata', Prochilodus lineatus through of the definition of qualitative and quantitative parameters of the semen pool used in the experiment; evaluation of the effects of different ratios of semen dilution corresponding to 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 20, 1 : 200, 1 : 2000, 1 : 20 000 and 1 : 100 000 semen:dilute solution on the SMD and, assessment of the effects of different temperatures of the activating solution (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 degrees C) on the SMD. The results of SMD were directly proportional to the dilution (P < 0.05), starting from the dilution of 1 : 2 (semen:water), with 23.04 s. Were used three replicates of the semen pool for each test. Two-year-old brookstock were maintained in ponds culture conditions. In November-December 2006, twelve mature males broodfish were selected (mean weight and length of 405.8 +/- 134.2 g and 25.6 +/- 3.1 cm, respectively). The males released that semen under slight pressure of the urogenital papilla were selected for the experiment. The SMD increased proportionally to the increase in dilution, until it reached a maximum of 28.83 s for the ratio 1 : 100 000 semen: dilute solution. The results of SMD in relation to the temperature of the activating solution exhibited a quadratic behavior (P < 0.05) with a maximum theoretical performance in terms of sperm motility duration of 21.36 s at a temperature of 17.3 degrees C. Thus, for the species considered, the increase in the dilution ratio proved favorable for the rise in motility duration until the maximum value studied of 1 : 100 000 semen:dilute solution. As for the temperature of the activating solution, the best results of SMD were obtained at the temperature of 17.3 degrees C. At higher temperatures used in the experiment (25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 degrees C), a decrease in motility duration.

AB  - Maria Virginia Parachu Marco, Carlos Ignacio Pina, Melina Simoncini, and Larriera Alejandro (2010) Effects of incubation and rearing temperatures on Caiman latirostris growth. Zoological Studies 49(3): 367-373. Different studies found that incubation temperature has an influence on the size of Caiman latirostris hatchlings and determines their gonadal sex. Experimental manipulations revealed that the effects of temperature on growth are independent of sex. Ambient temperature after hatching is also an influential factor: juvenile caiman had lower growth at a cool (29 degrees C) vs. a warm temperature (33 degrees C) independent of incubation temperatures. Two-month-old caiman were raised at 2 different temperatures (29 and 33 degrees C) for 100 d. These animals were subjected to different incubation treatments: 29, 31 (females), 33 (males), and 33 degrees C with 17 beta-estradiol (females). No differences were found in growth based on incubation temperature or sex. Our data indicate that the evolutionary advantage of a temperature-dependent sex determination, if it exists, is not bound to differential growth between the sexes nor to incubation temperature, at least in the 1st stages of life before hatchlings reach their 1st winter. Temperatures during the development and grow-out phases have direct effects on the size of the broad-snouted caiman. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/49.3/367.pdf

AB  - The electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that dominate the behavior of proteins and other biomolecules exhibit fundamentally different thermodynamic characteristics, and the correct reproduction of these differences is likely to be an important requirement for models that aim to predict the thermodynamics of protein stability and protein protein interactions. To assess the abilities of some current models to capture these differences, we report here the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations examining the association of acetate-methyl-ammonium and methane-methane pairs at 11 different temperatures from - 12.5 to 112.5 degrees C. Simulations were performed using two popular water models (TIP3P and TIP5P), with a total simulation time of 22 mu s. With both water models, we find that the acetate-methylammonium salt-bridge interaction is significantly more stabilized by high temperatures (e.g., over the range 25 to 100 degrees C) than is the methane-methane hydrophobic interaction. At low temperatures however, the two models exhibit quite different behavior, with the TIP5P model predicting little change in the relative stabilities of the two types of interaction in the range - 12.5 to 50 degrees C; this surprising result has potential implications for understanding adaptation to life in psychrophilic organisms. Fitting the Delta G data to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation allows the Delta H, Delta S, and Delta C-p of interaction to be obtained, thereby yielding a complete thermodynamic characterization of the different types of interaction in the temperature range 0 to 100 degrees C: despite significant quantitative differences, both water models correctly capture the opposite signs of the Delta C-p of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Finally, we show that at high temperatures a Poisson-based continuum solvation model provides good agreement with the explicit-solvent MD results, but only when the atomic radii used in the continuum calculations are scaled with temperature.

AB  - We have carried out long-term (14 years) V and R photometric monitoring of 12 carbon-rich proto-planetary nebulae. The light and color curves display variability in all of them. The light curves are complex and suggest multiple periods, changing periods, and/or changing amplitudes, which are attributed to pulsation. A dominant period has been determined for each and found to be in the range of similar to 150 days for the coolest (G8) to 35-40 days for the warmest (F3). A clear, linear inverse relationship has been found in the sample between the pulsation period and the effective temperature and also an inverse relationship between the amplitude of light variation and the effective temperature. These are consistent with the expectation for a pulsating post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) star evolving toward higher temperature at constant luminosity. The published spectral energy distributions and mid-infrared images show these objects to have cool (200 K), detached dust shells and published models imply that intensive mass loss ended 400-2000 years ago. The detection of periods as long as 150 days in these requires a revision in the published post-AGB evolution models that couple the pulsation period to the mass loss rate and that assume that intensive mass loss ended when the pulsation period had decreased to 100 days. This revision will have the effect of extending the timescale for the early phases of post-AGB evolution. It appears that real time evolution in the pulsation periods of individual objects may be detectable on the timescale of two or three decades.

AB  - A permanent snow cover for several months is typical for lame parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland Snow layers thicker than about 20 cm insulate the soil surface and stabilize the ground temperature close to 0 degrees C Many ground-living invertebrates are active at this temperature in the subnivean an space From this "base camp", some invertebrates migrate upwards to use the snow as a subsume The intranivean fauna consists of springtails (Collembola) and mites (Acari) that are small enough to move within the narrow pores between snow crystals The supianvean fauna consists of various invertebrates that ale active on the snow surface Some of them are Collembola that have migrated through the snow layers However, most of them are larger insects and spiders which migrate between the subnivean and supranivean habitats following air channels which are naturally created along tree stems, bushes etc penetrating the snow Likewise, certain Chironomidae and Plecoptera, hatching from winter-open rivers and brooks, are active on the snow surface The supranivean arthropod fauna has the following characteristics I It is a weather dependent assemblage of species. coming and going with changes in air temperature, cloud cover, and wind Below ea -6 degrees C animals are absent, but at temperatures around of above zero, many groups can be simultaneously active on snow. 2 The snow surface fauna shows pheno-logical changes throughout the winter, as certain species and groups are mainly active during certain months 3 Some invertebrates are highly specialized and take advantage of the snow surface as an arena in their life cycle Examples are Hypogastrura social's (Collembola), and the two wingless insects Chionea sp (Diptera Limoniidae) and Boreus sp (Mecoptera) They use the smooth snow sui face for efficient migration Chioea sp and Boreus sp lay their cuss during the snow-covered period. while H social's migrates to mate new colonies The cold tolerant spider Bolephthyphantes index is unique in constructing webs in small depressions on the snow, to catch migrating Collembola Various adaptations for using the snow as a substrate are discussed Besides physiological and morphological adaptations, snow surface arthiopods show special behavioural adaptations Most conspicuous is the ability of several Collembola species to navigate during migiation, using the position of the sun for orientation Furthermore, in Collembola and Mecoptera, jumping as an original mechanism to escape predators has independently evolved into a migrating mechanism An evolutionary potential exists for more invertebrate groups to take advantage of snow as a substrate in their life cycle For instance, several more cold tolerant spiders mid-it evolve the ability to catch migrating Collembola on snow

AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse provenance tests of beech situated close to the south-eastern continental limits of the species, in order to develop a response model of adaptation and plasticity of populations on evolutionary-ecological basis, following sudden climatic changes, as a result of transplanting. Modelling of juvenile height was performed with the help of ecodistance variables. The concept of transfer analysis and ecodistance is based on the hypothesis that phenotypic response to macroclimatic changes depends on the inherited adaptive potential of the population and on the magnitude and direction of experienced environmental change. In common garden experiments, the transfer to the planting site is interpreted as simulation of environmental change. The application of ecodistance of transfer for evaluating common garden experiments provides much needed quantitative information about response of tree populations to predicted climatic changes. The analysis of three field experiments of European beech in SE Europe indicates that macroclimatic adaptation patterns exist in juvenile growth and justify restrictions of use of reproductive material on the basis of evolutionary ecology. The presented model illustrates that response to climatic change is regionally divergent, depending on testing conditions and on hereditary traits. In particular, climatic warming in the central-northern part of the range may lead to production increase. However, under the stressful and uncertain conditions at the lower (xeric) limit of the species, growth depression and vitality loss are predicted. The deviating behaviour of higher elevation provenances support their separate treatment. The results may be utilised in climate change adaptation and mitigation policy in forestry and nature conservation, to revise rules for use of reproductive material and also for validating evolutionary and ecological hypotheses related to climate change effects.

AB  - Understanding how crop systems might respond to recent climate change is fundamental to the successful adaptation of efforts for sustainable agriculture. In the present paper, records over the period 1987-2004 from a long-term agroecosystem experiment carried out in Northeast China were used to explore the impacts of global warming on soybean (Glycine max (L) Merr.) yields under different controlled fertilization treatments. The results indicated that soybean yields were closely related to growing season temperatures. In most fertilization treatments, soybean yields showed a significant negative response to higher daily maximum temperature and greater diurnal temperature range (DTR), whereas they showed a significant positive response to higher daily minimum temperature. Analysis of covariance showed that these responses of soybean yields to temperature variables did not differ across fertilization treatments. Overall, soybean yields have declined significantly due to the warming trends since 1987. This has been mainly attributed to the higher daily maximum temperature. The present report demonstrates that soybean production in Northeast China may face challenges due to global warming unless potential adaptation options are adopted. The true mechanisms behind these yield impacts need further investigation to address effective agricultural adaptations for soybean systems to adapt to global warming.

AB  - Climate change is likely to disrupt the timing of developmental events (phenology) in insect populations in which development time is largely determined by temperature. Shifting phenology puts insects at risk of being exposed to seasonal weather extremes during sensitive life stages and losing synchrony with biotic resources. Additionally, warming may result in loss of developmental synchronization within a population making it difficult to find mates or mount mass attacks against well-defended resources at low population densities. It is unknown whether genetic evolution of development time can occur rapidly enough to moderate these effects. We present a novel approach to modeling the evolution of phenology by allowing the parameters of a phenology model to evolve in response to selection on emergence time and density. We use the Laplace method to find asymptotic approximations for the temporal variation in mean phenotype and phenotypic variance arising in the evolution model that are used to characterize invariant distributions of the model under periodic temperatures at leading order. At these steady distributions the mean phenotype allows for parents and offspring to be oviposited at the same time of year in consecutive years. Numerical simulations show that populations evolve to these steady distributions under periodic temperatures. We consider an example of how the evolution model predicts populations will evolve in response to warming temperatures and shifting resource phenology.

AB  - The major features of the East Asian subtropical westerly jet (EASWJ) in the upper troposphere simulated by the, two versions of CCSR/NlES/FRCGC climate system model (MIROC_Hires and MIROC_Medres) are examined by analyzing the differences between the coupled model 20(th) century simulations and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis, focusing on the evaluation of the model performances in reproducing the mean EASWJ structures, the seasonal evolution, interannual variability, and the relationship among the EASWJ seasonal evolution, the meridional temperature gradient and the diabatic heating in the upper troposphere.
   The mean EASWJ vertical and horizontal structures, the seasonal evolution, and the correspondence of the EASWJ location to the meridional temperature gradient in the upper troposphere are well simulated in the coupled models. The increase in model resolution can improve the simulation of the EASWJ structures, seasonal evolution and interannual variability. However, both coupled models overestimate the EASWJ intensity in winter, and underestimate the jet intensity in summer, relative to the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis. The biases in model EASWJ intensity are found to be associated with biases in meridional temperature gradients in the troposphere, and furthermore with the surface sensible heat flux in summer and convective condensation heating in winter as well as the meridional heat transport gradient. The coupled models simulate well the seasonal evolution of the diabatic heating averaged between 30 degrees N-45 degrees N, and its association with the westerly jet. However, the simulated maximum diabatic heating in summer is located eastward compared with the reanalyzed position, with a relatively weak diabatic heating intensity, especially in MIROC_Hires, while the MIROC_Medres model reproduces relatively strong diabatic heating near 130 degrees E in winter. This study suggests that the condensation latent heating over the western Pacific in winter, the surface sensible heating over the northern side of the Tibetan Plateau in summer and the meridional heat transport gradient determine the EASWJ intensity, location and structure as well as its seasonal evolution. Thus the reasonable reproductions of the meridional heat transport gradient and the surface diabatic heating are the key points for improving the EASWJ simulation by the MIROC model.

AB  - We explored two mutually nonexclusive hypotheses on autumnal leaf colouration. The co-evolutionary hypothesis states that autumnal leaf colouration functions as a handicap signal to herbivorous insects, whereas the photoprotection hypothesis posits that plant pigments primarily protect the plant against cold-induced photoinhibition and enhance nutrient transfer. To contrast both hypotheses, we compared yellow and red leaf colouration in three groups of mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia L.). Two montane groups of different age were characterised by low aphid numbers and low temperature, and a lowland group by high aphid numbers and high temperature. There were no consistent altitudinal differences in leaf colouration. Compared to young trees, adult trees developed fewer red but more yellow leaves at high altitude. In the lowland population, the development of red leaf colour was related to decreasing daytime temperature, whereas the appearance of yellow leaf colouration corresponded to the decreasing photoperiod. This is consistent with the photoprotection hypothesis. Individual differences in red and yellow leaf colouration were inversely correlated to the number of fruits, which might be interpreted as a trade-off between reproductive and protective commitment. Temperature effects explained variation in aphid numbers over time and leaf colouration explained aphid distribution on a given day. As predicted by the co-evolutionary hypothesis, strongly coloured individuals harboured fewer aphids than green or dull-coloured ones. Since decreasing temperature reduced the number of migrating aphids but induced red leaf colouration, these processes are not mutually fine-tuned, which likely restricts the potential for co-evolution between mountain ash and aphids.

AB  - Most social insect species are able to regulate the temperature within their nests. In this review, we examine the variety of mechanisms that social insect species have evolved to regulate temperature. We divide these mechanisms into two broad categories: active and passive. 'Passive' temperature regulation includes such mechanisms as nest site selection to optimize internal nest temperature, nest structures that permit passive heating or cooling, or simple behaviour such as brood translocation to regions within a nest where temperatures are most favourable. 'Active' temperature regulation refers to behaviour where individuals modify nest temperature by physical activity like wing fanning or evaporative cooling. Although there is enormous variation in the thermoregulatory mechanisms, there are also many similarities. All thermoregulatory mechanisms are self-organized and arise from simple rules followed by each individual worker.

AB  - Diapause in the boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis Boheman (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), remains a contentious issue despite intense investigation. In particular, the roles and interactions of photoperiod, temperature, and adult diet are poorly understood. We reexamined the influences of these factors by using a feeding regime typical of previous studies (group, one square per five weevils per day) as well as one known to promote reproductive development (single, one square per weevil per day). Three separate studies each incorporated all combinations of the following: photoperiod (short day, 11: 13; long day 13:11 [L:D] h), temperature regime (constant 29.4 degrees C; warm day, cool night, 29.4 degrees C:10 degrees C [day:night]), feeding regime, and age at dissection (3, 6, 9, and 12 d after adult eclosion). Studies differed in the source of weevils (Lower Rio Grande Valley, Brazos Valley of Texas), and the photoperiod used to rear weevils to adulthood (11:13 or 13:11 [L:D] h). Interpretable effects of photoperiod on diapause induction were not observed. Cool nights delayed development of fat bodies, oocytes with yolk, and the occurrence of diapause, especially in weevils fed in groups. However, these effects were not apparent by day 12. The most marked responses were to feeding regime. Hypertrophied fat bodies and diapause generally occurred more often, and oocytes with yolk less often, for weevils fed in groups compared with those fed singly. Fundamental differences in diapause response corresponding to rearing conditions or source of weevils were not observed. These results suggest improved understanding of the dynamics of adult diapause could be achieved through continued investigation of the effects of adult diets.

AB  - Under certain environmental situations, selection may favour the ability of females to adjust the sex ratio of their offspring. Two recent studies have suggested that viviparous scincid lizards can modify the sex ratio of the offspring they produce in response to the operational sex ratio (OSR). Both of the species in question belong to genera that have also recently been shown to exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Here we test whether pregnant montane water skinks (Eulamprus tympanum) utilise TSD to select offspring sex in response to population wide imbalances in the OSR, by means of active thermoregulation. We use a combination of laboratory and field-based experiments, and conduct the first field-based test of this hypothesis by maintaining females in outdoor enclosures of varying OSR treatments throughout pregnancy. Although maternal body temperature during pregnancy was influenced by OSR, the variation in temperature was not great enough to affect litter sex ratios or any other phenotypic traits of the offspring.

AB  - Question: Do invasive species adapt during range expansion? Data are few and many expect adaptation to be constrained by low genetic variation in invaders, which frequently experience population bottlenecks during colonization.
   Experimental results: We used a common-garden experiment to show that the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid (Insecta: Hemiptera: Adelgidae: Adelges tsugae) has evolved greater resistance to cold shock as it has expanded its range northward. This insect feeds on exposed twigs in winter and is vulnerable to extreme cold.
   Modelling results: Adelges tsugae has grown to a sufficiently large population size that its adaptive evolution appears unconstrained by the availability of new mutants, despite its parthenogenetic reproduction. Conservatively, its population size likely exceeds 1/(2u) within 40 ha of forest, where u is the haploid per-base mutation rate, so that on average a mutation arises each generation at every base pair in the entire genome within this area.
   Conclusion: This escape from genetic constraint is likely to be found in many species that have invaded successfully, facilitating their adaptation to novel conditions.

The pressure-induced changes in these properties were dependent on the pressure and temperature applied and the pH. The most pronounced changes were observed in the pressure range of 400-700 MPa. Pressure induced ail increase in turbidity, surface hydrophobicity, exposed SH content and susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis, while it resulted in a decrease in protein solubility, total SH content, denaturation enthalpy and trypsin inhibitory activity.

AB  - The reproductive biology, and larval and adult host rant e of Diabrotica speciosa (Germar), Diabrotica viridula (F.), Acalymma spp. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Galerucinae), and other Diabroticina are described. These Diabroticina are pests of several crops in South and Central America. The adult feeding hosts are compared, among species, and within species in different seasons, Laboratory oviposition and larval development tests oil several hosts, provided the basis to construct a table of putative hosts, and general reproductive traits related to two species groups of Diabrotica (virgifera and fucata). Eggs of D. speciosa and D. viridula. were exposed to low temperatures to detect the ability to be dormant. Multivoltinism and lack of egg diapause was demonstrated for the three species, and field data suggest other South American species present the same traits. Diabrotica speciosa (fucata group) larvae developed well on maize (Zea mays I.). peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.), and soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) roots, and not so well oil pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima Duchesne and Cucurbita andreana Naudin), beaus (Phaseolus spp.) and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) roots. Oviposition preferences roughly paralleled larval suitability. but there was a clear preference for cucurbits as adult food, when a available pigweed (Amaranthus quitensis Knuth), sunflower (Ikhanthus annuus. L.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) were in second place. Diabrotica viridula (virgifera group), preferred maize as adult and larval food, and for oviposition. Acalymma spp.. were associated in every respect to cucurbits, Other species showed varying degrees of preference for oviposition and feeding, but in general. cucurbits were the preferred adult feeding hosts. Followed by several wild plants, and maize the preferred oviposition host. Whereas cucurbits A were consistently visited by the adults of every species, the virgifera group species ovipositioned and developed exclusively on Mono-cotyledonae, However, D, speciosa. as expected for a fucata group species ovipositcd and developed oil a wide range of hosts. This new knowledge oil South American Diabroticina is discussed in the context of the current knowledge oil North American Diabroticina, Differences and similarities are discussed in connection with their pestiferous status, and their potential for adaptation to new hosts.

AB  - Co-adaptations, co-evolution, and co-speciation between herbivores and their host plants have been topics of interest for several decades. Difficulties in deciphering these relationships as well as physiological, biochemical, and ecological adaptations of herbivorous insects themselves are discussed here in relation to biotic and abiotic environmental factors that create temporal as well as spatial mosaics of genetic variation. Hybridization was shown in swallowtail butterflies (Papilio) (Lepidoptera: Papilionidae) to produce some trait concordance, but mostly independent geographic trait clines (physiological, biochemical, and morphological). Strong and extensive genetic introgression of Liriodendron tulipifera detoxification abilities was documented northward across the hybrid zone, presumably as a result of regional climate warming only during the last 3-4 years. These and other genetic novelties produced by hybridization may be important in speciation processes, and they also emphasize the difficulties identifying appropriate taxonomic classifications for discussing any species concept. Host plant detoxification abilities (as 'key innovations') are shown capable of rapid movement between different polyphagous herbivore species independently of the host plant availability and well beyond the insect species geographical range distribution. Part of the difficulty associated with ecologically categorizing herbivore species and identifying affiliated adaptations for host plant use may be related to independent movement of various 'species-diagnostic' traits. Climate-driven local selection regimes could help generate the dynamic variation observed for co-adapted, co-evolved, or non-adapted genotypes, and may produce the confusing and changing patterns of geographic mosaics seen within and among closely related herbivores. Experimental analyses of several factors that could explain the asymmetrical shapes of trait clines across the hybrid zone for tiger swallowtail butterflies are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to understand the nature of the biochemical and physiological variations between genetically different lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Selection for early or delayed reproduction has given rise to lines with substantial and heritable differences in longevity. The hypotheses tested were that either: (i) a compensatory slowing of metabolism, (ii) increased antioxidative enzyme activities, or (iii) elevated resistance to stressful conditions underlie these differences in longevity. The metabolic rate, metabolic potential (i.e. total amount of oxygen consumed during average lifespan) and speed of walking were all greater in long-lived than in short-lived flies, but then was no enhancement of antioxidant defenses. In fact, catalase activity was significantly lower in the long-lived dies. Long life was largely maintained under heat stress and starvation conditions, and was maintained to a lesser extent upon exposure to paraquat, a superoxide radical generator. In contrast, the 'short-lived' flies had a longer lifespan under cold stress and hyperoxia, also an inducer of radical generation. These results contradict the first two hypotheses and suggest that alleles underlying either long or short life are linked with enhanced resistance to specific kinds of stress, which may account for the preservation of these alleles in the parental population.

AB  - Sexual polymorphisms are model systems for analyzing the evolution of reproductive strategies. However, their plasticity and other binary traits have rarely been studied, with respect to environmental variables. A possible reason is that, although threshold models offer an adequate quantitative genetics framework for binary traits in a single environment, analyzing their plasticity requires more refined empirical and theoretical approaches. The statistical framework proposed here, based on the environmental threshold model (ETM), should partially fill this gap. This methodology is applied to an empirical dataset on a plastic sexual polymorphism, aphally, in the snail Bulinus truncatus. Aphally is characterized by the co-occurrence of regular hermaphrodites (euphallics) together with hermaphrodites deprived of the male copulatory organ (aphallics). Reaction norms were determined for 40 inbred lines, distributed at three temperatures, in a first experiment. A second experiment allowed us to rule out maternal effects. We confirmed the existence of high broad-sense heritabilities as well as a positive effect of high temperatures on aphally. However a significant genotype-by-environment interaction was detected for the first time, suggesting that sexual plasticity itself can respond to selection. A nested series of four ETM-like models was developed for estimating genetical effects on both mean aphally rate and plasticity. These models were tested using a maximum-likelihood procedure and fitted to aphally data. Although no perfect fit of models to data was observed, the refined versions of ETM models conveniently reduce the analysis of complex reaction norms of binary traits into standard quantitative genetics parameters, such as genetic values and environmental variances.

AB  - The effect of competition between incompatible and compatible pollen grains on the seed production of white clover was studied. Stigmatic receptivity was also studied. A selection line of white clover that has red leaves was used as a pollen donor and as a genetic marker to allow determination of the pollen donor responsible for ovule fertilisation. Results show that incompatible pollen did not inhibit compatible pollen grains from fertilising ovules and producing seeds, although it did slightly impair seed yield. At temperatures of 20/10 degrees C (day/night) stigmas of white clover remained receptive to additional pollination up to 32 h after an initial compatible pollination and 40 h after an incompatible pollination. The results imply that factors other than inadequate pollination and the self-incompatibility system are responsible for failure of white clover to attain its potential seed yield.

AB  - We used a coupled physical-biological model to examine potential distances between hatching and settlement locations for lobsters in the Gulf of Maine. The physical model is based on a finite-element mesh and climatological averages of the seasonally evolving temperature and density fields. Larval trajectories from coastal and offshore hatching sites (21-224 m deep) were calculated for early, middle and late-season hatching by coupling temperature-dependent development rates and depth (the biological model) to the circulation. Model results showed large spatial differences in larval development times (from 18 to 38 days) and distances transported (19-280 km) for the early hatch. Development time and transport decreased markedly by mid-season at most sites, but strong spatial differences persisted. The eastern Maine coast appears to experience stronger removal and less resupply of larvae than other regions, consistent with observed lower recruitment. Inverse solutions of the model for larvae arriving in mid-coastal Maine indicate that they originate from a broad section of the eastern coast 'upstream', with those nearest the shoreline generally travelling the shortest distances. The postlarval stage is neustonic (living near the surface), and a simple inverse model demonstrates that a diurnal coastal sea breeze can contribute substantially to inshore movement during this final planktonic stage. Thus, offshore reproduction may be linked to inshore recruitment.

AB  - Temperature effects on fecundity and reproductive capacity of adult fundatrigenia and alienicolae, and development of alienicolae of the poplar petiolegall aphid, Pemphigus populitransversus Riley, were measured at selected constant temperatures. Adult fundatrigenia produced an average of 16 nymphs per adult (range, 13.8-17.9 nymphs per adult). Reproductive capacity of adult alienicolae averaged 49.2 nymphs per adult (range, 17.4-75.22 nymphs per adult). Reproductive rate of fundatrigenia was more responsive to temperature, but reproductive capacity was less sensitive to temperature compared with alienicolae. Development of alienicolae was investigated at 7 constant temperatures ranging from 10 to 29.2 degrees C. Alienicolae development was fitted to a nonlinear, temperature-dependent model. In addition, degree-day requirements for development and the lower developmental threshold of alienicolae were estimated with n-weighted linear regression for comparison with reported lower developmental thresholds of other aphids. The lower developmental threshold estimate for P. populitransversus fell within the range of lower developmental thresholds for other aphids. Development time from birth to adult was similar to Pemphigus betae Doane, but longer than development times reported for some foliar-feeding aphids.

AB  - This study investigated the daily activities of juvenile sea cucumbers Holothuria scabra Jaeger. All individuals exhibited daily burrowing and feeding rhythms in response to environmental factors. The cycle of the smallest juvenile, > 10-40 mm, was linked to light; they began to burrow around sunrise and emerged close to sunset. Their burrowing activity was inhibited by continuous darkness. Juveniles >40-140 mm responded to changes in temperature; they burrowed earlier around 03:30 h, seeking shelter in the sediment as temperature declined, and emerged around mid-day. The maintenance of a constant warm temperature prevented them from burrowing. For all juveniles, time spent on the surface corresponded with feeding and periods of locomotion; while burrowed they remained stationary, did not feed and had a low intestinal transit. Organic matter content in the intestine was also found to vary with the daily cycle. Decreases in salinity from 35 to 30, 25 and 20 parts per thousand induced the burrowing of all juveniles within minutes, but they began to re-emerge after a few hours. Acclimation occurred most rapidly at salinity 30 parts per thousand and was slowest at salinity 20 parts per thousand. Conversely, nearly 40% of the juveniles were unable to cope with a decrease to salinity 15 parts per thousand. Juveniles of all sizes demonstrated a strong selectivity for sediment characteristics. In two substrate selection experiments, their preference for sand with a grain size around 0.4 mm and for organically rich material was firmly expressed within an hour. The general behavior of juvenile H. scabra reflects their ability to inhabit shallow sandy areas with high terrigenous inputs and variable environmental conditions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Under particular conditions of photoperiod and temperature, Armadillidium vulgare females, originating from a single population, might exhibit individual differences in the onset of reproduction and duration of the breeding period. In a population issued from a strain from middle latitudes, some females underwent only one parturial moult (northern tendency) and others three parturial moults (southern tendency). Females with an atypical northern phenology are the most numerous and tend to be found near the Danish population. In the latter, there is an asymmetrical response to laboratory selection (favourable to females with a longer breeding period). The asymmetrical variation in atypical individuals acts as a safety device against the unpredictability of the environment. The adaptation of this species, originally from the Mediterranean periphery, to a northern environment has led to a reduction in its capacity to breed over long periods of time. Populations from middle latitudes can undergo one or several parturial moults which enables the species to successfully colonize even far-away countries. These intrapopulation differences have an essential role and explain why Armadillidium vulgare is one of the most widely distributed species among Oniscidea. (C) Elsevier, Paris.

AB  - Xenopus laevis coelomic (body cavity) eggs are not fertilizable until they pass through the pars recta oviduct. A secreted pars recta oviductal protease with trypsin-like activity, oviductin, selectively hydrolyzes egg envelope glycoprotein gp43 to gp41; this limited proteolysis is believed to render the egg fertilizable. The effects of trypsin as a substitute for oviductin in modifying envelope structure and function were examined. Trypsinolysis (5 mIU for 30 min at room temperature) selectively converted gp43 to gp41 without hydrolysis of other envelope glycoproteins, and rendered coelomic eggs fertilizable in the presence of a jelly water preparation. Chymotrypsin had no effect on the acquisition of fertilizability, indicating that the reaction was dependent on trypsin-like specificity. This was confirmed by the use of p-aminobenzamindine and leupeptin to inhibit the ability of trypsin preparations to induce fertilizability. A sperm binding assay revealed that trypsin treatment dramatically increased sperm binding to egg envelopes derived from both coelomic eggs and ovarian eggs. Jelly water was not required for sperm binding. Therefore, trypsin can mimic the biological action of oviductin, selectively cleaving egg envelope gp43 to generate or expose sperm binding sites, rendering the envelope penetrable by sperm and permitting fertilization.

AB  - Controlled environmental chambers were used to determine the effect of constant low temperatures (0-18 degrees C) on diapause termination of the eggs of Aulocara elliotti (Thomas) and Ageneotettix deorum (Scudder), species that require low temperatures for diapause termination. When eggs of A. elliotti and A. deorum were incubated at 30 degrees C without low-temperature treatments, 6.1% of A. Elliotti hatched after approximate to 36 d of incubation and 1.5% of A. deorum hatched after approximate to 46 d of incubation. Exposure times (days) to selected constant low temperatures ranged from 15 to 100 d. For both species, the greatest hatch at all tow temperatures was induced with exposures of >60 d. Optimum conditions for diapause termination of A. elliotti were calculated to be between 75 and 98 d exposure to 6.6-8 degrees C. Optimum conditions for diapause termination of A. deorum were calculated to be between 75 and 77 d exposure to 7-8.6 degrees C. These studies provide insight about the univoltinism of these insects and offer evidence that with these species, embryonic diapause terminates before the prolonged subfreezing temperatures of winter.

T2  - GENETIKA
LA  - Russian
AB  - Two heterogeneous Drosophila melanogaster populations were subjected to selection for an increased rate of embryonic development by picking out the first 10% of hatching larvae. After repeating this procedure in 15 generations, ''fast'' populations were obtained, in which the duration of embryonic development at high temperature (31-32 degrees C) was 30-40 min less than in nonselected control populations. The results of preliminary experiments on substituting the second and third chromosomes in the selected and control populations provide evidence that selected genes responsible for accelerated development are located on the second chromosome. Inbreeding in 12 generations of selected populations was used to obtain about 40 lines homozygous, in particular, at time alcohol dehydrogenase gene. In four lines, the developmental rate was higher than in a homozygous control line, but others did nor differ from control or developed more slowly. The duration of embryonic development ae 32 degrees C in fast lines was 50-70 min shorter than in control, but this difference was significantly less at lower temperatures (25 and 17 degrees C). Hence, high temperature is primarily a factor in providing conditions for the expression of genes determining the developmental rate, rather than a factor of selection for these genes. It is suggested that selected genes modify developmental rate dependence on temperature.

AB  - Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been used to study samples taken from three paintings during treatment in the Conservation Department of the Tate Gallery. The paintings include two from the 16th century: (1) ''Queen Elizabeth 1'' by Nicholas Hilliard (National Portrait Gallery, London NPG 190), (2) ''An Allegory of Life'' (unattributed ca. 1570 British School To 5729) and (3) 19th century, Turner's 'The Opening of the Walhalla, 1842' (Tate Gallery N00533). Knowledge of the type of paint media used is of interest both to the conservator who needs to select the appropriate materials for cleaning the painting and to the art historian for documentation of artists' techniques.
   In the case of the Hilliard painting it was found that a mixed oil egg medium had been used. With regard to the unattributed 16th century British painting it was found that an oil-based medium had been used. The ground layer contained, as expected, a natural glue. Samples from the Turner painting showed that different regions of the painting had been executed with different materials; the region of the sky was painted predominantly with a drying oil, the lower regions of the painting contained mixtures of oil and resin and in some cases the samples were further complicated by the presence of proteinaceous material and wax. The recorded accompanying weight change gave information on the pigment volume concentration of the samples. In each case measurements were made of both the temperature and the heat evolved during the exothermic reactions. Thermomicroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the presence of complex mixtures, particularly in the case of the Turner samples.

AB  - Climatic change has long been regarded as an important factor in evolutionary history. In particular, periods of enhanced extinction in marine tara (especially those from warmer waters) have frequently been linked to decreases in seawater temperature. Studies of the physiology of marine invertebrates and fish alive today have revealed well-developed abilities to cope with temperature change, and there would thus appear to be a dichotomy between the rates of temperature change associated with extinction in geological history and the very much faster rates (by several orders of magnitude) with which many marine organisms can cope today. Nevertheless, evidence from ecology and biogeography indicates that temperature, or some temperature-associated factor, does play a significant role in determining the limits to performance, and hence distribution. The resolution of the dichotomy between the evidence from paleontology and physiology may come through a consideration of the role of the previous evolutionary history of the fauna, the influence of sudden temperature events, or the impact of climatic change on individual competitive ability, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. Studies of the energetics of marine invertebrates in relation to temperature and the evolutionary history of polar faunas indicate that we should beware of anthropocentric judgements in attempting to understand the role of climatic change in evolutionary history, and be critical in distinguishing the role of temperature per se from temperature-associated ecological factors. present evidence suggests that climatic change in the sea, at least at the rates currently believed to be typical, is unlikely to cause extinction by direct physiological impact. It is more likely that extinction is caused by ecological factors; temperature change is thus only one of several factors that may promote those ecological changes that are currently the best candidates for the proximate cause of extinction in the sea.

Flies selected in good environment appeared to be more sensitive to stress and individuals from unselected lines were more resistant than those from selected lines. Response to stress, effects of top-crossing, and manifestation of heterosis were more affected by complicated interactions; genetic properties of base population x kind of environment x selection history than by each of these factors themselves. Lines selected for combining ability did not show greater resistance to environmental changes than purebred tines. Positive genetic correlation between resistance to ethanol and to heat appears to be present.

AB  - Sex-determining mechanisms in reptiles can be divided into two convenient classifications: genotypic (GSD) and environmental (ESD). While a number of types of GSD have been identified in a wide variety of reptilian taxa, the expression of ESD in the form of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in three of the five major reptilian lineages has drawn considerable attention to this area of research. Increasing interest in sex-determining mechanisms in reptiles has resulted in many data, but much of this information is scattered throughout the literature and consequently difficult to interpret. It is known, however, that distinct sex chromosomes are absent in the tuatara and crocodilians, rare in amphisbaenians (worm lizards) and turtles, and common in lizards and snakes (but less than 20 % of all species of living reptiles have been karyotyped). With less than 2 percent of all reptilian species examined, TSD apparently is absent in the tuatara, amphisbaenians and snakes; rare in lizards, frequent in turtles, and ubiquitous in crocodilians. Despite considerable inter- and intraspecific variation in the threshold temperature (temperature producing a 1:1 sex ratio) of gonadal sex determination, this variation cannot confidently be assigned a genetic basis owing to uncontrolled environmental factors or to differences in experimental protocol among studies. Laboratory studies have identified the critical period of development during which gonadal sex determination occurs for at least a dozen species. There are striking similarities in this period among the major taxa with TSD. Examination of TSD in the field indicates that sex ratios of hatchlings are affected by location of the nests, because some nests produce both sexes whereas the majority produce only one sex. Still, more information is needed on how TSD operates under natural conditions in order to fully understand its ecological and conservation implications. TSD may be the ancestral sex-determining condition in reptiles, but this result remains tentative. Physiological investigations of TSD have clarified the roles of steroid hormones, various enzymes, and H-Y antigen in sexual differentiation, whereas molecular studies have identified several plausible candidates for sex-determining genes in species with TSD. This area of research promises to elucidate the mechanism of TSD in reptiles and will have obvious implications for understanding the basis of sex determination in other vertebrates. Experimental and comparative investigations of the potential adaptive significance of TSD appear equally promising, although much work remains to be performed. The distribution of TSD within and among the major reptilian lineages may be related to the life span of individuals of a species and to the biogeography of these species. Answers to many of the questions and tests concerning TSD in reptiles would be facilitated by controlling the conditions of incubation, by standardizing the experimental design, and by depositing voucher specimens in accessible collections after completion of the study. Goals for future research are discussed.

AB  - The South Armorican Shear Zone (SASZ), in the French Armorican Variscan belt is a lithospheric wrench fault that acted during the Late Carboniferous as a transition zone between two distinct domains: a thickened domain to the south affected by extension and crustal magmatism, and a weakly thickened domain to the north subjected to dextral wrenching and crust- and mantle-derived magmatism. The Pontivy-Rostrenen complex is a composite intrusion emplaced along the SASZ. To the south, the complex is made of leucogranites whereas, to the north, monzogranites outcrop together with small intrusions of quartz monzodiorite. U-Pb dating of magmatic zircon by LA-ICP-MS reveal that most magmatic rocks were emplaced at ca. 315 Ma (between 316.7 +/- 2.5 Ma and 310.3 +/- 4.7 Ma), excepted a late leucogranitic intrusion that was emplaced at 304.7 +/- 2.7 Ma. The leucogranites (-4.8 < epsilon Nd (T) < 2.1; presence of Archean to Paleozoic inherited zircon) are strongly peraluminous (A/CNK>1.1) and formed by partial melting of metasediments and peraluminous orthogneisses. The monzogranite (-4.0 < epsilon Nd (T) < -3.2; scarce Paleozoic inherited zircon) is moderately peraluminous (1 <A/CNK< 1.3) and formed by partial melting of an oithogneiss with a probable metaluminous composition whereas the quartz monzodiorite (-3.2 < epsilon Nd (T) < -2.2; no inherited zircon) is metaluminous (0.7 < A/CNK < 1.1) and formed by partial melting of a metasomatized lithospheric mantle. The evolution of the magmas was controlled by fractional crystallization, magma mixing and/or peritectic mineral entrainment. At the scale of the Armorican Variscan belt, crustal partial melting, to the south of the SASZ, was triggered by lithospheric thinning and adiabatic decompression during extension. Conversely, to the north, asthenosphere upwelling during strike-slip deformation and subsequent slab tearing, as suggested by tomographic data, induced the melting of both the crust and the mantle fertilized during previous subduction events. This process is likely not exclusive to the Armorican Massif and may be applied to other regions in the Variscan belt, such as Iberia. (C) 2017 International Association for Gondwana Research.

TI  - INTERACTIVE SALT AND SEDIMENT EVOLUTION - SELF-CONSISTENT QUANTITATIVE MODELS
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
LA  - English
AB  - Assessment of the combined evolution of salt and surrounding sediments is one of the major problems in salt-dominated basins. A quantitative approach, guided by observations from seismic and/or well data, is presented. The modeled present-day shape of a salt structure is constrained by an inverse non-linear procedure which determines the parameters controlling the salt shape. The non-linear procedure guarantees the shape to be in close correspondence with the observed present-day salt shape. By introducing time dependence of each of the parameters controlling the salt shape, the procedure permits an assessment of an evolving salt shape with time. By letting sedimentary beds move around the developing salt structure, the influence of the uprising salt on the evolving bed geometries above and around the salt is depicted. As the predicted present-day bed geometries must also be in accord with the observed rim syncline bed geometries, additional constraints are put on the parameters controlling the dynamic evolution of the salt structure. The inverse procedure automatically determines, in a self-consistent way, resolution and sensitivity of all parameters in the quantitative model, and also of the dynamic evolution of both the salt and the surrounding sedimentary formations. The procedure handles symmetric and asymmetric two-dimensional structures as well as symmetric three-dimensional structures.
   Applications are given to two salt structures in the North Louisiana salt basin. The first structure is a tall diapir with clearly defined rim synclines. By varying the parameters in the non-linear inverse procedure, a consistent reproduction of the observed data is obtained on both sides of the asymmetric diapir. In addition, in the regions where absence of data is greatest, the consistent model provides a measure of the degree, extent and location of allowed salt overhang in order that the observed and predicted salt shapes are in accord. Therefore, the procedure produces a quantified measure of the salt stock stem width to overhang width and the locations of both.
   The second structure consists of two salt pillows. Here the quantitative model provides a consistent picture of the dynamic shaping of each mound in relation to their common rim syncline.
   A synthetic case exemplifies the capability of modeling the combined salt-sediment evolution with the constraint that the depositional surfaces through time are horizontal. The modeled self-consistent dynamical evolution then permits a better understanding of evolving stress-strain, thermal focusing and hydrocarbon entrapment to be realized.

AB  - The formation and evolution of high-temperature aerosols during fixed bed combustion of wood pellets in a realistic combustion environment were investigated through spatially resolved experiments. The purpose of this work was to investigate the various stages of aerosol formation from the hot flame zone to the flue gas channel. The investigation is important both for elucidation of the formation mechanisms and as a basis for development and validation of particle formation models that can be used for design optimization. Experiments were conducted in an 8-kW-updraft fired-wood-pellets combustor. Particle samples were withdrawn from the centerline of the combustor through 10 sampling ports by a rapid dilution sampling probe. The corresponding temperatures at the sampling positions were in the range 200-1450 degrees C. The particle sample was size-segregated in a low-pressure impactor, allowing physical and chemical resolution of the fine particles. The chemical composition of the particles was investigated by SEM/EDS and XRD analysis. Furthermore, the experimental results were compared to theoretical models for aerosol formation processes. The experimental data show that the particle size distribution has two peaks, both of which are below an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mu m (PM2.5). The mode diameters of the fine and coarse modes in the PM2.5 region were similar to 0.1 and similar to 0.8 mu m, respectively. The shape of the particle size distribution function continuously changes with position in the reactor due to several mechanisms. Early, in the flame zone, both the fine mode and the coarse mode in the PM2.5 region were dominated by particles from incomplete combustion, indicated by a significant amount of carbon in the particles. The particle concentrations of both the fine and the coarse mode decrease rapidly in the hot oxygen-rich flame due to oxidation of the carbon-rich particles. After the hot flame, the fine mode concentration and particle diameter increase gradually when the temperature of the flue gas drops. The main contribution to this comes from condensation on preexisting particles in the gas of alkali sulfates, alkali chlorides, and Zn species formed from constituents vaporized in the fuel bed. The alkali sulfates were found to condense at a temperature of similar to 950 degrees C and alkali chlorides condensed later at similar to 600 degrees C. This agrees well with results of chemical equilibrium calculation of the gas-to-particle conversion temperature. After the hot flame the coarse mode concentration decreased very little when the flue gas was cooled. In addition to carbon, the coarse mode consists of refractory metals and also considerable amounts of alkali. (c) 2006 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Spatial genetic structure (SGS) is important to a population's ability to adapt to environmental change. For species that reproduce both sexually and asexually, the relative contribution of each reproductive mode has important ecological and evolutionary implications because asexual reproduction can have a strong effect on SGS. Reef-building corals reproduce sexually, but many species also propagate asexually under certain conditions. To understand SGS and the relative importance of reproductive mode across environmental gradients, we evaluated genetic relatedness in almost 600 colonies of Montipora capitata across 30 environmentally characterized sites in KaneModified Letter Turned Commaohe Bay, OModified Letter Turned Commaahu, Hawaii, using low-depth restriction digest-associated sequencing. Clonal colonies were relatively rare overall but influenced SGS. Clones were located significantly closer to one another spatially than average colonies and were more frequent on sites where wave energy was relatively high, suggesting a strong role of mechanical breakage in their formation. Excluding clones, we found no evidence of isolation by distance within sites or across the bay. Several environmental characteristics were significant predictors of the underlying genetic variation (including degree heating weeks, time spent above 30 degrees C, depth, sedimentation rate and wave height); however, they only explained 5% of this genetic variation. Our results show that asexual fragmentation contributes to the ecology of branching corals at local scales and that genetic diversity is maintained despite strong environmental gradients in a highly impacted ecosystem, suggesting potential for broad adaptation or acclimatization in this population.

AB  - This study investigates the spatio-temporal changes in maize yield under projected climate and identified the potential adaptation measures to reduce the negative impact. Future climate data derived from 30 general circulation models were used to assess the impact of future climate on yield in 16 major maize growing districts of India. DSSAT model was used to simulate maize yield and evaluate adaptation strategies during mid (2040-69) and end-centuries (207099) under RCP 4.5 and 8.5. Genetic coefficients were calibrated and validated for each of the study locations. The projected climate indicated a substantial increase in mean seasonal maximum (0.9-6.0 degrees C) and minimum temperatures (1.1-6.1 degrees C) in the future (the range denotes the lowest and highest change during all the four future scenarios). Without adaptation strategies, climate change could reduce maize yield in the range of 16% (Tumkur) to 46% (Jalandhar) under RCP 4.5 and 21% (Tumkur) to 80% (Jalandhar) under RCP 8.5. Only at Dharwad, the yield could remain slightly higher or the same compared to the baseline period (1980-2009). Six adaptation strategies were evaluated (delayed sowing, increase in fertilizer dose, supplemental irrigation, and their combinations) in which a combination of those was found to be effective in majority of the districts. District-specific adaptation strategies were identified for each of the future scenarios. The findings of this study will enable in planning adaptation strategies to minimize the negative impact of projected climate in major maize growing districts of India.

AB  - Combined heat and power economic emission dispatch (CHPEED) can obtain good economic and environmental benefits, but the dispatch problem presents non-convex, nonlinear, multi-constrained and multi-objective characteristics. Thus, a two-stage cooperative multi-objective differential evolutionary algorithm (TCADEA) is proposed in this paper. The algorithm uses a two-stage framework: the first stage uses a two-population strategy to divide the population into an elite population and an ordinary population, where the elite population is used to obtain better target values and the ordinary population is used to search the target space to ensure the diversity of the population and update the two populations by different adaptive differential operators. In addition, the epsilon constraint processing technique is used to handle the constraints. The second stage combines two populations into one and generates offspring through the constrained dominance principle (CDP) and adaptive differential evolution to maintain well-distributed population. The actual case results show that the TCADEA algorithm reduces $0.034 x 10(6), $0.008 x 10(6), $0.07 x 10(6) and 113 x 10(5) lb, 102 x 10(5) lb, 155 x 10(5) lb in fuel cost and emissions compared to MODE, NSGA-II, and TOP, respectively.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to explore the effect of automatic transmission fluid (ATF) temperature on the dynamic friction-wear properties of the friction component in a wet multi-disc clutch during the running-in process. Design/methodology/approach The running-in evolution was explored in terms of global friction performance and instantaneous friction characteristics. The variation of friction torque of the initial 300 engagement cycles was obtained by wet-clutch tests. Finally, an optical microscope was used to detect the wear mechanism of friction surfaces. Findings The ATF temperature showed a significant effect on the friction-wear performance in the clutch running-in process. The mean coefficient of friction decreased with the increase of the ATF temperature and decreased rapidly in the approximately initial 60 clutch engagements. The higher the ATF temperature was, the thinner the ATF film was, and more asperity summits were cut, thus leading to a smoother surface. Considering the slightly instantaneous friction fluctuation and the wear performance, a proper ATF temperature is necessary. Originality/value The results provide theoretical guidance for selecting the optimal ATF temperature during the running-in process.

AB  - Nickel-based superalloys belong to a special class of high-performance alloys that feature large amounts of nickel. The uniqueness of superalloys lies in their design features, most notably mechanical strength, durability, etc. Inconel 718 (IN718) is a nickel-based superalloy that exhibits high tensile and impact-resistant properties, along with good high-temperature corrosion resistance. Selective Laser Melting (SLM) is additive manufacturing (AM) technology aimed at melting and fusing metal powders using high power density lasers to produce precision functional parts. The accuracy and functional characteristics of manufactured parts are highly dependent on process parameters. The processing parameters that control the SLM process comprise laser power (P), hatch spacing (HS), exposure time (t), and border power (BP). This work primarily focuses on finding the combined effect of these process parameters on the surface roughness (SR) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of IN718 manufactured by SLM using the design of experiments (DOE).

AB  - This study presents an assessment of seasonal variation of biochemical traits for twenty one eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) hybrids. Data of five traits, ascorbic acid, total sugar, total anthocyanin, total phenolics content and total antioxidant capacity were recorded in kharif (August 2017- February 2018) and summer (February 2018 - June 2018) season and analyzed using univariate (ANOVA) and multivariate (PCA) analysis . Seasonal variations influenced expression of all traits, but the ranking of hybrids for total phenolics and anthocyanin content was very consistent between seasons. The highest phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid and antioxidant capacity was observed during summer months, when monthly average temperature was highest of the year. Total antioxidant capacity of the hybrids varied from 3.42 to 9.77 mu mol trolox equivalent/g in summer season, which is a 2.9 fold difference and total phenolic contents ranging from 18.63 to 40.38 mg/100 g, a 2.2 fold difference. Overall results indicate that in future breeding program of H8 (Muktakeshi x Swarna Mani), all the five traits are important for primary selection under high temperature stress. H16 (BRBL-02 x BRBL-04) has potential for improvement of traits like, total phenolics content and total antioxidant capacity under high and low temper-ature conditions.

AB  - Ants are highly diverse social insects living in colonies consisted of up to millions of individuals with reproductive division of labors. Due to the interests in disclosing the genetic and epigenetic regulation mechanisms underlying the distinct developmental trajectories between castes and division of labor in colonies, many ant species have recently been established as laboratory models for evolutionary development and social behavior studies. These functional studies often request a precise quantification of the relative gene expression level, which relies on a stably expressed reference genes for normalization. A core set of reliable reference genes for this purpose however has not been established yet in ants. In the present study, we tested the expression patterns and amplification efficiencies of 12 abundantly expressed candidate genes in Monomorium pharaonis, one of the few ant species that are suitable for laboratory rearing and experimentation. We quantified the expression levels of these genes by RT-qPCR in seven different conditions: embryo development, sexual development, worker development, adult phenotypes, tissues, and two abiotic manipulative treatments in pharaoh ant. Finally, five genes, elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1A), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), TATA-box-binding protein (TATA), tubulin gamma-2 chain-like (TBLg2), heat shock protein 67B2-like (HSP67) were found to be the most stable reference genes across seven conditions. We also identified the most stable reference genes applicable for each distinct condition and the optimal number of reference genes entailed were evaluated. Our study validates reliable reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis which lays the foundation for future studies in pharaoh ant.

AB  - Indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers leads to soil environmental disbalance and therefore, preparation and application of environment-friendly slow-release multifunctional fertilizers are of paramount importance for sustainable crop production in the present scenario. In this study, we propose a slow-release multifunctional composite nitrogen (N) fertilizer, which possesses the ability to supply plant accessible N in the form of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) to improve nitrate assimilation coupled with zinc (Zn, a major micronutrient for plants in the soil) after its degradation. For this purpose, NO3--intercalated zinc-aluminum (Zn-Al) layered double hydroxide (LDH) was synthesized using a co-precipitation protocol. The prepared LDH was added as 25.45% of total polymer weight to a sodium carboxymethyl cellulose/hydroxyethyl cellulose citric acid (NaCMC/HEC-CA) biodegradable hydrogel. A. brasilense, commonly used nitrogen-fixing bacteria in soils, was added to the LDH-hydrogel composite along with LDH alone to augment the availability of NH4+ and NO3-. Adjusting the pH under acidic (pH 5.25) and neutral (pH 7) conditions, the release pattern of NO3- from LDH and the composite was monitored for 30 days at normal temperature. The pH was selected based on the soil analysis data of North East India. The LDH-composite released 90% (w/w) and 85.45% (w/w) of intercalated NO3- at pH 5.25 and 7.00 respectively in 30 days. However, 100% (w/w) and 87% (w/w) of intercalated NO3- at pH 5.25 and 7.00 respectively were released in 30 days when only LDH was applied, which indicated the lower performance of LDH alone in comparison to the LDH-composite for the nitrate holding pattern. The pH of the bacteria-loaded system was observed to be acidic (pH = 5-6) during the study of nitrate assimilation and Zn2+ release. A. brasilense improved nitrate assimilation and increased the NH4+ ion concentration in the studied system. A significant increase in Zn2+ release was observed from day 5 in the presence of A. brasilense in the LDH-composite compared with that in the absence of A. brasilense. In conclusion, the prepared LDH-hydrogel-A. brasilense composite fertilizer system increases the availability of plant accessible N form (both NO3- and NH4+) and can potentially improve soil fertility with the addition of Zn and bacteria to the soil in the extended course.

AB  - Water temperatu r e is an important modulator of variation of phenotype in poikilothermic fish and therefore of body shape. The present study explores the phenotypic response of commercial O. mykiss parr when they are subjected to rearing temperatures of 8 degrees and 16 degrees C under controlled conditions with the aim of demonstrating , with the use of Landmark-Based Geometric Morphometrics, the influence of rearing temperature on body shape. O. mykiss males and neomales from eggs to parr stages, belonging to the same family and strain, were reared at different temperatures (8 degrees C and 16 degrees C) and grouped according to: Group 16 degrees C/neomales (n = 15), Group 16 degrees C/ males (n = 15), Group 8 degrees C/neomales (n = 15) and Group 8 degrees C/males (n = 15). Differences in body shape among sex and rearing temperatures were examined by geometric morphometrics and traditional morphometry. At 16 weeks, geometric morphometric analysis revealed a dimorphism, which was not detected by traditional morphome t r y , mainly in the dorsal and caudal fin area. This dimorphism was not observed in neomales. This difference may be the product of the potential for phenotypic plasticity and adaptation to genetically controlled environmental and local fluctuations, which affects to indicators of adaptation in unfavorable environmental conditions such a biomechanical action of swimming and propulsion. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the differential effect of 8 degrees and 16 degrees C water temperature on lateral body shape in male O. mykiss parr during the early stages of body development and in controlled conditions.

AB  - We propose to analyze the direct effect of climate change on the agricultural production of irrigated and non-irrigated plants, in the short and long term, in Tunisia. The methodological is based on the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model. The originality of this method is that it allows time dynamics to be taken into account in the explanation of a variable, thus improving forecasts and economic policies to be implemented in the short and long term. To this end, we used a highly disaggregated database describing the evolution of average temperature, rainfall, fertilizer, agricultural labor and the surface area of each plant in Tunisia over a long period, from 1984 to 2019.The results found reveal that, in the long term, there is a strong positive correlation between cereal production and rainfall in the governorates of North-West Tunisia. Contrary to the results found by the cereal crop, our results show that the average temperature has a positive effect on vegetable production. They also show that rainfall generally has a greater effect on vegetable and cereal production in the long term than in the short term. Our results also show that long term fruit production shows remarkable declines in the most fruit-producing governorates following an increase in rainfall and fertilizers, while an increase in production has taken place following an increase in labor force and agricultural area.

AB  - Genetic differentiation has been observed in marine species even when no obvious barriers to gene flow exist, and understanding such differentiation is essential for effective fisheries management. Highly differentiated outlier loci can provide information on how genetic variation might not only contribute to local adaptation but may also be affected by historical demographic events. A locus which aligned to a predicted zona pellucida sperm-binding protein 3 gene (ZP3) in Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) was previously identified as the highest outlier based on F-ST in a RADseq study of Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) across the West Coast of North America. However, because of the limited length of the RAD sequence and restricted geographic area of sampling, no conclusion on the functional significance of the observed variation was possible. In other marine species, ZP3 is involved in reproductive isolation, local adaptation, and has neofunctionalized as an antifreeze gene, and so it may provide important insights in functional population structure of Pacific cod. Here, we sequenced a 544-bp region of ZP3 in 230 Pacific cod collected from throughout their geographic range. We observed striking patterns of spatial structuring of ZP3 haplotypes, with a sharp break near Kodiak, Alaska, USA where populations within similar to 200 km of each other are nearly fixed for different haplotypes, contrasting a pattern of isolation by distance at other genetic markers in this region (F-ST = 0.003). Phylogenetic analysis of ZP3 haplotypes revealed that the more southern haplotypes appear to be ancestral, with the northern haplotype evolving more recently, potentially in response to a novel selective pressure as Pacific cod recolonized northern latitudes after glaciation. The sharp break in haplotype frequencies suggests strong selective pressures are operating on small spatial scales and illustrates that selection can create high divergence even in marine species with ample opportunities for gene flow.

AB  - Encapsulation is an effective strategy to prevent probiotics from environmental damages. The survivability of Lactobacillus is generally reduced under frozen or acid environments. In this study, an attempt was made to encapsulate Lactobacillus into the egg yolk aggregates formed upon freezing. Lactobacillus broth was mixed with liquid egg yolk and frozen at selected temperatures and time periods. After thawing, the number of surviving bacteria was determined. The results showed that freezing with the addition of egg yolk improved Lactobacillus survivability. It was confirmed that freezing increased the number of egg yolk aggregates, and those aggregates coated Lactobacillus after freezing. The encapsulated Lactobacillus was treated at pH 2.5 for 10 min, and the results showed that the encapsulation process increased the acid resistance of Lactobacillus. These results indicate that freezing-induced encapsulation with egg yolk could effectively protect Lactobacillus against freezing and acid treatment. This finding could be useful for the design and preservation of probiotics-based food products.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein is considered as a potential indicator of animal adaptation to harsh environmental stresses and its expression has been correlated with resistance to stress. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the seasonal variation in heat shock proteins (hsp70 and hsp90) and their association with frozen semen quality and fertility in buffaloes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During summer and winter, ejaculates (n = 32) were collected from buffalo bulls, diluted with freshly prepared Andromed extender (maintained at 34 degrees C) up to 80 million sperm per mL. The diluted semen was filled in French midi straws, equilibrated, and cryopreserved. The semen was evaluated at pre-freeze and post-thaw stages for heat shock proteins (HSP70 and HSP90), and sperm quality parameters. RESULTS: The levels of HSP70 were significantly (P = 0.00) higher in summer season compared to winter season. The HSP70 had a positive correlation with mass motility (P < 0.05; r = 0.39), live sperm count (P < 0.05; r = 0.47), and acrosomal integrity (P < 0.05; r = 0.37). The first artificial insemination conception rate (FAICR) had a positive correlation with HSP70 (P < 0.05; r = 0.47), and HSP90 (P < 0.05; r = 0.59), in frozen-thawed semen. CONCLUSION: The assessment of the levels of heat shock proteins may help in predicting cryo-tolerance and fertility of buffalo semen during various seasons.

AB  - Climatic changes are posing serious threats to crop production and food insecurity across the globe. This study explores the dynamic relationship between changing annual temperature and production of major crops such as wheat, rice, bajra, jowar, maize, barley, gram, sugar cane, mastered oil, and cotton in Pakistan from 2000 to 2019 through an eclectic production model. The estimated result of panel econometric analysis revealed a significant negative effect of rising temperature on selected crop production in the long run with an insignificant impact in the short run. Among other explanatory variables, the area under cultivation and fertilizer input have significant positive effects in both the long run and the short run. Improved quality seeds revealed insignificant effects and urging authorities to enhance quality research to develop climate change resilient crops. This study urges Pakistan to improve agriculture technology along with adopting other greenhouse gas mitigation, such as forestation and clean energy, and water conservation policies.

AB  - 1. Insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) serve a role in both desiccation resistance and sexual attractiveness. These two functions are thought to be maximised by different CHC compositions, which should lead to local adaptation between populations experiencing different natural and sexual selection pressures. 2. The Pacific field cricket (Teleogryllus oceanicus) is distributed throughout Oceania, including the Hawaiian and Cook Islands. In Hawaii, these crickets face strong natural selection from a parasitoid fly that has promoted the evolution of a novel male reproductive morph, dramatically altering sexual selection in the Hawaiian populations. The parasitoid and male polymorphism do not occur in the Cook Islands. 3. We captured male and female T. oceanicus on two Hawaiian Islands and three Cook Islands, and quantified their CHCs. We also measured temperature and RH at our collection sites to test for associations with cricket CHC profiles. 4. We discovered significant sexual dimorphism in CHC profiles, as well as differences between both island chains and particular islands. The two male reproductive morphs in Hawaii showed distinct CHC expression. There were no associations between weather variables and CHC profiles. 5. Observed differences in T. oceanicus CHC profiles appear to reflect geographic isolation rather than selection in response to local and environmental and social conditions.

AB  - The oxidation of ammonia is a key reaction for the production of artificial fertilizers and for environmental protection. Depending on the area of application, the catalytic reaction needs to be tuned toward the production of either N-2 or NOx and this selectivity is controlled by temperature, pressure, reactant ratio, and the type of catalyst. PtRh alloys are highly useful catalytic materials for the oxidation of ammonia, and they can be employed at different reaction conditions. In contrast to pure Pt and Rh catalysts, for which a large number of studies of ammonia oxidation reaction mechanism are available, for PtRh alloys, direct spectroscopic evidence for structure-performance relationship is still lacking. To understand the behavior of PtRh alloys, namely, what is their active phase under reaction conditions and how the alloy composition leads to a particular product distribution, we study the oxidation of ammonia over PtRh/Pt(111) surfaces by simultaneous operando ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and mass spectrometry at 1 mbar total reaction pressure. These data are complemented by a catalyst surface characterization by scanning tunneling microscopy in ultrahigh vacuum. We establish that the predominant surface structure during NH3 oxidation strongly depends on the degree of Pt enrichment and the O-2/NH3 mixing ratio. At the nanoscale, the selectivity toward N-2 or NO production is driven by the surface populations of N and O species. These, in turn, are controlled by the nature of the alloying of Pt with Rh.

AB  - Distinguishing neutral and adaptive genetic variation is one of the main challenges in investigating processes shaping population structure in the wild, and landscape genomics can help identify signatures of adaptation to contrasting environments. Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) is an anadromous salmonid and the most harvested fish species by Inuit people, including in Nunavik (Quebec, Canada), one of the most recently deglaciated regions in the world. Unlike many other anadromous salmonids, Arctic Char occupy coastal habitats near their natal rivers during their short marine phase restricted to the summer ice-free period. Our main objective was to document putatively neutral and adaptive genomic variation in anadromous Arctic Char populations from Nunavik and bordering regions to inform local fisheries management. We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to genotype 18,112 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 650 individuals from 23 sampling locations along >2000 km of coastline. Our results reveal a hierarchical genetic structure, whereby neighboring hydrographic systems harbor distinct populations grouped by major oceanographic basins: Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Ungava Bay, and Labrador Sea. We found genetic diversity and differentiation to be consistent both with the expected postglacial recolonization history and with patterns of isolation-by-distance reflecting contemporary gene flow. Results from three gene-environment association methods supported the hypothesis of local adaptation to both freshwater and marine environments (strongest associations with sea surface and air temperatures during summer and salinity). Our results support a fisheries management strategy at a regional scale, and other implications for hatchery projects and adaptation to climate change are discussed.

AB  - Since the phasing out and eventual ban on the production of organohalogen flame retardants, the use of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) has increased rapidly. This has led to the detection of OPFRs in various environments including the Arctic. Two of the most prevalent OPFRs found in the Arctic are tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCPP), and 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP). The impacts of exposure to OPFRs on Arctic organisms is poorly understood. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of exposure to TCPP, EHDPP, and a mixture of OPFRs on gene expression patterns in Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. Precision-cut liver slices from Atlantic cod in vitro were exposed to either TCPP or EHDPP alone or in a mixture and sampled at 2 different time points to quantify gene expression patterns using RNA sequencing. We exposed the liver slices to 2 concentrations of TCPP and EHDPP, one of which was chosen based on the levels found in the Arctic environment. The RNA sequencing results demonstrated differential expression of hundreds of genes in response to exposure. The genes representing cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism pathway were significantly enriched in all the treatment groups. Almost all the cholesterol biosynthesis genes were significantly down-regulated in response to OPFR exposure. The effects on these pathways could involve various physiological processes including reproduction, growth, and behavior as well as adaptation to changing temperatures. Membrane fluidity is an important adaptive mechanism among aquatic organisms. Altered cholesterol homeostasis could have long-term consequences by altering the adaptive potential of aquatic organisms to changing water temperatures, particularly those living in polar environments. These results suggest that OPFRs could have unique effects on the organisms living in the Arctic compared with other environments. Further studies are needed to understand the long-term impacts of exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations using laboratory and field-based studies. Environ Toxicol Chem 2021;00:1-10.

AB  - The study was carried out to investigate the manufacturing possibility of Silicon Carbide (SiC) by direct Powder Bed Selective Laser Processing (PBSLP) experimentally and numerically. The experimental study was carried out by means of PBSLP while the numerical study was accomplished by developing a CFD model. The CFD model simulates accurately realistic conditions of the PBSLP process. A user-defined code, that describes the process parameters such as laser power, scanning speed, scanning strategies, and hatching distance has been developed and compiled to ANSYS FLUENT 2020 R1. Also, the model was validated with the available published data from the literature. The model was used to deeply analyse and support the results obtained through the experimental runs. Different values of laser power and scanning speeds with scanning strategy in the form of a continuous linear pattern and rotated by 90 degrees between layers were studied. The laser power is ranging from 52W to 235 W while the scanning speed is ranging from 300 to 3900 mm s(-1). The results showed that the direct PBSLP of SiC is possible with the optimization of the process parameters. Layer thickness and hatching distance are the most important parameters that needed to be optimized. Also, the laser power and scanning speed needed to be adjusted so that the scanning temperature was between the sintering and the decomposition limits. The good agreement between experimental and simulation results proved the power and ability of the developed CFD model to be a useful tool to analyse and optimize future experimental data.

AB  - Land supplies multiple goods and services vital to humans and the environment. In the last decades, increasing evidence of growing land degradation are made apparent. A limited and depleting resource base, the reliance on climate-sensitive sectors and its large population, make South Asia highly vulnerable to climate change. Observed changes in climate include increases in temperature and increased monsoon variability and rainfall pattern leading to drought and flooding. Projected changes include increasing temperatures, rising sea levels, increasing cyclonic activity and higher variability of rainfall, all having enormous impacts on farming communities. At the same time, the region is rich in traditional agricultural knowledge (TAK), specialized in managing local agroecosystems to ensure food availability, tackling climatic risks and other ecological uncertainties. Particularly relevant is TAK related to land management to preserve soil fertility and avoid soil erosion. Ethnographic research is a valuable source of TAK, although this is rarely analysed with a climate change perspective. Based on a qualitative systematic review, and an expert's on-line survey, in this paper we review land management TAK and assess its potential for climate change adaptation. The review shows there is a vast amount of untapped TAK ethnographic research with potential for climate change adaptation.

TI  - Unconventional Transverse Transport above and below the Magnetic Transition Temperature in Weyl Semimetal EuCd2As2
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
LA  - English
AB  - As exemplified by the growing interest in the quantum anomalous Hall effect, the research on topology as an organizing principle of quantum matter is greatly enriched from the interplay with magnetism. In this vein, we present a combined electrical and thermoelectrical transport study on the magnetic Weyl semimetal EuCd2As2. Unconventional contribution to the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst effects were observed both above and below the magnetic transition temperature of EuCd2As2, indicating the existence of significant Berry curvature. EuCd2As2 represents a rare case in which this unconventional transverse transport emerges both above and below the magnetic transition temperature in the same material. The transport properties evolve with temperature and field in the antiferromagnetic phase in a different manner than in the paramagnetic phase, suggesting different mechanisms to their origin. Our results indicate EuCd2As2 is a fertile playground for investigating the interplay between magnetism and topology, and potentially a plethora of topologically nontrivial phases rooted in this interplay.

AB  - Aim Polyploids have been theorized to occur more frequently in environments that are subjected to severe conditions or sudden disruptions. Here we test the expectation that polyploid taxa occur more frequently in extreme or disrupted environments than their diploid counterparts, whether due to increased adaptive potential, environmental resilience or cross-ploidy competition.
   Location South America.
   Taxon All frog genera in the area with both polyploid and diploid member species (Ceratophrys, Chiasmocleis, Odontophrynus, Phyllomedusa and Pleurodema).
   Methods In all, 13,556 occurrence records of 82 frog species were collected from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Species distribution models, range overlap estimates, statistical tests and principal component analyses were used to estimate and compare environments between diploid and polyploid species within and across genera using several categorical and quantitative variables taken from multiple publicly available sources.
   Results Almost all polyploid occurrences are found within southeastern South America, largely to the exclusion of diploids. Polyploid species occur more closely with intergeneric polyploids than they do with congeneric diploids. Southeastern South America is more temperate, seasonal and less forested when compared to the tropical environments more commonly inhabited by diploids. The habitat ranges of polyploid species are subject to greater temperature fluctuations than diploid species. This region has also experienced major transformations in the modern era, owing to an agriculture boom over the last century. Polyploid occurrences are more likely to be found in areas with greater cropland usage, fertilizer application and pesticide application than diploids.
   Main Conclusions Across species, temperature seasonality was the only variable with strong statistical differences between diploids and polyploids. Greater annual fluctuations in temperature may lead to more established polyploid species due to reasons mentioned above; however, extreme temperature differences are also known to contribute to polyploid gamete formation, providing a possible non-selective explanation. Polyploid occurrences are also more likely to be found in areas of high agricultural impact, providing support for the hypothesis that polyploids are more resilient to environmental disruptions than diploids.

AB  - In this study, a new ecological dispatching model for cascade hydropower stations considering fish reproduction is proposed by adding the ecological flow demand for fish spawning to the scheduling target of cascade hydropower stations. The study was conducted in the middle reaches of Jinsha River basin where Liyuan-Ahai cascade hydropower stations are located. By sorting out and analysing the habits and demands of aquatic organisms in the river along with the river water temperature and incoming water conditions, the hydrological and water temperature conditions suitable for experimental ecological regulation of the cascade section of the Jinsha River were obtained. Liyuan-Ahai cascade reservoirs were selected to carry out experimental ecological regulation simulations under different inflow scenarios. This study provides scientific basis and reference for cascade hydropower station dispatching, which can help restoration of the environment and satisfy optimal social and economic benefits.

AB  - Rain-fed agriculture areas in Africa are experiencing heavy pressure from climatic changes and food insecurity risk. This paper aims to provide an integrated modeling framework to identify food-insecurity hotspots in African agricultural systems and potential effective adaptation strategies at a local scale. We use the integrated modeling framework to drive rain-fed maize simulation models with baseline and generated climatic data. Maize yields simulated with the current and doubling CO2 concentration are then compared to analyze the effect of CO2 fertilization. Incorporating two local adaptive strategies into crop modeling provided some insights on preferred types of adaptation in different areas. The results showed that rain-fed maize production is highly vulnerable to simulated global warming. Such impacts differed with different weather conditions. Climate change has greater impacts on the relatively arid area. The results of the effectiveness of adaptive strategies imply that adaptive strategies need to be tailored to the local and community level to buffer the yield reduction impacts of climate change effectively.

AB  - Environmental gradients are important factors that can potentially influence the genetic diversity and differentiation of populations. The present study examines the effect of environmental heterogeneity of the Hyrcanian forests on populations of Circaea lutetiana L. (Onagraceae). Using morphometrics, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of leaf epidermis, and molecular markers, we analyzed genetic diversity and differentiation among nine populations from environmentally divergent habitats. Three different gene pools were observed. Our results indicate that the genetic structure is significantly correlated to environmental factors, but not to the geographical distance. Genetic clustering in C. lutetiana is affected by temperature, humidity, elevation, and average annual rainfall. Overall, our data indicate that gene flow does not contribute to explaining spatial patterns of genetic structure and the adaptation to the environment is the main factor shaping the genetic structure of the C. lutetiana populations. The populations belonging to each of the three gene pools have similarities in microclimate parameters, despite their geographical proximity, and populations from the same genetic pool can be up to 470 km apart. This evidence, as well as morphological and genetic similarities of the populations with greater geographical distance, suggest the possibility of cryptic speciation in this species.

AB  - The Xolapa Complex (XC) is a high-grade metamorphic belt exposed along the southern margin of the North American plate in Mexico. Its evolution includes an episode of widespread anatexis related to crustal thickening and subsequent uplift to upper crustal levels, which culminated in the Paleocene. On the basis of field and petrographic work, this study integrates a petrological modelling approach with LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon and monazite geochronology to elucidate the tectonothermal evolution of this metamorphic belt. The study area in central XC includes a suite of alternating migmatitic paragneiss and garnet-bearing mafic schist. Petrological evidence and phase equilibria calculations demonstrate that a staurolite-kyanite grade metamorphism occurred at-640-670 degrees C and 8-9 kbar before extensive migmatization took place. Differential anatexis of fertile and refractory layers occurred progressively via biotite and amphibole dehydration-melting reactions, and continued during peak metamorphism at granulite-facies conditions of-800-820 degrees C and-5-7 kbar. According to Ti-in-zircon thermometry, melt generation/mobilization progressed during cooling until crystallize at-700 degrees C. The age of pro grade metamorphism was likely recorded by monazite cores that give midto Late Cretaceous ages. Cooling and melt crystallization could be constrained by leucosome zircon dated at 61.80.6 Ma. Both zircon and low-Y monazite from whole rock and melanosome portions, respectively, are consistent with an episode of growth around 60.9 +/- 0.5 Ma. Monazite, however, would have continued its crystallization process for a period of ca. 10 Ma. Thin zircon and high-Y monazite rims show ages between-34-25 Ma and are interpreted to reflect a stage of reheating by magmatic advection related to large Oligocene plutonism in the region. Age and nature of central XC basement show good correlation with other Early-Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary basins of central and southern Mexico. A period of crustal thickening would have buried the sequence at depths of-30 km, causing Barrovian-type metamorphism during midto Late Cretaceous time and eventually, anatexis that evolved at granulite-facies conditions during orogenic collapse in the Paleocene (>= 62 Ma). The time span from leucosome crystallization to late-stage reheating in central XC would imply a protracted high-temperature evolution indicating a middleto upper-crustal residence time of at least ca. 30 Ma.

AB  - Turtles are iconic reptiles that inhabit a range of ecosystems from oceans to deserts and climates from the tropics to northern temperate regions. Yet, we have little understanding of the genetic adaptations that allow turtles to survive and reproduce in such diverse environments. Common snapping turtles, Chelydra serpentina, are an ideal model species for studying adaptation to climate because they are widely distributed from tropical to northern temperate zones in North America. They are also easy to maintain and breed in captivity and produce large clutch sizes, which makes them amenable to quantitative genetic and molecular genetic studies of traits like temperature-dependent sex determination. We therefore established a captive breeding colony and sequenced DNA from one female using both short and long reads. After trimming and filtering, we had 209.51Gb of Illumina reads, 25.72Gb of PacBio reads, and 21.72 Gb of Nanopore reads. The assembled genome was 2.258 Gb in size and had 13,224 scaffolds with an N50 of 5.59Mb. The longest scaffold was 27.24Mb. BUSCO analysis revealed 97.4% of core vertebrate genes in the genome. We identified 3.27 million SNPs in the reference turtle, which indicates a relatively high level of individual heterozygosity. We assembled the transcriptome using RNA-Seq data and used gene prediction software to produce 22,812 models of protein coding genes. The quality and contiguity of the snapping turtle genome is similar to or better than most published reptile genomes. The genome and genetic variants identified here provide a foundation for future studies of adaptation to climate.

AB  - Living organisms have adapted to environmental oscillations in light and temperature through evolving biological clocks. Biological rhythms are pervasive at all levels of the endocrine system, including the somatotropic (growth) axis. The objective of the present research was to study the existence of daily rhythms on the somatotropic axis of a marine teleost species, specifically, the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). Larvae of S. aurata at 30 dph (days post hatching), kept under a 9 L:15D (light-dark) photoperiod, were collected every 3 h throughout a 36 h cycle. The expression of the following somatotropic axis genes was analyzed by quantitative PCR: pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 1 (adcyap1), prepro-somatostatin-1 (pss1), growth hormone (gh), growth hormone receptor types 1 and 2 (ghr1 and ghr2, respectively), insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf1) and igf1 receptor a (igf1ra). All genes displayed significant differences among time points and, with the exception of adcyap1, all showed statistically significant daily rhythms. The acrophases of gh, ghr1, ghr2, igf1 and igf1ra were located around the end of the dark phase, between ZT19:44 and ZT0:48 h, whereas the highest expression levels of adcyap1 occurred at ZT18 h. On the other hand, the acrophase of pss1, an inhibitor of Gh secretion, was located at ZT10:16 h, hence it was shifted by several hours with respect to the other genes. The present results provide the first thorough description of somatotropic axis rhythms in gilthead sea bream. Such knowledge provides insights into the role of rhythmic regulation of the Gh/Igf1 axis system in larval growth and metabolism, and it can also improve the implementation of more species-specific feeding regimes.

AB  - In this work, we show that selective laser melting (SLM), apart from producing complex structures, can also act as a metallurgical method to modify the Ni/Ti ratio of NiTi shape memory alloys, and thus providing a feasible approach to tailor the transformation temperatures and to modify the mechanical performance of NiTi alloys. NiTi samples were fabricated by SLM with a large variation of process parameters, e.g. scanning speed (v) from 400 to 1200 mm s(-1), hatch spacing (h) from 40 to 110 mu m and laser power (P) from 60 to 200 W. It is found that the martensite transformation temperature changes monotonously with the respective change of v, h or P. The composition analysis suggests that the different amount of Ni-loss under various SLM process conditions is the main reason for the evolution of transformation temperatures. Most importantly, good mechanical (total elongation > 10 %) and functional properties under tensile mode have been obtained despite of the large variation of SLM process parameters and the presence of extensive defects. The good tensile properties and tailorable phase transformation temperatures will provide great potential to make novel NiTi smart structures.

AB  - The role of meteorological factors in the transmission of the COVID-19 still needs to be determined. In this study, the daily new cases of the eight severely affected regions in four countries of South America and their corresponding meteorological data (average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average wind speed, visibility, absolute humidity) were collected. Daily number of confirmed and incubative cases, as well as time-dependent reproductive number (R-t) was calculated to indicate the transmission of the diseases in the population. Spearman's correlation coefficients were assessed to show the correlation between meteorological factors and daily confirmed cases, daily incubative cases, as well as Rt. In particular, the results showed that there was a highly significant correlation between daily incubative cases and absolute humidity throughout the selected regions. Multiple linear regression model further confirmed the negative correlation between absolute humidity and incubative cases. The absolute humidity is predicted to show a decreasing trend in the coming months from the meteorological data of recent three years. Our results suggest the necessity of continuous controlling policy in these areas and some other complementary strategies to mitigate the contagious rate of the COVID-19. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Polyploidy is pervasive in angiosperm evolution and plays important roles in adaptation and speciation. However, polyploid groups are understudied due to complex sequence homology, challenging genome assembly, and taxonomic complexity. Here, we study adaptive divergence in taxonomically complex eyebrights (Euphrasia), where recent divergence, phenotypic plasticity, and hybridization blur species boundaries. We focus on three closely related tetraploid species with contrasting ecological preferences that are sympatric on Fair Isle, a small isolated island in the British Isles. Using a common garden experiment, we show a genetic component to the morphological differences present between these species. Using whole-genome sequencing and a novel k-mer approach we call "Tetmer", we demonstrate that the species are of allopolyploid origin, with a sub-genome divergence of approximately 5%. Using -2 million SNPs, we show sub-genome homology across species, with a very low sequence divergence characteristic of recent speciation. This genetic variation is broadly structured by species, with clear divergence of Fair Isle heathland Euphrasia micrantha, while grassland Euphrasia erotica and coastal Euphrasia foulaensis are more closely related. Overall, we show that tetraploid Euphrasia is a system of allopolyploids of postglacial species divergence, where adaptation to novel environments may be conferred by old variants rearranged into new genetic lineages.

AB  - In this study, we assessed the possible impacts of climate variability and change on growth and performance of maize using multi-climate, multi-crop model approaches built on Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) protocols in five different agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Embu County in Kenya and under different management systems. Adaptation strategies were developed that are locally relevant by identifying a set of technologies that help to offset potential impacts of climate change on maize yields. Impacts and adaptation options were evaluated using projections by 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project-Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Two widely used crop simulation models, Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) and Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was used to simulate the potential impacts of climate change on maize. Results showed that 20 CMIP5 models are consistent in their projections of increased surface temperatures with different magnitude. Projections by HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC-ESM tend to be higher than the rest of 17 CMIP5 climate models under both emission scenarios. The projected increase in minimum temperature (Tmin) which ranged between 2.7 and 5.8 degrees C is higher than the increase in maximum temperature (Tmax) that varied between 2.2 and 4.8 degrees C by end century under RCP 8.5. Future projections in rainfall are less certain with high variability projections by GFDL-ESM2G, MIROC5, and NorESM1-M suggest 8 to 25% decline in rainfall, while CanESM2, IPSL-CM5A-MR and BNU-ESM suggested more than 85% increase in rainfall under RCP 8.5 by end of 21(st) century. Impacts of current and future climatic conditions on maize yields varied depending on the AEZs, soil type, crop management and climate change scenario. Impacts are largely negative in the low potential AEZs such as Lower Midlands (LM4 and LM5) compared with the high potential AEZs Upper Midlands (UM2 and UM3). However, impacts of climate change are largely positive across all AEZs and management conditions when CO2 fertilization is included. Using the differential impacts of climate change, a strategy to adapt maize cultivation to climate change in all the five AEZs was identified by consolidating those practices that contributed to increased yields under climate change. We consider this approach as more appropriate to identify operational adaptation strategies using readily available technologies that contribute positively under both current and future climatic conditions. This approach when adopted in strategic manner will also contribute to further strengthen the development of adaptation strategies at national and local levels. The methods and tools validated and applied in this assessment allowed estimating possible impacts of climate change and adaptation strategies which can provide valuable insights and guidance for adaptation planning.

AB  - A number of insects have been suggested to perform seasonal migration between low- and high-altitude areas. In these insects, support for the occurrence of migration mainly came from observations that focal insects disappeared from a certain range of altitudes but appeared at different altitudes with short time lags. In some insects, further support was obtained by mark-recapture studies, analyses of the seasonal change of age structure or reproductive conditions in individuals from different altitudes and studies on dormancy or temperature tolerance. Other means that can be used to assess the occurrence of altitudinal migration are briefly mentioned. Two types of migration, the dormancy-associated and dormancy-independent types, are discriminated. In the former type, insects usually breed in spring, migrate to high-altitude areas in late spring or early summer, usually for aestivation, and return to low-altitude areas in autumn. In this type, the same individuals perform upward and downward migration. In the latter type, insects also perform upward migration in late spring or early summer and downward migration in autumn, but they breed both in low- and high-altitude areas. The adaptive and evolutionary aspects of altitudinal migration are briefly mentioned.

AB  - The factors that control the fertility (e.g. capacity to form an ore deposits) of a magmatic system are still a matter of debate, requiring more studies on the evolution of ore-related magmas. This study presents a detailed reconstruction of the magmatic system forming the Stiavnica volcano, the biggest mineralized center of the Western Carpathians (Central Slovakia). The Stiavnica volcano represents an interesting study object because the magmatic system was sulfide-saturated during its entire evolution, and porphyry systems with contrasting Cu/Au ratio are present in the same volcano. This situation allows to study the impact of magmatic sulfide saturation on the Cu/Au ratio of porphyry deposits. Pressure, temperature, and the compositional evolution of pre-, syn-, and post-mineralization magmas were reconstructed based on the chemical composition of phenocrysts and hosted silicate melt inclusions and sulfide inclusions. Dominantly andesitic magmas forming the volcanic and intrusive rocks of the volcano were sourced from an upper crustal (similar to 1 to similar to 3 kbar) reservoir in which most phenoaysts grew from a sulfide-saturated dacitic to rhyolitic melt. This upper crustal magmatic reservoir was active during >3 My, and most ore-deposits, including Cu-Au porphyries, formed during cooling periods where the residual melt reached fluid saturation. In contrast, the Au-only porphyry deposit formed alter shallow emplacement (<1 km) of a hot magma that was produced by mixing between a magma derived from a lower crustal (>8 kbar) reservoir and one from the upper crustal reservoir. Inclusions of monosulfide solid solution were found in phenoaysts crystallizing over a large range of temperature and pressure in ore-related and barren magmas suggesting that sulfide saturation doesn't play a critical role on the fertility of the magmatic system. Finally, this study reveals that composition of the magmatic sulfides does not play a direct role in the Cu/Au ratio of the formed porphyry deposits. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study emphasizes the possible impact of coastal water quality on marine zooplankton community from six different sampling sites of south India (Kalpakkam, Nemmeli, Muttukadu, Kasimedu, Ennore and Kattupalli). Water Samples were collected in the sampling sites and physicochemical parameters were studied. The results showed significant variations in the concentration and distribution pattern of selected physicochemical parameters (temperatures, pH, salinity, DO, NO-3, NO-2, NH3, PO43- and SiO2) and heavy metals (Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, Fe, Mg, Co, and Cr). The concentration of nutrients and trace elements were reported high at site IV (Kasimedu) and low at site II (Nemmeli). Further, diversity indices showed maximum Shannon_H and Simpson_1-D indexes (H = 3.492; D = 0.966) at site IV (Kasimedu). Similarly, low diversity indices (H = 3.128; D = 0.9508) was registered at site II (Nemmeli) and site III (Muttukadu), indicating plankton population was attracted by high concentration of nutrients loads in the study areas. Finally, genotoxicity (genomic integrity) was assessed by DNA fragmentation and alkaline comet assay, which resulted in maximum genomic integrity loss for the sample collected from Kalpakkam (42.84 +/- 08.38), Ennore (41.44 +/- 06.59), and Kasimedu (39.5 +/- 09.68) sites. The results revealed that the maximum heavy metal concentration has impact on the zooplankton population as evidence from DNA fragmentation compared with that of freshly hatched out Artemia nauplii as control. Hence, the present investigation documents the alarming threat in coastal water quality which will have an impact on the zooplankton community in selected coastal zones.

AB  - Low oxygen and/or high carbon dioxide environments (hypoxic, anoxic or hypercarbic atmospheres) can cause a delay in insect development, the length of which depends on the exposure time, gas concentration, environmental factors, species, etc. Therefore, in this study, delay in development in 0-72 h old pupae of Cadra (=Ephestia) cautella was investigated by exposing them to two low oxygen (1% and 3%) atmospheres supplemented with high carbon dioxide (95% and 85%) balanced with nitrogen for 6-112 h at 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C and 65% relative humidity. Development-delaying effects of controlled or modified atmospheres (MA) were strongest at 20 degrees C, followed by 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The shortest exposure time at which delay in development was statistically meaningful was 24 h. Development-delaying effects of both MAs were of similar pattern. When compared to control groups, delay in development was in the range of 2.03-9.64 d at 20 degrees C, 0.19-3.72 d at 25 degrees C, and 0.02-2.77 d at 30 degrees C. Cadra cautella pupae, which were exposed to 1% oxygen with 95% carbon dioxide (balance with nitrogen) at 20 degrees C for 64 h, could still hatch 24 d after the treatment in comparison to control groups in which pupal eclosion was max. 16 d. Therefore in MAs applications, delay in development could be an important issue to consider for controlling stored-products pests, especially at lower temperatures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Understanding locomotor activity patterns would reveal key information about an animal's foraging strategy, energy budget and evolutionary adaptation. We studied the locomotor activity patterns of the takin (Budorcas taxicolor) in a temperate mountain region in China using GPS radio-collar technology from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015. Our research showed that takin had a bimodal crepuscular locomotor activity pattern, with an especially obvious movement peak at dusk. The takins showed significant seasonal differences in their movement rates, with the lowest movement rate in winter. The animals also showed sexual differences in their movement rates. In spring, the female movement rate was significantly higher than that of males during daytime, while during nighttime the movement rate of males was higher than that of females. The male movement rate was significantly higher than that of females in summer. The movement rate of the takins were correlated to microenvironment temperature and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in each season. These findings suggest that takin could adjust locomotor activity levels adapt to reproductive requirements, temperature variation and forage variability.

AB  - Purpose It is almost a common practice in Bangladesh to indiscriminately discharge effluent into the nearby wetlands, crop fields and water bodies. So, contamination occurs from water to food chain through soil and field crops. This study therefore assesses the impact of industrial effluent on water, soil and rice production taking Turag river bank as a case study, which located in the most thickly industrialized area of Bangladesh. Methods The descriptive and diagnostic research design was used in the present study. Eighty farmers were selected as respondents using proportionate stratified random sampling technique. The data were collected using an interview schedule. Impact of industrial effluent contamination was measured based on the extent of change that occurred in soil and water quality, level of insect infestation and, quantity and quality of rice before and after the establishment of industries. Similarly, water samples were collected to examine water quality parameters. Descriptive statistics such as frequency and percent, mean and standard deviation were used to describe and interpret the data, while paired t-test was used to test significant difference. Results The results revealed that the quality of water and soil, and quality and quantity of rice have differed significantly after the establishment of industries. Surface water was mostly affected (t-value 90.25). Almost all of the respondents (97.5%) stated that there was high insect infestation after the establishment of industries which negatively affects rice production. The water quality parameters test revealed that temperature, total dissolved salts, pH and salinity were within the acceptable limits, while electrical conductivity and heavy metals (Cd, Pb and Ni) were above the acceptable limits. The majority of respondents (77.6%) had favourable to highly favourable perception on the negative impact of industrial effluent contamination on rice production. The major problems faced due to the industrial effluent contamination were pollution, low fertility, increase attack of insect, dermal diseases and low yield. Conclusions The establishment of industries has quiet negatively altered soil, water and rice production as buttressed by the evidence based viewpoints of the respondents. Proper treatment of industrial effluent and implementation of environmental act would certainly help overcome the problem.

AB  - The central aim of evolutionary biology is to understand patterns of genetic variation between species and within populations. To quantify the genetic variation underlying intraspecific differences, estimating quantitative genetic parameters of traits is essential. In Pterygota, wing morphology is an important trait affecting flight ability. Moreover, gregarious parasitoids such as Nasonia vitripennis oviposit multiple eggs in the same host, and siblings thus share a common environment during their development. Here we estimate the genetic parameters of wing morphology in the outbred HVRx population of N. vitripennis, using a sire-dam model adapted to haplodiploids and disentangled additive genetic and host effects. The results show that the wing-size traits have low heritability (h(2) similar to 0.1), while most wing-shape traits have roughly twice the heritability compared with wing-size traits. However, the estimates increased to h(2) similar to 0.6 for wing-size traits when omitting the host effect from the statistical model, while no meaningful increases were observed for wing-shape traits. Overall, host effects contributed to similar to 50% of the variation in wing-size traits. This indicates that hosts have a large effect on wing-size traits, about fivefold more than genetics. Moreover, bivariate analyses were conducted to derive the genetic relationships among traits. Overall, we demonstrate the evolutionary potential for morphological traits in the N. vitripennis HVRx-outbred population, and report the host effects on wing morphology. Our findings can contribute to a further dissection of the genetics underlying wing morphology in N. vitripennis, with relevance for gregarious parasitoids and possibly other insects as well.

AB  - The evolution of the Volta potential of grade AA6063-T5 aluminum alloy microstructure with various intermetallic phases (IMP) during corrosion exposure to chloride-laden thin-film electrolytes at ambient temperature has been investigated, in situ and in real-time, using scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM), to gain insight into local corrosion processes. Trenching around micrometer-sized IMPs, de-alloying, oxidation, and the deposition of corrosion products were observed, which led to an inversion of the electrochemical nobility of the IMPs relative to the alloy matrix. Most of the IMPs showed cathodic Volta potentials (high nobility) relative to the matrix at 40%-80% relative humidity (RH), which became anodic (low nobility) when the surface was moistened with aqueous sodium chloride at elevated moisture (76%-87% RH) producing concentrations up to 5-6 M of chloride. The change of the Volta potential correlated with the onset and progress of corrosion and a nobility inversion of IMPs relative to the alloy matrix was observed. The corrosion behavior and the reasons for galvanic activities among microstructural constituents were elucidated and brought into a broader context to understanding localized corrosion.

AB  - Larvae of Leptus hringuri parasitizing families (adult female + offspring) of the treehopper Alchisme grossa on two host-plants, Brugmansia suaveolens (BS) and Solanum ursinum (SU), were studied. The effect of microenvironmental abiotic conditions (luminosity, temperature and relative humidity) and biotic conditions (distance from the soil to a treehopper host and host-plant phenological stage) on this tritrophic interaction was examined. Overall, the results suggest i) intensity of mite infestation (mean number of mites per infested female or family) of treehoppers (insect hosts) was twice on SU than on BS, ii) a preference of L. hringuri larvae for places with more luminosity (on both host-plants) and relative humidity (on SU), iii) a negative correlation between larval infestation and distance of the host colony to the ground, and iv) that larvae of L. hringuri could detect cues (i.e. chemical) emitted by their insect hosts or the host-plant of the insect host. Results indicate that luminosity, humidity and distance to the ground of the insect-host microenvironment affect both parasitization and prevalence of Leptus larvae mites; however, further research will be needed to understand the ecological mechanisms and consequences of these interactions and to test the hypotheses proposed herein under a chemical ecology perspective.

AB  - The invasive mussel Xenostrobus securis was first recorded from Galicia (NW Spain) in 2007, within an area characterized by the commercial culture of Mytilus galloprovincialis. This study investigated the spatial variability in reproduction of X. securis at three adjacent locations over a period of twelve months and the temporal variation at one location over two consecutive years. This is the first such study conducted outside its native range and in which the influences of temperature and salinity on the reproductive cycle were also tested. The invader exhibited rapid gametogenesis, accumulation of mature gametes and an extended spawning period interspersed with gonad recovery, without resting periods. The onset of gametogenesis varied both spatial and temporally, starting 15-days later at the innermost location than at the outermost one. Such spatial variability resulted in an almost continuous breeding season (10 months), in contrast to the 7-8 months observed in the native range. Although the spatial variability in maturation and spawning in the native location is mainly attributable to variations in salinity, the variability in the Ria de Vigo was probably caused by temperature acting as a trigger for maturation and spawning. The almost continuous breeding season exhibited by X. securis potentially results in planktotrophic larvae being present in the water column for almost 10 months of the year. The reproductive plasticity of X. securis and the potential to adapt to local environmental conditions highlight the need for specific monitoring programmes focused on early detection in potential invasion hotspots.

AB  - Ammonia volatilization is an important path of nitrogen loss from farmland into the environment, and is also the main factor of PM2.5 formation, which has serial disadvantageous effect on the ecological environment and agricultural production. Previously, most of the traditional methods for ammonia emission measurement collected atmospheric ammonia by an acid absorbent. However, these techniques were labor intensive, making it difficult to determine diurnal variation of ammonia volatilization. The open-path tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy is a reliable tool with high precision, high selectivity, and fast response time for continuous and nonintrusive monitoring of ammonia concentrations over distances from tens to hundreds of meters under field conditions. Currently, the combination of tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy and micrometeorological backward Lagrangian stochastic diffusion model (TDLAS-BLS) has become a popular technique in the measurement of ammonia volatilization in the field. The objectives of the study are first, to compare TDLAS-BLS technique with the micrometeorological integrated horizontal flux method for its accuracy and applicability for quantitatively measuring ammonia emission from large area of farmland through field experiments. Second, determine the dynamics of ammonia volatilization via high-temporal resolution data and identify the factors that govern ammonia volatilization from urea applied to winter wheat. The results indicated that the estimates made by TDLAS-BLS method were statistically equivalent to those made by the IHF method (regression gradient= 0. 97, R-2 =0. 97, n=14). The ammonia emission rates and total ammonia loss estimated by the TDLAS-BLS technique were only 3%0 and 6%0 lower than those from the IHF method, respectively. This implied that TDLAS-BLS technique can be used to quantitatively estimate ammonia emission from large area of farmland during topdressing period of winter wheat with acceptable accuracy. Ammonia concentration was higher in daytime than in the night at topdressing stage of winter wheat, due to wind speed fluctuation causing it to fluctuate greatly. Ammonia volatilization rate increased slowly after fertilization, and reached a maximum value at the sixth day after fertilization and then decreased gradually after 15 days. This was mainly concentrated in the 5 similar to 8 days after fertilization, and accounted for 69% of the total during the overall monitoring period. During this period, the total loss determined by TDLAS-BLS method was 8. 8 kg N . ha(-1) (6. 3% of the total applied N). The lower loss was related due to furrow application of urea and low temperature. This demonstrated the ability of the TDLAS-BLS method to characterize the diurnal patterns of ammonia emission and the environmental influences on ammonia emission from cropland via high-temporal resolution data. Ammonia volatilization showed large diurnal variability during the daytime, which was coincident with temperature, wind speed and solar radiation. Wind speed, solar radiation, soil temperature and precipitation are significantly correlated with ammonia volatilization. Meteorological factor (such as precipitation) are the main factors influencing ammonia volatilization in abnormal weather.

AB  - This paper reports, the improved sensitivity and selectivity of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) sensing at room temperature based on ternary heterostructure nanocomposite (CeO2-rGO/CNT). Detection of LPG is required for proper environment monitoring to avoid any health hazards in the household and industrial areas. Towards this, a low-cost, high performance, and high stable room temperature gas sensor was fabricated. CeO2 nanopuzzles was synthesized by Eggshell membrane template assisted hydrothermal method and nanocomposites by sono-chemical route. As-synthesized materials and nanocomposites were analyzed by employing characterizations like XRD, Raman, FT-IR, FESEM, and TEM, which confirmed the formation of shape, size, structure, and functional groups involved. The current study focuses on the fabrication of room temperature LPG sensor based on hybrid nanocomposites coated on flexible polyethylene terephthalate substrate working electrodes for In-house chemiresistive LPG detection unit to study response, stability, and selectivity parameters. The ternary heterostructure nanocomposite gas sensor exhibited good selectivity to LPG at room temperature. This sensor showed the response of 42% at 400 ppm of LPG, which is 2.21 times than pure CeO2 sensor with a short response time 26 s and recovery time of 98 s, and gained 99% response after bending with 95.2% stability and 85.7% periodic stability of the sensor.

AB  - This paper presents elite group-based evolutionary algorithms (EGEA) for adaptive ocean sampling using multiple unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs). The EGEA integrate a group-based framework and elitist selection methods into evolutionary path planner, which combine main advantages of these two techniques.The group-based framework allows each offspring individual of evolutionary algorithm to generate its own group of new solutions with a certain probability. Two elitist selection methods, herein referred to as group individual elitist selection (GIES) and whole population elitist selection (WPES), are proposed to facilitate selecting preferable solutions to be passed on to the next generation in the procedure of evolutionary algorithms. The EGEA path planners based on simulated annealing algorithm (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are tested to find trajectories for multiple UMVs to collect maximum interested ocean information from regions under investigation. The mixed integer linear programming (MILP) is also described and evaluated with the proposed EGEA for solving the adaptive sampling problem. Simulation results show that the whole elite group-based simulated annealing algorithm (WEGSA) is able to generate trajectories with more information gain from regions of high scientific interest with constrained energy of multiple UMVs than other techniques. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the inherent robustness and superiority of the proposed planner based on the EGEA in comparison with other techniques.

AB  - The pervasive occurrence of sexual dimorphism demonstrates different adaptive strategies of males and females. While different reproductive strategies of the two sexes are well-characterized, very little is known about differential functional requirements of males and females in their natural habitats. Here, we study the impact environmental change on the selection response in both sexes. Exposing replicated Drosophila populations to a novel temperature regime, we demonstrate sex-specific changes in gene expression, metabolic and behavioral phenotypes in less than 100 generations. This indicates not only different functional requirements of both sexes in the new environment but also rapid sex-specific adaptation. Supported by computer simulations we propose that altered sex-biased gene regulation from standing genetic variation, rather than new mutations, is the driver of rapid sex-specific adaptation. Our discovery of environmentally driven divergent functional requirements of males and females has important implications-possibly even for gender aware medical treatments.

AB  - Effects of parental environment on offspring traits have been well known for decades. Interest in this transgenerational form of phenotypic plasticity has recently surged due to advances in our understanding of its mechanistic basis. Theoretical research has simultaneously advanced by predicting the environmental conditions that should favor the adaptive evolution of transgenerational plasticity. Yet whether such conditions actually exist in nature remains largely unexplored. Here, using long-term climate data, we modeled optimal levels of transgenerational plasticity for an organism with a one-year life cycle at a spatial resolution of 4 km(2) across the continental United States. Both annual temperature and precipitation levels were often autocorrelated, but the strength and direction of these autocorrelations varied considerably even among nearby sites. When present, such environmental autocorrelations render offspring environments statistically predictable based on the parental environment, a key condition for the adaptive evolution of transgenerational plasticity. Results of our optimality models were consistent with this prediction: High levels of transgenerational plasticity were favored at sites with strong environmental autocorrelations, and little-to-no transgenerational plasticity was favored at sites with weak or nonexistent autocorrelations. These results are among the first to show that natural patterns of environmental variation favor the evolution of adaptive transgenerational plasticity. Furthermore, these findings suggest that transgenerational plasticity is likely variable in nature, depending on site-specific patterns of environmental variation.

AB  - Inland waters experience extreme environmental conditions determining the evolution of several adaptive strategies of the fauna to these variable conditions. Freshwater sponges produce resisting bodies called gemmules that contain totipotent cells and specialized spicules (gemmuloscleres). Completely formed gemmules exhibit low metabolic rates and may become dormant during periods of environmental stress. Until now, few species had their hatchability tested against different environmental conditions. The purpose of the present study was to test the capacity of hatching gemmules of two freshwater sponge species (Heteromeyenia cristalina Batista, Volkmer-Ribeiro & Melao, 2007 and Radiospongilla inesi Nicacio & Pinheiro, 2011) from inland waters from different localities. Five assays were tested (A): A1 (water of sponge collection site); A2 (Pirangi River water); A3 (Araraquara Pond water); A4 (mineral water) and A5 (Al after drying gemmules). For each assay, three replicates with 30 gemmules were used. The gemmules were observed daily during 30 days. Data analysis was performed using ANOVA and a posteriori Tukey test. Results showed that gemmules from both species submitted to A3 have not hatched, probably due to its very high conductivity. There was a significant difference between assays (A1, A2 and A4) and between species (F-2,F-12 = 77.2; P < 0.001). Comparison between Al and A5 showed significant differences between both assays and species (F-1,F-8 = 27.5; P < 0.001). Radiospongilla inesi presented high hatching rate at all assays, while H. cristalina had a high hatching rate only on Al and A5. Results clearly show that each species has a different capacity of hatching.

AB  - Trade-offs shaping behavioral variation are often influenced by the environment. We investigated the role that the environment plays in mediating trade-offs using a widespread frog with a conspicuous mating display, Pseudacris crucifer. We first demonstrated, using playback and desiccation experiments, that calling site selection involves a trade-off between sound transmission and desiccation. We then determined the influence of local environmental conditions on the intensity of the trade-off by examining range-wide behavioral and environmental data. We showed that the benefit of improved call transmission is positively influenced by vegetation density and ground cover. Behavioral data are consistent with this relationship: sites with a greater transmission benefit have increased prevalence of arboreally calling males. We also found that the prevalence of arboreal calling behavior increases with relative humidity and air temperature, suggesting an influence of these environmental variables on the desiccation cost of arboreal calling. This study provides a clear example of the role of the environment in mediating trade-off intensities and shaping critical behavioral traits.

AB  - Eggplant fruit is a chilling injury sensitive vegetable and should not be stored at lower than 12 degrees C postharvest, although fruit are often placed in temperatures as low as 0-5 degrees C. For this reason, a rapid early detection of eggplants previously stored at chilling temperatures would allow early removal of those fruit from the market. Eggplant fruit (cv. Fantasy) were stored either at 2 degrees C (chilling injurious temperature) or at 12 degrees C (safe storage temperature) for 10 days. Every 2 days, fruit from each group were sampled and left at room temperature, for one additional day. Color measurements in the CIE L*a*b* mode and reflectance data in the wavelength range 360-740 nm, Fourier Transform (FT)-NIR spectra (800-2777 nm) and hyperspectral images at the visible (400-1000 nm) and near infrared (900-1700 nm) part of the electromagnetic spectrum were also acquired on each fruit. Three supervised algorithms; partial least square (PLS), supervised vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) were applied to classify fruit according to the storage temperature. Chilling injury (CI) was subjectively evaluated, according to the presence of black seeds or of brown discolored flesh area. According to the results, although chilling injury symptoms started being evident only after the 4th day of storage at 2 degrees C, it was possible to discriminate fruit earlier, since day 2, by processing the FT-NIR spectral data with the SVM classifier (100 and 92% non-error-rate (NER)) in calibration and cross validation, respectively) in the whole period data set. Color or FT-NIR spectral data classified with PLSDA permitted relatively good classification of fruit (> 83% accuracy) since the 4th day of storage, while L, C, H degrees color measurements or Vis-NIR hyperspectral imaging data combined with PLSDA generate trustworthy models only after the 6th day of storage. On the other hand, NIR hyperspectral imaging technique and kNN classification algorithm were incapable to separate the fruit either accurately or consistently. These results indicate a good potential of adapting selected protocols, in terms of technique, processing of the raw data and supervised classification algorithm, in order to minimize postharvest losses induced by the improper temperature management of chilling sensitive fruit, such as the eggplants.

AB  - Conflicts of interests between males and females over reproduction is a universal feature of sexually reproducing organisms and has driven the evolution of intersexual mimicry, mating behaviours and reproductive polymorphisms. Here, we show how temperature drives pre-reproductive selection in a female colour polymorphic insect that is subject to strong sexual conflict. These species have three female colour morphs, one of which is a male mimic. This polymorphism is maintained by frequency-dependent sexual conflict caused by male mating harassment. The frequency of female morphs varies geographically, with higher frequency of the male mimic at higher latitudes. We show that differential temperature sensitivity of the female morphs and faster sexual maturation of the male mimic increases the frequency of this morph in the north. These results suggest that sexual conflict during the adult stage is shaped by abiotic factors and frequency-independent pre-reproductive selection that operate earlier during ontogeny of these female morphs.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a colorless gas with a smell of rotten eggs which poses great threat on human health and environmental protection. Traditional metal oxide based H2S sensors always suffer from undesirable selectivity and elevated operation temperature. To overcome these obstacles, in this report cuprous oxide nanowires/nanoparticles (Cu2O) anchored onto reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO) were prepared to serve as the sensing layer. Multiple characterization techniques such as SEM, TEM, FTIR, and XRD were utilized to explore the sensor performance toward H2S gas. Compared to the partial recovery at 25 degrees C, the prepared rGO/Cu2O sensor showed a response of 20% toward 1 ppm H2S at 40 degrees C, together with full restoration, excellent repeatability, long-term stability and selectivity. Favorable film porosity, highly conductive rGO nanosheets and nanometer size effect of Cu2O materials were responsible for these inspiring results, paving the avenue for future trace H2S detection in the aspects of higher sensitivity and lower power-consumption.

AB  - This study predicts in real time the evolution of temperature and density for arbitrary long tracks in laser-based additive manufacturing using artificial neural networks (ANNs). First, a random laser path is transformed appropriately to serve as an ANN input via a custom trajectory decomposition method providing a local description of each trajectory point relative to its surroundings, which is calculated and load-optimized using K-d trees. For each trajectory point, a "Master" ANN calculates the present temperature, using the trajectory descriptors and previous step temperature as inputs. This is made into a parallel procedure by exploiting a "Pilot" ANN without temperature feedback, making a first pass over the whole trajectory to estimate temperature responses. The Master ANN uses these results as a feedback that is iteratively refined. A "Rider" ANN uses the final temperatures as input and calculates local density evolution. Four hundred fifty finite element model experiments of short random walk trajectories were used for ANN training. Results are presented for various types of laser paths, including random, hatch, spiral, fractal, and spline. ANN simulation execution time consistently taking under 50% of the real process time in all validated cases for track length in excess of 100 m proved the ability of the platform to operate at the full layer-scale of LBAM.

AB  - Amaranth (Amaranthus sp.) is an important leafy vegetable in Africa where most farmers grow unimproved landraces. Information about amaranth genetic diversity and its adaptation to different environments will help breeders develop improved commercial varieties that meet market requirements. The objectives of this study were to investigate the performances of amaranth entries for vegetable yield across locations and seasons, assess the relative contributions of genetic vs. environmental sources of variation to yield, and cluster locations into megaenvironments (MEs) to suggest future test sites. Twenty six diverse entries were evaluated for vegetable yields in replicated trials at five locations in wet cool and hot dry seasons in Tanzania. Season explained the highest proportion (52.1%) of the total sum of squares followed by entries (24.9%) and locations (23.0%). Mean yield across the hot dry season trials (27.7 t.ha L-1) was 47.3% greater than the mean yield across wet cool season trials (18.8 t.ha L-1). Differences among entries in vegetable yield were higher in the hot dry season than in the wet cool season, indicating that gain from selection is likely to be greater in the hot dry season. Most entries performed well in either wet cool or hot dry season but a few entries were adapted to both seasons. Two MEs were identified, one characterized by lower altitudes, higher temperatures, and less fertile soils, and a second ME associated with higher altitudes, lower temperatures, and more fertile soils. Each ME may serve as an initial selection site for their respective target environment. Targeting a specific season may give a better chance of finding high yielding varieties.

AB  - The Chinese pond mussel, Sinanodonta woodiana, an invasive species indigenous to Asia, naturally colonizes new locations as a glochidium that parasitizes fish. Human activity has facilitated a continental-scale spread of S. woodiana in Europe, where it is found in artificial reservoirs and has begun to invade natural habitats. This study aimed to investigate the reproductive activity of males in a female-biased population of S. woodiana that lives in a riverine channel linked to a power plant with a cooling water system in NW Poland. Cells formed during spermatogenesis and morphological changes in reproductive follicles (acini) were analysed over a 2-year period using light microscopy. Typical and atypical spermatogenic pathways were identified. The atypical spermatozoa were released from multinucleated cysts and had significantly shorter heads than typical spermatozoa. Spermatozoa formed in the typical way occurred consistently in all months over the study period, while the atypical spermatozoa were recorded occasionally in the first year of the study and more frequently in the second study. The highest proportion of males with spent gonads was found in late summer and early autumn. Our data show that mussels produce spermatozoa year-round, but that the levels of typical and atypical spermatogenesis varied. The two pathways of spermatogenesis in S. woodiana provide an important insight into potential mechanisms underlying the evolution of doubly uniparental inheritance of mitochondrial DNA, a phenomenon observed in S. woodiana. Additionally, a detailed understanding of the reproductive cycle of this non-native species can help to understand its reproductive potential and predict the likely direction of population change in a newly colonized area. The breeding population of S. woodiana studied by us inhabits a tributary of the Odra River, one of Poland's largest rivers, and thus poses a threat to the natural environment. Riverine habitats like our study site are local heat islands and the mussels reproducing in them over time may colonize natural waters and expand the range of their distribution.

AB  - Current interrupt and galvanostatic EIS techniques were utilized in a complementary fashion to characterize the different sources of overpotential during anodic gas evolution. Room temperature anodic evolution of oxygen at a nickel working electrode in aqueous potassium hydroxide and the high temperature (348 degrees C) anodic evolution of chlorine at a glassy carbon working electrode in molten (LiCl)(57.5)-(KCl)(13.3)-(CsCl)(29.2) where investigatd. Combining of the two techniques enables to separate the total measured overpotential into its ohmic, charge transfer, and mass transfer components. Potential decay curves indicated that natural convection (due to both bubble evolution and density driven flow) was a major driving force in reestablishing equilibrium conditions at the working electrode surface. During oxygen evolution, charge transfer resistance dominated the total overpotential at low current densities, but as the current density approached similar to 100mA/cm(2), mass transfer overpotentials and ohmic overpotential became non-negligible. The mass transfer overpotential during chlorine evolution was found to be half that found during oxygen evolution. (c) The Author(s) 2019. Published by ECS.

AB  - Silicones are polymers that have properties of great interest for cosmetic and personal care industry, especially D-4 (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) and D-5 (decamethylcyclopentasiloxane), generically named cyclomethicones. However, different studies show the hypothesis that the use of these products is harmful and, therefore, several countries have adopted legislative actions to limit their use in personal care and cosmetic products. Faced with this new situation, different cosmetic companies began to look for different alternatives to cyclomethicones, mainly: organomodified silicones or esters. The former are based on the addition of functional groups to the main chain of silicon and oxygen. The latter represent a totally different line, since their functional group is the ester, but they have properties similar to silicones. Esters, especially branched-chain ones are currently the more promising alternative to replace cyclomethicones in cosmetic formulations. Nowadays, most of them are obtained by chemical reactions that require high temperatures and non-selective /contaminant catalysts that lead to low-quality final products. As an alternative, biocatalytic synthesis occurs always at mild operation conditions supplying ultra-pure, odor, and colorless products with less wastes and side reactions. Therefore, biocatalysis is a valid and environmentally sustainable option for the synthesis of silicone-substitute esters used in cosmetic formulations.

AB  - Gene modification is a promising tool for plant breeding, and gradual application from the laboratory to the field. Selectable marker genes (SMG) are required in the transformation process to simplify the identification of transgenic plants; however, it is more desirable to obtain transgenic plants without selection markers. Transgene integration mediated by site-specific recombination (SSR) systems into the dedicated genomic sites has been demonstrated in a few different plant species. Here, we present an auto-elimination vector system that uses a heat-inducible Cre to eliminate the selectable marker from transgenic maize, without the need for repeated transformation or sexual crossing. The vector combines an inducible site-specific recombinase (hsp70::Cre) that allows for the precise elimination of the selectable marker gene egfp upon heating. This marker gene is used for the initial positive selection of transgenic tissue. The egfp also functions as a visual marker to demonstrate the effectiveness of the heat-inducible Cre. A second marker gene for anthocyanin pigmentation (Rsc) is located outside of the region eliminated by Cre and is used for the identification of transgenic offspring in future generations. Using the heat-inducible auto-excision vector, marker-free transgenic maize plants were obtained in a precisely controlled genetic modification process. Genetic and molecular analyses indicated that the inducible auto-excision system was tightly controlled, with highly efficient DNA excision, and provided a highly reliable method to generate marker-free transgenic maize.

AB  - Composting processes reduce the weight and volume of biowaste and produce products that can be used in agriculture (e.g., as fertilizer). Despite the benefits of composting, there are also problems such as odors and the emission of pollutants into the atmosphere. This research aimed to investigate the phenomenon of process gas (CO, CO2, NO, O-2) evolution within a large-scale municipal composter. The effects of turning frequency and pile location (outdoor vs. indoors) on process gas and temperature spatial and temporal evolution were studied in six piles (3781 tons of initial weight) over a six-month period. The biowaste consisted of green waste and municipal sewage sludge. The chemical composition and temperature of process gases within four cross sections with seven sampling locations were analyzed weekly for similar to 7-8 weeks (a total of 1375 cross sections). The aeration degree, temperature, CO, CO2, and NO concentration and their spatial and temporal distribution were analyzed. Final weight varied from 66% reduction to 7% weight gain. Only 8.2% of locations developed the desired chimney effect (utilizing natural buoyancy to facilitate passive aeration). Only 31.1% of locations reached thermophilic conditions (necessary to inactivate pathogens). Lower O-2 levels corresponded with elevated CO2 concentrations. CO production increased in the initial composting phase. Winter piles were characterized by the lowest CO content. The most varied was the NO distribution in all conditions. The O-2 concentration was lowest in the central part of the pile, and aeration conditions were good regardless of the technological regime used. Turning once a week was sufficient overall. Based on the results, the most favorable recommended procedure is turning twice a week for the first two weeks, followed by weekly turning for the next two weeks. After that, turning can be stopped unless additional removal of moisture is needed. In this case, weekly turning should continue until the process is completed. The size of the pile should follow the surface-to-volume ratio: <2.5 and <2 for cooler ambient conditions.

AB  - This study deals with the effect of uncarbonized eggshell weight percentage on the tensile strength of AA 2014 composite manufactured by Electromagnetic stir casting technique. Response surface methodology (RSM) is used to design the experiment. The selected process parameters are preheat temperature, stirring current, stirring time, matrix pouring temperature, and reinforcement of uncarbonized eggshell weight percentage. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is employed to study the influence of selected process parameters. The maximum tensile strength of 287.194 MPa was achieved for reinforcement preheat temperature 537.87 degrees C, stirring current 12 A, stirring time 179.9 sec, matrix pouring temperature 726.8 degrees C, and reinforcement weight percentage of 12.46. At optimum level of process parameter confirmation tests are performed to validate the result. In confirmation test, tensile strength and hardness are investigated. It is observed that due to the reinforcement of uncarbonized eggshell in AA2014 aluminium alloy, tensile strength and hardness are improved by 55.24% and 39.58 %.

AB  - Volcanic rocks in the southern part of the Tan-Lu Fault Zone (TLFZ), eastern China, provide key evidence for the connection between spatially and temporally related pulses of Cretaceous magmatism, activity on the TLFZ, and the dynamics of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. We identify two stages of bimodal volcanism in the Chaohu-Lujiang segment, southern TLFZ, based on lithological assemblages and precise isotopic ages. The Early Cretaceous (125-121 Ma) volcanic rocks are fractionated aluminous A-type rhyolites and basalts, whereas the Late Cretaceous volcanic rocks (97-83 Ma) range in composition from porphyritic andesites and trachydacites to rhyolites. The Early Cretaceous rhyolites display strongly negative Nd-Hf isotopic compositions (epsilon(Nd)(t) = -16.3 to -16.1, epsilon(Hf)(t) = -24.1 to -17.9). The most likely source rocks of the fractionated aluminous A-type rhyolites are metaigneous rocks of the Feidong Complex. The Early Cretaceous potassic basalts (K2O/Na2O = 1.5-3.4, epsilon(Nd)(t) = 9.0) exhibit more enriched isotopic compositions than the Late Cretaceous sodic porphyritic andesites (K2O/Na2O = 0.6-0.8, epsilon(Nd)(t) = -5.6, epsilon(Hf)(t) = -15.1 to -6.8), indicating derivation from heterogeneously enriched lithospheric mantle. This heterogeneity is ascribed to derivation from more fertile and isotopically enriched mantle sources with lower solidus temperatures. Modeling of selected elements reveals that the Late Cretaceous trachydacites (epsilon(Nd)(t) = -12.2 to -8.2, epsilon(Hf)(t) = -16.5 to -6.4) originated by mixing between coeval mafic and felsic magmas. The most negative (epsilon(Nd)(t) = -18.8 to -17.1, epsilon(Hf)(t) = -20.5 to -4.7) isotopic compositions, along with Neoproterozoic inherited zircons within the Late Cretaceous rhyolites, indicate derivation from lower crust of the South China Block. We suggest that the Early Cretaceous bimodal volcanic rocks formed in an extensional backarc setting induced by retreat of the subducting Izanagi slab. However, the TLFZ became a focus of Late Cretaceous bimodal volcanism due to weak far field extension caused by the slow northward motion of the Paleo-Pacific Plate. Moreover, the high velocity and low angle of subduction of the Izanagi slab were the main driving mechanisms behind an Early Cretaceous transpressional event that separated the two stages of bimodal volcanism.

AB  - This study investigates rice yield and evaluates potential adaptation measures on field management practices for rainfed rice production under climate change scenarios in the Songkhram River Basin, Thailand. The top-down and bottom-up approaches are combined to evaluate the future climate conditions in the Songkhram River Basin and identify adaptation strategies respectively. An ensemble of four Regional Climate Models (RCMs) bias-corrected using the Quantile Mapping technique was used to project the future climate under two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The DSSAT crop simulation model was used to simulate rice yield and evaluate the impacts of climate change on rice yield, as well as the feasibility of four adaptation options, which were solicited from four hundred farmers through questionnaire surveys in the basin. The strategies include (i) change in planting date, (ii) change in fertiliser application date, (iii) change in fertiliser application dose, and (iv) supplying irrigation water. Based on the model results, future maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to increase by 2.8 and 3.2 degrees C respectively under RCP8.5 scenario for 2080s. Although annual rainfall may be unchanged, rainfall patterns will shift earlier in future. Evaluation of adaptation strategies suggest that supplying irrigation water under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios respectively are the best strategies to increase rice yield under climate change scenarios. Change in fertiliser application date and change in planting date can increase the future rice yield by 12 and 8%, respectively under RCP4.5 scenario for 2080s. Adjusting the fertiliser application dose may however reduce future rice yield. Although supplying irrigation water can aid the production of rainfed rice, other concerns such as the source of water are involved. The feasibility of adaptation actions would depend largely on available resources and mindset of farmers. Further work is warranted in exploring a combination of adaptation strategies and management plans to combat the adverse impacts of climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chenopodium quinoa (Willd.) is an herbaceous C3 crop originating in the Andean Altiplano. Quinoa possesses a great deal of genetic variability, can adapt to diverse climatic conditions, besides of having seeds with high nutritional properties. An experiment conducted in Burkina Faso has determined the response of two quinoa varieties (Titicaca and Negra Collana) to different planting dates (November vs December), irrigation levels (Potential evapotranspiration-PET, 100, 80 and 60% PET), and N fertilization rates (100, 50 and 25 kg N ha(-1)). Main research findings have shown that quinoa can be highly performant under drought stress conditions and low nitrogen inputs, besides of coping with high temperatures typically of the Sahel. The highest yields (1.9 t ha(-1)) were achieved when sown in November at 60 % PET and 25 kg N ha(-1). For this location, short cycle varieties, such as Titicaca, were recommended in order to avoid thermic stress conditions occurring prior to the onset of the rainy season (May-October).

AB  - The university restaurant from Tecnologico de Costa Rica's main Campus in Cartago, has the purpose of a better waste management; therefore, three composting methods were evaluated to produce organic fertilizer from its biodegradable residues. The researchers selected the techniques through expert's opinion, assessing variables like pH, temperature, moisture and efficiency in each technique, in order to determine the most efficient one to re-valorize the organic waste.
   A factorial experimental design was selected, in which three treatments were compared: Takakura (TK), Mountain microorganisms (MM) and Pellets (P) with biodegradable solid wastes on each case, in tumbling composters and in pile composters (on the ground), with two repetitions. The used p value was 0,05.
   As a result, the Takakura treatment showed the best results from a technical, environmental and economic point of view, since it reached the highest average temperature (53 degrees C) and achieved the thermophilic phase faster than the other ones, maintaining the expected indicators for proper composting, such as a pH close to 7, moisture between 50% and 70% and efficiency of 81%.. Consequently, the researchers conclude this treatment represents a valid strategy to aim towards a circular economy approach at the university's restaurant from Tecnologico de Costa Rica.

AB  - Our understanding of the impacts of ongoing global warming on terrestrial species has increased significantly during the last several years, but how climatic change has affected, and will affect, the distribution of earthworms remains largely unknown. We used climate niche modeling to model the current distribution of the giant earthworm Rhinodrilus alatus - an endemic species of the Cerrado Domain in Brazil, which is traditionally harvested and commercialized for fishing bait. R. alatus is sensitive to environmental changes because climate, in synergy with soil attributes, determine its annual reproductive cycle and distribution. The paleoclimatic reconstructions predict important geographical shifts from LGM (similar to 21,000 yBp) to the present potential distribution of R. alatus: range expansion, fragmentation, and shrinkage of the current core area. Further, the 2070 scenarios predict substantial shrink and losses of stable areas. Our results indicate that climate change will not only affect the extent of the distribution, but will also promote significant fragmentation and a geographical shift to outside of the currently recognized geographical boundaries. In this context, populations of R. alatus would decline and traditional harvesting would collapse, requiring immediate implementation of management and conservation measures for the species and economically sustainable alternatives for the local community.

AB  - Climate change will affect the dynamics of the hydrogeological systems and their water resources quality; in particular nitrate, which is herein taken as a paradigmatic pollutant to illustrate the effects of climate change on groundwater quality. Based on climatic predictions of temperature and precipitation for the horizon of 2021 and 2050, as well as on land use distribution, water balances are recalculated for the hydrological basins of distinct aquifer systems in a western Mediterranean region as Catalonia (NE Spain) in order to determine the reduction of available water resources. Besides the fact that climate change will represent a decrease of water availability, we qualitatively discuss the modifications that will result from the future climatic scenarios and their impact on nitrate pollution according to the geological setting of the selected aquifers. Climate effects in groundwater quality are described according to hydrological, environmental, socio-economic, and political concerns. Water reduction stands as a major issue that will control stream-aquifer interactions and subsurface recharge, leading to a general modification of nitrate in groundwater as dilution varies. A nitrate mass balance model provides a gross estimation of potential nitrate evolution in these aquifers, and it points out that the control of the fertilizer load will be crucial to achieve adequate nitrate content in groundwater. Reclaimed wastewater stands as local reliable resource, yet its amount will only satisfy a fraction of the loss of available resources due to climate change. Finally, an integrated management perspective is necessary to avoid unplanned actions from private initiatives that will jeopardize the achievement of sustainable water resources exploitation under distinct hydrological scenarios.

AB  - Despite widespread interest in describing and forecasting the impacts of climate change on species distributions, poor understanding of the climate variables that shape distributions and conflicting perspectives on the role that species traits play in mediating shifts have limited our ability to interpret and project changes in species distributions. Using standardized survey data along the northeast US continental shelf, we assessed the historical exposure and sensitivity of 81 species of marine chordates, arthropods, and molluscs to 24 sea surface temperature (SST) variables in two seasons. By comparing temperature trends in geographies available to species against temperature trends in geographies used by them we were able to identify which variables species track consistently through space and time. Logistic regression analyses were then used to assess whether species traits affected the likelihood of niche tracking while accounting for the season and temporal window in which temperatures were summarized and methodological constraints that might have limited our ability to detect tracking responses. A slight majority of species (52%) clearly shifted their distributions to track at least one temperature variable through space and time. Tracking rates were much lower on a per variable basis (5.1% of 3432 variables), despite widespread exposure to changing temperatures (89.2% of 3432 variables). None of the twelve ecological traits we investigated - including traits related to dispersal ability, ecological specialization, reproductive capacity, and commercial harvest - accounted for differences in tracking responses across species even after accounting for differences in climate exposure. Our results suggest widespread behavioral or physiological flexibility among our study species, or ongoing genetic adaptation to changing temperatures. They also suggest that divergent selection on climate sensitivities of close relatives may limit the utility of ecological traits for predicting distributional responses to future climate change.

AB  - Phosphogypsum (PG) which is a waste byproduct of fertilizer production is the promising source of the gypsum industry. In order to explore the application of hemihydrate PG (HPG) as a substitute of hemihydrate gypsum, the setting and hardening characters of HPG plaster at different pH after neutralization were examined and contrasted with hemihydrate flue gas desulfurization gypsum (HFGD) plaster. Results showed that HPG plaster sets slow with a fall in strength and this effect was more pronounced after retarders were added when pH increased from 5.85 to 11.08. By contrast, HFGD plaster sets fast and without strength variation in the similar alkaline range. Microscopic studies including chemically combined water and temperature evolution curves of HPG plaster revealed that with the increase of the pH, the hydration reaction mechanism of hemihydrate and the gypsum crystal morphology were radically changed due to the fact of interaction between impurities and alkali. Consequently, HPG plaster is very different from HFGD plaster and its application in the alkaline condition was restricted. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Luminescent metal nanoclusters have attracted considerable research attention in recent years due to their unique properties and extensive usage in many fields. Three different synthetic routes were developed to in situ generate orange and red emitting copper nanoclusters embedded in monolithic eggshell membrane (Cu NCs@ESM) using different reducing reagents including N2H4H2O, NH2OHHCl and Vitamin C at room temperature for the first time. The routes are extremely facile, low-cost and versatile. The obtained Cu NCs@ESM nanocomposites exhibit excellent photostability and chemical stability, laying the foundation for various practical applications. Fluorescent surface patterning was demonstrated based on the proposed strategy easily. Significantly, the Cu NCs@ESM shows selective fluorescence quenching response to Hg2+ ions and good catalytic activity for methylene blue (MB) reduction degradation making it ideal as portable sensing strip and recyclable catalyst. The work provides a general strategy for the fabrication of other various monolithic nanomaterials with potential applications.

AB  - Sharks have maintained a key role in marine food webs for 400 million years and across varying physicochemical contexts, suggesting plasticity to environmental change. In this study, we investigated the biochemical effects of ocean acidification (OA) levels predicted for 2100 (pCO(2) similar to 900 mu atm) on newly hatched tropical whitespotted bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum). Specifically, we measured lipid, protein, and DNA damage levels, as well as changes in the activity of antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymatic ROS scavengers in juvenile sharks exposed to elevated CO2 for 50 days following hatching. Moreover, we also assessed the secondary oxidative stress response, i.e., heat shock response and ubiquitin levels. Newly hatched sharks appear to cope with OA-related stress through a range of tissue-specific biochemical strategies, specifically through the action of antioxidant enzymatic compounds. Our findings suggest that ROS-scavenging molecules, rather than complex enzymatic proteins, provide an effective defense mechanism in dealing with OA-elicited ROS formation. We argue that sharks' ancient antioxidant system, strongly based on non-enzymatic antioxidants (e.g., urea), may provide them with resilience towards OA, potentially beyond the tolerance of more recently evolved species, i.e., teleosts. Nevertheless, previous research has provided evidence of detrimental effects of OA (interacting with other climate-related stressors) on some aspects of shark biology. Moreover, given that long-term acclimation and adaptive potential to rapid environmental changes are yet experimentally unaccounted for, future research is warranted to accurately predict shark physiological performance under future ocean conditions.

AB  - Cereal leaf beetles (CLBs) are described as an invasive pest of small grain cereals in many regions worldwide. Prediction models aimed to prevent yield losses caused by these feeding insects have been developed by researchers all over the world. As a foundation for many of these prediction models, it is known that a specific number of heat units, or growing degree days (GDDs), is required for an insect to complete a certain physiological process. In this paper, we overview the existing GDD models for CLBs. Furthermore, we used our Belgian input data to compare model predictions with our own observations.Though, the existing models were not able to predict the seasonal trends present in our data: the occurrence of various life stages were monitored earlier then the model predicted. Hence, a weighted GDD model was tested on the data as well: the accumulated GDDs during certain periods were balanced according to the significance of this period for the insect. Rainfall and/or relative humidity were included as well. Based on these selected variables, multiple linear regression models, ridge regression models, and regression trees were fitted. This approach performed considerably better compared to the simple accumulation of GDD. However, based on cross-year cross-location validation method, to gain insight in the future performance of the models, the accuracy was still too low to serve as an accurate warning tool.

AB  - This work evaluates the exploitation of four different types of waste for the production of biogas and fertilizer using a feedback multiscale analysis approach. The yield of sludge, manure, municipal solid wastes (MSW) and lignocellulosic residues is evaluated and the kinetics of the anaerobic digestion of each of these residues is determined by performing a parameter estimation using experimental data. It turns out that hydrolysis is the limiting stage. Next, a techno-economic evaluation of a processing facility is carried out. Finally a supply network model is developed to evaluate the optimal use of the residues over a region in Spain. The network is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem selecting the type of residue, the number and size of the digesters and the location of the plants across 59 shires of a particular region in Spain for the available budget. MSW is the selected waste due to its wide availability and large yield to fertilizer. Lignocellulosic residues are the second best option. Only intrashire transport is suggested. The shires selected for waste processing are rather scattered as a function of the resources available and the already installed facilities. However, the amount of residues available can provide more than three times the region demand for natural gas, but the budget required adds up to more than 4.4 .10(9) (sic) (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Photoperiod is considered the universal zeitgeber, regulating physiological processes in numerous animals. However, for animals in light-restricted habitats (e.g. burrows or cavities), thermoperiod may be a more important cue. Our study tested this hypothesis in the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, which nests in cavities and undergoes development within a brood cell. We assessed the role of environmental cues (thermoperiod and photoperiod) on the process of adult emergence by examining: (1) whether those cues direct circadian rhythms, (2) which cue is more dominant and (3) how sensitive developing bees and emergence-ready adults are to cues. Although we found that 20% of light penetrates the brood cell, and bees respond to photoperiod by synchronizing emergence, thermoperiod is the dominant cue. When presented with a conflicting zeitgeber, bees entrained to the thermophase instead of the photophase. When temperature cues were removed, we observed free-running of emergence, indicating that underlying circadian mechanisms can be synchronized by daily fluctuations in temperature. We also found that emerging bees were highly sensitive to even small increases in temperature, entraining to a ramp speed of 0.33 degrees C h(-1). The response and sensitivity to temperature cues suggest that M. rotundata evolved a temperature-mediated clock to time emergence from light-restricted cavities.

AB  - Covalent attachment of ubiquitin to substrate proteins changes their function or marks them for proteolysis, and the specificity of ubiquitin attachment is mediated by the numerous E3 ligases encoded by animals. Mind Bomb is an essential E3 ligase during Notch pathway signaling in insects and vertebrates. While Caenorhabditis elegans encodes a Mind Bomb homolog (mib-1), it has never been recovered in the extensive Notch suppressor/enhancer screens that have identified numerous pathway components. Here, we show that C. elegans mib-1 null mutants have a spermatogenesis-defective phenotype that results in a heterogeneous mixture of arrested spermatocytes, defective spermatids, and motility-impaired spermatozoa. mib-1 mutants also have chromosome segregation defects during meiosis, molecular null mutants are intrinsically temperature-sensitive, and many mib-1 spermatids contain large amounts of tubulin. These phenotypic features are similar to the endogenous RNA intereference (RNAi) mutants, but mib-1 mutants do not affect RNAi. MIB-1 protein is expressed throughout the germ line with peak expression in spermatocytes followed by segregation into the residual body during spermatid formation. C. elegans mib-1 expression, while upregulated during spermatogenesis, also occurs somatically, including in vulva precursor cells. Here, we show that mib-1 mutants suppress both lin-12 and glp-1 (C. elegans Notch) gain-of-function mutants, restoring anchor cell formation and a functional vulva to the former and partly restoring oocyte production to the latter. However, suppressed hermaphrodites are only observed when grown at 25 degrees, and they are self-sterile. This probably explains why mib-1 was not previously recovered as a Notch pathway component in suppressor/enhancer selection experiments.

AB  - The holobiont (host with its endocellular and extracellular microbiome) can function as a distinct biological entity, an additional organismal level to the ones previously considered, on which natural selection operates. The holobiont can function as a whole: anatomically, metabolically, immunologically, developmentally, and during evolution. Consideration of the holobiont with its hologenome as an independent level of selection in evolution has led to a better understanding of underappreciated modes of genetic variation and evolution. The hologenome is comprised of two complimentary parts: host and microbiome genomes. Changes in either genome can result in variations that can be selected for or against. The host genome is highly conserved, and genetic changes within it occur slowly, whereas the microbiome genome is dynamic and can change rapidly in response to the environment by increasing or reducing particular microbes, by acquisition of novel microbes, by horizontal gene transfer, and by mutation. Recent experiments showing that microbiota can play an initial role in speciation have been suggested as an additional mode of enhancing evolution. Some of the genetic variations can be transferred to offspring by a variety of mechanisms. Strain-specific DNA analysis has shown that at least some of the microbiota can be maintained across hundreds of thousands of host generations, implying the existence of a microbial core. We argue that rapid changes in the microbiome genome could allow holobionts to adapt and survive under changing environmental conditions thus providing the time necessary for the host genome to adapt and evolve. As Darwin wrote, "It is not the strongest of the species that survives but the most adaptable".

AB  - The recently emerging two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been a fertile ground for exploring abundant exotic physical properties. Critical points, the extrema or saddle points of electronic bands, are the cornerstone of condensed-matter physics and fundamentally determine the optical and transport phenomena of the TMDCs. However, for bilayer MoS2, a typical TMDC and the unprecedented electrically tunable venue for valleytronics, there has been a considerable controversy on its intrinsic electronic structure, especially for the conduction band-edge locations. Moreover, interlayer hopping and layer polarization in bilayer MoS2 which play vital roles in valley-spintronic applications have remained experimentally elusive. Here, we report the experimental observation of intrinsic critical points locations, interlayer hopping, layer-spin polarization, and their evolution with temperature in bilayer MoS2 by performing temperature-dependent photoluminescence. Our measurements confirm that the conduction-band minimum locates at the K-c instead of Q(c) and the energy splitting between Q(c) and K-c redshifts with a descent of temperature. Furthermore, the interlayer hopping energy for holes and temperature-dependent layer polarization are quantitatively determined. Our observations are in good harmony with density-functional theory calculations.

AB  - Aiming to quantitatively evaluate the microstructure of polymer-modified bitumen (PMB) for roads, this paper employs the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform(2D-FFT) to process the microscopic and numerical images of four PMBs. The related derivative parameters, including the characteristic frequency and wavelength, are computed from the 2D-FFT power spectrum. The results show that the absence/presence of a characteristic frequency (range) on the power spectrum can indicate the lack/existence of the corresponding periodical structural pattern(s) in the original PMB image. A lower characteristic frequency usually represents a coarser PMB microstructure while a higher one implies a finer PMB microstructure. The 2D-FFT method is thus valid for differentiating various PMB microstructures. The proposed method is also capable of quantitatively evaluating the effects of temperature and the temporal evolution of PMB microstructure during phase separation. As the separation continues, the decrease of characteristic frequency indicates the coarsening process of a PMB microstructure. Additionally, the numerical reproduction of the observed phase separation is evaluated with the same method. The quantitative comparison with the experimental results reveals that the simulations fairly reproduced the microscopy observation results despite some deviation. The proposed method provides a foundation for the microstructure-based modelling of PMB performance in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) emissions from alpine ecosystems conventionally being long-term cultivated with feed crops are not well quantified. The authors attempted to address this knowledge gap by performing a year-round experimental campaign in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Fertilized (F) and unfertilized (UF) treatments were established within a flat calcareous-soil site for the long-term cultivation of feed oats. NO fluxes and five soil variables were simultaneously measured. A single plow tillage accounted for approximately 54%-73% of the NO releases during the cropping period (CP); and the non-cropping period (NCP) contributed to 51%-58% of the annual emissions. The direct NO emissions factor (EFd) was 0.021% +/- 0.021%. Significantly lower Q(10) values (p < 0.01) occurred in the F treatment during the CP (approximately 3.6) compared to those during the other period or in the other treatment (approximately 4.9-5.1), indicating a fertilizer-induced reduction in the temperature sensitivity. The selected soil variables jointly accounted for up to 72% (p < 0.01) of the variance for all the fluxes across both treatments. This finding suggests that temporally and/or spatially distributed fluxes from alpine calcareous-soil ecosystems for feed crop production may be easily predicted if data on these soil variables are available. Further studies are needed to test the hypothesis that the EFd is larger in alpine feed-oat fields than those in this study if the soil moisture content is higher during the period following the basal application of ammonium- or urea-based fertilizer.

AB  - The objective of this paper was to review the responses of antioxidant system and physiological parameters of bitter melon (BM), sponge gourd (SG), and winter squash (WS) under waterlogged and low temperature conditions. The BM and SG plants were subjected to 0-72 h flooding treatments, and BM and WS plants were exposed to chilling at 12/7 degrees C (day/night) for 0-72 h. Different genotypes responded differently to environmental stress according to their various antioxidant system and physiological parameters. Increased ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities provided SG and WS plants with increased waterlogging and chilling stress tolerance, respectively, compared to BM plants. The APX gene from SG and the SOD gene from WS were then cloned, and the regulation of APX and SOD gene expressions under flooding and chilling stress, respectively, were also measured. Increased expression of APX and SOD genes was accompanied by the increased activity of the enzyme involved in detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to those stresses. Both APX and SOD activities can be used for selecting BM lines with the best tolerances to water logging and chilling stresses.

AB  - Dryland shrub communities have been degraded by a range of disturbances and now face additional stress from global climate change. The spring/summer growing season of the North American sagebrush biome is projected to become warmer and drier, which is expected to facilitate the expansion of the invasive annual grass Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) and alter its response to fire in the northern extent of the biome. We tested these predictions with a factorial experiment with two levels of burning (spring burn and none) and three climate treatments (warming, warming + drying, and control) that was repeated over 3 years in a Montana sagebrush steppe. We expected the climate treatments to make B. tectorum more competitive with the native perennial grass community, especially Pseudoroegneria spicata, and alter its response to fire. Experimental warming and warming + drying reduced B. tectorum cover, biomass, and fecundity, but there was no response to fire except for fecundity, which increased; the native grass community was the most significant factor that affected B. tectorum metrics. The experimental climate treatments also negatively affected P. spicata, total native grass cover, and community biodiversity, while fire negatively affected total native grass cover, particularly when climate conditions were warmer and drier. Our short-term results indicate that without sufficient antecedent moisture and a significant disruption to the native perennial grass community, a change in climate to a warmer and drier spring/summer growing season in the northern sagebrush biome will not facilitate B. tectorum invasion or alter its response to fire.

AB  - Several highly effective fire-adaptive traits first evolved among modern plants during the mid-Cretaceous, in response to the widespread wildfires promoted by anomalously high atmospheric oxygen (O-2) and extreme temperatures. Serotiny, or long-term canopy seed storage, is a fire-adaptive strategy common among plants living in fire-prone areas today, but evidence of this strategy has been lacking from the fossil record. Deposits of abundant fossil charcoal from sedimentary successions of the Chatham Islands, New Zealand, record wildfires in the south polar regions (75 degrees-80 degrees S) during the mid-Cretaceous (ca. 99-90 Ma). Newly discovered fossil conifer reproductive structures were consistently associated with these charcoal-rich deposits. The morphology and internal anatomy as revealed by neutron tomography exhibit a range of serotiny-associated characters. Numerous related fossils from similar, contemporaneous deposits of the Northern Hemisphere suggest that serotiny was a key adaptive strategy during the high-fire world of the Cretaceous.

AB  - Agricultural nitrogen loss becomes an increasingly important source of water quality deterioration and eutrophication, even threatens water safety for humanity. Nitrogen dynamic mechanism is still too complicated to be well captured at watershed scale due to its multiple existence forms and instability, disturbance of agricultural management practices. Stereoscopic agriculture is a novel agricultural planting pattern to efficiently use local natural resources (e.g., water, land, sunshine, heat and fertilizer). It is widely promoted as a high yield system and can obtain considerable economic benefits, particularly in China. However, its environmental quality implication is not clear. In our study, Qianyanzhou station is famous for its stereoscopic agriculture pattern of Southern China, and an experimental watershed was selected as our study area. Regional characteristics of runoff and nitrogen losses were simulated by an integrated water system model (HEQM) with multi-objective calibration, and multiple agriculture practices were assessed to find the effective approach for the reduction of diffuse nitrogen losses. Results showed that daily variations of runoff and nitrogen forms were well reproduced throughout watershed, i.e., satisfactory performances for ammonium and nitrate nitrogen (NH4-N and NO3-N) loads, good performances for runoff and organic nitrogen (ON) load, and very good performance for total nitrogen (TN) load. The average loss coefficient was 62.74 kg/ha for NH4-N, 0.98 kg/ha for NO3-N, 0.0004 kg/ha for ON and 63.80 kg/ha for TN. The dominating form of nitrogen losses was NH4-N due to the applied fertilizers, and the most dramatic zones aggregated in the middle and downstream regions covered by paddy and orange orchard. In order to control diffuse nitrogen losses, the most effective practices for Qianyanzhou stereoscopic agriculture pattern were to reduce farmland planting scale in the valley by afforestation, particularly for orchard in the downstream regions, followed by fertilizer application optimization.

AB  - The Australasian red (southern) rock lobster, Jasus edwardsii (Hutton, 1875), has a pelagic larval duration (PLD) of 18-20 mo, which may be the longest PLD of any crustacean. This PLD compares with 8-12 mo for 2 other species of rock lobster that occupy overlapping latitudinal ranges in Australia and New Zealand, Sagmariasus verreauxi and Panulirus cygnus. In this article, we examine 2 hypotheses using a Lagrangian individual-based bio-physical model (IBBM). The first hypothesis is that the long PLD of J. edwardsii occurs simply because it is a cool-water species, and its larvae require longer to develop in the cool ocean temperatures around southern Australia and New Zealand. The second hypothesis is that the long PLD of J. edwardsii evolved because some feature in the ocean circulation around Australia and New Zealand led to selection for longer larval duration. We find that potential settlement around Australia shows strong annual cycles with higher settlement in winter, probably caused by stronger onshore Ekman flow in winter. For larvae hatching in spring, those that can delay metamorphosis for 20-21 mo after hatching can take advantage of this higher potential settlement and thereby increase recruitment. Although we cannot exclude temperature as a factor in the evolution of long PLD, we suggest that the long PLD of J. edwardsii may well be an evolutionary response to these strong annual cycles of oceanic circulation that impact potential settlement.

AB  - Coastal waters corresponding to macrotidal systems are among the most variable marine biotopes. Sessile animals as bivalve mollusks may however be found forming intertidal beds at high densities, as allowed by full adaptation to local conditions. A better knowledge of adaptive responses to environmental factors is required to foresee possible adverse effects of global change. At the sub-cellular level, transcriptional responses are among the earliest signals of environmental disturbances and they can reveal subtle and meaningful changes in organism exposed to stress. Three blue mussel (Mytilus spp.) populations inhabiting the Bay of Brest (France) in sites exposed to different levels of chronic pollution, from low to moderate, were surveyed upon a seasonal schedule, with special attention to the reproductive cycle. Major seawater parameters were monitored over a full-year in the framework of the S! RANO project, based on an automatic high frequency acquisition system installed aboard a ship of opportunity. The health status of mussels has been assessed by measuring a condition index and gametogenesis has been followed by histology. Selected biological responses to environmental stress were detected using a multimarker approach including expression of genes involved in chemical stress response and energetic metabolism, and cellular immune parameters. Environmental parameters showed deep seasonal variations which differed among sites. Most biological responses followed a seasonal pattern. Late winter and spring corresponded to an active reproduction period in the Bay of Brest. Earlier spawning was observed in harbor areas compared to the oceanic site and an altered physiological state was assumed in commercial harbor mussels during the reproductive period, suggesting that their health is compromised at this time of year. However, no signs of severe chemical stress were detected in both harbor mussel populations, which could reflect adaptive responses to adverse environmental conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The key magmatic processes that lead to the formation of large magmatic-hydrothermal porphyry copper mineral deposits remain uncertain, and a particular question is why a few of these deposits, such as the Pebble porphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposit, are strongly enriched in both gold and molybdenum. This study investigated the igneous rocks of the Pebble district and obtained major and trace element compositions, Sr and Nd isotopic compositions, and zircon age and trace element data to model the origin of the ore-forming magmas.
   The Pebble porphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposit, one of the worlds largest Cu-Au resources, formed during the final stages of regional Late Cretaceous arc magmatism (101-88 Ma) in the Southwest Alaska Range. Local pre-mineral intrusions (99-95 Ma) are dominated by alkaline compositions including monzodiorite stocks, shoshonite dikes, and monzonite porphyries, but also include lesser volumes of high-K calc-alkaline diorite and granodiorite sills. The occurrence of early alkaline magmas has been noted at other gold-rich porphyry systems, including Bingham and Kerr-Sulfurets-Mitchell. Mineralization at Pebble is associated with granodiorite to granite porphyry dikes related to the >165 km(2) high-K calc-alkaline Kaskanak granodiorite batholith (91-89 Ma). Over a period of 10 m.y., Late Cretaceous melts evolved from high temperatures (930-730 degrees C) and modestly hydrous and oxidized conditions to relatively low temperatures (760-680 degrees C) and very hydrous and oxidized conditions. Collectively, all Late Cretaceous igneous rocks at Pebble contain magnetite and little or no ilmenite, are metaluminous to weakly peraluminous, and have typical arc trace element enrichments and depletions. They have moderate Sr/Y ratios (20-55) and gently sloped REE profiles (La/Yb = 5-20) that are not adakitic, which supports a source area lacking garnet that is consistent with a thin crust in southwest Alaska.
   Radiogenic isotopes for Late Cretaceous intrusions at Pebble have a restricted range of primitive Sr and Nd isotopic compositions (Sr-87/(86)Sri = 0.703290.70424; epsilon Nd-i = 4.9-6.1), which overlap with volcanic and plutonic basement rocks of the Jurassic Talkeetna Arc along the Alaska Peninsula. The Kaskanak batholith intrudes the Late JurassicEarly Cretaceous Kahiltna flysch, and mixing models using Sr and Nd isotopes indicate that the Kaskanak batholith assimilated <= 10 wt% Kahiltna flysch in amounts that did not likely affect magma fertility. Xenocrystic zircon samples are abundant in Cretaceous pre-mineral intrusions and have U-Pb ages similar to detrital zircon samples in the Kahiltna flysch. These data support some assimilation of upper crustal Kahiltna flysch, but the dominance of DevonianMississippian xenocrystic zircon populations in some intrusions suggests derivation from unexposed older basement.
   The extraordinary endowment of Cu and Au at Pebble is inferred to result from primitive calc-alkaline and alkaline arc magmas and the hydrous and strongly oxidized conditions that suppressed the formation and fractionation of Cu- and Au-enriched sulfide melts. Furthermore, differentiation to silicic compositions was a product of extensive crystal fractionation of parental melts accompanied by minor crustal assimilation. The trace element content of the intermediate composition intrusions indicates that both hornblende and titanite fractionation processes in the mid- to shallow-crust were both required to produce the more evolved granodiorite and granite porphyry compositions. Despite the apparent lack of Mo-enriched continental crust in the region, primitive hydrous melts were produced by protracted arc magmatism and were modified by minor crustal assimilation including early alkaline magmatism, periodic recharge of mafic hydrous basalts and hybrid andesites, and fractional crystallization, which was apparently sufficient to enrich Mo in late stage felsic melts.

AB  - The overall aim of this research was to develop egg freshness prediction models in terms of selected quality indices. Six experiments (4 constant temperatures and 2 variable temperatures) were carried out on hen eggs for a total period of 10, 21, 26, 13, and 105 d at storage temperatures of 30, 20, 20 to 10, 30 to 10, and 5 and 10 degrees C, to observe trends in the relative weight loss (RWL), Haugh unit (HU), yolk index (YI), albumin index (AI), yolk pH, and albumin pH. The results showed that there was an increasing trend in the RWL and a decreasing trend in the YI, AI, and HU for all temperature conditions. The changes in the yolk and albumin pH were not uniform. The data from the constant temperature conditions were used to determine the coefficients of the egg quality prediction models, which consisted of the primary model controlling the change rate of the quality indicator at a temperature condition in differential equation form, and the secondary model controlling the change rate with temperature, which was in quadratic polynomial form. The models were applied to the data from the fluctuating temperature conditions, and the zeroth, third, and eighth order kinetic models described the stepwise change in the RWL, HU, and YI, respectively. The accuracy and bias factor values for the RWL, HU, and YI were 1.116 and 0.940, 1.028 and 1.001, and 1.038 and 0.966, respectively. It can be concluded that the models can be used to predict egg freshness in terms of the RWL, HU, and YI at any temperature condition with in the range of 5 to 30 degrees C during storage.

AB  - The ideas on the evolutionary value of hard inbreeding under conditions of extreme environmental conditions (especially temperatures) for the processes of the formation of adaptive genetic polymorphism and speciation are substantiated. The main manifestations of the paradoxical effect of hard inbreeding include (1) structural and functional reorganization of the genome of generative (reproductive) system and (2) activation of mobile genetic elements. This can lead to the generation of different types of mutations (gene, chromosomal, genomic, and systemic) and heterochromatin modifications.

AB  - Background
   Amphimeriasis is a fish-borne disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimerus spp. that has recently been reported as endemic in the tropical Pacific side of Ecuador with a high prevalence in humans and domestic animals. The diagnosis is based on the stool examination to identify parasite eggs, but it lacks sensitivity. Additionally, the morphology of the eggs may be confounded with other liver and intestinal flukes. No immunological or molecular methods have been developed to date. New diagnostic techniques for specific and sensitive detection of Amphimerus spp. DNA in clinical samples are needed.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   A LAMP targeting a sequence of the Amphimerus sp. internal transcribed spacer 2 region was designed. Amphimerus sp. DNA was obtained from adult worms recovered from animals and used to optimize the molecular assays. Conventional PCR was performed using outer primers F3-B3 to verify the proper amplification of the Amphimerus sp. DNA target sequence. LAMP was optimized using different reaction mixtures and temperatures, and it was finally set up as LAMPhimerus. The specificity and sensitivity of both PCR and LAMP were evaluated. The detection limit was 1 pg of genomic DNA. Field testing was done using 44 human stool samples collected from localities where fluke is endemic. Twenty-five samples were microscopy positive for Amphimerus sp. eggs detection. In molecular testing, PCR F3-B3 was ineffective when DNA from fecal samples was used. When testing all human stool samples included in our study, the diagnostic parameters for the sensitivity and specificity were calculated for our LAMPhimerus assay, which were 76.67% and 80.77%, respectively.
   Conclusions/Significance
   We have developed and evaluated, for the first time, a specific and sensitive LAMP assay for detecting Amphimerus sp. in human stool samples. The procedure has been named LAMPhimerus method and has the potential to be adapted for field diagnosis and disease surveillance in amphimeriasis-endemic areas. Future large-scale studies will assess the applicability of this novel LAMP assay.

AB  - Withstanding extinction while facing rapid climate change depends on a species' ability to track its ecological niche or to evolve a new one. Current methods that predict climate-driven species' range shifts use ecological modelling without eco-evolutionary dynamics. Here we present an eco-evolutionary forecasting framework that combines niche modelling with individual-based demographic and genetic simulations. Applying our approach to four endemic perennial plant species of the Austrian Alps, we show that accounting for eco-evolutionary dynamics when predicting species' responses to climate change is crucial. Perennial species persist in unsuitable habitats longer than predicted by niche modelling, causing delayed range losses; however, their evolutionary responses are constrained because long-lived adults produce increasingly maladapted offspring. Decreasing population size due to maladaptation occurs faster than the contraction of the species range, especially for the most abundant species. Monitoring of species' local abundance rather than their range may likely better inform on species' extinction risks under climate change.

AB  - The beta-form crystals in isotactic polypropylene (iPP) are proved to be favorable and effective for developing general iPP plastics with high performance. Herein, sustainable eggshell power decorated with calcium pimelate (DES), an effective beta-form nucleating agent for iPP, was fabricated via the interaction between pimelic acid and Ca2+ on the surface of eggshell powder at elevated temperature. DSC and FTIR analysis identified the reaction occurred and formation of calcium pimelate on surface of the eggshell powder. Then, the effects of the functionalized eggshell powder on the nonisothermal and isothermal crystallization behavior, melting characteristics and polymorph structures were investigated. From the nonisothermal crystallization experiments, the incorporation of supported beta-form nucleator greatly enhanced the crystallization temperature of iPP. The content of beta-form crystals (K (beta)) could reach a value as high as 87% at 5 mass% DES load. Moreover, the crystallization and melting characteristics of iPP nucleated by DES were not changed under multiple scan conditions with melt temperature range from 190 to 250 A degrees C. Interestingly, from the investigation of isothermal crystallization and subsequent melting behavior, it was found that DES is a temperature-dependent selective nucleator for inducing iPP crystallization. Main alpha-form crystals or beta-form crystals could form when using high or low crystallization temperatures, respectively. Particularly, these results demonstrated a possibility to tailor the ratio of alpha-form crystals to beta-form crystals by simply choosing isothermal crystallization conditions. Then the crystallization mechanism based on thermodynamics and kinetics factors was further discussed.

AB  - Phenotypic traits such as ornaments and armaments are generally shaped by sexual selection, which often favours larger and more elaborate males compared to females. But can sexual selection also influence the brain? Previous studies in vertebrates report contradictory results with no consistent pattern between variation in brain structure and the strength of sexual selection. We hypothesize that sexual selection will act in a consistent way on two vertebrate brain regions that directly regulate sexual behaviour: the medial preoptic nucleus (MPON) and the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN). The MPON regulates male reproductive behaviour whereas the VMN regulates female reproductive behaviour and is also involved in male aggression. To test our hypothesis, we used high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging combined with traditional histology of brains in 14 dragon lizard species of the genus Ctenophorus that vary in the strength of precopulatory sexual selection. Males belonging to species that experience greater sexual selection had a larger MPON and a smaller VMN. Conversely, females did not show any patterns of variation in these brain regions. As the volumes of both these regions also correlated with brain volume (BV) in our models, we tested whether they show the same pattern of evolution in response to changes in BV and found that the do. Therefore, we show that the primary brain nuclei underlying reproductive behaviour in vertebrates can evolve in a mosaic fashion, differently between males and females, likely in response to sexual selection, and that these same regions are simultaneously evolving in concert in relation to overall brain size.

AB  - Future climate change will have far reaching consequences for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, the majority of whom depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Here we assessed the farm-level impact of climate change on family food self-sufficiency and evaluated potential adaptation options of crop management. Using three years of experimental data on maize and millet from an area in southern Mali representing the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa we calibrated and tested the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model. Changes in future rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature and their simulated effects on maize and millet yield were analysed for climate change predictions of five Global Circulation Models (GCMs) for the 4.5 Wm(-2) and 8.5 Wm(-2) radiative forcing scenario (rcp4.5 and rcp8.5).
   In southern Mali, annual maximum and minimum temperatures will increase by 2.9 degrees C and 33 degrees C by the mid-century (2040-2069) as compared with the baseline (1980-2009) under the rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 scenario respectively. Predicted changes in the total seasonal rainfall differed between the GCMs, but on average, seasonal rainfall was predicted not to change. By mid-century maize grain yields were predicted to decrease by 51% and 57% under current farmer's fertilizer practices in the rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 scenarios respectively. APSIM model predictions indicated that the use of mineral fertilizer at recommended rates cannot fully offset the impact of climate change but can buffer the losses in maize yield up to 46% and 51% of the baseline yield. Millet yield losses were predicted to be less severe under current farmer's fertilizer practices by mid-century i.e. 7% and 12% in the rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 scenario respectively. Use of mineral fertilizer on millet can offset the predicted yield losses resulting in yield increases under both emission scenarios.
   Under future climate and current cropping practices, food availability is expected to reduce for all farm types in southern Mali. However, large and medium-sized farms can still achieve food self-sufficiency if early planting and recommended rates of fertilizer are applied. Small farms, which are already food insecure, will experience a further decrease in food self-sufficiency, with adaptive measures of early planting and fertilizer use unable to help them achieve food self-sufficiency. By taking into account the diversity in farm households that is typical for the region, we illustrated that crop management strategies must be tailored to the capacity and resource endowment of local farmers. Our place-based findings can support decision making by extension and development agents and policy makers in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A series of piston cylinder experiments were conducted to determine the partition coefficient of Cu between amphibole and andesitic to rhyolitic silicate melts. The experiments were run at T = 740-990 degrees C, P = 0.7 GPa, oxygen fugacity (fO(2)) ranging from that of the Ni-NiO buffer (NNO) to 2.3 log units higher (NNO + 2.3 and dissolved water in variable concentrations (under-saturated to saturated conditions). Fixed metal activities were imposed by using Au97Cu3 and Au92Cu8 alloy capsules, which allowed simultaneously determination of Cu solubility. Our data demonstrate that Cu solubilities in both the silicate melt and amphibole decrease with decreasing temperature. The solubility of Cu decreases by a factor of 6 from 990 to 740 degrees C in equilibrium with andesitic to rhyolitic melt compositions. The average amphibole/silicate melt partition coefficient of Cu [D-cu, (amph/melt)] is 0.066 +/- 0.006, and is essentially constant without showing any correlation with silicate melt composition, dissolved water concentration, temperature or fO(2).
   The low D-cu' (amph/melt) value suggests that amphibole crystallizing at any stage of calc-alkaline magma evolution is unable to scavenge a significant fraction of the initially available Cu from the melt. However, D-cu (amph/ melt) is high enough to yield precisely measurable Cu concentrations in natural amphiboles. As D-cu (amph/melt) results constant along the liquid line of descent of calc-alkaline magmas, amphibole compositions may thus be used as a proxy to monitor the evolution of the Cu concentration in the silicate melt (not the bulk magma if sulfide is present). This may be useful for understanding the metallogenic evolution of intrusive rocks, in which silicate melt inclusions in minerals are generally absent. As most porphyry-type Cu ore deposits are associated with upper crustal intrusions, in-situ microanalysis of inclusion-free amphiboles in such rocks may help understand ore genesis and might also be used in mineral exploration to assess the fertility of prospective magmatic systems.

AB  - Nitrification inhibitors reduce the rate of transformation of ammonium to nitrate, which may increase ammonia volatilization from urea-based N fertilizers. The objective of this study was to quantify ammonia volatilization from surface-applied granular urea treated with combinations of NBPT and the nitrification inhibitors, DCD and nitrapyrin, under controlled laboratory conditions for three soils. Nine laboratory trials evaluated select combinations of application rates for NBPT, DCD, and nitrapyrin-treated urea. Trials were conducted on three soils selected for differences in pH, organic matter, and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Cumulative N loss as ammonia from untreated granular urea was 40.1, 44.5, and 38.2% of applied N for the Raub, Wheeling, and Pella soils, respectively. When the urease inhibitor, NBPT was applied alone at 900 mg NBPT kg(-1) urea, N loss through volatilization was reduced 48.5, 43.3, and 77.9% for the Raub, Wheeling and Pella soil types, respectively. Of the soil tested, cation exchange, texture, and organic matter had the greatest impact on the rate and cumulative ammonia loss from surface-applied untreated urea and urea treated with the urease/nitrification inhibitors. Nitrification inhibitors prevented the conversion of ammonium to nitrate by DCD and nitrapyrin, increasing ammonia losses of N in five out of six trials compared to untreated urea. When using nitrification inhibitors with surface-applied urea, ammonia losses were decreased with the application of NBPT as well.

AB  - Selective laser melting (SLM) is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique that uses powders to fabricate 3Dparts directly. The objective of this paper is to perform an experimental investigation of selective laser melted 17-4PH stainless steel. The investigation involved the influence of separate processing parameters on the density, defect, microhardness and the influence of heat-treatment on the mechanical properties. The outcomes of this study show that scan velocity and slice thickness have significant effects on the density and the characteristics of pores of the SLMed parts. The effect of hatch spacing depends on scan velocity. The processing parameters, such as scan velocity, hatch spacing and slice thickness, have effect on microhardness. Compared to the samples with no heat-treatment, the yield strength of the heat treated sample increases significantly and the elongation decreases due to the transformation of microstructure and the changes in the precipitation strengthening phases. By a combination of changes in composition and precipitation strengthening, microhardness improved. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The nutritional value of animal feed primarily depends on its chemical composition (content of crude protein, crude ash, crude fibre, crude fat and nitrogen-free extracts), which is to some extent determined by fertilization with sulphur. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of different sulphur application regimes on selected quality parameters of cocksfoot Dactylis glomerata L. A field experiment was conducted on brown eutrophic soil. Sulphur was applied in two doses: 10 kg S ha(-1), and 20 kg S ha(-1). In addition, each experimental treatment was fertilized with 120 kg N ha(-1), 30 kg P ha(-1), 100 kg K ha(-1), and 15 kg Mg ha(-1). During the growing period from March to September, air temperature and precipitation were monitored. Fertilization with sulphur was found to affect the content of crude fibre, crude ash, crude fat, cystine and methionine in cocksfoot, while no correlation was observed between the content of these chemical components and the weather conditions. The concentration of nitrogen-free extracts did not vary significantly in response to sulphur application, but the content of these compounds correlated with the average precipitation sum, air temperature, and Selyaninov's coefficient. Sulphur application did not affect the crude protein content, which was significantly correlated with the temperature and Selyaninov's coefficient during the growing season of cocksfoot. The results of the field experiment suggest that sulphur fertilization of cocksfoot increased the quality of the fodder.

CP  - 15th International Symposium on Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC)
AB  - An advanced flexible solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stack concept with the potential for increased reliability, better performance and lower cost is being developed. This stack concept integrates prime-surface interconnects and single cells into a lightweight and compact structure with reliable gas seals for efficient operation at various temperatures depending on selected materials. The concept has several attractive features including reduced stack weight and volume, decreased in performance losses in stacking, improved sealing, versatility in incorporation of different types of cell construction (for example, conventional sintered ceramic cells or metal-supported cells) and flexibility in gas flow configuration. The prime-surface interconnect is a one-piece metal sheet that incorporates both fuel and oxidant flow fields with peaks on one side of the interconnect serving as flow channels (valleys) on the other side, for example, the egg-carton shaped prime-surface flow field. The design of the prime-surface interconnect including the key factors impact on pressure drop, flow uniformity and formability is being evaluated. Hydroforming has been identified as the forming approach for prime surface interconnects. Development of metal-supported cells has been initiated. A fabrication process based on sputtering is being developed for producing cells on metal supports for this stack concept.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) has a key role in the global carbon (C) cycle. The complex relationships among the components of C cycle make the modelling of SOC variation difficult. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are models capable to determine interrelationships based on information. The objective was to develop and evaluate models based on the ANN technique to estimate the SOC in Mollisols of the Southeastern of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina (SEBA). Data from three long term experiments were used. Management and meteorological variables were selected as input. Management information included numerical variables (initial SOC (SOCI); number of years from the beginning of the experiment (Year), proportion of soybean in the crop sequence; (Prop soybean); crop yields (Yield), proportion of cropping in the crop rotation (Prop agri), and categorical variables (Crop, Tillage). In addition, two meteorological inputs (minimum (Tmin) and mean air temperature (Tmed)), were selected. The ANNs were adequate to estimate SOC in the upper 0.20 m of Mollisols of the SEBA. The model with the best performance included six management variables (SOCI, Year, Prop soybean, Tillage, Yield, Prop agri) and one meteorological variable (Tmin), all of them easily available and with low level of uncertainty. Soil organic C changes related to soil use in the SEBA could be satisfactorily estimated using an ANN developed with simple and easily available input variables. Artificial neural network technique appears as a valuable tool to develop robust models to help predicting SOC changes.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the co-composting of an inorganic industrial waste (eggshell - ES) in very high levels (up to 60% w/w).
   Since composting is a process in which solid, liquid and gaseous phases interact in a very complex way, there is a need to shed light on statistical tools that can unravel the main relationships structuring the variability associated to this process. In this study, PCA and data visualisation were used with that purpose.
   The co-composting tests were designed with increasing quantities of ES (0, 10, 20, 30 and 60%ES w/w) mixed with industrial potato peel and rice husks. Principal component analysis showed that physical properties like free air space, bulk density and moisture are the most relevant variables for explaining the variability due to ES content. On the other hand, variability in time dynamics is mostly driven by some chemical and phytoxicological parameters, such as organic matter decay and nitrate content. Higher ES incorporation (60% ES) enhanced the initial biological activity of the mixture, but the higher bulk density and lower water holding capacity had a negative effect on the aerobic biological activity as the process evolved. Nevertheless, pathogen-killing temperatures (>70 degrees C for 11 h) were attained. All the final products obtained after 90 days were stable and non-phytotoxic. This work proved that valorisation of high amounts of eggshell by co-composting is feasible, but prone to be influenced by the physical properties of the mixtures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A study of single-phase convection and flow condensation heat transfer in horizontal copper tubes (8.81 mm inside diameter) was conducted using three refrigerants (HCFC-22, HFC-134a and HFC-410A). A smooth tube and three micro-fin tubes (axial, helical and crosshatch enhancement) were examined. Local-mean flow condensation data were experimentally obtained. Experimental conditions were selected to reflect typical operating conditions encountered in refrigeration and air-conditioning applications. All micro-fin tubes illustrated significant enhancement in single-phase convection and flow condensation. The cross-hatch enhancement performed particularly better in both single-phase convection and flow condensation. For the three refrigerants investigated, the refrigerant type seemed to have little influence on the enhancement mechanism of the micro-fin tubes examined. The experimental results are presented in Part I. Development of design equations is presented in Part II.

AB  - This study proposes a novel approach for controlling frictional performances at paper clutch systems by a combination of organic friction modifiers (OFMs). The OFMs are commonly used for modifying the frictional properties at the paper clutch. Although the effect of the OFMs tends to be dependent on temperature due to their working mechanism based on the surface adsorption, the frictional properties are preferable to be stable in all the operating temperature for the consistent and precise clutch control. Aiming to modify the temperature dependence of the OFM effect, an OFM with an Advanced Concept (FMAC) was newly developed, and the impact on the clutch frictional performance was investigated using Low Velocity Friction Apparatus (LVFA). Only with the conventional OFM, the friction values experienced excessive reduction at 80 or 120 degrees C, while an optimal property was achieved at 40 degrees C. In the presence of the FMAC, it was possible to inhibit the conventional OFM selectively at the high temperature conditions preventing the friction reduction, leading to the ideal frictional property in all the temperature conditions. The surface analysis revealed that the FMACs were capable of adsorbing on the substrate more intensively at high temperature, which should be the reason of the temperature dependent competitive effect of the FMACs.

AB  - Minor actinide (MA) accumulated in spent fuel is the primary contributor to the long-term radiological hazards of high-level nuclear waste. Due to its outstanding features such as fast neutron spectrum, no fuel assembly fabrication, on-line refueling and reprocessing, Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) is regarded as one of the candidate reactors for MA incineration. In the present work, we evaluate the MA incineration capability for a 500 MWth FLiNaK MSFR by considering on-line MA feeding into the fuel salt and/or U-233 extraction from the fertile salt, where the initial FLiNaK fuel salt is composed of 70 mol% (LiF4, NaF and KF) and 30 mol% (ThF4, (UF4)-U-233 and MAF(3)). The simulated results show that, during a 50-year operation, the MA incineration efficiency with on-line MA feeding and U-233 extraction scenario is significantly higher compared with the case without either MA feeding or U-233 extraction. Based on the scenario of online MA feeding and U-233 extraction, the initial MA loading is further adjusted to keep a small excess reactivity during the whole operation. And the MA incineration amount, the depletion ratio between MA and total heavy nuclides and the MA incineration efficiency at 50-year operating time are 7301 kg, 77.4% and 33.3 kg/TWh, respectively, with a doubling time of 39-year for U-233 breeding. We also analyze and discuss the evolutions of the fuel temperature feedback coefficient, the effective delayed neutron fraction and the intensity of spontaneous fission neutron during the whole operating time.

AB  - Organisms use endogenous clocks to anticipate regular environmental cycles, such as days and tides. Natural variants resulting in differently timed behaviour or physiology, known as chronotypes in humans, have not been well characterized at the molecular level. We sequenced the genome of Clunio marinus, a marine midge whose reproduction is timed by circadian and circalunar clocks. Midges from different locations show strain-specific genetic timing adaptations. We examined genetic variation in five C. marinus strains from different locations and mapped quantitative trait loci for circalunar and circadian chronotypes. The region most strongly associated with circadian chronotypes generates strain-specific differences in the abundance of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II.1 (CaMKII. 1) splice variants. As equivalent variants were shown to alter CaMKII activity in Drosophila melanogaster, and C. marinus (Cma)-CaMKII.1 increases the transcriptional activity of the dimer of the circadian proteins Cma-CLOCK and Cma-CYCLE, we suggest that modulation of alternative splicing is a mechanism for natural adaptation in circadian timing.

AB  - To protect soils against threats, it is necessary to predict the consequences of human activities and global change on their evolution on a ten to hundred year time scale. Mechanistic modelling of soil evolution is then a useful tool. We analysed the ability of the SoilGen model to be used for projections of soil characteristics associated to various soil threats: vertical distributions of <2 mu m fraction, organic carbon content (OC), bulk density and pH. This analysis took the form of a functional sensitivity analysis in which we varied the initial conditions (parent material properties) and boundary conditions (co-evolution of precipitation and temperature; type and amount of fertilization and tillage as well as duration of agriculture). The simulated scenario variants comprised anthroposequences in Luvisols at two sites with one default scenario, six variants for initial conditions and 12 variants for boundary conditions. The variants reflect the uncertainties to our knowledge of parent material properties or reconstructed boundary conditions.
   We demonstrated a sensitivity of the model to climate and agricultural practices for all properties. We also conclude that final model results are not significantly affected by the uncertainties of boundary conditions for long simulations runs, although influenced by uncertainties on initial conditions.
   The best results were for organic carbon, although improvements can be reached through calibration or by incorporating a dynamic vegetation growth module in SoilGen. Results were poor for bulk density due to a fixed-volume assumption in the model, which is not easily modified. The <2 mu m fraction depth patterns are reasonable but the process of clay new formation needs to be added to obtain the belly shape of the Bt horizon.
   After calibration for organic carbon under agriculture, the model is suitable for producing soil projections due to global change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Interest in fresh, functional foods is on the rise, compelled by the growing interest of consumers for diets that support health and longevity. Microgreens garner immense potential for adapting leafy vegetable production to a micro-scale and for improving nutritional value in human diet. Scope and approach: Major preharvest factors of microgreens production, such as species selection, fertilization, biofortification, lighting and growth stage at harvest are addressed with respect to crop physiology and quality, as well as postharvest handling and applications, temperature, atmospheric composition, lighting and packaging technology which influence shelf-life and microbial safety. Key prospects for future research aiming to enhance quality and shelf-life of microgreens are highlighted. Key findings and conclusions: Effective non-chemical treatments for seed surface sterilization and antimicrobial action, pre-sowing treatments to standardize and shorten the production cycle and crop specific information on the interaction of sowing rate with yield and quality deserve further attention. Indigenous landraces, underutilized crops and wild edible plants constitute a vast repository for selection of genetic material for microgreens. Modular fertilization may fortify microgreens bioactive content and augment their sensorial attributes. Pre- and postharvest select-waveband, intensity and photoperiod combinations can elicit compound-specific improvements in functional quality and in shelf-life. Research is needed to identify effective sanitizers and drying methods non-abusive on quality and shelf-life for commercialization of ready-to-eat packaged microgreens. Genotypic variability in postharvest chilling sensitivity and the interactions of temperature, light conditions and packaging gas permeability should be further examined to establish environments suppressive on respiration but preventive of off-odor development.

AB  - An uncertainty quantification analysis is performed to further investigate the nature of the "two-stage" wear process of the paper-based friction lining in a wet clutch. In this approach, the results of a computerized wear prediction model are examined through sensitivity analysis and a model validation that utilizes the Monte Carlo (MC) method. Extensive computational results that take into account the uncertainty and variability in the input data are presented to gain insight into the evolution of temperature and wear during the engagement process.

AB  - Steep genetic clines resulting from recent secondary contact between previously isolated taxa can either gradually erode over time or be stabilized by factors such as ecological selection or selection against hybrids. We used patterns of variation in 30 nuclear and two mitochondrial SNPs to examine the factors that could be involved in stabilizing clines across a hybrid zone between two subspecies of the Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus. Increased heterozygote deficit and cytonuclear disequilibrium in populations near the center of the mtDNA cline suggest that some form of reproductive isolation such as assortative mating or selection against hybrids may be acting in this hybrid zone. However, only a small number of loci exhibited these signatures, suggesting locus-specific, rather than genomewide, factors. Fourteen of the 32 loci surveyed had cline widths inconsistent with neutral expectations, with two SNPs in the mitochondrial genome exhibiting the steepest clines. Seven of the 12 putatively non-neutral nuclear clines were for SNPs in genes related to oxidative metabolism. Among these putatively non-neutral nuclear clines, SNPs in two nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes (SLC25A3 and HDDC2), as well as SNPs in the myoglobin, 40S ribosomal protein S17, and actin-binding LIM protein genes, had clines that were coincident and concordant with the mitochondrial clines. When hybrid index was calculated using this subset of loci, the frequency distribution of hybrid indices for a population located at the mtDNA cline center was non-unimodal, suggesting selection against advanced-generation hybrids, possibly due to effects on processes involved in oxidative metabolism.

AB  - Background: Prior studies including the Framingham Heart Study have suggested associations between single components of air pollution and vascular function; however, underlying mixtures of air pollution may have distinct associations with vascular function.
   Methods: We used a k-means approach to construct five distinct pollution mixtures from elemental analyses of particle filters, air pollution monitoring data, and meteorology. Exposure was modeled as an interaction between fine particle mass (PM2.5), and concurrent pollution cluster. Outcome variables were two measures of microvascular function in the fingertip in the Framingham Offspring and Third Generation cohorts from 2003 to 2008.
   Results: In 1,720 participants, associations between PM2.5 and baseline pulse amplitude tonometry differed by air pollution cluster (interaction P value 0.009). Higher PM2.5 on days with low mass concentrations but high proportion of ultrafine particles from traffic was associated with 18% (95% confidence interval: 4.6%, 33%) higher baseline pulse amplitude per 5 g/m(3) and days with high contributions of oil and wood combustion with 16% (95% confidence interval: 0.2%, 34%) higher baseline pulse amplitude. We observed no variation in associations of PM2.5 with hyperemic response to ischemia observed across air pollution clusters.
   Conclusions: PM2.5 exposure from air pollution mixtures with large contributions of local ultrafine particles from traffic, heating oil, and wood combustion was associated with higher baseline pulse amplitude but not hyperemic response. Our findings suggest little association between acute exposure to air pollution clusters reflective of select sources and hyperemic response to ischemia, but possible associations with excessive small artery pulsatility with potentially deleterious microvascular consequences.

AB  - Climate changes are expected to be greatest in the polar and temperate areas, where predictions point to an increase in freeze-thaw events and changes in precipitation, evaporation, and salinity patterns. These events will therefore affect biological activity of the soil compartment that may result in large impacts in ecosystem functioning and dynamics therein. This concern becomes even more important when considering the presence of contaminants due to intense anthropogenic activity, which may lead to synergistic or antagonistic effects and increase or decrease the impact on natural ecosystems. This paper reviews the effect of physical and chemical stressors on enchytraeids, with special emphasis on Enchytraeus albidus because most relevant studies have involved this species. E. albidus is a freeze-tolerant and euryhaline organism and several studies suggest that the absence of salinity may have important (negative) consequences not only for their freeze tolerance ability but also for their reproduction and capacity to deal with the presence of contaminants, such as metals and fungicides. Single and joint effects of constant freezing or freeze-thaw cycles and surfactants, such as 4-nonylphenol, affected negatively E. albidus freeze tolerance by decreasing the levels of cryoprotectants, membrane fluidity and interfering with cellular energy allocation. Because enchytraeids are of ecological significance in many important habitats along the Artic and cold-temperate environments, a reduction in abundance may result in disturbances of the decomposition processes in soils. The knowledge of the biological, physiological, and biochemical limits of enchytraeids to combined effect of physical and chemical stressors are crucial to provide a scientific basis for improving the setting of safety factors when extrapolating from controlled (and optimal) laboratory conditions to natural soil ecosystems. Therefore, there is a need to expand and evolve experiments that more realistically mimic the situation in the field, where interactions between factors are highly relevant. The synergistic or antagonistic interactions identified in the present review may also represent a stepping stone in the evaluation and possible inclusion of natural factors, like cold and salinity, in standardized enchytraeid test guidelines and consequently in risk assessment of chemicals.

AB  - In this paper, we show how the results of phase equilibria calculations in different mantle compositions can be reconciled with the evidence from natural mantle samples. We present data on the response of bulk rock density to pressure (P), temperature (T) and compositional changes in the lithospheric mantle and obtain constraints on the P-T evolution recorded by mantle xenoliths. To do this, we examine the mantle xenolith suite from the Quaternary alkali basalts of Pali-Aike, Patagonia, using phase equilibria calculation in six representative compositions. The calculations were done subsolidus and in volatilefree conditions. Our results show that the density change related to the spinel peridotite to garnet peridotite transition is not sharp and strongly depends on the bulk composition. In a depleted mantle composition, this transition is not reflected in the density profile, while in a fertile mantle it leads to a relative increase in density with respect to more depleted compositions. In mantle sections characterized by hot geothermal gradients (similar to 70 mW/m(2)), the spinel-garnet transition may overlap with the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Phase equilibria calculations in peridotitic compositions representative of the Pali-Aike mantle were also used to constrain the origin and evolution of the mantle xenoliths. Our results indicate that the mineral modes and compositions, and the mineral zonation reported for the low-temperature peridotites (spinel and spinel + garnet harzburgites and lherzolites), are linked to a cooling event in the mantle which occurred long before the eruption of the host basalts. In addition, our phase equilibria calculations show that kelyphitic rims around garnets, as those observed in the high-temperature garnet peridotites from Pali-Aike, can be explained simply by decompression and do not require additional metasomatic fluid or melt.

AB  - The invasive pest Drosophila suzukii is characterized by a specific fresh-fruit targeting behavior and has quickly become a menace for the fruit economy of newly infested North American and European regions. D. suzukii carries a strain of the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia, named wSuz, which has a low infection frequency and no reproductive manipulation capabilities in American populations of D. suzukii. To further understand the nature of wSuz biology and assess its utility as a tool for controlling this pest's populations, we investigated the prevalence of Wolbachia in 23 European D. suzukii populations, and compared our results with those available in American populations. Our data showed a highly variable infection frequency with a mean prevalence of 46%, which is significantly higher than the 17% found in American populations. Based on Multilocus Sequence Typing analysis, a single wSuz strain was diagnosed in all European populations of D. suzukii. In agreement with American data, we found no evidence of cytoplasmic incompatibility induced by wSuz. These findings raise two questions: a) why Wolbachia is maintained in field populations of D. suzukii and b) what are the selective forces responsible for the variation in prevalence within populations, particularly between European and American continents? Our results provide new insights into the D. suzukii-Wolbachia association and highlight regional variations that await further investigation and that should be taken into account for using Wolbachia-based pest management programs.

AB  - The spatial and seasonal alteration in a battery of biomarkers responses (enzymatic activity of glutathione S-transferase, catalase and acetylcholinesterase and lipid peroxidation) were investigated to assess the metal derived effects in clam (Ruditapes decussatus) gills, collected from Tunis lagoon (Tunisia). Trace metals (Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, V and Zn) concentrations were assessed seasonally in sediments and tissues of R. decussatus from three different sites (S1, S2 and S3). Bioaccumulation factor (BAF) analysis showed a spatio-temporal variation of metal uptake rates in clams through sediments. Likewise, the multibiomarker approach enabled a time-site trend differentiation between sites with distinctive degrees of anthropogenic contamination. Site S2 was identified as the most impacted region due to the presence of different contamination sources (shipping and industrial activities). The results suggest that biomarker's seasonal variation arises from a complex interaction between environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, salinity) and probably biological factors (mainly the reproduction process) along with anthropogenic pressure. The general biological response measured with the IBR index at all the sampling sites revealed the highest metabolic stress in summer. The combined effects of metal contamination and increased temperature and salinity in summer appear to induce the highest metabolic adaptation response. The selected biomarkers provided an integrated response, which is useful for the assessment of the combined effects of metal contamination and abiotic parameters in clams and the environmental status of coastal lagoon ecosystem.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of using lycopene and organic minerals in diets for laying hens on the egg quality and stability of eggs stored for 30 days under different storage environments. An entirely randomized design was adopted in 2x3x3 factorial scheme (mineral sources x lycopene levels x storage periods) with six replicates of eight hens per experimental unit. The experimental diets were: feed containing inorganic minerals (IM) without added lycopene; IM with added lycopene (400mg kg(-1)); IM with added lycopene (800mg kg(-1)); organic minerals (OM) without added lycopene; OM with added lycopene (400mg kg(-1)); OM with added lycopene (800mg kg(-1)). After 112 days of feeding experimental diets, it was selected 60 eggs treatment(-1), which were later labeled, stored in room and refrigerated temperature, and subjected to different storage periods (0, 15 and 30 days). Variables analyzed were: Haugh unit, yolk index, yolk color, albumen and yolk pH, and lipid oxidation (TBARS). Stability of eggs is not altered as a function of mineral sources and levels of lycopene studied. However, increasing storage time affects the quality of the eggs of laying hens at both storage conditions.

AB  - Antimony is becoming an increasingly critical element as the supply-demand gap is expected to exceed 10% over the period 2015-2020. Antimony production is primarily concentrated in China (90%) and as the industrial demand for this metal surges, attention has to turn towards the recovery of antimony from (industrial) waste residues and end-of-life products in order to guarantee a sustainable supply of antimony. Although lamp phosphor waste is usually considered as a source of rare earths, it also contains significant amounts of antimony in the form of the white halophosphate phosphor (Ca,Sr)(5)(PO4)(3)(Cl,F):Sb3+, Mn2+ (HALO). HALO phosphor readily dissolves in dilute acidic conditions, making antimony far more accessible than in the main production route which is the energy intensive processing of stibnite ore (Sb2S3). HALO makes up 50 wt% of the lamp phosphor waste, but it has been systematically overlooked and treated as an undesired residue in the efforts to recover rare earths from lamp phosphor waste. In this paper, the feasibility of antimony recovery is discussed and an efficient process is proposed. The HALO phosphor is first dissolved in dilute HCl at room temperature, followed by a selective extraction of antimony with the ionic liquid Aliquat (R) 336. The remaining leachate is valorized as apatite which is a feed for the phosphate and fertilizer industry. A zero-waste valorization approach was followed, meaning that no residue or waste was accepted and that all the elements were converted into useful products. This paper thus emphasizes the potential of lamp phosphor waste as a secondary source of antimony and describes a sustainable process to recover it. The process can be integrated in lamp phosphor recycling schemes aimed at recovering rare earths.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most serious threats the world faces. It will have disproportionate impacts on millions of poor rural people in Ethiopia. For development work to be effective, it should not only help rural people emerge from poverty, it should also enable them to cope with and mitigate the impact of climate change. Agriculture is the human enterprise that is most vulnerable to climate change, because of the subsistence nature of the farming practices. Farmer's adaptive capacity is constrained by a lack of economic and technical resources, and they are vulnerable due to a strong dependence on rain-fed crops. While agroforestry may play a significant role in mitigating the atmospheric accumulation of Greenhouse Gases (GHG), it also has a role to play in helping smallholder farmers adapt to climate change. This paper examines the mitigation and adaptation potential of home garden and tree-based agroforestry systems. The planting of fast growing and nitrogen fixing trees and shrubs releases nitrogen for crop growth and save fertilizers. They also buffer climate extremes and temperature increases. Within the Sodo reforestation project mainly Grevillea robusta is used due to its improvements by fixing nitrogen without chemical effects on the soil. The research focuses on the role of agroforestry in both mitigation and adaptation to climate change. It is recommended that in low-income and food-deficit regions livelihoods including food security and climate change cannot be tackled in isolation.

AB  - Due to its significant reliance on weather patterns, as well as other environmental factors, agricultural production is particularly vulnerable to changes in climate. Adoption of climate change mitigating strategies are key to coping and building resilience against the vagaries of climate change and hence, increasing agricultural poverty, and lifting rural smallholder farmers out of poverty and food insecurity. This study analyzed the factors influencing the adoption of climate change mitigating measures by smallholder farmers in Imo State, Nigeria. Multi-stage sampling technique was used is selecting 60 respondents were used for the study. Primary data, collected using structured questionnaire, were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical tools such as frequency counts and percentages, mean, likert scale type analysis and probit regression. Results showed that unusual early rains followed by weeks of dryness, high temperature, incidence of diseases, heavy rainfall, decrease in soil fertility, increase in pest problems, erratic rainfall pattern, loss of forest resources, reduced harmattan, flooding, soil erosion, heavy winds, thunderstorms, heavy and long period of rainfall, weed infestation, overflowing of rivers and streams, and extinction of some crop species were some of the major effects or manifestations of climate change and they have severe effect on crop production. Also, climate change mitigation measures mostly adopted by the farmers were drainage/flood barrier construction, multiple cropping, mulching, use of improved varieties of crops, change of planting date, irrigation of crops, planting of cover crops, and tree planting. The probit regression showed that the significant variables influencing adoption of climate change mitigation measures were age of the farmer, farming experience, tenancy status, years of education, extension contact, income, access to credit and membership of farmers' association. Education and training of farmers especially as it pertains adoption of good agricultural practices was recommended, as well as the provision of credit to enable them adopt mitigation measures to climate change.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus, a commonly found pathogen, can cause food poisoning and infections. Thus, it is necessary to develop analytical methods for the rapid screening of S. aureus in suspicious samples. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are widely used as affinity probes to selectively enrich target species from complex samples because of their high specific surface area and magnetic properties. The MNP surface should be functionalized to have the capability to target specific species. We herein propose a straightforward method to functionalize aluminum oxide-coated iron oxide (Fe3O4@Al2O3) MNPs with the peptide HHHHHHDEEGLFVD (D). The peptide D was comprised of three domains: polyhistidine (H-6) used as the linker, DEE added as the spacer, and GLFVD used for targeting S. aureus. D was immobilized on the surface of Fe3O4@Al2O3 MNPs through H-6-Al chelation. Our results showed that the D-functionalized Fe3O4@Al2O3 MNPs (D-Fe3O4 MNPs) possess the capability to target S. aureus. The selective trapping experiments were conducted under microwave-heating for only 60 s, and sufficient bacterial cells were trapped by the MNPs to be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). We demonstrated that the D-Fe3O4@Al2O3 MNPs combined with MALDI-MS can be used to rapidly characterize trace amounts of S. aureus in complex juice and egg samples.

AB  - Fertilization of Pinus radiata plantations mid-rotation after thinning can alter soil nitrogen availability. However, the magnitudes and durations of tree and stand growth responses are not well understood across different soils with specific site conditions. Two mid-rotation fertilization trials in Pinus radiata plantations with unexpected sustained growth responses for more than 6 years and volume gains of 25 m(3) ha(-1) and 50 m(3) ha(-1) in sandy and granitic soils, respectively, and one trial with no response to fertilization were selected to study the monthly dynamics of nitrogen availability and net mineralization using in situ core incubations. After 2 years, the results showed that fertilization increased nitrogen mineralization and availability until 6 years in sandy soil and until 7 years in granitic soil following fertilization. This result explained the sustained stand growth response observed at these sites. When considering the magnitude of the response, large increases in mineralization rates and soil N availability were observed in the granitic soil relative to the sandy soils. Our results suggest that stands with available N-(NH4+ + NO3-) evels less than 2 kg ha(-1) during spring and fall months or with N-(NO3-) levels lower than 0.2 kg ha(-1) during any month may respond to N fertilization.

AB  - Indoles and indole-derivatives can be used to site-specifically label proteins on lysine and N-terminal amino groups under mild, nondenaturing reaction conditions. Hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) and a-lactalbumin were labeled with indole, fluoroindole, or fluoroindole-2-carboxylate via electrophilic aromatic substitutions to lysine side chain N epsilon- and N-terminal amino imines, formed in situ in the presence of formaldehyde. The reaction is highly site-selective, easily controlled by temperature, and does not eliminate the native charge of the protein, unlike many other common lysine-specific labeling strategies. F-19 NMR was used to monitor reaction progression, and in the case of HEWL, unique resonances for each labeled side chain could be resolved. We demonstrate that the indole tags are highly selective for primary amino groups. F-19 NMR demonstrates that each lysine exhibits a different rate of conjugation to indoles making it possible to employ these tags as a means of probing surface topology by NMR or mass spectrometry. Given the site-specificity of this tagging method, the mildness of the reaction conditions (aqueous, buffered, or unbuffered) and the low stoichiometry required for the reaction, indole-derivatives should serve as a valuable addition to the bioconjugation toolkit. We propose that labeling lysine side chains and N-terminal amino groups with indoles is a versatile and general strategy for bioconjugations with substituted indoles having broad implications for protein functionalization.

AB  - Biomorphic SnO2 was synthesized through a sol-gel approach combined with an infiltration process and a calcination treatment. This synthesis route adopted loofah sponge (LS) and eggshell membrane (ESM) as a template respectively, which was proved low-cost and environmentally friendly. Based on TG/DTA analysis, the calcination temperature was decided to be 550 A degrees C. XRD and TEM patterns confirmed the tetragonal rutile structure of SnO2. FESEM characterization revealed that the SnO2 fibers were made of nanoparticles (average particle size: similar to 8 nm) and faithfully duplicated the same confirmations of natural templates. The gas sensing properties of as-prepared SnO2 were investigated using different gases such as ethanol, methanol and acetone, etc. The optimal working temperature for LS-template SnO2 was 250 A degrees C, which was relatively lower than the case of ESM-template SnO2 (300 A degrees C). Compared with ESM-template SnO2, LS-template SnO2 showed higher response, better selectivity and stability to ethanol, which was mainly due to the three-dimensional, hierarchical and hollow structure. Synthesis mechanism and gas sensing mechanism of LS-template SnO2 were also discussed.

AB  - Adult anchovies in the Bay of Biscay perform north to south migration from late winter to early summer for spawning. However, what triggers and drives the geographic shift of the population remains unclear and poorly understood. An individual-based fish model has been implemented to explore the potential mechanisms that control anchovy's movement routes toward its spawning habitats. To achieve this goal, two fish movement behaviors - gradient detection through restricted area search and kinesis - simulated fish response to its dynamic environment. A bioenergetics model was used to represent individual growth and reproduction along the fish trajectory. The environmental forcing (food, temperature) of the model was provided by a coupled physical-biogeochemical model. We followed a hypothesis-testing strategy to actualize a series of simulations using different cues and computational assumptions. The gradient detection behavior was found as the most suitable mechanism to recreate the observed shift of anchovy distribution under the combined effect of sea-surface temperature and zooplankton. In addition, our results suggested that southward movement occurred more actively from early April to middle May following favorably the spatio-temporal evolution of zooplankton and temperature. In terms of fish bioenergetics, individuals who ended up in the southern part of the bay presented better condition based on energy content, proposing the resulting energy gain as an ecological explanation for this migration. The kinesis approach resulted in a moderate performance, producing distribution pattern with the highest spread. Finally, model performance was not significantly affected by changes on the starting date, initial fish distribution and number of particles used in the simulations, whereas it was drastically influenced by the adopted cues.

AB  - The effects of internal friction (IF) on Zr65Cu35 metallic glass plasticity are investigated through molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that the Voronoi polyhedron < 0,3,6,3 > increases as IF increases, thereby effectively inhibiting localized deformation and improving metallic glass plasticity. The simulations allow reproduction of images of IF evolution in metallic glasses subjected to isothermal annealing at 730 K and 850 K respectively, which can help explain the experimental observations. IF could be adjusted by selecting suitable annealing temperatures and cooling rates. The results of this work provide a strong foundation for future metallic glass designs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The Gonghe Basin region of the Tibet Plateau is severely affected by desertification. Compared with other desertified land, the main features of this region is windy, cold and short growing season, resulting in relatively difficult for vegetation restoration. In this harsh environment, identification the spatial distribution of soil nutrients and analysis its impact factors after vegetation establishment will be helpful for understanding the ecological relationship between soil and environment. Therefore, in this study, the 12-year-old C. intermediaplantation on sand dunes was selected as the experimental site. Soil samples were collected under and between shrubs on the windward slopes, dune tops and leeward slopes with different soil depth. Then analyzed soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK). The results showed that the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrients was existed in C. intermedia plantation on sand dunes. (1) Depth was the most important impact factor, soil nutrients were decreased with greater soil depth. One of the possible reasons is that windblown fine materials and litters were accumulated on surface soil, when they were decomposed, more nutrients were aggregated on surface soil. (2) Topography also affected the distribution of soil nutrients, more soil nutrients distributed on windward slopes. The herbaceous coverage were higher and C. intermedia ground diameter were larger on windward slopes, both of them probably related to the high soil nutrients level for windward slopes. (3) Soil "fertile islands" were formed, and the "fertile islands" were more marked on lower soil nutrients level topography positions, while it decreased towards higher soil nutrients level topography positions. The enrichment ratio (E) for TN and AN were higher than other nutrients, most likely because C. intermediais a leguminous shrub.

AB  - Models of instantaneous soil-surface CO2 efflux (SCEins) arc critical for understanding the potential drivers of soil C loss. Several simple SCEins models have been reported in the literature. Our objective was to compare and validate selected soil temperature (T-s)- and water content (theta(v))-based equations for modeling SCEins among a variety of cropping systems and land management practices. Soil-surface CO2 effluxes were measured and modeled for grain-harvested corn (Zea mays L.) soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotations, grain- and stover-harvested continuous corn systems with and without a cover crop, and reconstructed prairies with and without N fertilization on soils with subsurface drainage. Soil-surface CO2 effluxes, T-S, and theta(v), were measured from 2008 to 2011. Models calibrated with weekly measured SCEins, T-s, and theta(v), throughout the growing season produced lower root mean squared error (RMSE) than models calibrated with several weeks of hourly measured data. Model selection significantly affected SCEins estimations, with models that use only T-s parameters having lower RMSE than models that use both T-s and theta(v). However, the model that produced the lowest RMSE during validation estimated growing-season SCE that did not significantly differ from numerical integration of weekly measured SCEins. All models had similar residual errors with autocorrelated trends at monthly, weekly, and hourly scales. Autoregressive moving average functions were able to precisely describe the temporal errors. To accurately model SCEins and scale across time, improvement of temporal errors in T-S and theta(v), based SCEins models is needed to obtain accurate and precise closure of C balances for managed and natural ecosystems.

AB  - This study examined how genotypes of Daphnia pulicaria from a single population, separated by thousands of generations of evolution in the wild, differ in their sensitivity to a novel anthropogenic stressor. These genotypes were resurrected from preserved resting eggs isolated from sediments belonging to three time periods: 2002-2008, 1967-1977, and 1301-1646 A.D. Toxicity of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos was determined through a series of acute toxicity tests. There was a significant dose-response effect in all genotypes studied. Moreover, significant variation in toxicity among genotypes within each time period was detected. Importantly, a significant effect of time period on sensitivity to chlorpyrifos was found. Analysis of the median effect concentrations (EC50s) for genotypes within each time period indicated that the 1301-1646 genotypes were 2.7 times more sensitive than the 1967-1977 genotypes. This trend may be partially explained by microevolutionary shifts in response to cultural eutrophication.

AB  - Li-ion pouch cells were made to study the factors that influence gas evolution during formation (first charge). Electrode materials, electrolyte additives and temperature were varied. Measurements were made using the Archimedes' In Situ Gas Analyzer at Dalhousie University. When cells are charged to high voltages (>4.2 V) there is gas evolution, presumed to be from reactions on the surface of the positive electrode. This is separate from the gas evolution known to happen at lower voltage (<3.5 V) caused by reactions on the negative electrode. Both evolutions were characterized by the magnitude of volume changes and their onset voltages. Gas volumes appear to increase and onset voltages decrease, respectively, with increasing temperature. Use of the additive prop-1-ene-1,3-sultone at 2% by weight in Li[Ni0.42Mn0.42Co0.16]O-2/graphite cells yields smaller volume and higher onset voltage of gas evolution at all temperatures, compared to other additives tested. Certain cathode materials, namely some coated LiCoO2 samples, can be charged to high voltages (<= 4.7 V) without producing gas at high voltage. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.

AB  - Storage time and temperature are known to be important factors in determining Salmonella growth in table eggs. It is assumed that growth of Salmonella within eggs starts when the egg yolk membrane breaks down, allowing Salmonella to enter and grow. The length of time for which the yolk membrane remains intact is time and temperature dependent.
   The present study addresses the question whether the current legal requirement in Germany to cool table eggs marketed 18 days after laying needs to be updated. Detailed data on the current storage and transport conditions in Germany were collected. On the basis of these data, typical combinations of temperature and time were selected. For these different time-temperature scenarios, the consequences regarding the probability of growth of Salmonella Enteritidis inside the eggs were calculated. A probabilistic model consisting of nine modules reflecting storage/transport stages from farm to retail in Germany was used to calculate whether the yolk membrane remains intact during the individual steps. Growth of Salmonella was simulated without cooling (room temperature) as well as with two different cooling scenarios (4-6 degrees C and 8-12 degrees C), which are temperature ranges used in Germany by various retailers. Simulations of these scenarios resulted in relative low numbers of eggs with Salmonella growth until purchase (89 out of 50,000 eggs in the uncooled scenario, 10 out of 50,000 eggs stored at 8-12 degrees C and 5 out of 50,000 eggs stored at 4-6 degrees C). These results show that for an average egg trading time of 7.5 days, as was observed for Germany, the probability for the consumer to purchase eggs where no Salmonella growth has started and yolk membrane integrity still exists is high. However, the model supports the necessity for egg cooling after the yolk membrane integrity time is exhausted. Furthermore, the model shows clearly that cooling will extend the time period before the egg yolk membrane breaks down. According to our results, the requirement to cool eggs from the 18th day onwards after laying, as required by legislation in Germany, is reasonable, as it matches the time point of the yolk membrane breakdown for the average egg kept at 18-20 degrees C. Therefore, continuation of this regulation is strongly supported. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work an experimental procedure and the determination of first and second law efficiencies for the cooking process of eggplant using a solar cooker box-type are shown. The eggplant was modelled as cylinder. In the experimental process a NI Compact Field Point was used as acquisition data system which allows measure temperatures in simultaneous form. The temperatures evolution was defined using thermocouples located at water, surface and central point of the eggplant. After to measure the evolution temperatures in a solar cooker thermodynamics principles were applied to determine the first and second laws. The results obtained indicates what is the numerical difference between the first and second laws in the cooking process of eggplant. The results allow to understand how the inlet energy that impacts on solar cooker is converted in energy useful in the cooking process of eggplant. This work be used in future designs of solar cookers.

AB  - Experiments were carried out to optimize the process parameters for production of papaya powder using foam-mat drying. Papaya pulp was foamed by incorporating methyl cellulose (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 %, w/w), glycerol-mono-stearate (1, 2, 3 and 4 %, w/w) and egg white (5, 10, 15 and 20 %, w/w) as foaming agents. The maximum stable foam formation was 72, 90 and 125% at 0.75 % methyl cellulose, 3 % glycerol-mono-stearate and 15 % egg white respectively with 9A degrees Brix pulp and whipping time of 20 min. The foamed pulp was dried at air temperature of 60, 65 and 70 A degrees C with foam thickness of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mm in a batch type cabinet dryer. The drying time required for foamed papaya pulp was lower than non-foamed pulp at all selected temperatures. Biochemical analysis results showed a significant reduction in ascorbic acid, beta-carotene and total sugars in the foamed papaya dried product at higher foam thickness (6, 8 and 10 mm) and temperature (65 and 70 A degrees C due to destruction at higher drying temperature and increasing time. There was no significant change in other biochemical constituents such as pH and acidity. The organoleptic and sensory evaluation of the quality attributes of papaya powder obtained from the pulp of 9A degrees Brix added with 3 % glycerol-mono-stearate, whipped for 20 min and dried with a foam thickness of 4 mm at a temperature of 60 A degrees C was found to be optimum to produce the foam-mat dried papaya powder.

AB  - We demonstrate a distributed measurement technique to observe temperature changes along pumped Yb-doped fibers. This technique is based on an array of fiber Bragg gratings acting as a temperature sensor line. The Bragg gratings are inscribed directly into the Yb-doped fiber core using high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses and an interferometric setup. We studied the temperature evolution in differently co-doped Yb fibers during optical pumping and identified different effects contributing to the observed temperature increase. We found that preloading of fibers with hydrogen supports the formation of Yb2+ during UV irradiation and has a large impact on fiber temperature during pumping. The proposed technique can be applied to investigate the homogeneity of pump absorption in active fibers and to support spatially resolved photodarkening measurements. (c) The Authors.

AB  - Thrips-transmitted Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) has a broad host range including crops and weeds. In Georgia, TSWV is known to consistently affect peanut, tomato, pepper, and tobacco production. These crops are grown from March through November. In the crop-free period, weeds are presumed to serve as a green bridge for thrips and TSWV. Previous studies have identified several winter weeds as TSWV and thrips hosts. However, their ability to influence TSWV transmission in crops is still not completely understood. To further understand these interactions, population dynamics of two prevalent vectors, viz., Frankliniella fusca (Hinds) and Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), on selected winter weeds were monitored from October through April in four counties from 2004 to 2008. Peak populations were typically recorded in March. F. fusca and F. occidentalis adults were found on winter weeds and their percentages ranged from 0 to 68% in comparison with other adults. Immatures outnumbered all adults. Microcosm experiments indicated that the selected winter weeds differentially supported F. fusca reproduction and development. The time required to complete one generation (adult to adult) ranged from 11 to 16 d. Adult recovery ranged from 0.97 to 2.2 per female released. In addition, transmission assays revealed that thrips efficiently transmitted TSWV from peanut to weeds, the incidence of infection ranged from 10 to 55%. Back transmission assays with thrips from TSWV-infected weeds resulted in up to 75% TSWV infection in peanut. These whole-plant transmission and back transmission assays provide the basis for TSWV persistence in farmscapes year round.

AB  - In Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests the composition of the ground flora can be affected by the amount of light reaching the forest floor, influencing the balance between the three common ericaceous shrubs bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and heather (Calluna vulgaris). A pinewood ground flora with more than 20% bilberry cover is considered good habitat for capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), a large forest grouse of considerable conservation interest throughout Europe. Old, semi-natural Scots pine woodland is considered its prime habitat in Scotland, although this is limited in area compared to twentieth century planted forests. Action to manipulate environmental conditions within Scots pine plantations by altering light levels to favour bilberry through thinning and felling could potentially increase greatly the area of available capercaillie habitat in Scotland. We implemented a five year study to look at bilberry response to variable intensity thinning in two Scots pine plantations, where thinning followed management guidance for capercaillie available at the time. Bilberry was present in both forests but a positive response to thinning was not universal; although at both sites bilberry cover increased significantly over five years with levels >20% cover reached, this could only be attributed to the thinning treatment at one of the sites. A treatment of small patch clearfelling did not lead to losses in bilberry. Management guidance published after the trial had begun, identified the appropriate intensity of thinning for enhancing bilberry cover at our study sites, indicated by the relative increase of bilberry in the plots where the prescription had been followed. Although there was no significant treatment effect by year five, 42% average bilberry cover was reached at one site tested. However the format of this guidance, a range of stem density-tree height combinations, was difficult to apply using typical forest management data and we explore redefining the guidance as a post thinning stand basal area range. We suggest >22 to <31 m(2) ha(-1) basal area would be appropriate in Scots pine plantations established at normal spacing and subject to the commonest form of selective thinning regime. This range in basal area can be achieved without conflicting with management for timber production. Our results also support small patch clearfelling as a method of diversifying plantation age structure which is compatible with maintaining capercaillie brood habitat.

AB  - Temperature has a tremendous effect on the rate and amount of gold dissolution. In potentiodynamic experiments the total amount of dissolved gold increases by a factor of 4.5 when the temperature is increased from 25 to 75 degrees C. Moreover, the previously reported correlation between the onset of oxide formation and the commencement of the dissolution process is found to be correct for all studied temperatures. Negative shift in the advent of oxidation is accompanied by a similar shift in the dissolution onset potential. Similarly, the dissolution rate rises significantly with temperature during potentiostatic and galvanostatic polarization steps. A correlation between the temperature-dependent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and gold dissolution is found. Arrhenius plots for the OER and gold dissolution are used to obtain information on the apparent activation energy EA for both processes. It is found that for OER and Au dissolution E-A = 57 kJ mol(-1). The later finding suggests that there is a common intermediate for both reactions, the formation of which constitutes the rate-determining step. (C) The Author(s) 2014. Published by ECS.

AB  - This paper proposes the modelling and simulation of monthly average soil temperature evolution considering the nonlinear influence of the following parameters: average air temperature, distance from the sea, height above sea level and average humidity from 2001-2010 period, measured in the following locations: Constanta Medgidia, Gura Portitei and Tulcea, in the south-eastern Romania. The importance of the present research comes from the establishment of an apparent influence of each input parameter over the evolution of average soil temperature and the determination of approximated values of these influences using neural networks as simulation methods. Soil temperature has an agro-meteorological importance whereas it influences plants, especially in the initial phase of vegetation sprouting, springing and matching (for grains). If the soil temperature during these phases is high, the seed growth is faster with the optimum amount of moisture. The soil temperature effects also the nutrient absorption by the plant root, the development of root system, the efficient exploitation of fertilisers in the soil, water circulation in the root system, evapotranspiration, etc. The method uses a feedforward with quick propagation - Levenberg Marquardt training algorithm. Following the data analysis, the training, the testing and validation steps the neural network determined the relative values of influence of climatic parameters over the average monthly soil temperature, considered in the artificial neural network training step. Also, effective artificial neural network training was achieved, according to the error values initially defined.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to assess size and morphological changes in response to temperature in the marine diatom, Ditylum brightwellii (West) Grunow, using ecological, morphological and physiological approaches. D. brightwellii has two distinct cell morphologies: prism (large-sized cell) and cylinder types (small-sized cell). In the coastal waters of South Korea, the prism type was found to be present at high frequency at low temperatures, whereas the cylinder type was predominant at high temperatures. Other environmental factors did not affect the presence of either cell type significantly. In growth experiments to determine the effect of temperature on the size of D. brightwellii, the abundance of the prism type increased at low temperature, but the abundance of the cylinder type increased at high temperature. These results are important for understanding temperature-induced size and morphological changes in D. brightwellii, and their potential role as an adaptive strategy.

AB  - Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) are highly conserved molecular chaperones, playing a pivotal role in cellular progress. In this study, we reported the characterization of the Hsp90 alpha and Hsp90 beta genes in Megalobrama amblycephala, the expression profiling during early development, in various healthy tissues and in response to bacterial infection, and the assessment of their adaptive evolution. The Hsp90 alpha cDNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 2193 bp encoding 731 amino acids and the Hsp90 beta cDNA has an ORF of 2184 bp encoding 728 amino acids. Using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, the mRNA of both Hsp90a and Hsp90 beta reached the highest level at 15th day post-hatch. Using qRT-PCR and Western blot, both Hsp90 alpha and Hsp90 beta were widely expressed in various healthy tissues and significantly higher in blood than in other tissues. Expression of both Hsp90 alpha and Hsp90 beta were up-regulated upon bacterial infection and reached the peak level at 4 h post infection. Site model analysis indicated that one positive selection site (T717) in Hsp90 alpha was found, while no positive selection site was observed in Hsp90 beta. Branch-site model test showed that there were adaptively evolutionary evidences in the branches of Salmoniformes and Gasterosteiformes for Hsp90 alpha gene, and in the branch of Salmoniformes for Hsp90 beta gene.

AB  - The controlled assembly of nanostructures via shape instability mechanisms is a potential alternative to traditional top-down processes like e-beam lithography for nanostructuring surfaces. In this contribution, the dynamics of the nanostructures' assembly via thin film agglomeration have been analyzed. Pt thin films with a thickness of 50 nm were deposited via magnetron sputtering on yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) single crystals and subjected to heat treatments at 1023 K for times ranging from 10 to 130 min. The morphological evolution of Pt thin films has been investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), obtaining the hole growth dynamics and morphological parameters like the lateral correlation length and the nanostructures' Minkowski functionals. The experimentally obtained morphology evolution is compared to the simulated evolution of thin film structures resulting from a cell dynamical system (CDS) model. Three main observations have been made. (i) The hole radius is found to scale as function of time t with a rate proportional to t(-3/4) [log(-3) t]. This is in agreement with Srolovitz's instability theory describing hole growth predominated by surface diffusion. (ii) The morphological evolution of the Pt thin films has been analyzed as function of time t by means of Minkowski measures and the lateral correlation length. A discontinuity in the lateral correlation length and a significant deviation of the Minkowski functionals from the expected Gaussian behavior was found to be coupled with the coalescence of holes. (iii) By using the Ginzburg-Landau equation for the description of the fundamental diffusion process, the CDS model allows a computational reproduction of the experimentally obtained film morphologies in the early stages of agglomeration.

AB  - Fruit flies were used by several laboratories between 1901 and 1910 for studies of experimental evolution at Harvard, Indiana University, and Cold Spring Harbor before Thomas Hunt Morgan found his white-eyed mutation that we associate with the beginnings of the fly lab at Columbia University. The major players prior to Morgan were William Castle and his students at Harvard University, Frank Lutz at Cold Spring Harbor, and Fernandus Payne whose ideas for working with fruit flies were shaped by his studies of blind cave fauna at Indiana University. Payne's interests were stimulated by the work of Carl Eigenmann, an authority on blind cave fauna, and William Moenkhaus, who introduced Payne to fruit flies at Indiana University before Payne moved to Columbia to pursue graduate work with Morgan and Edmund Wilson. The motivations of the laboratories differed in the theories used for their work. Castle spread the word about the utility of fruit flies for research, but Payne gave Morgan his first fruit flies for research leading to the discovery of the white-eye mutation.

AB  - A c-type lysozyme (named as MgCLYZ) gene was cloned from the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. Blast analysis indicated that MgCLYZ was a salivary c-type lysozyme which was mainly found in insects. The nucleotide sequence of MgCLYZ was predicted to encode a polypeptide of 154 amino acid residues with the signal peptide comprising the first 24 residues. The deduced mature peptide of MgCLYZ was of a calculated molecular weight of 14.4 kD and a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 8.08. Evolution analysis suggested that bivalve branch of the invertebrate c-type lysozymes phylogeny tree underwent positive selection during evolution. By quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, MgCLYZ transcript was widely detected in all examined tissues and responded sensitively to bacterial challenge in hemocytes and hepatopancreas. The optimal temperature and pH of recombinant MgCLYZ (rMgCLYZ) were 20 degrees C and 4, respectively. The rMgCLYZ displayed lytic activities against Gram-positive bacteria including Micrococcus luteus and Staphyloccocus aureus, and Gram-negative bacteria including Vibrio anguillarum, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas putida, Proteus mirabilis and Bacillus aquimaris. These results suggest that MgCLYZ perhaps play an important role in innate immunity of M. galloprovincialis, and invertebrate c-type lysozymes might be under positive selection in a species-specific manner during evolution for undergoing adaptation to different environment and diverse pathogens.

AB  - Background: There is a lack of understanding the evolutionary forces driving niche segregation of closely related organisms. In addition, pinpointing the genes driving ecological divergence is a key goal in molecular ecology. Here, larval transcriptome sequences obtained by next-generation-sequencing are used to address these issues in a morphologically cryptic sister species pair of non-biting midges (Chironomus riparius and C. piger).
   Results: More than eight thousand orthologous open reading frames were screened for interspecific divergence and intraspecific polymorphisms. Despite a small mean sequence divergence of 1.53% between the sister species, 25.1% of 18,115 observed amino acid substitutions were inferred by a statistics to be driven by positive selection. Applying McDonald-Kreitman tests to 715 alignments of gene orthologues identified eleven (1.5%) genes driven by positive selection.
   Conclusions: Three candidate genes were identified as potentially responsible for the observed niche segregation concerning nitrite concentration, habitat temperature and water conductivity. Additionally, signs of positive selection in the hydrogen sulfide detoxification pathway were detected, providing a new plausible hypothesis for the species' ecological differentiation. Finally, a divergently selected, nuclear encoded mitochondrial ribosomal protein may contribute to reproductive isolation due to cytonuclear coevolution.

AB  - During the growth of thin metal films on dielectric substrates at a given deposition temperature T-d, the film's morphology is conditioned by the magnitude and asymmetry of up- and downhill diffusion. Any severe change of this mechanism leads to a growth instability, which induces an alteration of the thin film morphology. In order to study this mechanism, ultrathin Pt films were deposited via pulsed laser deposition onto yttria-stabilized zirconia single crystals at different deposition temperatures. The morphological evolution of Pt thin films has been investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and standard image analysis techniques. The experimentally obtained morphologies are compared to simulated thin film structures resulting from a two-dimensional kinetic Monte Carlo approach. Two main observations have been made: (i) thin Pt films deposited onto ZrO2 undergo a growth transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional growth at T-d > 573 K. The growth transition and related morphological changes are a function of the deposition temperature; and (ii) a critical cluster size of i* = 4 in combination with an asymmetric Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier favoring the uphill diffusion of atoms allows for a computational reproduction of the experimentally obtained film morphologies.

KW  - ADAPTATION
AB  - Until 50 years ago, high-altitude terrestrial research was conducted largely within the realm of environmental physiology, where interests were focused on physiological mechanisms and mountain exploration. Scientists from the United States, Europe, and Peru had developed sophisticated physiological models of adaptation and acclimatization to the hypoxia of high altitude, but very little research had been conducted on permanent residents, particularly natives of high altitude in the two major regions of the worldthe Andes and the Himalayas. In 1962, Raul T. Baker initiated a project at the Pennsylvania State University to explore the responses of indigenous Peruvians to the major stresses at altitude: hypoxia and cold. Approaches to this early research were anthropological in perspective and centered on population-level studies with an evolutionary approach. Studies were conducted by applying a combination of physiological experimental methods, simulated field experiments, and extended anthropological field observations. Early hypotheses at this time were that heredity played a major role in the adaptive complexes in native high-altitude residents. These early hypotheses were later modified to incorporate or replace the genetic hypotheses with developmental adaptation models. A half century of research within anthropology and research in other fields has presented a vastly more complex and integrated picture of high-altitude adaptation in native residents. Recent studies incorporate physiology and oxygen transport, population and molecular genetics, reproduction, growth, and development. The history and current status of high-altitude research and its anthropological applications are treated in papers from this plenary symposium. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 25:148150, 2013.

AB  - Diatoms are the most species-rich group of microalgae, and their contribution to marine primary production is important on a global scale. Diatoms can form dense blooms through rapid asexual reproduction; mutations acquired and propagated during blooms likely provide the genetic, and thus phenotypic, variability upon which natural selection may act. Positive selection was tested using genome and transcriptome-wide pair-wise comparisons of homologs in three genera of diatoms (Pseudo-nitzschia, Ditylum, and Thalassiosira) that represent decreasing phylogenetic distances. The signal of positive selection was greatest between two strains of Thalassiosira pseudonana. Further testing among seven strains of T. pseudonana yielded 809 candidate genes of positive selection, which are 7% of the protein-coding genes. Orphan genes and genes encoding protein-binding domains and transcriptional regulators were enriched within the set of positively selected genes relative to the genome as a whole. Positively selected genes were linked to the potential selective pressures of nutrient limitation and sea surface temperature based on analysis of gene expression profiles and identification of positively selected genes in subsets of strains from locations with similar environmental conditions. The identification of positively selected genes presents an opportunity to test new hypotheses in natural populations and the laboratory that integrate selected genotypes in T. pseudonana with their associated phenotypes and selective forces.

AB  - Local adaptation and species interactions have been shown to affect geographic ranges; therefore, we need models of climate impact that include both factors. To identify possible dynamics of species when including these factors, we ran simulations of two competing species using an individual-based, coupled map-lattice model using a linear climatic gradient that varies across latitude and is warmed over time. Reproductive success is governed by an individual's adaptation to local climate as well as its location relative to global constraints. In exploratory experiments varying the strength of adaptation and competition, competition reduces genetic diversity and slows range change, although the two species can coexist in the absence of climate change and shift in the absence of competitors. We also found that one species can drive the other to extinction, sometimes long after climate change ends. Weak selection on local adaptation and poor dispersal ability also caused surfing of cooler-adapted phenotypes from the expanding margin backwards, causing loss of warmer-adapted phenotypes. Finally, geographic ranges can become disjointed, losing centrally-adapted genotypes. These initial results suggest that the interplay between local adaptation and interspecific competition can significantly influence species' responses to climate change, in a way that demands future research.

AB  - In this paper two mathematical models with shrinkage effect describing eggplant drying are developed and discussed. The models are both modified diffusion equations and take differently into account changes of eggplant slice structure during drying. In the first model a diffusion coefficient variable with the water content is considered while in the second model a fictitious convective term is introduced. The two models are both suitable to describe the analyzed drying processes. Moreover, their equivalence is analytically demonstrated. Parameters values are estimated through a nonlinear regression procedure by comparison with the drying experiments carried out at different temperatures. Information about thickness evolution, derived from the models, are found to be in agreement with experimental data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The South American tomato pinworm (Tuta absoluta) has recently invaded Europe and is rapidly spreading in the Afro-Eurasian continent where it is becoming a major pest on tomato crops. Laboratory tests were undertaken to evaluate the potential of 29 European strains of Trichogramma parasitoids to control T. absoluta. In addition to the host itself, the host plant (tomato) was used during the laboratory tests in order to increase the chance of selecting the best parasitoid strains. Trichogramma females were placed with T. absoluta eggs on a tomato leaflet in tubes. We compared the parasitism of T. absoluta by the various Trichogramma species tested to the Trichogramma species currently commercially available for the pest control in Europe, i.e. Trichogramma achaeae. Thereafter, the more promising strains were tested on a larger scale, in mesocosm (i.e. cages in greenhouses) and in greenhouse compartments to evaluate efficiency of laboratory selected strains under cropping conditions. The most efficient strain from the laboratory screening trials did not perform as efficiently under the greenhouse conditions. We discuss differences in parasitism levels among species and strains and among the different scales tested in the experiments, as well as implications of these results for further screening for biocontrol agents.

AB  - Microstructural evolution determined by mechanical testing is usually modelled from perceived mechanisms of work hardening during dislocation passage and storage in complex arrays. The predicted stress strain behaviour is then compared with the measured one. Recently a new functional constitutive relation was derived by Saimoto and Van Houtte based on Taylor slip analysis that is optimally fitted to replicate the measured data. The curve fitting parameters arise from the incremental strain Delta gamma producing a mean slip distance lambda and the retained dislocation density rho assessed from the flow stress tau. A method has been derived to precisely determine lambda from the measured data. Moreover, the yield stress determined from the optimum curve fitting is derived from strains beyond the yield point and, hence, has the capacity to separate the solid solution and grain size effects from that of the yield phenomenon. Typically two fit curves are required, the intersection of which defines tau(3), gamma(3) and lambda(3), akin to the stage II to stage III transition in single crystals. A tabulation of these parameters permits reproduction of the mechanical curves. Furthermore, a plot of flow stress tau vs. 1/lambda results in a description of work hardening evolution onto which the inverse cell size 1/d(C) can be superimposed. Using the results from standard materials testing practice the temperature dependence and evolution of the pertinent parameters show that point defect drag effects are prominent below 273 K for AA1100 but not for AA5754.

AB  - Thickening of arc lithosphere influences the extent of magmatic differentiation and is thereby important for the evolution of juvenile arcs into mature continental crust. Here, we use mantle xenoliths from the late Mesozoic Sierra Nevada continental arc in California (USA) to constrain the pressure, temperature, and compositional evolution of the deep lithosphere beneath a mature arc. These xenoliths consist of spinel peridotites and garnet-bearing spinel peridotites. The former are characterized by coarse-grained protogranular textures having bulk compositions indicative of high-degree melting. The latter are characterized by porphyroclastic textures, garnet coronas around spinels, garnet exsolution lamellae in pyroxenes, and pyroxenes with high-Al cores and low-Al rims. The garnet-bearing spinel peridotites range from depleted to fertile compositions, but the high Cr-numbers [molar Cr/(Cr + Al)] of spinel cores reflect high-degree melting. These observations suggest that the protoliths of the garnet-bearing spinel peridotites were melt-depleted spinel peridotites. Constraints from geothermobarometry and bulk compositions coupled with mantle melting models suggest that the protoliths underwent shallow melt depletion (1-2 GPa, 1300-1400 degrees C), followed by compression, cooling, and final equilibration within the garnet stability field (similar to 3 GPa, < 800 degrees C). The deepest equilibrated samples are the most refertilized, suggesting that refertilization occurred during compression. We interpret this P-T-composition path to reflect progressive thickening of the Sierran arc lithosphere perhaps as a result of magmatic inflation or tectonic thickening. We hypothesize that newly formed arc lithospheric mantle thickens enough to pinch out the asthenospheric wedge, juxtaposing Sierran arc lithosphere against the subducting oceanic plate. This could have terminated arc magmatism and initiated cooling of the deep Sierran lithosphere.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to review nitrogen (N) controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) research methods used to measure nutrient release from CRFs. If CRF-N release patterns match vegetable crop needs, crop N uptake may become more efficient, thus resulting in similar or greater yields, reduced fertilizer N needs, and reduced environmental N losses. Three methods categories to estimate N release are: laboratory; growth chamber, greenhouse, or both; and field methods. Laboratory methods include a standard and accelerated temperature-controlled incubation methods (TCIMs); methods incubate CRF using selected time periods, temperatures, and/or sampling methods. Accelerated TCIMs, in contrast to the standard method, allow for shorter incubation periods. Growth chamber and greenhouse methods, including column and plastic bag studies, may be used to test new CRF products in conditions similar to particular vegetable production systems. However, the column method predicts N release from CRFs more effectively than the plastic bag method because of ammonia volatilization and lower N recovery rates associated with the bag method. Both field methods, pot-in-pot and pouch methods, are viable vegetable research options. The pouch method measures N remaining in the CRF prill and the pot-in-pot method measures N released from the CRY, thus each method can be applied to different research objectives. Nitrogen released during incubation may be measured using methods such as total Kjeldahl N (TKN), prill weight loss, combustion, colorirnetric, or ion-specific electrodes. The prill weight loss method is the least expensive but can only be used with urea CRF. Thus, the CRF-N source(s) and research objectives will determine the appropriate N analysis method. More research needs to be completed on correlations of field and laboratory CRY extractions. Field release methods should be considered the most reliable indicator of CRF-N performance until a laboratory method reliably predicts CRF-N expected field response.

AB  - Through greenhouse pots experiments, an orthogonal test method was employed here to study the optimum degradation conditions of cold-adapted degrading bacterial and the winter wheat. This orthogonal experiment selected four influencing factors: oil content, bacteria amount, soil moisture content and fertilizer. The results showed that in different stages, the optimum degradation conditions were different. Oil content and the bacterial amount were the two most important factors that influenced the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. The impact of fertilizers on the degradation rate increased with time, while water content on the degradation rate decreased with time.

AB  - The honey bee colonies, with the relevant number of immature brood and adults, and stable, high levels of humidity and temperatures of their nests, result in suitable environments for the development of microorganisms including pathogens. In response, honey bees evolved several adaptations to face the increased risks of epidemic diseases. As the antimicrobial venom peptides of Apis mellifera are present both on the cuticle of adult bees and on the nest wax it has been recently suggested that these substances act as a social antiseptic device. Since the use of venom by honey bees in the context of social immunity needs to be more deeply investigated, we extended the study of this potential role of the venom to different species of the genus Apis (A. mellifera, Apis dorsata, Apis cerana and Apis andreniformis) using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry techniques. In particular we investigated whether (similarly to A. mellifera) the venom is spread over the body cuticle and on the comb wax of these three Asian species. Our results confirm the idea that the venom functions are well beyond the classical stereotype of defence against predators, and suggest that the different nesting biology of these species may be related to the use of the venom in a social immunity context. The presence of antimicrobial peptides on the comb wax of the cavity-dwelling species and on the cuticle of workers of all the studied species represents a good example of "collective immunity" and a component of the "social immunity " respectively.

AB  - Grapholita molesta (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is one of the main pests of peach trees in Brazil, causing fruit losses of 3-5%. Among possible biological control agents, Trichogramma pretiosum (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) has been found in peach orchards. Our objectives were to study the rearing of T pretiosum in eggs of G. molesta and Anagasta kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), and select lineages of this parasitoid that have the potential to control G. molesta. Selection of best lineages was made from 5 populations of T pretiosum collected from organically-cultivated peach orchards. The study was done under controlled temperature (25 +/- 2 degrees C), relative humidity (70 +/- 10%) and 14:10 h (light:dark) photoperiod conditions. Grapholita molesta eggs were found to be adequate hosts for the development of T pretiosum, and the parameters for number of parasitized eggs, percent parasitized eggs, and sex ratio were similar to those for A. kuehniella eggs. The highest rate of parasitism of G. molesta eggs occurred in eggs with up to 48 h of embryonic development. Among the lineages of T pretiosum that were collected, HO8, PO8, PEL, and L3M showed the best biological performance and are therefore indicated for semi-field and field studies for biological control of oriental fruit moth.

AB  - Soil carbon (C) management is identified as a key element of sustainable agriculture, and an increase in nitrogen (N) mineralization rates is expected with an increase in soil C. However, any practical recommendation for using soil C management to substitute the application of synthetic N fertilizer needs to account simultaneously for other important agronomic variables and environmental conditions. For this purpose we investigated the simultaneous impact of soil C management, environmental conditions, and soil structure on N mineralization in two apple orchard systems in Havelock North, New Zealand. One system is an organic orchard using regular compost applications and the other is a neighboring integrated orchard with no external inputs of organic matter. The soil type, texture, and climate are identical in both orchards. We selected different temperatures (10A degrees C, 15A degrees C, and 20A degrees C) and soil moistures (-30, -100, and -300 kPa) as the environmental conditions for N mineralization. Simultaneously, the hot-water extractable C (HWC) contents were measured and served as the indicator for the soil C management of the orchards. To analyze the impact of soil structure, the N mineralization of undisturbed cores was compared with that of disturbed samples. The net N mineralization of the soil in the organic orchard was on average six times higher than that in the integrated orchard. At the same time, in the organic orchard the HWC contents at the beginning of the N mineralization experiment were about two times higher than in the integrated orchard. In a multiple regression as a practical recommendation for the orchards of our case study, we could explain 84% of the variability of N mineralization rates using HWC and environmental conditions as the independent variables. The HWC content was the most significant variable in the multiple regression model and showed that soil C management has a more prominent role than the environmental conditions. Soil C management such as regular compost applications which increase the soil's HWC contents can also be used to manage N mineralization. The significant difference between the undisturbed and disturbed samples showed the soil structure can have an effect on N mineralization.

AB  - Background: Historically, non-native species of Gambusia (Poeciliidae) have been used to control larval stages of the Asian tiger mosquito, Stegomyia albopicta Reinert, Harbach et Kitching, 2004 throughout Italy. The potential utility of indigenous populations of Aphanius fasciatus (Valenciennes) (Teleostei: Cyprinodontidae) as an appropriate alternative biological control is currently being explored. A sub-sample of ten fish collected from Cervia Saline, Italy (salinity 65 ppt; 30 degrees C) to assess their reproductive capability in captivity, harboured a moderate infection of Gyrodactylus von Nordmann, 1832 (Platyhelminthes, Monogenea). A subsequent morphological and molecular study identified this as being a new species.
   Results: Gyrodactylus salinae n. sp. is described from the skin, fins and gills of A. fasciatus. Light and scanning electron microscopical (SEM) examination of the opisthaptoral armature and their comparison with all other recorded species suggested morphological similarities to Gyrodactylus rugiensoides Huyse et Volckaert, 2002 from Pomatoschistus minutus (Pallas). Features of the ventral bar, however, permit its discrimination from G. rugiensoides. Sequencing of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 and the 5.8S rRNA gene and a comparison with all species listed in GenBank confirmed they are unique and represent a new species (most similar to Gyrodactylus anguillae Ergens, 1960, 8.3% pair-wise distance based on 5.8S+ITS2). This represents the first species of Gyrodactylus to be described from Aphanius and, to date, has the longest ITS1 (774 bp) sequenced from any Gyrodactylus. Additional sampling of Cervia Saline throughout the year, found G. salinae n. sp. to persist in conditions ranging from 35 ppt and 5 degrees C in December to 65 ppt and 30 degrees C in July, while in captivity a low level of infection was present, even in freshwater conditions (0 ppt).
   Conclusions: The ability of G. salinae n. sp. to tolerate a wide range of salinities and temperatures shows its potential to readily adapt to several environmental conditions. These findings, together with the fact that A. fasciatus is a protected species and is considered as a biological control organism, necessitate further studies on the ecology and virulence of G. salinae n. sp.

AB  - The main problems about research and application of two-line hybrid rice were reviewed, including the confusing nomenclature and male sterile lines classification, the unclear characteristics of photoperiod and temperature responses and the unsuitable site selection for male sterile line and hybrid rice seed production. In order to efficiently and accurately use dual-purpose genic male sterile lines, four types, including PTGMS (photo-thermo-sensitive genic male sterile rice), TGMS (thermo-sensitive genic male sterile rice), reverse PTGMS and reverse TGMS, were proposed. A new idea for explaining the mechanism of sterility in dual-purpose hybrid rice was proposed. The transition from sterile to fertile was involved in the cooperative regulation of major-effect sterile genes and photoperiod and/or temperature sensitive ones. The minor-effect genes with accumulative effect on sterility were important factors that affected the critical temperature of sterility transfer. In order to make better use of dual-purpose lines, the characterization of responses to photoperiod and temperature of PTGMS should be made and the identification method for the characterization of photoperiod and temperature responses of PTGMS should also be put forward.

AB  - Organisms survive changes in the environment by altering their rates of metabolism, growth, and reproduction. At the same time, the system must ensure the stability and functionality of its macromolecules. Fluctuations in the environment are sensed by highly conserved stress responses and homeostatic mechanisms, and of these, the heat shock response (HSR) represents an essential response to acute and chronic proteotoxic damage. However, unlike the strategies employed to maintain the integrity of the genome, protection of the proteome must be tailored to accommodate the normal flux of nonnative proteins and the differences in protein composition between cells, and among individuals. Moreover, adult cells are likely to have significant differences in the rates of synthesis and clearance that are influenced by intrinsic errors in protein expression, genetic polymorphisms, and fluctuations in physiological and environmental conditions. Here, we will address how protein homeostasis (proteostasis) is achieved at the level of the cell and organism, and how the threshold of the stress response is set to detect and combat protein misfolding. For metazoans, the requirement for coordinated function and growth imposes additional constraints on the detection, signaling, and response to misfolding, and requires that the HSR is integrated into various aspects of organismal physiology, such as lifespan. This is achieved by hierarchical regulation of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) by the metabolic state of the cell and centralized neuronal control that could allow optimal resource allocation between cells and tissues. We will examine how protein folding quality control mechanisms in individual cells may be integrated into a multicellular level of control, and further, even custom-designed to support individual variability and impose additional constraints on evolutionary adaptation.

AB  - We have used low temperatures (down to -20 degrees C) and high pressures (up to 2000 bar) to populate low-lying excited state conformers of hen lysozyme, and have analyzed their structures site-specifically using N-15/H-1 two-dimensional HSQC NMR spectroscopy. The resonances of a number of residues were found to be selectively broadened, as the temperature was lowered at a pressure of 2000 bar. The resulting disappearance of cross-peaks includes those of residues in the beta-domain of the protein and the cleft between the beta- and alpha-domains, both located close to water-containing cavities. The results indicate that low-lying excited state conformers of hen lysozyme are characterized by slowly fluctuating local conformations around these cavities, attributed to the opportunities for water molecules to penetrate into the cavities. Furthermore, we have found that these water-containing cavities are conserved in similar positions in lysozymes from a range of different biological species, indicating that they are a common evolutionary feature of this family of enzymes.

AB  - Species with a wide geographical distribution are often composed of distinct subgroups which may be adapted to their local environment. European trout (Salmo trutta species complex) provide an example of such a complex consisting of several genetically and ecologically distinct forms. However, trout populations are strongly influenced by human activities, and it is unclear to what extent neutral and adaptive genetic differences have persisted. We sampled 30 Swiss trout populations from heterogeneous environments along replicated altitudinal gradients in three major European drainages. More than 850 individuals were genotyped at 18 microsatellite loci which included loci diagnostic for evolutionary lineages and candidate markers associated with temperature tolerance, reproductive timing and immune defence. We find that the phylogeographic structure of Swiss trout populations has not been completely erased by stocking. Distinct genetic clusters corresponding to the different drainages could be identified, although nonindigenous alleles were clearly present, especially in the two Mediterranean drainages. We also still detected neutral genetic differentiation within rivers which was often associated with the geographical distance between populations. Five loci showed evidence of divergent selection between populations with several drainage-specific patterns. Lineage-diagnostic markers, a marker linked to a quantitative trait locus for upper temperature tolerance in other salmonids and a marker linked to the major histocompatibility class I gene were implicated in local adaptation and some patterns were associated with altitude. In contrast, tentative evidence suggests a signal of balancing selection at a second immune relevant gene (TAP2). Our results confirm the persistence of both neutral and potentially adaptive genetic differences between trout populations in the face of massive human-mediated dispersal.

AB  - Analyses of Sahel regional and country-specific rainfall and temperature time series derived from a fixed subset of stations show the well-documented large-scale decreasing trend in rainfall that occurred between 1970 and 2000 and also, an increasing trend in summertime maximum and wintertime minimum temperatures. The evolution of summertime mean maximum temperature is almost opposite to that of rainfall, and a significant correlation is observed between the evolution of this quantity and millet yields, in comparison with correlation with summertime rainfall. It appears that quantifying future vulnerability of the Sahel zone to climate change is rather difficult because climate models have not in general shown yet a satisfactory reproduction of the observed climate variability of this area.

AB  - As a new class of materials, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have been continuing fascinating the community with properties that can be seen from neither bulk graphite nor diamond. Although the physics and chemistry of these carbon allotropes have been intensively investigated from various perspectives, the laws governing the fascinations and their interdependence remain as yet undetermined. From the perspectives of bond and nonbond formation, dissociation, relaxation, vibration, and the associated energetics and dynamics of charge repopulation, polarization, densification, and localization, this article aims to show that the broken-bond-induced local bond contraction and bond strength gain, quantum entrapment and densification of charge and energy, polarization of the unpaired edge dangling sigma-bond electrons, and the formation of the pseudo-pi-bond between the dangling sigma-bond electrons along the edges are responsible for the anomalies. Theoretical reproduction of the experimentally observed elastic modulus enhancement, melting point depression, layer-number, strain, pressure and temperature induced Raman shift, C 1s core-level positive shift, work function reduction, band gap expansion, edge and defect selective generation of the Dirac-Fermi polarons and the associated magnetism consistently confirmed that the shorter and stronger bonds between undercoordinated carbon atoms modulate locally the atomic cohesive energy, the Hamiltonian, and hence the detectable bulk properties. The polarization of the unpaired dangling sigma-bond electrons by the densely, deeply, and locally entrapped core and bonding electrons generates the massless, magnetic and mobile Dirac-Fermi polarons at sites surrounding vacancies and zigzag-GNRedges. The pseudo-pi-bond formation between the nearest dangling sigma-bond electrons along the armchair-GNR and the reconstructed zigzag-GNR edges discriminates them from the zigzag-GNR edges or vacancies in the electronic and magnetic properties. Consistency between predictions and observations confirmed that the C-C bond contracts by up to 30% with a 152% bond strength gain at the edges with respect to those in the bulk diamond.

AB  - Despite the scant quantitative data available in the literature, it has been hypothesized that some chemical compounds can have deleterious effects on soil stabilization with lime and cements (e.g., nitrates, phosphates and chlorides). This study intends to assess their influence on soil stabilization quantitatively. An original experimental procedure was followed. Selected soils were mixed with a potential deleterious compound at a concentration representative of what can be found in the field. The performance of the different mixtures in terms of soil stabilization was then assessed by performing mechanical tests on samples submitted to several curing conditions (temperature and humidity). The results showed that the tested compounds are likely to alter the soil stabilization processes and thus lower the mechanical performance of the stabilized soil. The results also showed that it is not possible to determine a single threshold value for the compounds considered because their influence on soil stabilization is also a function of the nature of the soil (silt or fine sand), the type of cement (CEM I or CEM II) and the curing conditions.

AB  - The novel idea of using rotifers Lecane inermis (Rotifera, Monogononta) as a tool to overcome activated sludge bulking generates an on-going need to study rotifer biology. The results of biological research on rotifers can serve to improve the method so that it can be most effective when applied in treatment plants. The aim of this study was to test the effect of temperature on four selected rotifer clones originating from different treatment plants. The rate of population development from a single individual (parthenogenetic female) during a 10-day experiment was measured at three temperatures: 8, 15 and 20 degrees C. The temperatures used reflect the annual temperature distribution in the majority of municipal wastewater treatment plants in the temperate zone. The growth rate coefficient (r) and doubling time (tD) were calculated for each clone. Under the most favourable conditions (20 degrees C), r values varied between 0.41 and 0.47 d and doubling time between 1.5 and 1.7 d. At a temperature of 15 degrees C, the doubling time was approximately two times longer (2.5-3.4 d). The strongest intraspecific variations were observed at the lowest temperature of 8 degrees C. At this temperature, one of the clones almost failed to proliferate, and another exhibited a doubling time of 7.9 d. The doubling times were a few times greater for the remaining two clones (60 d for Lk1, 33.3 d for Lk4). These results could be very useful in predicting the chances that the rotifers would survive in a biological reactor in a wastewater treatment plant at the temperatures used in these reactors.

AB  - Potential spawning habitat is defined as the area where environmental conditions are suitable for spawning to occur. Spawning adult data from the first quarter (January-March) of the International Bottom Trawl Survey have been used to study the inter-annual variability of the potential spawning habitat of North Sea plaice from 1980 to 2007. Generalised additive models (GAM) were used to create a model that related five environmental variables (depth, bottom temperature and salinity, seabed stress and sediment type) to presence-absence and abundance of spawning adults. Then, the habitat model was applied each year from 1970 to 2007 to predict inter-annual variability of the potential spawning habitat. Predicted responses obtained by GAM for each year were mapped using kriging. A hierarchical classification associated with a correspondence analysis was performed to cluster spawning suitable areas and to determine how they evolved across years. The potential spawning habitat was consistent with historical spawning ground locations described in the literature from eggs surveys. It was also found that the potential spawning habitat varied across years. Suitable areas were located in the southem part of the North Sea and along the eastern coast of England and Scotland in the eighties; they expanded further north from the nineties. Annual survey distributions did not show such northward expansion and remained located in the southern North Sea. This suggests that this species' actual spatial distribution remains stable against changing environmental conditions, and that the potential spawning habitat is not fully occupied. Changes in environmental conditions appear to remain within plaice environmental ranges, meaning that other factors may control the spatial distribution of plaice spawning habitat.

AB  - The evolutionary potential of plant species that reproduce via predominantly clonal means and the conditions under which clonality is favoured are not well known. Long-term clonal reproduction is expected to result in a number of readily detectable genetic signals not present in populations that reproduce by sexual means. We use a hierarchical sampling strategy to assess genotype probabilities and confirm that two rare sister taxa of Banksia ionthocarpa have contrasting modes of reproduction. Banksia ionthocarpa subsp. chrysophoenix reproduces clonally. Populations had low levels of genotypic diversity and were comprised of large clonal patches consisting of many ramets that covered hundreds of square metres and showed little intermixing. The taxon was genetically depauperate (mean N-a = 1.97, mean P = 0.66, mean H-e = 0.282), had high levels of genetic differentiation between populations (theta = 0.481), and populations exhibited excess heterozygosity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) among loci, suggesting historically high levels of clonality. In contrast, the sister taxon B. ionthocarpa subsp. ionthocarpa, which occurs in an area with more than twice the annual rainfall and less extreme minimum and maximum temperatures, showed no evidence of clonality, high levels of genotypic diversity, greater genetic diversity (mean N-a = 3.31, mean P = 0.81, mean H-e = 0.405), lower levels of genetic differentiation between populations (theta = 0.253) and no evidence of excess heterozygosity or LD among loci. We suggest that the development of clonality in subsp. chrysophoenix is associated with its more marginal environment and enhanced by response to recurrent fires.

AB  - Comparative sociogenomics has the potential to provide important insights into how social behaviour evolved. We examined brain gene expression profiles of the primitively eusocial wasp Polistes metricus and compared the results with a growing base of brain gene expression information for the advanced eusocial honeybee, Apis mellifera. We studied four female wasp groups that show variation in foraging/provisioning behaviour and reproductive status, using our newly developed microarray representing approximately 3248 P. metricus genes based on sequences generated from high-throughput pyrosequencing. We found differences in the expression of approximately 389 genes across the four groups. Pathways known from Drosophila melanogaster to be related to lipid metabolism, heat and stress response, and various forms of solitary behaviour were associated with behavioural differences among wasps. Forty-five per cent of differentially expressed transcripts showed significant associations with foraging/provisioning status, and 14 per cent with reproductive status. By comparing these two gene lists with lists of genes previously shown to be differentially expressed in association with honeybee division of labour, we found a significant overlap of genes associated with foraging/provisioning, but not reproduction, across the two species. These results suggest common molecular roots for foraging division of labour in two independently evolved social insect species and the possibility of more lineage-specific roots of reproductive behaviour. We explore the implications of these findings for the idea that there is a conserved 'genetic toolkit' for division of labour across multiple lineages.

AB  - Currently, the great majority of the data that are used for solving macromolecular structures by X-ray crystallography are collected at cryogenic temperatures. Selection of a suitable cryoprotectant, which ensures crystal stability at low temperatures, is critical for the success of a particular diffraction experiment. The effectiveness of salts of organic acids as potential cryoprotective agents is presented in the following work. Sodium formate, acetate, malonate and citrate were tested, as were sodium potassium tartrate and acetate in the form of potassium and ammonium salts. For each salt investigated, the minimal concentration that was required for successful cryoprotection was determined over the pH range 4.5-9.5. The cryoprotective ability of these organic salts depends upon the number of carboxylic groups; the lowest concentration required for cryoprotection was observed at neutral pH. Case-study experiments conducted using the tetragonal form of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) confirmed that salts of organic acids can successfully act as cryoprotective agents of protein crystals grown from high concentrations of inorganic salts. When crystals are grown from solutions containing a sufficient concentration of organic acid salts no additional cryoprotection is needed as the crystals can safely be frozen directly from the crystallizing buffers.

AB  - Context. Measuring the surface abundances of AGB stars is an important tool for studying the effects of nucleosynthesis and mixing in the interior of low-to intermediate mass stars during their final evolutionary phases. The atmospheres of AGB stars can be strongly affected by stellar pulsation and the development of a stellar wind, though, and the abundance determination of these objects should therefore be based on dynamic model atmospheres.
   Aims. We investigate the effects of stellar pulsation and mass loss on the appearance of selected spectral features (line profiles, line intensities) and on the derived elemental abundances by performing a systematic comparison of hydrostatic and dynamic model atmospheres.
   Methods. High-resolution synthetic spectra in the near infrared range were calculated based on two dynamic model atmospheres (at various phases during the pulsation cycle) as well as a grid of hydrostatic COMARCS models with effective temperatures T-eff and surface gravities log g over an adequate range. Equivalent widths of a selection of atomic and molecular lines (Fe, OH, CO) were derived in both cases and compared with each other.
   Results. In the case of the dynamic models, the equivalent widths of all investigated features vary over the pulsation cycle. A consistent reproduction of the derived variations with a set of hydrostatic models is not possible, but several individual phases and spectral features can be reproduced well with the help of specific hydrostatic atmospheric models. In addition, we show that the variations in equivalent width that we found on the basis of the adopted state-of-the-art dynamic model atmospheres agree qualitatively with observational results for the Mira R Cas over its light cycle.
   Conclusions. The findings of our modelling form a starting point to deal with the problem of abundance determination in strongly dynamic AGB stars (i.e., long-period variables). Our results illustrate that some quantities such as the C/O ratio can probably still be determined to a reasonable accuracy, but the measurement of other quantities will be hampered by the dynamics. The qualitative agreement with observations of R Cas opens promising possibilities for a forthcoming quantitative comparison of our synthetic spectra with observed ones of AGB variables in the globular cluster 47 Tuc.

AB  - Large sand bed loads in trout stream headwaters can limit salmonid spawning habitat and reproductive success. This phenomenon has been observed in many northern Wisconsin watersheds, where historic logging practices are the likely source of the sediment loading. Presently, sediment transport is limited by abundant woody debris, causing channels to aggrade and bury gravels. We evaluated the impacts of a wood debris and beaver dam removal remediation strategy on fine sediment transport and exposure of the underlying gravel and cobble substrates in a second-order Lake Superior tributary. A 300-m treatment reach received selective wood removals and was compared with both an upstream 300-m reference reach receiving no alteration and a downstream reach to monitor the effects of transferred fine sediment. Physical channel measurements were taken before the wood removal process, with repeat sampling at 10 and 12 months posttreatment. The wood removal treatment resulted in a significant 25% narrowing of mean stream widths, a 32% increase in mean flow velocities, a 58% reduction in the sand bed load, and a 400% increase in the available coarse substrate across the channel. Grain size distributions coarsened noticeably from pre-to posttreatment. Water depth and temperature were not altered by the treatment, and the reference station physical measures were relatively unchanged over the 12-month study period. Immediately after the wood removal there was an observable pulse of sediment traveling through the downstream reach that increased the sand bed load, increased stream widths, and filled pools. However, these impacts diminished with time, and near-preremoval conditions had returned after 12 months. The wood removal treatment caused a significant reduction in sand content and enhanced the availability of salmonid spawning substrates.

AB  - Strategies to conserve rare species require identifying resources that function as important habitat elements and that promote high demographic performance. Assessing the relative importance of resources, however, can be confounded by natural variation in resource availability and by the hierarchical spatial structure in which resources are organized. Because availability and relative importance of resources often vary across environmental and spatial gradients, we used gradients together with resource selection functions and variance decomposition to assess the relative importance of resources to nest site selection and reproductive performance of Ferruginous Pygmy-Owls (Glaucidium brasilianum). We measured habitat characteristics of 106 nests and paired available sites at five spatial scales across a 220-km gradient of precipitation and vegetation in northwest Mexico, in a region adjacent to the southwestern United States where pygmy-owls have declined to near extinction. Resources explained 76-85% of variation in nest site selection and 21-31% of variation in reproductive performance across all spatial scales combined. Although we found evidence of resource selection at each scale, the magnitude of selection and influence of resources on reproductive performance were greatest where availability of selected resources were low and where temperature extremes and predation risk likely increased the relative importance of these resources. At larger scales, geographic changes in resource use corresponded with changes in availability, whereas at smaller scales, resource use varied little despite changes in availability, suggesting higher specificity and importance of resources at smaller scales. At the smallest scale, owls selected nest cavities with smaller entrances, larger volume, greater height, and orientations that produced cooler microclimates in the hottest regions of the study area; these choices promoted higher reproductive performance. Cavity resources explained more variation in selection and reproductive performance than resources at larger scales, highlighting their importance as conservation targets. High correlation of resource characteristics among spatial scales, however, indicated that selection of resources at small scales depended on characteristics of resources at larger scales. Assessing how resource selection changes in response to underlying variation in resource availability can help prioritize resources most important for conservation and management.

AB  - Composting is a solid waste treatment process consisting of the biochemical degradation of organic materials. A controlled microbial aerobic decomposition produces stabilized organic materials to be used as soil conditioners or organic fertilizers. The efficiency of this process is Strongly temperature-dependent and the key to successful composting lies in the tracking of an appropriate temperature batch curve based on experience and related to a complex succession of differing microbial activities. Such a complexity is modelled in this paper with a fuzzy structure composed of clustered antecedents, describing the process regimes, and consequent linear models driven by the aeration cycle and in-cycle temperature evolution. This fuzzy model was adapted to the data by cluster training and minimization of a model/data error criterion. The calibrated model was able to describe the temperature profile during the most significant part of the composting batch. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many apiculturally important traits of the honeybee have medium to high heritabilities and are therefore capable of strong response to selection. However, the natural mating system of honeybees makes it difficult to exclude unselected males from matings and necessitates expensive procedures like artificial insemination or isolated mating stations. By manipulating ambient light and temperature, an Australian queen breeder has developed a novel system that delays the flight time of selected queens and drones. To assess the efficacy of this "Horner system," drones and their assumed worker offspring were genotyped using microsatellite loci to test whether the workers were exclusively sired by the selected drones. The Horner system was found to provide at least 85% control of matings, equivalent to a 48% increase in the selection differential, when queens and drones are selected in a breeding program.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study the possibility of valorization of the carbonatation lime from the sugarbeet industry by production of compost using in the same time the excess of bagasse from the cane sugar industry together with household waste (organic materials). Three experiments were conducted: in the first experiment the carbonatation lime (dry substance content 83.7%) at a content of 32% was composted with bagasse (DS 89.3%) and household waste (DS 13.4%), while in the second experiment the compost did not contain the carbonatation lime (only bagasse and household waste in the same proportions). In the third experiment the concentration of carbonatation lime in the mixture (carbonatation lime bagasse household waste) was increased to 50%. After 75 days of composting with natural aeration, a good evolution of the temperature for all the composts was observed. In the final step of composting, all composts have pH values of 8.0-8.5 and the ratio of carbon/nitrogen was reduced to the recommended value. The compost with carbonatation lime could be used as fertilizer for the Moroccan soils.

AB  - Substrate spawning fish are believed to be selective in their choice of spawning habitat, yet few studies have shown the relative importance of different characteristics in terms of habitat quality. We used an extensive and detailed dataset to identify the factors that govern both large-scale (10(3) to 10(5) m) and local-scale (10(1) to 10(2) m) selection by a substrate-spawning fish, the Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis L. Distribution of spawning habitat was strongly dependent on habitat characteristics defined by substrate, wave exposure, temperature and depth. The most important predictor was the type of spawning substrate, which generally consisted of different types of vegetation. Substrates providing rigidity and structural complexity were preferred, despite abundant presence of other substrate types. Shallow depth and sheltered areas were also selected habitat characteristics. The response to temperature was scale-dependent, with a stronger selection expressed at the local scale. The specific selectivity suggests that spawning patterns can be successfully modelled with sufficient detail using only a few fundamental environmental variables. Wave exposure and depth are readily available for large-scale spatial predictions, while temperature and substrate require further development in most coastal areas. The high specificity of the characteristics determining habitat quality suggests that it should be possible to apply this modelling approach for identification and conservation of spawning habitats of Eurasian perch and other substrate-spawning fishes in coastal waters.

AB  - Data from General Circulation Models (GCMs) are often used to investigate hydrological impacts of climate change. However GCM data are known to have large biases, especially for precipitation. In this study the usefulness of GCM data for hydrological studies, with focus on discharge variability and extremes, was tested by using bias-corrected daily climate data of the 20CM3 control experiment from a selection of twelve GCMs as input to the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB. Results of these runs were compared with discharge observations of the GRDC and discharges calculated from model runs based on two meteorological datasets constructed from the observation-based CRU TS2.1 and ERA-40 reanalysis. In the first dataset the CRU TS 2.1 monthly timeseries were downscaled to daily timeseries using the ERA-40 dataset (ERA6190). This dataset served as a best guess of the past climate and was used to analyze the performance of PCR-GLOBWB. The second dataset was created from the ERA-40 timeseries bias-corrected with the CRU TS 2.1 dataset using the same bias-correction method as applied to the GCM datasets (ERACLM). Through this dataset the influence of the bias-correction method was quantified. The bias-correction was limited to monthly mean values of precipitation, potential evaporation and temperature, as our focus was on the reproduction of inter- and intra-annual variability.
   After bias-correction the spread in discharge results of the GCM based runs decreased and results were similar to results of the ERA-40 based runs, especially for rivers with a strong seasonal pattern. Overall the bias-correction method resulted in a slight reduction of global runoff and the method performed less well in arid and mountainous regions. However, deviations between GCM results and GRDC statistics did decrease for < span style='border-top: 1px solid #000; color: #000;'> Q </span >, Q90 and IAV. After bias-correction consistency amongst models was high for mean discharge and timing (Qpeak), but relatively low for inter-annual variability (IAV). This suggests that GCMs can be of use in global hydrological impact studies in which persistence is of less relevance (e.g. in case of flood rather than drought studies). Furthermore, the bias-correction influences mean discharges more than extremes, which has the positive consequence that changes in daily rainfall distribution and subsequent changes in discharge extremes will also be preserved when the bias-correction method is applied to future GCM datasets. However, it also shows that agreement between GCMs remains relatively small for discharge extremes.
   Because of the large deviations between observed and simulated discharge, in which both errors in climate forcing, model structure and to a lesser extent observations are accumulated, it is advisable not to work with absolute discharge values for the derivation of future discharge projections, but rather calculate relative changes by dividing the absolute change by the absolute discharge calculated for the control experiment.

AB  - In this article, we prepared a novel imprinted polymer by a room temperature ionic liquid-mediated surface molecular imprinting technique in in combination with a sol-gel process. This polymer was characterized by static and kinetic adsorption experiments and exhibited good recognition ability and offered fast kinetics for the adsorption of Para Red. A simple and sensitive analytical method, based on the coupling of molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), had been developed for determination of trace Para Red. With a loading flow, rate of 0.42 mL min(-1) for 25 mL, an enrichment factor of 1061 was achieved. Under the selected experimental condition, the detection limit (S/N = 3) of Para Red was 6.6 ng L-1, and the peak area precision (RSD) for 5 replicate detections of 0.15 mu g L-1 Para Red was 4.1%. The applicability of this method for determination of the blank chili sauce sample, spiked with Para Red at 5 to 25 ng g(-1) levels, was demonstrated, with recoveries ranging from 86% to 95%.
   Practical Application: In this paper, a simple and sensitive analytical method, based on the coupling of molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction with high performance liquid chromatography, had been developed for determination of trace Para Red. It was applied to the analysis of spiking Para Red in chili sauce sample with satisfactory recovery and repatability. This proposed method has the potential to be used for monitoring the illegal addition of Para Red in foods in the future due to its simple, reliable, rapid, and excellent precision.

AB  - Elucidating the molecular mechanisms that created ancient complex traits like insect wings is difficult. Fortunately, some complex traits have arisen recently. For example, hermaphroditic reproduction evolved independently many times during recent nematode evolution [1-3]. Although C. elegans hermaphrodites require fog-2 [4], which encodes an F box protein that regulates the translation of tra-2 mRNAs [5, 6], the related species C. briggsae lacks fog-2 [7]. We identified a critical regulator of hermaphrodite development in C. briggsae, named she-1. Analysis of double mutants indicates that she-1 acts upstream of tra-2 in C. briggsae, just as fog-2 does in C. elegans. Molecular cloning shows that she-1 encodes a novel F box protein that was created by a recent gene duplication. Whereas FOG-2 acts through GLD-1 in C. elegans, SHE-1 does not bind GLD-1 in C. briggsae. Thus, both species recruited F box genes produced by recent duplication events into the sex-determination pathway to control hermaphrodite development, but these genes have distinct activities. This result implies that some gene families are more likely to give rise to novel regulatory genes than other families. Finally, we note that null mutations of she-1 are temperature sensitive, so C. briggsae might once have been a facultative hermaphrodite.

AB  - Many species expanded their geographic ranges from core "refugium'' populations when the global climate warmed after the Pleistocene. The bottlenecks that occur during such range expansions diminish genetic variation in marginal populations, rendering them less responsive to selection. Here, we show that range expansion also strongly depletes inbreeding depression. We compared inbreeding depression among 20 populations across the expanded range of a common European plant, and found that marginal populations had greatly reduced inbreeding depression. Similar patterns were also revealed by multilocus computer simulations. Low inbreeding depression is predicted to ease conditions for the evolution of self-fertilization, and selfing is known to be particularly frequent in marginal populations. Therefore, our findings expose a remarkable aspect of evolution at range margins, where a history of expansion can reverse the direction of selection on the mating system, providing a parsimonious explanation for the high incidence of selfing in marginal populations.

AB  - To modify the level and composition of isoflavones, the important bioactive constituents of soybean seeds, soybean was transformed via co-bombardment of embryogenic cultures with three DNA cassettes containing the CHS6-chalcone synthase and IFS2-isoflavone synthase genes, and a fragment of PAL5-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene, all in sense orientation under the lectin promoter mixed with the selectable marker gene, HPT (hygromycin phosphotransferase) under the 355 promoter. Four of six fertile lines produced integrated all four genes.
   Isoflavone levels were lower in T1 mature seeds of 5 of the 6 lines compared to the control. Transgene segregation was found in one selected line, with formation of additional sublines with different transgene composition found also in the homozygous plants. Decreased isoflavone concentrations (by about 70%) were found in T4 homozygous seeds of the two lines studied in detail here. The embryo axes accumulated most of the glycitein and contained a higher isoflavone concentration than the cotyledons. Expression of transgenes driven by the lectin promoter reduced the isoflavone concentration only in the cotyledons and not in embryo axes, indicating that this promoter is preferably active in cotyledons.

AB  - In this paper, a self adaptive real-coded genetic algorithm (SARGA) is implemented to solve the combined heat and power economic dispatch (CHPED) problem. The self adaptation is achieved by means of tournament selection along with simulated binary crossover (SBX). The selection process has a powerful exploration capability by creating tournaments between two solutions. The better solution is chosen and placed in the mating pool leading to better convergence and reduced computational burden. The SARGA integrates penalty parameterless constraint handling strategy and simultaneously handles equality and inequality constraints. The population diversity is introduced by making use of distribution index in SBX operator to create a better offspring. This leads to a high diversity in population which can increase the probability towards the global optimum and prevent premature convergence. The SARGA is applied to solve CHPED problem with bounded feasible operating region which has large number of local minima. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can find a solution towards the global optimum and compares favourably with other recent methods in terms of solution quality, handling constraints and computation time.

AB  - Background: As exemplified by the famously successful model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, nematodes offer outstanding animal systems for investigating diverse biological phenomena due to their small genome sizes, short generation times and ease of laboratory maintenance. Nematodes in the genus Panagrolaimus have served in comparative development and anhydrobiosis studies, and the Antarctic species P. davidi offers a powerful paradigm for understanding the biological mechanisms of extreme cold tolerance. Panagrolaimus nematodes are also unique in that examples of gonochoristic, hermaphroditic and parthenogenetic reproductive modes have been reported for members of this genus. The evolutionary origins of these varying reproductive modes and the Antarctic species P. davidi, however, remain enigmatic.
   Results: We collected nuclear ribosomal RNA gene and mitochondrial protein-coding gene sequences from diverse Panagrolaimus species and strains, including newly discovered isolates from Oregon, to investigate phylogenetic relationships in this nematode genus. Nuclear phylogenies showed that the species and strains historically identified as members of Panagrolaimus constitute a paraphyletic group, suggesting that taxonomic revision is required for Panagrolaimus and related nematode lineages. Strain-specific reproductive modes were mapped onto the molecular phylogeny to show a single origin of parthenogenesis from a presumably gonochoristic ancestor. The hermaphroditic strains were all placed outside a major monophyletic clade that contained the majority of other Panagrolaimus nematodes. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial sequences showed that substantial molecular and geographic diversity exists within the clade of parthenogenetic strains. The Antarctic species P. davidi was found to be very closely related to two Panagrolaimus strains from southern California. Phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses suggested that P. davidi and the California strain PS1579 shared a common ancestor in the very recent evolutionary past.
   Conclusion: Our study provides a phylogenetic framework for understanding the evolutionary origins and diversification patterns of varying reproductive modes within Panagrolaimus and important insights into the origin of the Antarctic species P. davidi. Panagrolaimus offers a powerful nematode model for understanding diverse evolutionary phenomena including the evolution of asexuality and the adaptive evolution of extreme cold tolerance.

AB  - The current study investigated the changes in sperm quality (motility, velocity, and chromatin integrity) occurring during storage at room temperature or 5 degrees C for up to 48 hours in spermatozoa after extension or single-layer centrifugation (SLC) throught Androcoll-E. In unselected samples, all parameters of sperm quality deteriorated significantly during storage (P < .01), although the deterioration was faster at room temperature (22-30 degrees C) than for cool storage (P < .01). The SLC-selected spermatozoa had higher motility, velocity, and chromatin integrity than the overall unselected population (motility: selected 85 +/- 10%, unselected 56 +/- 13%; P < .001; velocity: selected 85.1 +/- 13 mu m/second, unselected 63.5 +/- 15 mu m/second; P < .001; and DFI selected 12.2 +/- 4.8 mu m/second; unselected 23.6 +/- 7.4 mu m/second; P < .001). Furthermore, sperm quality did not deteriorate with storage in the SLC-selected samples, either at room temperature (22-30 degrees C for 24 hours) or cooled to 4 degrees C (for at least 48 hours), whereas a significant deterioration in sperm quality was observed in the unselected sperm samples (P < .01). Thus, room temperature storage of SLC-selected spermatozoa may be an option for insemination doses from stallions whose spermatozoa do not tolerate cooling. In addition, a new sperm analyzer, the Qualisperm, showed good correlation with subjective motility assessment (r = 0.8, P < .001), was user-friendly, and provided a reasonable volume of data. This instrument may be a useful adjunct to sperm quality assessment at the study.

AB  - We studied variations in genetic, physiological, and ecological traits, and the phylogenetic relationship among sexual and parthenogenetic populations of Asobara japonica, a larval parasitoid of drosophilid flies, in order to understand how they adapt to local environments and have differentiated. The strain from Iriomote-jima (IR) differed from other Japanese strains in the nucleotide sequences of its cytochrome oxidase Subunit I (COI) and in not undergoing diapause and having a shorter preimaginal period and a higher adult tolerance of cold. The strains other than IR showed a low level of nucleotide variation in COI but varied in their mode of reproduction; the strains from the Ryukyu Islands were sexual, whereas those from the main islands of Japan and Ogasawara were parthenogenetic. In addition, strains from higher latitudes generally showed a high incidence of diapause, although there were some exceptions. On the other hand, preimaginal period and adult cold tolerance varied little among the strains excluding IR, and pupal cold tolerance, oviposition preference and incidence of parasitism varied little among the strains including IR. Evolution and environmental adaptations in this species are discussed, particularly focusing on parthenogenetic populations.

KW  - NANOSTRUCTURES
KW  - MICROTUBULES
AB  - A route for producing polyaniline nanotubes using the inner eggshell membrane as a template is demonstrated. Because the template substitutes the inner eggshell membrane with the outer eggshell membrane in the same reaction process, the resulting morphology of polyaniline correspondingly changes. A series of experimental results indicate that the pore size of the template plays a key role in the formation of the polyaniline nanotubes. By imaging the template before, during, and after the polymerization, a possible formation condition and process of polyaniline nanotubes is proposed. Meanwhile, fiber mats imitating an eggshell membrane-electrospun poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) fiber mats-are successfully used as a template for synthesizing polyaniline nanotubes in the same polymerization process. Using the PVA fiber mats as the template for different pore size and using an electrospinning method for different hours, respectively, the resulting morphology of the polyaniline correspondingly changes. When the pore size of PVA fiber mats is similar to that of the inner eggshell membrane, polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes can be obtained. The high surface areas, small diameter, and porous nature of the PANI nanotubes give significantly better performance in both gas sensitivity and time response. The gas-responses to trimethylamine, ammonia, and hydrazine are examined at room temperature. Compared with polyaniline prepared without a template, the polyaniline nanotubes prepared using the imitating template show higher selectivity and quicker response to trimethylamine gas. Meanwhile, the reversible circulation response change of polyaniline nanotubes has a reasonable reproducibility and has more potential applications in the area of sensor development.

AB  - Kin recognition has been demonstrated to play an important role in the social structure of a wide range of animals. Most studies to date have examined parent-offspring recognition only in species that provide offspring with direct parental care, however, there are several advantages to parent-offspring recognition even in the absence of direct parental care. In this study we investigated reciprocal mother-offspring recognition in the Australian scincid lizard Eulamprus heatwolei, a species that does not show direct parental care. We examined whether neonates could discriminate between their mothers and unrelated females, and whether females could discriminate between their offspring and unrelated neonates, via chemical cues, using retreat site selection experiments. We conducted trials when neonates were 1 and 4 weeks old to investigate whether responses are maintained as neonates age. We found that both neonates and mothers could discriminate between related and unrelated individuals when neonates were 1 week old. Mothers were more likely to take refuge under tiles treated with the odours of their own offspring, while neonates spent less time in areas treated with the odours of unrelated females. At 4 weeks of age, mothers no longer exhibited discriminatory behaviour between their offspring and unrelated neonates, while neonates were more likely to associate with the odour of any female over the odourless control. We hypothesize that reciprocal mother-offspring recognition in E. heatwolei reduces interference competition between mothers and their offspring and also may be important in habitat selection and territory establishment.

AB  - The gametogenic cycle of the smooth clam Callista chione off the Arrabida region was studied throughout a 17-month period (from January 2004 to May 2005) using standard histological techniques, mean oocyte diameters and a condition index. This species showed a synchronism between sexes both in terms of gametogenic development and spawning. The results indicated that sex-ratio was not significantly different from parity. In January 2004, the gametogenic cycle had already begun and ended in late October 2004. Three spawning peaks were detected: January-March, April-May and August-October. No resting period was observed and a new gametogcnic cycle began in early November, immediately after the spawning period. The analysis of the oocyte diameter enabled predicting the main spawning periods, which appear to be largely governed by sea-water temperature. The condition index evolved according to the reproductive cycle of the species, with the highest values being observed prior to the main spawning periods. The size at first maturity estimated for C. chione was 50-81 mm.

AB  - Throughout the Northern Hemisphere, changes in local and regional climate conditions are coupled to the recurring and persistent large-scale patterns of pressure and circulation anomalies spanning vast geographical areas, the so-called teleconnection patterns. Indeed, the atmospheric fluctuations described by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are closely associated with the last four decades of inter-annual variability in local snow and ice conditions observed in the Arctic. Since the NAO has also been connected with changes in the global climate, the behaviour of species, communities and other ecosystem elements at Zackenberg in relation to the NAO enables us to view these in circumpolar and global contexts.
   Large-scale systems like the NAO constitute the link between the global change and local climate variability to which ecosystem components respond. Here, we place selected ecosystem elements from the monitoring programme Zackenberg Basic presented in previous chapters in a circumpolar context related to NAO-mediated climatic changes. We begin by linking the local variability in winter weather conditions at Zackenberg to fluctuations in the NAO. We then proceed by linking the observed intra- and inter-annual behaviour of selected ecosystem elements to changes in the NAO. The functional ecosystem characteristics in focus are landscape gas exchange dynamics phenological patterns at different trophic levels, consumer-resource dynamics and community stability. The influence of the NAO is presented and discussed in a broader perspective based on information obtained from other arctic localities.
   The relation between the NAO and the Zackenberg winter weather, is nonlinear, reflecting differential effects of the NAO as the index moves between high and low phases. The inverse hyperbolic relationship found between the NAO and the amount of winter snow was also evident as non-linear response in organisms and systems to inter-annual changes in the NAO. Responses investigated included growth and reproduction in plants and animals, population dynamics and synchrony, inter-trophic interactions and community stability together with system feedback dynamics.

AB  - We analyzed the foraging activity and the dietary spectrum of the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile Mayr) and select native ants on cork oaks from Mediterranean open cork oak (Quercus suber) secondary forests. The study areas included invaded and noninvaded zones in close proximity. The Argentine ant's daily foraging activity was correlated to the abiotic factors studied, whereas the seasonal foraging activity was related not only to the variations in the average air temperature, but also to the trophic needs of the colony. Argentine ant workers focused their attention on protein foods during the queens' oviposition periods and during the larvae development phase, and on carbohydrate foods, such as honeydew, when males and workers were hatching. There were no significant differences over the entire year in the quantity of liquid food collected by the Argentine ant workers in comparison with the native ants studied. The solid diet of the Argentine ant on cork oaks is composed of insects, most of which are aphids. Our results have clear applications for control methods based on toxic baits in the invaded natural ecosystems of the Iberian Peninsula.

AB  - Using emulsified triacylglycerols, we have shown recently [Mosbah et al., 2007, submitted for publication] that amino acid residue G311 of Staphylococcus xylosus lipase (SXL) is critically involved in substrate selectivity, pH and temperature dependency. Using the monomolecular film technique, we show in the present study that the four single mutants of this residue (G311L, G311W, G311D, and G311K), interact efficiently with egg-phosphatidyl choline (egg-PC) monomolecular films, comparably to the wild-type (G311). A critical surface pressure (pi(c)) of about 25 mN/m was obtained with the SXL wild-type (SXL-WT) and its mutants. These results support our conclusion that the G311 residue is not involved in the interfacial adsorption step of SXL. A kinetic study on the Surface pressure dependency, stereoselectivity, and regioselectivity of SXL-WT and its G311 mutants was also performed using optically pure enantiomers of diacylglycerols (1,2-sn-dicaprin and 2,3-sn-dicaprin) and a prochiral isomer (1,3-sn-dicaprin) spread as monomolecular films at the air-water interface. Our results indicated that the mutation of one single residue at position 311 affects critically the catalytic activity, the stereo- and the regioselectivity of SXL. As previously observed with emulsified substrates [Mosbah et al., 2007, submitted for publication] we observed that an increase in the size of the 311 amino acid side chain residue was accompanied by a decrease of lipase activity measured on dicaprin monolayer. We also noticed that the substitution of G311 by a basic or acidic residue (G311K and G311D), induces a significant shift of the pH optimum from 8 to 9.5 or from 8 to 6.5, respectively.

AB  - Hydrorefining of C-4 cuts of unsaturated hydrocarbons involves the selective removal of 1-butyne by catalytic hydrogenation. Due to its technological relevance, we investigated the hydrogenation of 1-butyne over a commercial palladium-based catalyst of the eggshell type. The experimental conditions were selected to reproduce those of industrial hydrorefining reactors: liquid-phase reaction, seven levels of temperature between 27 and 62 degrees C, initial concentrations of 1-butyne up to 0.6 mol/l and hydrogen partial pressure ranging from 0.8 to 8 atm. Under these conditions, the overall effectiveness factor of 1-butyne hydrogenation was less than 0.15. Provided that hydrogen was the limiting reactant inside the active shell, 1-butene was the only product yielded by 1-butyne hydrogenation. The regression analysis of experimental data corresponding to the hydrogenation of 1-butyne to 1-butene was restricted to experimental compositions in which 1-butyne concentration was higher than 0.07 mol/l. An intrinsic kinetic expression with reaction orders 1 and -1 for hydrogen and 1-butyne, respectively, predicts experimental data with an average deviation of 2.1%. Estimates of the activation energy and kinetic coefficient at 44 degrees C are (1.55 +/- 0.06) 10(4) cal/mol and (4.6 +/- 0.1) mol/(kg s). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data on the occurrence of sardine (Sardina pilchardus) eggs from 42 national ichthyoplankton surveys along the European Atlantic coast were collated in order to describe the spawning habitat and spawning distribution of sardine in recent decades (1985-2005). A modification of existing spawning habitat characterisation techniques and a newly developed method to compare the probability of egg presence across surveys carried out with different sampling gears were used. Results showed that sardine spawning off the Atlantic European coast is mainly restricted to the shelf area, with the main geographical range being between the Strait of Gibraltar (the southern limit of data available for this analysis) and the middle part of the Armorican shelf (latitude around 47.5 degrees North), and along a temperature range of 12-17 degrees C. Spawning grounds within these limits show a nearly continuous geographical distribution, covering a large proportion of the shelf of the Iberian peninsula and adjacent waters, except for: (1) a persistent gap at the north west corner of the Iberian peninsula, (2) a small secondary break at the Spanish-French border in the inner part of the Bay of Biscay and (3) at the south west corner of the peninsula where there is a narrowing of the shelf width. These discontinuities were used to separate spawning into four nuclei and to describe the changes in spawning distribution in the time series. The relative importance of each nucleus and the degree of separation between adjacent nuclei varies between years, with the exception of the permanent gap at the northwest corner of the Iberian peninsula, which is persistent throughout the time series. Year to year changes in the proportion of the potential spawning habitat in which spawning actually occurred, changing from around 60% before the mid 1990s to around 40% thereafter, and did not show any relationship with spawning stock biomass. Evolution of potential habitat occupation over the Armorican shelf shows larger variability than that observed in the Iberian peninsula, with percentages of occupation ranging from around 30% up to nearly 80% of the shelf in recent years (within the limitations of the relatively sparse data for this region).

AB  - At the National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture (US Department of Agriculture, Ag. Research Service) in Leetown, WV, we have a broodstock development program now entering the second generation of family-based selective breeding using expected breeding values (EBVs). Our major breeding objectives are faster growth and resistance to Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the causative agent of bacterial coldwater disease. For these traits we have developed assays to evaluate phenotypic performance. In addition to our breeding program, we are participating in an international collaboration to develop a microsatellite marker linkage map for the rainbow trout with the intent of identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) and using them in marker (MAS) or gene-assisted (GAS) selection. There are several possible approaches with regard to the types and numbers of markers to develop and the strategies and methods for implementing the markers in a selective breeding program. This paper describes the choices we made concerning QTL identification for traits of high, low, and unknown degrees of heritability. These traits are plasma cortisol response to a crowding stress (h(2) = 0.4), feed intake (h(2) = 0.1) and resistance to F. psychrophilum (0.3 < h(2)< 0.4). In order to identify QTL in a relevant commercially important rainbow trout line, we are making crosses from within our resource population. The development of research family crosses, choice of markers for genome scanning, and planned steps to implementation of these results are described.

AB  - Wheat yield prediction using different agrometcorological indices, spectral index (NDVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and trend predicted yield (TPY) were developed in Hoshiarpur and Rupnagar districts of Punjab. On the basis of examination of Correlation Coefficients (R), Standard Error of Estimate (SEOE) and Relative Deviation (RD) values resulted from different agromet models, the best agromet subset were selected as Minimum Temperature (T-min), Maximum Temperature (T-max) and accumulated Heliothermal Units (HTU) in case of Hoshiarpur district and Minimum Temperature accumulated Temperature Difference (TD) and accumulated Pan Evaporation (E) for Rupnagar district at reproductive stage (2(nd) week of March) of wheat. It was found that Agromet-Spectral-Trend-Yield model could explain 96% (SEOE = 87 kg/ha) and 91% (SEOE = 146 kg/ha) of wheat yield variations for Hoshiarpur and Rupnagar districts, respectively.

AB  - Both deleterious mutations and parasites have been acknowledged as potential selective forces responsible for the evolutionary maintenance of sexual reproduction. The pluralist approach to sex proposes that these two factors may have to interact synergistically in order to stabilize sex, and one of the simplest ways this could occur is if parasites are capable of causing synergistic epistasis between mutations in their hosts. However, the effects of both deleterious mutations and parasitism are known to be influenced by a range of environmental factors, so the nature of the interaction may depend upon the organisms' environment. Using chemically mutated Daphnia magna lines, we examined the effects of mutation and parasitism under a range of temperature and food regimes. We found that although parasites were capable of causing synergistic epistasis between mutations in their hosts, these effects were dependent upon an interaction between parasite genotype and temperature.

AB  - Regenerable, embryogenic haploid cell suspensions were initiated and established from type II pollen calluses of two selected Chinese maize genotypes (No 592 Y and 592.A2 LY). The induction frequency of friable, embryogenic callus (type II) was highly dependent on three factors: genotype, medium, cold pretreatment, and on their interactions. Repeated callus and cell selection during the culture procedure led to stable haploid suspensions consisting of fine clusters each containing 20-50 cells. The selected cell lines were able to maintain their morphogenic ability during long-term subculture (2 years). Protoplasts were successfully isolated from subcultured, friable, embryogenic pollen calluses and cultured on N6BM and N6K media using a feeder layer, obtained from 2-day-old suspension culture. Healthy plants were regenerated from protoplast-derived calluses.

AB  - This paper describes a 3D FE simulation of the cold ironing process for forming the drum clutch, the main part component of the automatic transmission. The process of the drum clutch with inner gears that was employed in this study consists of 12 steps associated with nine deep drawing processes and three ironing processes to form the inner gear shape. The ironing processes were focused on this study in order to estimate the dimensional accuracy of the inner gear shape according to the process variables such as the punch shape, the approach angle of the punch, and the thickness reduction ratio. A rigid-plastic finite element simulation was applied to analyze the deformation characteristics of the ironing processes and to determine the optimum parameter for selected conditions. Finally, an experiment on the whole drum clutch forming process was carried out to examine the validity of the analytical results and the chosen parameters. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A functional response study of the eight most common arthropod predators of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), eggs was conducted in the laboratory. Predators were starved for 24 h, and single predators were exposed to different prey density treatments. Predation response was observed at 6, 12, and 24 h after feeding trials began. At the highest prey density (150 eggs per predator), Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville and Collops quadrimaculatus (F.) adults and Chrysopa oculata Say larvae showed the highest consumption rates (116, 85, and 119 eggs/24 h, respectively), followed by H. convergens larvae (51 eggs/24 h), adult Geocoris punctipes (Say) (45 eggs/24 h), and adult Scymnus loewii Mulsant, Orius insidiosus (Say), Notoxus spp., and Nabis capsiformis Germar (1, 1, 10, and 12 eggs/24 h, respectively). Adult Notoxus spp., N. capsiformis, and O. insidiosus showed type 1 functional response, whereas adult C. quadrimaculatus, G. punctipes, H. convergens, and larval H. convergens and C. oculata showed type 2 response. All predators consumed the highest number of bollworm eggs at 35 degrees C and the lowest numbers at 15 degrees C; predation rate at 35 degrees C was four times higher than that at 15 degrees C. The prey density-dependent behavior of predators and effect of temperature on their predation behavior are discussed.

AB  - Humans are evolutionarily adapted to chronic undernutrition as a consequence of ecologically dictated dietary restriction. Increased aridity, cooler temperatures and increased climatic oscillation effected an alteration of the quantity and quality of vegetation upon which hominids depended for food during the Plio-Pleistocene period. Hominids responded physiologically to climate-induced caloric curtailment in the same way organisms respond to experimentally imposed caloric restriction: by reducing the rate and/or altering the manner in which they metabolized fuel. Such metabolic alterations are mediated principally by the hypothalamus and it is herein hypothesized that the human hypothalamus was subjected to substantial selective pressure, promoting an energetically conservative hypometabolic state. Moreover, the most salient phenotypic characteristics typifying the human species - long lifespan, low reproductive potential, lengthy development and high brain/bodyweight ratio are effectuated in organisms undergoing caloric restriction. These phenotypic/physiological characteristics - herein termed the quadripartite complex - can be modulated by metabolic rate, which is, in turn, modulated by the hypothalamus. An appreciable alteration in climate occurred between 2.0 and 1.5 million years ago, a juncture at which one hominid Lineage (Paranthropus) went extinct. Paranthropus was characterized by such external adaptations as robust cranio-facial. morphology and pronounced enamel deposition, indicative of subsistence on tough, low-quality vegetal foods. Conversely, the Homo lineage responded to its marginal dietary repertoire through internal means, centering on metabolic suppression. It is herein hypothesized that this adaptive metabolic alteration, enacted in response to ecologically imposed caloric restriction, produced the defining morphologic attributes of Homo and enabled the evolutionary success of the human species. Among the implications of this line of thinking is that modern humans may be particularly sensitive to the deleterious effects of excess energy intake and, concomitantly, particularly amenable to the ameliorative effects of caloric restriction.

AB  - The application of genetic male sterility in hybrid rice production has great potential to revolutionize hybrid seed production methodology. The two-line breeding system by using thermo-sensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) has been discovered and successfully developed as a breeding strategy in rice. One TGMS gene was investigated by a spontaneous rice mutant line, Sokcho-MS, originated from a Korean japonica variety. It was shown that Sokcho-MS is completely sterile at a temperature higher than 27 degrees C and/or lower than 25 degrees C during the development of spikelets, but fertile at the temperature ranging from 25 to 27 degrees C regardless of the levels of day-length. Genetic analysis and molecular mapping based on SSR, STS and EST markers revealed that a single recessive gene locus involved the control of genic male sterility in Sokcho-MS. By using an F-2 mapping population derived from a cross between Sokcho-MS and a fertile indica variety Neda, the new TGMS gene, designated as tms6, was mapped primarily to the long arm of chromosome 5 of Oryza sativa at the interval between markers E60663 (2.0 cM) and RM440 (5.8 cM). Subsequently, tms6 was fine mapped to the interval between markers RM3351 (0.1 cM) and E60663 (1.9 cM). As tms6 appeared to be independent of other mapped TGMS genes in rice, the genetic basis of Sokcho-MS was further discussed.

AB  - Aging research in vertebrates is hampered by the lack of short-lived models. Annual fishes of the genus Nothobranchius live in East African seasonal ponds. Their life expectancy in the wild is limited by the duration of the wet season and their lifespan in captivity is also short. Nothobranchius are popular aquarium fishes and many different species are kept as captive strains, providing rich material for comparative studies. The present paper aims at reviving the interest in these fishes by reporting that: (1) Nothobranchius can be cultured, and their eggs stored dry at room temperature for months or years, offering inexpensive methods of embryo storage; (2) Nothobranchius show accelerated growth and expression of aging biomarkers at the level of histology and behaviour; (3) the species Nothobranchius furzeri has a maximum lifespan of only 3 months and offers the possibility to perform investigations thus far unthinkable in a vertebrate, such as drug screening with life-long pharmacological treatments and experimental evolution; (4) when the lifespan of different species is compared, a general correlation is found between wet season duration in their natural habitat and longevity in captivity; and (5) vertebrate aging-related genes, such as p66Shc and MTP, can be easily isolated in Nothobranchius by homology cloning. These fishes can become excellent models for aging studies. They can be employed to test the effects of experimental manipulation on aging at a pace comparable with that of Drosophila and to probe the effects of natural selection on the evolution of aging-related genes.

AB  - Characteristics of the nesting habitat of Trionyx mutica were studied below Lock and Darn 19, upper Mississippi River. A 1/2 km section of sandy shoreline where T. mutica had previously been found to be abundant was examined for nests. Nest construction occurred between mid June and mid July. Active nests, those containing eggs, were found in sandy soils within a narrow range of surface temperatures (36-37 degrees C). The preferred sites were exposed to direct sunlight with little or no vegetation present. Over 90% of the active nests were found at sites with these characteristics. False nests were found in areas with much higher or lower soil surface temperatures, which indicated that turtles may select for optimum temperatures.

AB  - Single-crystal Raman spectra are presented for the salt [C(NH2)(3)][V(OH2)(6)](SO4)(2), displaying electronic transitions between the trigonal components of the vanadium(III) T-3(1g)(O-h) ground term. The (3)A -> E-3(C-3) electronic Raman band is centered at similar to 2720 cm(-1), and exhibits extensive structure, revealing the energies of the spinor components of the E-3(C-3) term for the two crystallographically distinct [V(OH2)(6)](3+) cations. The data are interpreted in conjunction with parameters previously reported from an electron paramagnetic resonance study of the salt. A satisfactory reproduction of the electronic Raman profile and ground-state spin-Hamiltonian parameters is achieved by employing a ((3)A circle plus E-3)circle times e vibronic coupling model, in which the spin-orbit splitting of the E-3(C-3) is quenched significantly by the Ham effect, and the intensity of harmonics of the Jahn-Teller active vibration enhanced by their proximity to the electronic Raman bands. The model gives an excellent account of the intensities of the electronic Raman bands, which are shown to depend profoundly on both temperature and the selected component of the polarizability tensor. The electronic Raman profile changes notably upon deuteriation, a result that exposes deficiencies in the single-mode coupling model.

AB  - Selective laser sintering (SLS) experiments with polyetherketone (PEK) and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) powders are described. The absorption behaviour of the polymer powders has been investigated with respect to the content of carbon black as an IR-absorber in the range from 0.03 to 0.1 wt.%. Laser sintering process studies have been carried out at room temperature using a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser system. The sintering depths of single layer substrates have been determined according to the process parameters, such as laser power scanning speed and hatch distance. These process parameters have been optimised with the goal of achieving good structural integrity of the substrate. The influence of melt viscosity has been determined by comparing PEEK powders of low and standard melt viscosity. Scanning electron micrographs show the morphology of the original polymer powders and the laser sintered specimens. On the basis of the experimental results a qualitative SLS mechanism is proposed to describe the energy transfer from the carbon black particles to the surrounding polymer powder.

AB  - Sex differences in metabolic rate (MR) can result from dimorphism in the performance of energetically demanding activities. Male crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus) engage in costly calling and aggressive activity not performed by females. Consistent with this difference, we found higher maximal MR, factorial scope, and fat content in males than females. T. oceanicus song is also costly because it attracts the parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea. Parasitized crickets had reduced maximal MR consistent with a metabolic cost to harboring larvae. This cost was greater for females, either because females invest more heavily into reproduction at the expense of metabolic capacity, or because males are under stronger selection to respond to infection. Little is known about O. ochracea outside of its auditory system and parasitic lifestyle. We observed greater resting MR in male flies, possibly reflecting a sex difference in the requirement for metabolic power output, because male flies perform potentially costly mating behavior not seen in females. We found a positive relationship between larval density within a cricket and pupal resting MR, suggesting that crickets in good condition are able to both harbor more larvae and produce larvae with higher resting MR. These results reveal a complex interplay between the metabolism of crickets and their fly parasitoids.

AB  - The pathway for oxygen, the control of oxygen transport and the role of haemoglobin expression for the physiological adaptation to different oxygen and temperature conditions were studied in the ecological model organism Daphnia magna. Ventilation of the inner walls of the carapace as the main gas exchange area as well as of the embryos in the brood pouch are controlled, oxygen-dependent processes. The P-O2-dependent increase of heart rate as well as perfusion rate during short-term, progressive hypoxia improves the circulatory oxygen transport within the body. The regulation of haemoglobin (Hb) expression is the central mechanism for a medium-term adaptation to hypoxia. Genetic control elements and oxygen conditions near the two Hb synthesis sites (fat cells, epipodite epithelial cells) determine, which types of Hb subunits and, accordingly, hetero-multimeric Hb macromolecules are produced. One synthesis site may respond mainly to internal, the other one to external oxygen conditions. Depending on environmental condition, either higher quantities of macromolecules of unchanged functionality (P-50) or increasing amounts of macromolecules with higher oxygen affinity are synthesized. The Hb subunit DmHbA is probably of considerable importance for this functional change. The physiological benefits of haemoglobin in Daphnia are discussed. Physiological adaptation of Daphnia to different temperatures is also related to the control of oxygen transport processes with the regulation of haemoglobin expression again as a central mechanism.

AB  - The setting expansion is an important property for a phosphate-bonded investment material. This research was undertaken to investigate a test that might be suitable for its measurement when used in a Standard. In the 'Casting-Ring Test', the investment sample is contained in a steel ring and expands to displace a precisely positioned pin. Variables with the potential to alter routine reproduction of the value were investigated. The vacuum-mixer model is a production laboratory variable that must not be ignored and for this reason, experiments were repeated using a different vacuum-mixer located at a second test site. Restraint by the rigid ring material increased expansion, while force on the pin reduced it. Expansion was specific to the lining selected. Increased environmental temperature decreased the final value. Expansion was still taking place at a time at which its value might be measured. However, when these factors are set, the reproducibility of values for setting expansion was good at both test sites (coefficient of variation 14%, at most). The results revealed that with the control that is available reliable routine measurement is possible in a Standard test. The inter-laboratory variable, vacuum-mixer model, produced significant differences and it should be the subject of further investigation.

AB  - The thermosensitive genic male sterility (TGMS) system has great potential for revolutionizing hybrid rice production through simple, less expensive and more efficient seed production technology. For the successful utilization of this novel male sterility system, knowledge of the breeding and fertility behaviour of a TGMS line is essential. In this study, the fertility transformation behaviour, the critical fertility and sterility temperatures and the mode of inheritance of male sterility were studied for a new TGMS line, TS6, identified at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, India. The pollen and spikelet fertilities recorded on plants raised at fortnightly intervals revealed that this line was completely sterile for 78 consecutive days (35/22 to 32/23degreesC, maximum/minimum temperatures) and reverted to fertile when the temperature was 30/18degreesC. It remained fertile continuously for 69 days and the maximum pollen and spikelet fertilities recorded were 75 and 70%, respectively. The fertility was highly influenced by daily maximum temperature followed by average and minimum temperatures. It was not influenced by relative humidity, sunshine hours or photoperiod. The critical temperature inducing sterility and fertility was 26.7 and 25.5degreesC, respectively. The male sterility in TS6 was inherited as a monogenic recessive in the F-2 and BC1 populations of TS6 x MRST9 as well as TS6 x IR68281B. Using bulked segregant analysis on an F-2 population of TS6 x MRST9, an RAPD marker, OPC05(2962), was identified to be associated with TGMS in TS6.

AB  - We investigated the effect of temperature on the activity of soil ammonia oxidizers caused by changes in the availability of ammonium and in the microbial community structure. Both short (5 days) and long (6.5, 16 and 20 weeks) incubation of an agricultural soil resulted in a decrease in ammonium concentration that was more pronounced at temperatures between 10 and 25degreesC than at either 4degreesC or 30-37degreesC. Consistently, potential nitrification was higher between 10 and 25degreesC than at either 4degreesC or 37degreesC. However, as long as ammonium was not limiting, release rates of N-2 O increased monotonously between 4 and 37degreesC after short-term temperature adaptation, with nitrification accounting for about 35-50% of the N-2 O production between 4 and 25degreesC. In order to see whether temperature may also affect the community structure of ammonia oxidizers, we studied moist soil during long incubation at low and high concentrations of commercial fertilizer. The soil was also incubated in buffered (pH 7) slurry amended with urea. Communities of ammonia oxidizers were assayed by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the amoA gene coding for the alpha subunit of ammonia monooxygenase. We found that a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system using a non-degenerated reverse primer (amoAR1) gave the best results. Community shifts occurred in all soil treatments after 16 weeks of incubation. The community shifts were obviously influenced by the different fertilizer treatments, indicating that ammonium was a selective factor for different ammonia oxidizer populations. Temperature was also a selective factor, in particular as community shifts were also observed in the soil slurries, in which ammonium concentrations and pH were better controlled. Cloning and sequencing of selected DGGE bands indicated that amoA sequences belonging to Nitrosospira cluster 1 were dominant at low temperatures (4-10degreesC), but were absent after long incubation at low fertilizer treatment. Sequences of Nitrosospira cluster 9 could only be detected at low ammonium concentrations, whereas those of Nitrosospira cluster 3 were found at most ammonium concentrations and temperatures, although individual clones of this cluster exhibited trends with temperature. Obviously, ammonia oxidizers are able to adapt to soil conditions by changes in the community structure if sufficient time (several weeks) is available.

AB  - The development of the solitary endoparasitoid Meteorus gyrator was compared in the six larval stages of its host, the tomato moth Lacanobia oleracea , and at five constant temperatures. The host instar at the time of parasitism had a marked effect on the larval developmental period of the parasitoid, such that larvae derived from eggs oviposited in first instar hosts took approximately 18 days to egress, whilst those derived from eggs oviposited in sixth instar hosts took <10 days. The weight of cocoons was greatest when oviposition was into final instar hosts, where female cocoons averaged 12.8 mg, and lowest in those derived from eggs oviposited into first instars (9.2 mg). The parasitoid's larval development rate in third instar hosts increased with temperature increments in a linear fashion up to 25 degrees C, after which development times were only marginally increased. At 10 degrees C, the mean larval development time was approximately 90 days and pupal development 35-40 days, whilst at 25 degrees C development times were 10-11 days for larvae and 6-7 days for the pupae. In the majority of cases, overall development times were marginally longer (<1 day) in females than in males.

AB  - A kinetic investigation of the vapor-phase hydrogenation and hydroisomerization of 1-butene and cis- and trans-2-butene is presented. This investigation is aimed at validating a practical set of rate equations. The experiments were performed at approximately atmospheric pressure using a commercial Pd/Al2O3 catalyst of the eggshell type in an integral fixed-bed isothermal reactor. The outlet composition was measured under 120 sets of operating conditions at six levels of temperature between -8 and 30 degreesC. The mole fractions of 1-butene and hydrogen in the feed were varied between 0.5 and 3% and between 0.5 and 50%, respectively. Space-time covered the range of (5-55) x 10(-3) S. Internal diffusion limitations affected the effective reaction rates and product distribution. Hence, the mass conservation equations inside the catalyst had to be solved to estimate the intrinsic values of the kinetic parameters. Two rival kinetic models of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson type were proposed, one of which could be confidently discriminated as the better of the two models considered. An essential feature of the chosen model is that hydrogen concentration exhibits distinct effects on the hydrogenation and hydroisomerization reactions of n-butenes. The selected model predicts the experimental results with an average deviation of 8.8%. The estimates of the kinetic parameters show inference intervals in the range of +/-10-30%.

AB  - The susceptibility of brakes and clutches to the known phenomenon of frictionally-excited thermoelastic instability is estimated studying the interface temperature and pressure evolution with time. A simple model has been considered where a layer with half-thickness a slides with speed V between two rigid and non-conducting half-planes. The advantage of this fairly simple model is that it permits us to deduce analytically the critical conditions for the onset of instability, that is the relation between the critical speed V-cr and the growth rate b of the interface temperature and pressure. It has then been verified that as the thickness a reduces the system becomes more and more prone to instability, and that a symmetrical pressure/temperature distribution at the layer interfaces can be more unstable than an antisymmetrical one. Moreover, the analysis of the evolution of the system beyond the critical conditions has shown that even if low frequency perturbations are associated with small critical speed, they might be less critical than high frequency perturbations if the working sliding speed is much larger than the actual critical speed of the system.

AB  - A 2D multilayered model has been considered to estimate the transient evolution of temperature and pressure perturbations in multi-disk clutches and brakes during operation. The model proposed by Decuzzi et al. [1] has been modified here to estimate the variation of b-perturbation growth rate-with V-relative sliding speed. It has been verified that the perturbation with the lowest critical speed has also the highest growth rate, and that low frequency perturbations are less critical than high frequency perturbations, at fixed critical speed. Therefore, when comparing perturbations with identical critical speed, those with higher wave numbers are responsible for more intense thermomechanical damages. Also, for perturbations with wave number smaller than the critical m(er), the temperature increases with m; vice versa for perturbations with wave number larger than mer the temperature decreases with m. A reduction in thickness ratio a(1)/a(2) between friction and metal disks has the effect of increasing the temperature and growth rate. An approximate formula for the temperature variation with time has been derived for a linearly decreasing engagement speed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The computational burden associated with applications of the Tolerable Windows Approach (TWA) considerably exceeds that of traditional integrated assessments of global climate change. As part of the ICLIPS (Integrated Assessment of Climate Protection Strategies) project, a computationally efficient climate model has been developed that can be included in integrated assessment models of any kind. The ICLIPS climate model (ICM) is implemented in GAMS. It is driven by anthropogenic emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, halocarbons, S(F)6, and SO2. The output includes transient patterns of near-surface air temperature, total column-integrated cloud cover fraction, precipitation, humidity, and global mean sea-level rise. The carbon cycle module explicitly treats the nonlinear sea water carbon chemistry and the nonlinear CO2 fertilized biosphere uptake. Patterns of the impact-relevant climate variables are derived form empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and scaled by the principal component of temperature change. The evolution of the latter is derived from a box-model-type differential analogue to its impulse response function convolution integral. We present a description of the ICM components and some results to demonstrate the model's applicability in the TWA setting.

AB  - The rapidly dividing cleavage stages of embryos do not have the typical responses to cell damage, such as induction of the heat shock response, use of mitotic checkpoints, or use of apoptosis to eliminate severely damaged cells. This could create problems with integrity of DNA, but the solution in these embryos appears to be a "be prepared" approach, in which specific adaptations are used to minimize DNA damage during cleavage and the use of apoptosis at the mid-blastula transition to remove any cells that were nevertheless damaged. It has been assumed that this approach has evolved because of the advantage of rapid production of a motile larvae. Alternatively, this particular approach may have the selective advantage of increasing mutation rate when there are greater environmental stresses. This could provide more variants on which selective pressures could act and thus accelerate evolution during environmentally stressful periods.

AB  - A central assumption of baboon socio-ecological models is that all populations have the same capacity to react to different environments. The burden of our argument is that this assumption needs to be reconsidered. Data suggest not only that hamadryas, but chacma as well, differ in interesting ways from the stock baboon model that has been derived, in the main, from earlier work on anubis and cynocephalus. Although environmental factors are behind these differences, much of their influence is a consequence of their effect on restricted ancestral populations, where selection for appropriate responses to the social challenges set by local conditions now constrains the nature of individual responses to contemporary environments. Available genetic evidence suggests a southern African origin for Papio at a time when climatic conditions were certainly no better than they are now and when temperatures, if nothing else, were probably lower. In light of this, a reconstruction of how climate has structured the sexual conflict between males and female charcma, which itself hinges on infanticide, can help explain not only the East African pattern, but also how the apparently anomalous hamadryas pattern has been derived.

AB  - Females of the Australian scincid lizard Eulamprus tympanum can manipulate the sex of their offspring in response to gender imbalances in the population using temperature-dependent sex determination. Here we show that when adult males are scarce females produced male-biased litters and when adult males were common females produced female-biased litters. The cues used by a female to assess the adult population are not known but presumably depend upon her experience throughout the breeding season. Maternal manipulation of the sex ratio of the offspring in E. tympanum illustrates a selective advantage of temperature-dependent sex determination in a viviparous species.

AB  - The role of hypothalamic neurotransmitter systems in behavioral thermoregulation was investigated. in the prespawning female tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus. Intrahypothalamic microinjection with serotonin (5-HT, 3 mul of 1.0 x 10(-6) M) resulted in a significant increase in the selected temperature. This effect was mimicked by the agonist of 5-HT1A, 1B, and 2C receptors, N-3-trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine. Intrahypothalamic microinjection of tilapia with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) resulted in a biphasic effect of the temperature selection, whereas microinjection with muscimol, an agonist of GABA(A) receptor, had no effect on temperature selection. Both agonist and antagonist of glutamate (Glu), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and MK-801 (1.0 x 10(-6) M), a noncompetitive blocker of NMDA receptor, significantly decreased the preferred temperature. These results indicate that the hypothalamic 5-HT, GABA, and Glu systems play a role in the temperature selection of prespawning female tilapia. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Laying hens have physiological responses that affect their productive performance when given different ambient temperatures. The objectives of this study were, first, to quantitatively describe the relationship between different constant environmental temperatures and egg production characteristics of laying hens by a statistical analysis and assessment of the published literature. Second, to compare the effect of different cycling environmental temperatures on the egg production characteristics of laying hens. Twenty-nine experiments were selected that had compared different constant temperatures and that included 21degreesC within their range. Differences in egg production were expressed as a proportion of the treatment group given 21degreesC within that experiment. An exponential curve with the addition of a linear trend gave the best (P<0.001) description of egg numbers, weight and mass, feed intakes and egg composition variables. There was a linear decrease (P<0.001) in measures of shell strength with increasing temperature. A second statistical analysis compared eight published experiments that had described the egg laying responses of laying hens kept in daily fluctuating temperatures and had been compared to a treatment group kept at 21degreesC within the same experiment. The results indicated that the egg laying responses of the hens were best predicted by computing the mean of the predicted responses to each of the temperatures that occurred during the day. However, information on the low temperature, the proportion of the day at the low temperature and the amplitude of the temperature cycle were required to give a precise prediction of the egg laying responses.

AB  - Bioremediation of weathered diesel fuel in Arctic soil at low temperature was studied both on-site in small-scale biopiles and in laboratory microcosms. The field study site was on Ellesmere Island (82degrees30'N, 62degrees20'W). Biostimulation was by fertilization with phosphorous and nitrogen. Bioaugmentation was with an enrichment culture originating from the field site. In biopiles, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were reduced from 2.9 to 0.5 mg/g of dry soil over a period of 65 days. In microcosms at 7 C, TPH were reduced from 2.4 to 0.5 mg/g of dry soil over a period of 90 days. Inoculation had no effect on hydrocarbon removal in biopiles or in microcosms. Maximum TPH removal rates in the biopiles were approximately 90 mug of TPH g(-1) of soil day(-1), occurring during the first 14 days when ambient temperature ranged from 0 to 10degreesC. The fate of three phylotypes present in the inoculum was monitored using most-probable-number PCR, targeting 16S rRNA genes. Populations of all three phylotypes increased more than 100-fold during incubation of both uninoculated and inoculated biopiles. The inoculum increased the initial populations of the phylotypes but did not significantly affect their final populations. Thus, biostimulation on site enriched populations that were also selected in laboratory enrichment cultures.

AB  - Invasive species have been characterized as tolerant of environmental extremes. This hypothesis was evaluated for invasive aquatic species in North America, particularly Asian clams, Corbicula fluminea, and zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha. Both species have rapid growth, early maturity, short life spans, and elevated fecundity, allowing rapid population recovery after reductions by rarefractive, environmental extremes. Extensive resistance capacities offer little adaptive value to invasive, r-selected species, because population reductions occur in their unstable habitats regardless of degree of stress tolerance. Thus, both species have relatively poor physiologic resistance, depending instead on elevated growth and fecundity for rapid population recovery. In contrast, native North American bivalve species are often adapted to stable habitats where perturbation is infrequent (i.e., freshwater unionoidean bivalves). They are characterized by slow growth, extended life spans, and low effective fecundities, slowing population recoveries (K-selected), and have evolved extensive resistance adaptations to avoid extirpation during environmental extremes. Review of resistance adaptations in other North American aquatic invaders revealed poorer or equivalent physiological tolerance relative to taxonomically related native species, suggesting that extensive physiological tolerance is not required for invasive success.

AB  - We investigate the effects of molecular opacities on the evolution of TP-AGB stars that experience the third dredge-up, i.e. with surface abundances of carbon and oxygen varying with time. To this aim, a routine is constructed to derive the molecular concentrations through dissociation equilibrium calculations, and estimate the opacities due to H-2, H2O, OH, C-2, CN, and CO for any given density, temperature and chemical composition of the gas. Then, synthetic TP-AGB models with dredge-up are calculated by either adopting the newly developed routine, or interpolating between fixed opacity tables for solar chemical composition. The comparison between the two cases shows that the change in the dominant opacity sources, as the C/O ratio grows from below to above unity, crucially affects the evolution of the effective temperature, i.e. causing a notable cooling of the carbon-rich models (with C/O>1). From the comparison with observational data, it turns out that TP-AGB models with variable molecular opacities are able to reproduce the observed range of effective temperatures, mass-loss rates, and wind expansion velocities of C-type giants in the solar neighbourhood, otherwise failed if assuming fixed molecular opacities for solar-scaled mixtures. Finally, we mention other possibly important evolutionary and observational effects that result from the adoption of the variable opacities, such as: i) significant shortening of the C-star phase due to the earlier onset of the super-wind; ii) consequent reduction of the carbon yields; iii) reproduction of the observed range of near-infrared colours of C-stars.

AB  - The theory of convergence predicts that, given similar selective regimes, both present and past, unrelated ecological communities will show similar attributes. Mild Pleistocene climate, highly infertile soils, and similar fire regimes explain the remarkable convergence between mediterranean-type vegetation from South Africa (fynbos) and Australia (kwongan). Heathlands in the Aljibe Mountains, at the western end of the Mediterranean basin, constitute a single vegetation type within the Mediterranean region.
   We studied the association between endemism and plant life form in a flora from environmentally similar areas of the South African Cape region (fynbos) and the Aljibe Mountains by contingency table analysis. We included two non-acid, neighbouring areas to the latter region in the analysis as contrasts. We also compared the patterns of variation in three components of biodiversity (species richness, endemism level and taxonomic singularity) of fynbos and Aljibe heathland woody plant communities along similar soil fertility gradients by means of two-way ANOVAs.
   At the regional (flora) level, our results show two common features in the biological aspects of endemism between the two regions: (1) edaphic endemism and (2) association of endemism with the shrub growth form. At the community level, we detected strong similarities in the patterns of variation of endemism and taxonomic singularity of woody communities from both regions along an ecological gradient related to soil fertility. We interpret these similarities, both at the regional and community levels, as suggestive of convergence between fynbos and Aljibe heathland.

AB  - Optical absorption and photoluminescence spectra performed on Ho3+ (4f(10)) and Er3+ (4f(11)) doped KGd(WO4)(2) single crystals were measured at selected temperatures between 5 and 80 K. In this monoclinic matrix. space group C2/c (No. 15) the lanthanide ions replacing Gd3+ occupy a single crystallographic site with symmetry C-2. The interpretation of these spectra and the simulation of the splitting of L-2S+1(J) levels were carried out in the frame of the phenomenological single-electron crystal field theory, through the simultaneous diagonalization of the energy matrices of the free-ion (fi) and crystal field (cf) interactions. A total of 20 fi and 14 cf adjustable parameters were considered for the reproduction of experimental energy levels and their associated wavefunctions. The simulated energy level series are in excellent accordance with the experimental data. i.e. rms deviations, sigma =14.5 and 15.6 cm(-1) for Ho3+ and Er3+, respectively. The comparison with similar results for Pr3+. (4f(2)) and Nd3+ (4f(3)) allowed establishment of the variation trends of the cf parameters with the number of 4f electrons.

KW  - PISCES
AB  - The blind cave-dwelling fish Phreatichthys andruzzii shows rapid eye development, and at a temperature of 29.5 degreesC, maximal eye differentiation is reached 36 h after egg laying. Very rapid eye degeneration then occurs, and a rudimentary and very degenerated ocular cyst is all that remains 1 month later. This may explain why this species has so often been erroneously considered anophthalmic. Ocular degeneration starts with a decrease in the rate of mitosis in the neuroblastic cells of the retinal Anlage. Degeneration by means of lytic processes is clearly observed beginning 32 h after egg laying. Disappearance of the lens, transformation of the cornea into skin, and cryptic degeneration of the eyes are phenotypic variations of the fundamental mechanisms of eye development in vertebrates. These can be considered evolutionary adaptations by the ancestral fishes to the aphotic cave environment.

AB  - The elastic property evolution with increasing temperature of dehydrated polyacrylamide (PAAm) gel has been measured with a vibrometer at several frequencies, The elastic stiffness (Young's modulus) showed marked changes (significant decrease in the real part and a clear peak in the imaginary part) around a characteristic temperature, which shifted toward the higher region with increasing applied frequency, similar to the features observed during the glass transition of noncrystalline polymers. The activation energy of the elastic stiffness relaxation was also calculated with the peak temperature of the imaginary part and the applied frequency. The activation energy value of the dehydrated PAAm gel was in the range usually observed for noncrystalline polymers, based on which dehydrated PAAm gel has been confirmed to have the properties usual for noncrystalline polymer glass from an elastic point of view.

T2  - ANNALES HISTORIQUES DE LA REVOLUTION FRANCAISE
LA  - French
AB  - For Cuvier, between "mathematical sciences" and "moral sciences" lies a space "as vast as it is fertile, that of "natural sciences." These include chemistry, the study of heat, light and electricity, and also natural history. The broad sweep of the latter covers metereology, hydrology, mineralogy, geology, anatomy, physiology and likewise botany and zoology. In this wide field, Cuvier often emphasises the importance of the cristallographie work of Hauy and highlights two major revolutions. The first, in experimental science, is the new chemistry attached to the name of Lavoisier. The other, in the empirical sciences, is the natural method of classification systematized by Jussieu in botany and which Cuvier himself, among others, champions in zoology. Technical and medical innovations are not forgotten, but they are considered applications of scientific progress. In his eulogies of scientists and didactic explanations of discoveries, Cuvier makes a point of recognizing contributions from abroad. He manages, however, to reconcile his chauvinistic concerns with universalism by pointing out that imperial France is renowned for her impartiality.

AB  - Normal and irregular blunt clam-shells were found. Blunt shells increased with depth, because of increasing anoxia. Minimal weight-indices and reproductive stages were found at 40 m depth (near thermo-haline stratification) probably due to spawning just before sampling. Clams from shallower stations were more ripe and heavier due to higher temperatures and re-development than at deeper stations since temperatures were still below threshold levels for spawning (10 degreesC). Respiration was at ambient temperatures acclimated to standard rates. Consequently, clams from deeper stations (with lower ambient temperatures) had 2 times higher respiration at the same test-temperature. Clams from the most shallow station (Puck Lagoon 5 m) showed the worst performance due to adverse hydrodynamics (stagnated water, anoxia). Heterozygotes showed better performance than homozygotes (heterosis). In 1995 genetic differentiation was found (Idh was diagnostic): clams below 30 m resembled Atlantic populations; shallow stations formed a distinct group (Baltic race). In later years all populations were Atlantic, probably due to inflow of North Sea water. Before 1996 ecophysiological differences between clams in the Gdansk Bay can possibly be related to genetic differentiation (adaptations of Atlantic vs. Baltic types), in later years differences were due to acclimation to ambient temperatures, salinity and oxygen levels.

AB  - A study of single-phase convection and flow condensation heat transfer in horizontal copper tubes (8.81 mm inside diameter) was conducted using three refrigerants (HCFC-22, HFC-134a and HFC-410A). A smooth tube and three micro-fin tubes (axial, helical and crosshatch enhancement) were examined. Local-mean flow condensation data were experimentally obtained. Experimental conditions were selected to reflect typical operating conditions encountered in refrigeration and air-conditioning applications. All micro-fin tubes illustrated significant enhancement in single-phase convection and how condensation. The cross-hatch enhancement performed particularly better in both single-phase convection and flow condensation. For the three refrigerants investigated, the refrigerant type seemed to have little influence on the enhancement mechanism of the micro-fin tubes examined. The experimental results are presented in Part I. Development of design equations is presented in Part II.

AB  - Very sensitive measurements of N-2 and N2O flux from soil are possible when gas evolved from N-15-labeled soil is analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry, This approach is useful for studying the fate of nitrogen fertilizer and for studying soil microbial processes contributing to the atmospheric increase of nitrous oxide, a radiatively active trace gas that can contribute to global warming and ozone depletion. Most systems of equations that relate isotopic analysis to gas nut are sufficiently complex that certain limitations and potentials of the N-15 approach may be overlooked. We describe a graphical representation of labeled N-gas flux that illustrates the equations and encourages critical thinking regarding the implementation of related experiments, This model is used to interpret underestimation that occurs if flux derives from multiple pools of differing enrichment. A statistical derivation is presented for a previously published simulation of underestimation due to multiple pools. The same equations are applied to field data to explore whether temporal variation in soil nitrate enrichment is likely to cause significant underestimation. Two sampling strategies are proposed that may eliminate the assumption of pool uniformity, thereby eliminating a potential source of underestimation.

AB  - Respiration rates of various geographical strains of Crassostrea gigas were compared to assess the respiratory expenditure as a physiological indicator of catabolism (cost of maintenance). Parental oysters, sampled in France (Marennes-Oleron), Japan (Hiroshima), Taiwan (Tunkang) and Spain (Cadix), were differentiated by both their geographic origin and by mitochondrial DNA markers, allowing the distinction between the two closely related taxa Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea angulata. After reproduction of these parental oysters, respiration rates of spat of each strain, reared under common controlled conditions, were individually estimated at 20 degrees C by using a volumetric microrespirometer. Our results demonstrated that physiological variability existed among the Crassostrea gigas strains and is likely to be related to physiological differences between geographical regions and/or genetic adaptations. The French strain showed the highest rates (0.71 mu L.h(-1)), while the Japanese, Taiwanese and the hybrid between Spanish and French strains consumed less, 0.53, 0.43 and 0.40 mu L.h(-1) respectively. Our results confirmed the discrepancies previously suggested between Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea angulata. Comprehensive physiological assessments should be carried out over a wide temperature range to confirm our results and to further evaluate growth potential. Appropriate decision making based on these studies will help future shellfish management in shellfish rearing areas such as the overstocked Marennes-Oleron Bay.

AB  - Supercritical extraction (SFE) is a unit operation that exploits the dissolving power of supercritical fluids (SF) under conditions above their critical temperature and pressure. It is possible to obtain solvent-free extracts using SF and the extraction is faster than using conventional organic solvents. These advantages are due to the high volatility of SF (gases under normal environmental conditions) and improved transport properties (i.e., high diffusivity and low viscosity). When using carbon dioxide (CO2) in particular, moderate-temperature processing and high selectivity towards valuable microconstituents in natural products can be achieved. This article presents a review of transport properties and solubilities in SF, particularly CO2, as well as other underlying factors that are responsible for the kinetics and phase equilibrium in SFE processes. It also describes the selective CO2 extraction of essential oils, pungent principles, carotenoid pigments, antioxidants, antimicrobials, and related substances to be used as ingredients for the food, drug and perfume industries, from spices, herbs and other plant materials. These very important applications are discussed from the point of view of the potential applications of SFE in Latin America. The two most: important commercial applications of SFE in the food industry, namely hop extraction and coffee decaffeination, are reviewed to a limited extent. Some other potential applications briefly described include extraction and fractionation of edible fats and oils, purification of solid matrices, and concentration of fermentation broths, fruit juices and other extracts. In most cases CO2 extracts are compared with counterparts obtained using conventional methods.

AB  - Production of diffraction-quality protein crystals mandates nucleation of a moderate number of crystals. Excessive nucleation can lead to many small crystals of poor morphology, making them useless for structural determination via X-ray crystallography. In this work, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and light scattering are utilized to delineate the liquid-liquid binodal in lysozyme solutions at concentrations typically used for crystal growth (10-50 mg/ml). Such cloud point temperatures are determined over a range of protein concentrations and compared to visually observed nucleation temperatures. In all cases, nucleation occurs at temperatures above the cloud point temperature. Thus, measurement of the cloud point temperature gives the crystal grower a bound on the protein crystal growth problem. Nucleation is reproducibly induced within 2 degrees C of the cloud point temperature; while prior work indicates that growth, when carried out near the saturation temperature, yields high quality crystals. The ease of measuring the cloud point via turbidity measurements allows for the rational selection of an initial temperature to induce protein nucleation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - A novel approach, at least for laboratory conditions,:for analysis of the dependence of soil C evolution on temperature is presented. A two-component (labile and refractory organic C) parallel first-order model was fitted to CO2 evolution rates from top- and subsoil, incubated at different combinations of temperature (constant -4, 0.3, 5, 15, 25, weekly fluctuating between -4 and +5 degrees C) and moisture (17, 26, 36 and 50% H2O for the topsoil and 16, 23, 31 and 41% for the subsoil) and to the evolution of CO2 after the addition of roots or stubble of Phalaris arundinacea in the topsoil, measured at 25 degrees C and 36% H2O (Lomander et al., 1998). The size of the pools and their respective first-order rate constants were optimized simultaneously by a least-squares method. The optimization was carried out separately for top- and subsoil. Quadratic functions were fitted to the temperature and moisture responses. For topsoil samples in which roots or stubble were added, a three-component model (labile, refractory and stubble or roots) was used. The initial partitioning of the soil C, the decomposition rate constants for each partition and the temperature and moisture responses were all assumed to be identical to those of pure topsoil, while the initial pool sizes of added roots and straw were measured. The calculated temperature at which CO2 evolution ceased (T-min) was -0.83 degrees C, and a recalculation to Q(10)-values resulted in increasing temperature response with decreasing temperature (Q(10)=22 at 25 degrees C and 12.7 at 0.3 degrees C). Simulated CO2 evolution rates agreed well with the measurements (R-adj(2) = 0.96 and 0.81) for top- and subsoil, respectively. The multi-compartment approach was superior to the single-compartment approach, which gave R-adj(2) = 0.88 and 0.76 for top- and subsoil, respectively. In general, CO2 evol ution rates obtained from the laboratory experiment were higher than those measured in the field; even after differences in temperature and moisture were taken into account. After 300 d in the laboratory at 25 degrees C and 36% H2O. 99% and 86% of the added straw and roots, respectively, had disappeared according to the described model. The CO2-evolution rate per unit of soil carbon was about two times higher for topsoil than for subsoil. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous studies on salmonids have yielded equivocal results as to the role of cortisol in directly inhibiting ovarian steroidogenesis. In an effort to determine why this might be so, isolated ovarian follicles of rainbow trout were incubated with and without cortisol under varying conditions of gonadotropin or steroid precursor stimulation, incubation time and temperature. Cortisol at concentrations of 100-1000 ng ml(-1) suppressed basal production of 17 beta-estradiol (E(2)) in only 4 out of 20 experiments, had no effect on human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-stimulated production, and no suppressive effect on 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17P)-stimulated production in 14 experiments, but increased E(2) production in response to 17P in 2 experiments. Cortisone had no effect on basal E(2) production, suggesting that cortisol was unlikely to be exerting any effect indirectly after further metabolism. Extended incubation times at 12 degrees C resulted in overall decreased levels of E(2) in incubation media, but this had no obvious effect on patterns generated by treatment with cortisol. Extended incubation at 18 degrees C did change the pattern of response to treatment with cortisol in 1 out of 3 experiments. All incubations examined produced substantial amounts of E(2)-glucuronide but this showed no obvious relationship to whether or not inhibition of E(2) production by cortisol was observed. Effect of stress history was examined by incubating follicles from stressed or unstressed fish. In follicles from fish nearing the end of vitellogenesis, stress resulted in reduced production of both testosterone and E(2) in response to hCG, but increased conversion of 17P to E(2). The same effect was not observed in follicles from fish at an earlier stage of vitellogenesis. Measurement of E(2) uptake by follicles from selected experiments showed that follicles contained considerable amounts of E(2) and were potentially a sink for steroid produced during incubation. The experiments show that a consistent effect of cortisol on ovarian steroidogenesis remains elusive, but that stimulatory effects are as likely to occur as inhibitory effects. All responses are potentially further confounded by loss of free steroid from the medium by conjugation or absorption into the oocytes.

AB  - Of the major physical factors that influence insect seasonal ecology, moisture is least understood and least appreciated. It is our premise that experimental probing of insets from diverse zones and various habitats would reveal general patterns of insect responses to moisture that are as striking as those for photoperiod and temperature. using the paradigms of photoperiod and temperature as ec ophysiological determinants of insect seasonality, we hypothesize that moisture influences insect life cycles via one or more of three mechanisms - as a token stimulus for diapause, modulator of developmental or reproductive rates, or behavioral cue for vital seasonal events. For heuristic purposes, we offer each of these hypotheses in close association with approaches for testing their validity in insects that undergo dry-season dormancy. The approaches appear appropriate for examining the role of moisture in the life histories of terrestrial invertebrates other than insects, as well ads plants and microbes that have a seasonal resting sate. Elucidating moisture's role in insect seasonal cycles is critical to the development of comprehensive phenological models, improved insect management systems, and identification of novel evolutionary mechanisms for adaptation to wet-dry seasons, especially in tropical, subtropical,and Mediterranean regions.

AB  - The exchange and release properties of the natural phillipsite tuff from the Aritain area in Jordan were evaluated by studying the exchange properties of this natural zeolite in the NH4+-NA(+) system. Exchange isotherms at 18, 35, and 50 degrees C showed that phillipsite exchanged NH4+ preferably over Na+ at all temperatures. However, the selectivity coefficient for NH4+ decreased with decreasing temperature. The release of NH4+ from phillipsite saturated with ammonium sulfate took place in two stages characterized by different SO42-:NH4+ ratios. Aritain phillipsite from NE Jordan could be processed and used as NH4+ slow-release fertilizers. The use of NH4+-phillipsite tuff offers an option to the widely used soluble NH4-fertilizers in agciculture to avoid environmental problems associated with nitrogen contamination of surface water and groundwater.

AB  - New laser-fluorination oxygen isotope data are presented for volcanic glasses and phenocrysts from Lau and North Fiji Basin lavas. The low oxygen blank of the technique allows accurate analysis of these often scarce igneous phases. delta(18)O values of volcanic glass range from 5.53 parts per thousand to 6.06 parts per thousand. Oxygen isotope ratios of ferromagnesian and plagioclase phenocrysts are lower and higher than their host glasses, respectively, and coexisting phases appear to represent oxygen isotope equilibrium at magmatic temperatures. Evolved lavas from the propagating and dying rift tips in the Central Lau Basin display significant O-18-enrichment with magmatic evolution due to FeTi-oxide crystallisation and require that precursor melts had relatively low delta(18)O values immediately prior to oxide saturation. Development of these precursor melts from basaltic parents involved assimilation of hydrothermally altered sheeted dykes ol gabbros in recently accreted oceanic crust accompanied by crystallisation of a plagioclase-rich assemblage. The stable isotope geochemistry and petrology of Central Lau Basin lavas, constrain magmatic evolution to depth between 2.5 and 5 km beneath the seafloor. A dacite from Valu Fa Ridge is slightly O-18-enriched relative to Valu Fa basalts, consistent with crystallisation of a mineral assemblage similar to mid-ocean ridge basalts. O-18/O-16 ratios of Lau Basin basaltic glasses decrease with Mg Number; this observation could be reconciled with the assimilation and fractional crystallisation model proposed for initial differentiation of the evolved lavas. However, oxygen isotope data for Central Lau Basin basalts correlate positively with Ba/La while basaltic glasses from throughout the region display a negative correlation between delta(18)O and Na-8.0 suggesting that recycling of subducted oxygen and/or mantle fertility may also exert an influence on O-18/O-16 of primary melts. Presently, the lack of quantitative control over oxygen isotope fractionation in basaltic systems prohibits resolution of these effects. Detailed investigation of less complex suites of lavas, employing the precision offered by laser fluorination, may provide new insights into the behaviour of oxygen at magmatic temperatures.

AB  - Most sexually reproducing species have sexual proportions around 1:1. This major biological phenomenon remained unexplained until 1930, when FISHER Proposed that it results from a mechanism of natural selection. Here we report the first experimental test of his model that obeys all its assumptions. We used a naturally occurring X-Y meiotic drive system-the sex-ratio trait of Drosophila mediopunctata-to generate female-biased experimental populations. As predicted by FISHER, these populations evolved toward equal sex proportions due to natural selection, by accumulation of autosomal alleles that direct the parental reproductive effort toward the rare sex. Classical Fisherian evolution is a rather slow mechanism: despite a very large amount of genetic variability, the experimental populations evolved from 16% of males to 32% of males in 49 generations and would take 330 generations (29 years) to reach 49%. This slowness has important implications for species potentially endangered by skewed sexual proportions, such as reptiles with temperature sex determination.

AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes are highly effective bioinsecticides. Their efficacy may be reduced due to the various pesticides they encounter in the soil. These include insecticides as well as nematicides used against plant-parasitic nematodes. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of genetic selection as means of enhancing resistance of the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora strain HP88 to the nematicides: Fenamiphos (an organophosphate), Oxamyl (a carbamate) and Avermectin (a biological product). Estimates of heritability (h(2)) of resistance to the three nematicides were obtained from analysis of inbred lines derived from the base population. The heritability estimate for Fenamiphos was h(2) = 0.31, for Oxamyl h(2) = 0.71 and for Avermectin h(2) = 0.46. Five rounds of selection were performed. Thereafter, each line was divided into two: for one subline selection continued for six additional rounds. The other subline was reared without selection for the six additional rounds. After the eleventh round, resistance to the nematicides was examined as were several traits relevant to biocontrol efficacy including virulence, heat tolerance and reproduction potential. Selection resulted in an 8-9-fold increase in resistance to Fenamiphos and Avermectin and a 70-fold increase in resistance to Oxamyl. The enhanced resistance Oxamyl and Avermectin, and to a lesser extent to Fenamiphos, was stable and continued after selection was relaxed. No deterioration in traits relevant to biocontrol efficacy was observed in the selected lines as compared with the base population. The selected lines displayed enhanced cross-resistance towards some, but not all, of the nematicides tested. These results demonstrate that genetic selection can be used to enhance resistance of entomopathogenic nematodes to certain environmental stresses. The selected lines will be useful bioinsecticides in the context of integrated pest management.

AB  - The structure of the liquid cyclopropane and the evolution of the local ordering with temperature has been investigated along the liquid-vapour coexistence curve between the melting point (T-m approximate to 146 K) and room temperature by neutron diffraction and molecular dynamics simulation.
   Experimentally, the intramolecular structure factor is well described using the molecular parameters close to those reported from spectroscopic calculations and is found to be almost temperature independent. In contrast, the intermolecular structure factor shows a strong variation in the translational and orientational ordering by cooling the liquid from room temperature to a temperature close to the melting point.
   Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using an atom-atom Lennard-Jones potential to model the intermolecular interaction between cyclopropane molecules. Excellent reproduction of thermodynamical and dynamical data reported for cyclopropane has allowed an assessment of the validity of the potential parameters used. Moreover, good agreement between the experimental and the simulated pair correlation function has been obtained, allowing the use of the simulated functions to discuss the evolution of the liquid structure with temperature. It is found that g(CC)(r) is the correlation function best able to describe the variation in the orientational order in the first shell of neighbours, from the relative evolution against temperature of the first two peaks observed at about 4.0 and 5.1 Angstrom, respectively. A discussion of this evolution using angular pair correlation function and geometrical models based upon solid-phase data shows that, at low temperatures, the favoured configurations of cyclopropane molecules are those where, on average, their symmetry axes are perpendicular or parallel. When the temperature increases, configurations where the molecular axes are more randomly distributed tend to increase, thus leading to a more orientationally disordered liquid. It is emphasized that this trend is also consistent with the interpretation of light scattering experiments.

AB  - The strain Rhodococcus erythropolis E-15, which grows well on hydrocarbons at law positive temperatures, was selected by screening a collection of hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria. This strain was introduced into tundra soil contaminated with oil (I kg/m(2)). The natural hydrocarbon-oxidizing microflora of non-polluted tundra soils (isolated on liquid media) accounted for 10(4) cells per g and mainly contained rhodococci. All indigenous rhodococci were of the S-type, with low oxidizing: activity toward hydrocarbons. Fertilizing the soil only slightly increased (by 10%) the rate of hydrocarbon biodegradation by indigenous oil-oxidizing microflora. Five weeks after introduction of the active strain, the soil content of hydrocarbons decreased by approximately 40%. The concentration of the introduced bacterium remained 10(7) cells/g even seven weeks after the beginning of the experiment.

AB  - Intramolecular long-range electron transfer (LRET) in hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) accompanying Trp --> TyrO radical transformation was investigated in aqueous solution by pulse radiolysis as a function of pH (5.2-7.4) and temperature (283-328K). The reaction was induced by highly selective oxidation of Trp with N-3(.) radicals under low concentration of the reactants but at a high HEWL/N-3(.) molar ratio, so that more than 99% of the oxidized protein molecules contained only a single tryptophyl radical. Synchronous decay of Trp(.) and build-up of TyrO(.) conformed satisfactorily to first-order kinetics, indicating that LRET involved either one or more Trp(.)/Tyr redox pairs characterized by similar rate constants. The rate constant of LRET, k(5), increased monotonously with decreasing pH showing the following characteristics: (i) in the pH range 7.4-5.2 the plot of k(5) against pH was sigmoidal in shape, reflecting protonation of Glu35 (pK(a) approximate to 6) and pointing to involvement of conformational control of the kinetics of LRET, (ii) below pH5.2 a sharp increase in k(5) was observed due to the protonation of Trp(.) to form TrpH(.+), which is known to oxidize tyrosine faster than does Trp(.). Arrhenius plots of the temperature-dependence of k(5) showed that the activation energy of LRET varies both with temperature and the protonation state of the enzyme. The activation energies are in the range 7.6-56.0 kJ mol(-1) and are similar to those for activation of amide hydrogen exchange in native HEWL below its denaturation temperature. Selective oxidation by ozone of the Trp62 indole side-chain in HEWL to N'-formylkynurenine (NFKyn62-HEWL) caused a large drop in the initial yield of Trp(.) radicals, G(Trp(.))(i). This was accompanied by a relatively small decrease in k(5) but selective oxidation by ozone had a pronounced effect on its temperature-dependence. Taken together these observations indicate that of the six tryptophans present in HEWL Trp62 contributes about 50% to the yield of the observed LRET. In the enzyme-inhibitor complex, HEWL(GlcNAc)(3), where Trp62 and Trp63 are completely shielded from the solvent by the bound triacetylchitotriose, G(Trp(.))(i) was lower than in NFKyn62-HEWL, and both the kinetic and energetic characteristics of LRET, observed at pH5.2, were again somewhat different than in HEWL alone. Considering known solvent accessibilities of tryptophans in the complex, the observed LRET process in HEWL(GlcNAc)(3) was assigned to Trp123. Theoretical evaluation of the electronic coupling for the dominant LRET pathways between all the potential Trp(.)/Tyr redox couples in HEWL, with help of the PATHWAYS model, enabled Trp62/Tyr53, Trp63/Tyr53 and Trp123/Tyr23 to be identified as the pairs involved in the experimentally observed electron transfer.

AB  - Analyses of changes in frequency of the gene medionigra in colonies of the moth Panaxia dominula, begun by R. A. Fisher, E. B. Ford and P. M. Sheppard, have long been regarded as a model study of natural selection under field conditions. Recently, their conclusions have been criticized, on the grounds that phenotypes have been improperly scored and that population structure has been misunderstood. The results are re-examined here, including recent unpublished collections.
   It is argued that the colonies studied are distinct populations, as usually defined, and that the results could not arise as a result of migration. Fluctuation in population size from year to year, large variance in fecundity and some features of mating behaviour probably reduce the effective number to less than half the estimated population size. Variable expressivity and consequent subjective variation in scoring, casts some doubt on earlier claims that selection fluctuates significantly from generation to generation, and on a reported case of increase in frequency from a very low starting point. However, the one natural and thr ee artificial colonies studied are consistent in providing estimates of selection of 7 per cent or more against medionigra, despite the variation introduced by small population size and scoring difficulties. There appears to be an equilibrium at a low frequency, and the rate of approach to it suggests that the selection is frequency dependent. One artificial colony, at West Kirby on the Wirral, Merseyside, U.K., does not show an equivalent decline. Selection cannot be as strong as indicated elsewhere, but since the population size is small some disadvantage to medionigra cannot be rejected.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - The use of environmentally induced genetic male sterile (EGMS) rice could alter the development of hybrid rice from a three-line system to a two-line system. It is critical for the utilization of EGMS rice to determine which are the main environmental factors influencing fertility changes. Fertility responses to photoperiod (P) and temperature (T) were studied in 101 EGMS rice lines under nine controlled regimes combining three photoperiods (15.0, 14.0 and 12.5 h) x three temperatures (30.1, 24.1 and 23.1 degrees C). According to the variance analysis of seed-setting data, 96 % of the total EGMS lines studied could be divided into three types as follows: (1) photoperiod-sensitive genetic male sterility (PGMS) characterized statistically by significant (P < 0.05) P and P x T interaction effects but by a non-significant T effect on fertility, (2) thermosensitive genetic male sterility (TGMS) by a significant T effect, a non-significant P effect and by either a significant or a non-significant P x T interaction effect on fertility, and (3) photo-thermosensitive genetic male sterility (P-TGMS) by only a significant P x T interaction effect on fertility. Among the japonica EGMS lines studied, PGMS, TGMS and P-TGMS accounted for 32.3, 9.7 and 51.6%, respectively. However, among the indica EGMS lines, no PGMS lines were detected and most of them were TGMS or P-TGMS (61.4 and 35.7 %, respectively). The results indicate that the selection of indica PGMS lines of rice might be very difficult. The availability of different types of EGMS rice in two-line system hybrid rice is evaluated and the selection of an ideal model of response to photoperiod and temperature for indica EGMS is discussed.

AB  - Major carbon and nitrogen fluxes through crop and soil were studied in a series of field experiments. Barley, winter wheat, a grass mixture cut for hay and the energy crop reed canary-grass (Phalaris arundinacea) were studied. The treatments ranged from drought to daily irrigation/fertilization with high doses of water and nitrogen. Crop biomass and nitrogen dynamics above and below ground and incident light as well as soil temperature, moisture and mineral N content were monitored. Litter decomposition experiments were also performed in the field.
   The results were used to parameterize, validate and improve a set of soil/plant simulation models. Selected experimental results and experiences gained from the water, C and N budgeting and modelling work are presented.

AB  - Induction of the larval diapause in Chymomyza costata is controlled by two mechanisms, temperature-dependent induction and a photoperiodic response. Geographical, clinal variation was observed in both mechanisms. Critical photoperiods increased northwards 1 h 9 min per 5 degrees of latitude. The dine relaxes north of 65 degrees N, however. The critical temperature measured under long-day conditions varied little in areas south of 63 degrees N, but increased from 13 degrees C at that latitude to 17 degrees C at 65 degrees N and to 24 degrees C at 68 degrees N. Selection experiments revealed extensive intrapopulation variation in both diapause characteristics. The mean temperature In the middle of the breeding season for C. costata is above the long-day critical temperature in areas south of 63 degrees N, the same or slightly lower than the critical temperature in areas between 63 degrees N and 66 degrees N and well below the critical temperature in areas north of 67 degrees N. The relative importance of temperature and photoperiod in diapause induction changes from south to north, the photoperiod being the main determinant in the south and temperature assuming the main role in the north. The forms and positions of the two dines can be explained when data on the estimated number of generations per year are combined with data on weather and illumination conditions at each locality.

KW  - POLYMORPHISM
AB  - Biodiversity differentiation and the relative importance of forces and causes driving evolution at the molecular and organismal levels require more critical testing. The opposite slopes of Lower Nahal Oren, Mount Carmel, Israel, designated 'Evolution Canyon', display dramatic biotic Contrasts. Higher solar radiation on the south-facing slope (S-slope) makes it spatiotemporally more heterogeneous, warmer, drier and fluctuating than the north-facing slope (N-slope). Consequently, local biodiversity differentiation across several hundred metres displays globally divergent patterns. In different groups of organisms (i.e. across phylogeny) the 'tropical Asian-African' S-slope harbours African and Asian xeric tropical biota. The S-slope is richer on average in terrestrial species, displaying higher genetic diversity than the 'temperate European' N-slope, which is richer in aquatic-dependent taxa. Adaptive differences in different organisms are demonstrated within and between the slopes. Microclimatic aridity diversifying selection seems here a major evolutionary force that drives adaptive molecular and organismal evolution. Present results suggest that 'Evolution Canyon' provides a fertile local testing model of evolutionary predictions.

AB  - Physiological clocks have been selected in various eukaryotic organisms in relation to daily, tidal, lunar and annual cycles of the environment. Insect species are appropriate experimental objects for the analysis of biological timing mechanisms and their evolutionary adaptation to the local environment. The most complex periodic environment occurs in the interface between the land and the sea, i.e., in the range of spring and neap tides. By the combination of 'circadian' and 'circalunar' clocks and their reliably perceptible 'zeitgeber' conditions, a few marine insects can temporally program their development to distinct tidal situations that occur only on distinct lunar days and at a distinct time of day every 14-15 days.

AB  - A flow-injection procedure for spectrophotometric determination of cadmium in fertilizers based on formation of the blue ternary complex between cadmium, iodide and Malachite Green (MG) is proposed. Addition order and concentrations of reagents, interaction time between iodide and MG, flow rates, pH and temperature for ternary complex formation, surfactant addition, and presence of potential interferent ions were studied. A 30-s interaction between iodide and MG, a temperature of 20 degrees C and use of picolinic acid for copper masking were selected. Linearity of the calibration graph was improved with cadmium addition. For selectivity enhancement, masking agents, kinetic discrimination, and ion-exchange separation were investigated and a Chelex-100 resin minicolumn (50-100 mesh) was employed for in-line interferent removal. The proposed system is very stable and handles about 60 samples per hour (10.0-100.0 mu g Cd l(-1)) corresponding to 0.105 mg MG and 166 mg KI consumed per determination Linearity of the calibration plot is observed up to 200 mu g Cd l(-1), the detection limit being 2 mu g Cd l(-1). Results are precise (R.S.D. = 1.3% and 4.0% for 93.0 and 35.3 mu g Cd l(-1)) and in agreement with tungsten coil atomic absorption spectrometry. Accurate results are also obtained for lobster and soya bean samples.

AB  - Developmentally regulated, tissue-specific patterns of nuclear lamin expression occur during vertebrate embryogenesis, but little is known regarding lamin ontogeny during the early development of other phyla. cDNA clones encoding a lamin from the sea urchins Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Lytechinus variegatus have been identified, and the full coding region from the former has been sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that this echinoderm lamin is more closely related to vertebrate B-type lamins than to dipteran fly and nematode lamins-the only other invertebrate lamins sequenced to date. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to sea urchin lamin demonstrate that nuclei of unfertilized eggs and embryos exhibit relatively faint immunoreactivity until the differentiation of primary mesenchymal cells, the nuclear envelopes of which become strongly and selectively labeled by anti-lamin antibodies. Northern blots reveal stage-specific fluctuations in a single 4-kb lamin message during early development and, together with immunoblotting data, suggest that the increase in mesenchymal cell nuclear envelope immunoreactivity is due to a quantitative increase in a single type of lamin. These observations demonstrate that, similar to vertebrates, cell differentiation in invertebrates can be accompanied by a change in lamin expression patterns. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.

AB  - Four classes of cell nuclei containing polytene chromosomes of different diameters were detected in the salivary glands of Drosophila at the stage of 0-hour prepupae.  The diameter of chromosomes was shown to depend on the level of polyteny.  In the selected highly inbred lines LA (low activity) and HA (high activity) and in their F1 hybrids LA x HA and HA x LA, the ratios of nuclei containing chromosomes with different levels of polyteny were analyzed.  It was established that chromosomes of an inadaptive line LA have a decreased level of polyteny.  The hybrids were superior to both parent lines in terms of the trait studied.  Giant chromosomes of line and hybrid females had higher levels of polyteny than male chromosomes.  It is shown that the level of polyteny of giant chromosomes in Drosophila lines and their hybrids is correlated with differences in traits with a high adaptive value, such as rate of development, fertility, heat resistance, competitiveness, etc.

AB  - The main constraint of using Ogura male-sterile cytoplasm in Brassica is the induction of leaf yellowing at low temperature and the low seed set. But whether or not the cytoplasm can disturb the general commercial performance of the plants is not well-known. Therefore, this work was carried out with the purpose of evaluating Ogura cytoplasmic male-sterile cabbage hybrids and compare them to genomic similar mate-fertile ones and to the most popular cabbage hybrid cultivated in Brazil. Harvest data showed an effect of the cytoplasm on reducing plant and head weight, core length and head length and width, although not altering heading index, shape and core indexes, nor head compactness. On the other hand, it was observed also that a careful selection of the parental lineages can produce male-sterile hybrids as good as their male-fertile analogues. All the evaluated hybrids were similar or better than the check for the characteristics under study.

AB  - The dynamic processes controlling N2O evolution in the field are complex; therefore, estimates of long-term evolution from periodic measurements are likely to be unreliable. Greater reliability in such estimations may be possible by reproducing these processes mathematically within a dynamic simulation model. A mathematical hypothesis for denitrification and N2O production was used within a larger ecosystem simulation model to study N2O evolution under laboratory and field conditions. Hourly N2O fluxes estimated by the model were compared with fluxes recorded over an inundated soil core during a 10-day laboratory incubation after a 100-g N Mg-1 amendment with N-15-KNO3. Estimated values were within 20% of those recorded for fluxes, ranging from 0 to 4 mg N m-2 h-1. Recovery of both mineral and labeled N from the amendment after 10 days was estimated within 2 g Mg-1 of recorded values. Hourly N2O fluxes estimated by the model were also compared with fluxes recorded during spring thaws during 2 years at a field site in central Alberta. Fluxes ranging from 0.1 to 10.0 mg N m-2 h-1 were reproduced by the model after different fertilizer treatments. Increased rates of N2O evolution followed periods of saturation in the upper profile caused by snowmelt. These increased rates continued for about 1 week in both years before declining as soil drying progressed. In the model, evolution arose from the volatilization, during drainage, of aqueous N2O generated from biological NO3- reduction that occurred during periods of low aqueoUs O2 concentrations caused by water accumulations in the thawing soil profile. The simulated evolution supports the hypothesis that denitrification accompanies soil thawing after snowmelt at this site.

AB  - Lignosulfonate (LS) has been used as a carrier for micronutrients and has the potential to improve macronutrient fertilizer efficiency, but little is known about the behaviour of LS fertilizer mixtures in soil. A laboratory study was conducted using ammonium lignosulfonate (2.67% wt wt-1) in combination with diammoniumphosphate (DAP), urea (U) and U + DAP incubated in a silty clay loam soil. The experiment monitored CO2 evolution and NH3-N volatilization for 69 d and extractable soil N periodically for 38 d. Addition of LS initially increased CO2 evolution, but only a small proportion (10-22%) of the LS-C was evolved as CO2. Lignosulfonate decreased urea hydrolysis slightly and reduced the proportion of added N volatilized from the LS+U treatment. Lignosulfonate treatments accumulated N in the form of NH4+, suggesting that LS may inhibit nitrification. A larger proportion of added inorganic N was recovered in the LS + fertilizer treatments, indicating that LS may increase fertilizer N availability.

AB  - The magnitude of quantitative genetic variation for primary sex ratio was measured in families extracted from a natural population of the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), which possesses temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Eggs were incubated at three temperatures that produced mixed sex ratios. This experimental design provided estimates of the heritability of sex ratio in multiple environments and a test of the hypothesis that genotype X environment (G X E) interactions may be maintaining genetic variation for sex ratio in this population of C. serpentina. Substantial quantitative genetic variation for primary sex ratio was detected in all experimental treatments. These results in conjunction with the occurrence of TSD in this species provide support for three critical assumptions of Fisher's theory for the microevolution of sex ratio. There were statistically significant effects of family and incubation temperature on sex ratio, but no significant interaction was observed. Estimates of the genetic correlations of sex ratio across environments were highly positive and essentially indistinguishable from + 1. These latter two findings suggest that G X E interaction is not the mechanism maintaining genetic variation for sex ratio in this system. Finally, although substantial heritable variation exists for primary sex ratio of C. serpentina under constant temperatures, estimates of the effective heritability of primary sex ratio in nature are approximately an order of magnitude smaller. Small effective heritability and a long generation time in C. serpentina imply that evolution of sex ratios would be slow even in response to strong selection by, among other potential agents, any rapid and/or substantial shifts in local temperatures, including those produced by changes in the global climate.

AB  - The relationship between annual abundance (individuals/m2) of the crab Chasmagnathus granulata Dana and selected environmental factors (temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen) was investigated in a salt marsh in the Patos Lagoon estuary, southern Brazil. Sampling was performed on a monthly basis over 16 months. Highest abundances, which occurred during periods of moderate increasing temperature and salinity, may be explained by the species' reproductive and recruitment strategies. Burrows seem to attenuate temperature and salinity variations and the hypoxia to which crabs are constrained when burrowed is solved by metabolic depression. Although C. granulata is a good hyper-osmotic regulator, its resistance to low salinities is decreased when subjected to low temperatures, suggesting a temperature-salinity interaction.

AB  - The main objective of the research was to examine the changes in circulating gonadotropin (GTH) in response to a superactive analog of gonadotropin-releasing hormone ([D-Ala6, Pro9-NEt]-GnRH = GnRHa), combined with dopamine antagonists, in order to formulate a procedure for spawning induction in female tilapia.  The fish employed in the experiments were female hybrids (Oreochromis niloticus x O. aureus) 50-250 g.  Tilapia gonadotropin (taGTH) was determined by radioimmunoassay previously developed in our laboratory.  GnRHa was given at 4 graded doses (1-500-mu-g/kg) and blood was sampled before treatment and 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours thereafter.  The doses most effective in elevating GTH level were 10 and 100-mu-g/kg.  The catecholamine release inhibitor, reserpine, and the specific dopamine receptor antagonists, pimozide, domperidone and metoclopramide, were all effective in augmenting the increase in circulating GTH in response to GnRHa.  When compared at an identical molar dose of 12-mu-mol/kg, pimozide showed slightly higher potency 12 or 24 hours after treatment.  Pimozide dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was more effective than in an aqueous suspension (acidified saline containing metabisulfite).  In one temperature experiment, fish were reared at 16-degrees-C and then exposed for 60 hours to various temperatures.  Basal taGTH levels were 10.45 +/- 0.9 ng/ml at 16-degrees-C, 14.47 +/- 2.0 ng/ml at 26-degrees-C and 19.77 +/- 2.6 at 33-degrees-C.  The response to GnRHa was also positively correlated with the temperature.  However, the effect of dopamine antagonists was more apparent at the low temperature.  In a second experiment, in which the lowest temperature was 19-degrees-C, the taGTH level and the response to GnRHa increased two-fold over that of the previous experiment and was positively correlated with the temperature.  The study culminated in two spawning experiments.  The reproductive stage of the females selected for these experiments was synchronized by removing the spawn from their mouths.  In the first experiment the fish were injected with saline or with the combination of GnRHa (100-mu-g/kg) and metoclopramide dissolved in saline (100-mu-g/kg) and kept at 26-degrees-C.  None of the saline-injected controls ovulated while 9/13 of the treated fish spawned within 48 hours.  In the second experiment, carried out at 29-degrees-C, the fish were injected with a lower dose of GnRHa (10-mu-g/kg) in combination with domperidone dissolved in DMSO (5 mg/kg).  In this experiment none of the control fish but 9/11 of the treated fish ovulated within 12 hours.  These protocols can be applied in interspecific crosses of tilapia species.

AB  - The use of CuZnAl industrial shape memory alloys requires to approach the questions of their stability and their transformation temperatures in the long run.
   We have investigated the influences that have education and time periodes between the several processing phases for several annealing times at 100-degrees-C.
   These three parameters have an effect not only on the alloy transformation temperatures but also on the evolution kinetic of these temperatures in the long run.
   This fact requires an exact characterization of the alloy state in order to master the industrial reproduction of such processings.

AB  - After seven pediatric cases of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) were diagnosed in a farming community in upstate New York, a questionnaire regarding symptoms and potential risk factors of CFS was distributed to all students enrolled in the same school district.  Twenty-one students with symptoms of CFS were identified.  Two controls per case matched for age and sex were randomly selected from questionnaire respondents.  Health status was verified for all subjects by telephone, and diagnosis of CFS was confirmed by a physician.  Information was collected on the following factors:  symptoms of CFS among other family members; history of allergy/asthma; consumption of raw milk, raw eggs, raw cheese, or raw meat; water supply; exposure to animals; home heating source; proximity to farmland/orchards; tick bite; blood transfusion; camping, and appendicitis.  Logistic-regression analyses indicated that the best model (characterized by symptoms among other family members, recent ingestion of raw milk, and history of allergy/asthma) produced significant estimates of relative risk (P < .05) of 35.9, 44.3, and 23.3, respectively, for the three factors (corrections were made for the effect of the other covariates).  These data suggest that a combination of host and environmental factors, including an infectious agent or agents, are involved in the etiology of CFS.
