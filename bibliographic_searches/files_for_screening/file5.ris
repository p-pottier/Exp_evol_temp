TI  - Is competition an interaction as relevant as predation for tropical planktonic cladocerans?
VL  - 30
AB  - Aim: To test the relevance of competition and predation for the two most abundant and frequent cladoceran populations, the medium-sized Ceriodaphnia richardi Sars, 1901 and the large-sized Daphnia gessneri Herbst, 1967, in a tropical shallow lake. Methods: Laboratory experiments and weekly samplings in the lake for a year were performed to evaluate: density fluctuations and reproduction; predation on juveniles and adults by larvae of Chaoborus brasiliensis Theobald, 1901; competitive interactions and possible implications of competition and predation on the fluctuations of populations in the lake. Juveniles and adults of both cladocerans were offered to larvae instar IV of chaoborid, for testing selective predation in laboratory experiment. Competitive interaction between the two cladocerans was tested in experiments, with high (0.70 mg C.L-1) and low (0.25 mg C.L-1) concentrations of the edible chlorophycean Desmodesmus spinosus Chodat. Results: C. richardi and D. gessneri were more abundant in the cool season, when their densities were inversely correlated, and when invertebrate predators, C. brasiliensis and the water mite Krendowskia sp., were less abundant. Despite higher concentrations of food and larger number of offsprings produced by the cladocerans in the warm season in the lake, their densities were lower, coincident with the increase of invertebrate predators, mainly chaoborid larvae. C. brasiliensis preyed on adult C. richardi and on young D. gessneri. In the competition experiments, the densities and the population growth rates of C. richardi were higher than those of D. gessneri. The competition results support the “small body size” and the “rmax" hypotheses. The exclusion of D. gessneri by C. richardi occurred only in experimental conditions, while they coexist in the lake, but without reaching their carrying capacity. Conclusions: Predation is the key factor influencing the populations of cladocerans, whereas competition seems to play a secondary role, probably restricted to some periods of lower food concentration in the cool season. © 2018, Sociedade Brasileira de Limnologia.

TI  - Evolution of plasticity in the city: Urban acorn ants can better tolerate more rapid increases in environmental temperature
VL  - 6
IS  - 1
AB  - Because cities contain high levels of impervious surfaces and diminished buffering effects of vegetation cover, urbanized environments can warm faster over the day and exhibit more rapid warming over space due to greater thermal heterogeneity in these environments. Whether organismal physiologies can adapt to these more rapid spatio-temporal changes in temperature rise within cities is unknown, and exploring these responses can inform not only how plastic and evolutionary mechanisms shape organismal physiologies, but also the potential for organisms to cope with urban development. Here, we examined how plasticity in thermal tolerance under faster and slower rates of temperature change might evolve in response to the more rapid spatio-temporal temperature rise in cities. We focused on acorn ants, a temperature-sensitive, ground-dwelling ant species that makes its home inside hollowed out acorns. We reared acorn ant colonies from urban and rural populations under a common garden design in the laboratory and assessed the thermal tolerances of F1 offspring workers using both fast (1°C min-1) and slow (0.2°C min-1) rates of temperature change. Relative to the rural population, the urban population exhibited higher heat tolerance when the temperature was increased quickly, providing evidence that temperature ramp-rate plasticity evolved in the urban population. This result was correlated with both faster rates of diurnal warming in urban acorn ant nest sites and greater spatial heterogeneity in environmental temperature across urban foraging areas. By contrast, rates of diurnal cooling in acorn ant nest sites were similar across urban and rural habitats, and correspondingly, we found that urban and rural populations responded similarly to variation in the rate of temperature decrease when we assessed cold tolerance. Our study highlights the importance of considering not only evolutionary differentiation in trait means across urbanization gradients, but also how trait plasticity might or might not evolve. © The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - Unconventional Transverse Transport above and below the Magnetic Transition Temperature in Weyl Semimetal EuCd2As2
VL  - 126
IS  - 7
AB  - As exemplified by the growing interest in the quantum anomalous Hall effect, the research on topology as an organizing principle of quantum matter is greatly enriched from the interplay with magnetism. In this vein, we present a combined electrical and thermoelectrical transport study on the magnetic Weyl semimetal EuCd2As2. Unconventional contribution to the anomalous Hall and anomalous Nernst effects were observed both above and below the magnetic transition temperature of EuCd2As2, indicating the existence of significant Berry curvature. EuCd2As2 represents a rare case in which this unconventional transverse transport emerges both above and below the magnetic transition temperature in the same material. The transport properties evolve with temperature and field in the antiferromagnetic phase in a different manner than in the paramagnetic phase, suggesting different mechanisms to their origin. Our results indicate EuCd2As2 is a fertile playground for investigating the interplay between magnetism and topology, and potentially a plethora of topologically nontrivial phases rooted in this interplay. © 2021 American Physical Society.

TI  - Seasonal shifts in the thermal biology of the lizard Liolaemus tandiliensis (Squamata, Liolaemidae)
VL  - 73
SP  - 61-70
AB  - Small lizards can accommodate to constraints imposed by temporal changes in ambient temperature through a combination of adaptive evolution and behavioral and physiological plasticity. Thermal physiology plasticity may compensate for climate variation and favor performance while minimizing behavioral costs in sub-optimal conditions. The Tandilia's lizard, Liolaemus tandiliensis, occurs in an isolated mountain range of the Argentinean temperate Pampas. In this study, we compared the thermal biology of L. tandiliensis between late spring (December) and mid-summer (February). The habitats' thermal quality was lower in late spring than in mid-summer. The lizard's field-body temperature (Tb) was 2-3 degrees C higher than the operative temperature (Te). Overall, the mean preferred temperature (Tsel) was 37.4 degrees C [preferred range (Tset): 36.2-38.7 degrees C], and was similar to other Liolaemus species. The Tset and Tsel of females in late spring were 1.8 degrees C lower than in mid-summer. In the case of males, the Tsel did not vary among seasons, while the Tset had a difference of 2.5 degrees C between seasons. Adults were moderate thermoregulators, but females were more efficient only in late spring (E-males = 0.69; E-females = 0.58), compared to mid-summer (E-males = 0.68; E-females = 0.50). Juveniles did not show temporal differences in temperature preferences and had a relatively higher efficiency in late spring (E = 0.38) compared to mid-summer (E = 0.28). An increased proportion of juveniles and adults shifted their Tb near to the Tset in late spring respect to mid-summer. The adults also matched their preferred temperatures to their current body temperature. These results suggest that seasonal shifts in the thermoregulatory parameters of L. tandiliensis may improve their thermoregulatory efficiency. Although temporal variation in ambient temperatures might influence the thermal biology of the studied lizards, other factors such as changes in the reproductive status may have also interfered.

TI  - Survival model database of human digestive system cells exposed to electroporation pulses: An in vitro and in silico study
VL  - 10
AB  - Background and objectives: This study aimed to establish a mathematical survival model database containing cell-specific coefficients from human digestive system cells exposed to electroporation pulses (EPs). Materials and methods: A total of 20 types of human digestive system cell lines were selected to investigate the effect of EPs on cell viability. Cell viability was measured after exposure to various pulse settings, and a cell survival model was established using the Peleg–Fermi model. Next, the cell-specific coefficients of each cell line were determined. Results: Cell viability tended to decrease when exposed to stronger electric field strength (EFS), longer pulse duration, and more pulse number, but the decreasing tendency varied among different cell lines. When exposed to a lower EFS (<1,000 V/cm), only a slight decrease in cell viability occurred. All cell lines showed a similar tendency: the extent of electrical injury (EI) increased with the increase in pulse number and duration. However, there existed differences in heat sensitivity among organs. Conclusions: This database can be used for the application of electroporation-based treatment (EBT) in the digestive system to predict cell survival and tissue injury distribution during the treatment.

TI  - Temperature drift modeling and compensation of capacitive accelerometer based on AGA-BP neural network
VL  - 164
AB  - The accuracy is one of the key indicators for capacitive accelerometers. However, it will be affected by temperature drift especially the rapid temperature variation. To compensate the temperature drift, a back propagation (BP) neural network model based on an adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) has been proposed. According to the ratio of average fitness to maximum fitness, a nonlinear equation constructed is to obtain adaptive probabilities of crossover and mutation. Moreover, the algorithm flow of crossover and mutation is also adaptive by this ratio. Hence, the compensation model will avoid local optimal values effectively. Five experiments with different input accelerations have been conducted in a temperature variation rate of 1 degrees C/min to test the model. The results validate that, the AGA-BP compensation model has the best effect, compared to the multiple linear regression (MLR) compensation model and GA-BP compensation model. This model is of high reference values for compensating rapid temperature variation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Genome-Wide Identification and Evaluation of New Reference Genes for Gene Expression Analysis Under Temperature and Salinity Stresses in Ciona savignyi
VL  - 10
AB  - Rapid adaptation/accommodation to changing environments largely contributes to maximal survival of invaders during biological invasions, usually leading to success in crossing multiple barriers and finally in varied environments in recipient habitats. Gene expression is one of the most important and rapid ways during responses to environmental stresses. Selection of proper reference genes is the crucial prerequisite for gene expression analysis using the common approach, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Here we identified eight candidate novel reference genes from the RNA-Seq data in an invasive model ascidian Ciona savignyi under temperature and salinity stresses. Subsequently, the expression stability of these eight novel reference genes, as well as other six traditionally used reference genes, was evaluated using RT-qPCR and comprehensive tool RefFinder. Under the temperature stress, two traditional reference genes, ribosomal proteins S15 and L17 (RPS15, RPL17), and one novel gene Ras homolog A (RhoA), were recommended as the top three stable genes, which can be used to normalize target genes with a high and moderate expression level, respectively. Under the salinity stress, transmembrane 9 superfamily member (TMN), MOB kinase activator 1A-like gene (MOB) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBQ2) were suggested as the top three stable genes. On the other hand, several commonly used reference genes such as á-tubulin (TubA), â-tubulin (TubB) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) showed unstable expressions, thus these genes should not be used as internal controls for gene expression analysis. We also tested the expression level of an important stress response gene, large proline-rich protein bag6-like gene (BAG) using different reference genes. As expected, we observed different results and conclusions when using different normalization methods, thus suggesting the importance of selection of proper reference genes and associated normalization methods. Our results provide a valuable reference gene resource for the normalization of gene expression in the study of environmental adaptation/accommodation during biological invasions using C. savignyi as a model. © 2019 Huang, Li and Zhan.

TI  - Within-population variation in body size plasticity in response to combined nutritional and thermal stress is partially independent from variation in development time
AB  - Ongoing climate change has forced animals to face changing thermal and nutritional environments. Animals can adjust to such combinations of stressors via plasticity. Body size is a key trait influencing organismal fitness, and plasticity in this trait in response to nutritional and thermal conditions varies among genetically diverse, locally adapted populations. The standing genetic variation within a population can also influence the extent of body size plasticity. We generated near-isogenic lines from a newly collected population of Drosophila melanogaster at the mid-point of east coast Australia and assayed body size for all lines in combinations of thermal and nutritional stress. We found that isogenic lines showed distinct underlying patterns of body size plasticity in response to temperature and nutrition that were often different from the overall population response. We then tested whether plasticity in development time could explain, and therefore regulate, variation in body size to these combinations of environmental conditions. We selected five genotypes that showed the greatest variation in response to combined thermal and nutritional stress and assessed the correlation between response of developmental time and body size. While we found significant genetic variation in development time plasticity, it was a poor predictor of body size among genotypes. Our results therefore suggest that multiple developmental pathways could generate genetic variation in body size plasticity. Our study emphasizes the need to better understand genetic variation in plasticity within a population, which will help determine the potential for populations to adapt to ongoing environmental change. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Studying phenotypic variation and DNA methylation across development, ecology and evolution in the clonal marbled crayfish: a paradigm for investigating epigenotype-phenotype relationships in macro-invertebrates
VL  - 109
IS  - 1
AB  - Animals can produce different phenotypes from the same genome during development, environmental adaptation and evolution, which is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation. The obligatory parthenogenetic marbled crayfish, Procambarus virginalis, whose genome and methylome are fully established, proved very suitable to study this issue in detail. Comparison between developmental stages and DNA methylation revealed low expression of Dnmt methylation and Tet demethylation enzymes from the spawned oocyte to the 256 cell embryo and considerably increased expression thereafter. The global 5-methylcytosine level was 2.78% at mid-embryonic development and decreased slightly to 2.41% in 2-year-old adults. Genetically identical clutch-mates raised in the same uniform laboratory setting showed broad variation in morphological, behavioural and life history traits and differences in DNA methylation. The invasion of diverse habitats in tropical to cold-temperate biomes in the last 20 years by the marbled crayfish was associated with the expression of significantly different phenotypic traits and DNA methylation patterns, despite extremely low genetic variation on the whole genome scale, suggesting the establishment of epigenetic ecotypes. The evolution of marbled crayfish from its parent species Procambarus fallax by autotriploidy a few decades ago was accompanied by a significant increase in body size, fertility and life span, a 20% reduction of global DNA methylation and alteration of methylation in hundreds of genes, suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms were involved in speciation and fitness enhancement. The combined analysis of phenotypic traits and DNA methylation across multiple biological contexts in the laboratory and field in marbled crayfish may serve as a blueprint for uncovering the role of epigenetic mechanisms in shaping of phenotypes in macro-invertebrates. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 111

AB  - The Salar de Huasco is an evaporitic basin located in the Chilean Altiplano, which presents extreme environmental conditions for life, i.e. high altitude (3800 m.a.s.l.), negative water balance, a wide salinity range, high daily temperature changes and the occurrence of the highest registered solar radiation on the planet (&gt; 1200 W m−2). This ecosystem is considered as a natural laboratory to understand different adaptations of microorganisms to extreme conditions. Rhodobacter, an anoxygenic aerobic phototrophic bacterial genus, represents one of the most abundant groups reported based on taxonomic diversity surveys in this ecosystem. The bacterial mat isolate Rhodobacter sp. strain Rb3 was used to study adaptation mechanisms to stress-inducing factors potentially explaining its success in a polyextreme ecosystem. We found that the Rhodobacter sp. Rb3 genome was characterized by a high abundance of genes involved in stress tolerance and adaptation strategies, among which DNA repair and oxidative stress were the most conspicuous. Moreover, many other molecular mechanisms associated with oxidative stress, photooxidation and antioxidants; DNA repair and protection; motility, chemotaxis and biofilm synthesis; osmotic stress, metal, metalloid and toxic anions resistance; antimicrobial resistance and multidrug pumps; sporulation; cold shock and heat shock stress; mobile genetic elements and toxin–antitoxin system were detected and identified as potential survival mechanism features in Rhodobacter sp. Rb3. In total, these results reveal a wide set of strategies used by the isolate to adapt and thrive under environmental stress conditions as a model of polyextreme environmental resistome. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Plant group ii lea proteins: Intrinsically disordered structure for multiple functions in response to environmental stresses
VL  - 11
IS  - 11
AB  - In response to various environmental stresses, plants have evolved a wide range of defense mechanisms, resulting in the overexpression of a series of stress-responsive genes. Among them, there is certain set of genes that encode for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that repair and protect the plants from damage caused by environmental stresses. Group II LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) proteins compose the most abundant and characterized group of IDPs; they accumulate in the late stages of seed development and are expressed in response to dehydration, salinity, low temperature, or abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. The physiological and biochemical characterization of group II LEA proteins has been carried out in a number of investigations because of their vital roles in protecting the integrity of biomolecules by preventing the crystallization of cellular components prior to multiple stresses. This review describes the distribution, structural architecture, and genomic diversification of group II LEA proteins, with some recent investigations on their regulation and molecular expression under various abiotic stresses. Novel aspects of group II LEA proteins in Phoenix dactylifera and in orthodox seeds are also presented. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) indicated a ubiquitous distribution and expression of group II LEA genes in different plant cells. In vitro experimental evidence from biochemical assays has suggested that group II LEA proteins perform heterogenous functions in response to extreme stresses. Various investigations have indicated the participation of group II LEA proteins in the plant stress tolerance mechanism, spotlighting the molecular aspects of group II LEA genes and their potential role in biotechnological strategies to increase plants’ survival in adverse environments. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Quarkonia suppression has been looked up as a prominent signature of Quark–Gluon Plasma (QGP). Charmonium and bottomonium suppression has been extensively studied under the QGP scenario with various hot and cold nuclear matter effects using Unified Model of Quarkonia Suppression (UMQS) in our earlier work. Here we have modified our model to explain suppression data of D0 mesons at 2.76 TeV. For space-time evolution of temperature, we used (1 + 1 )-dimensional Bjorken’s hydrodynamics. We are using quasi-particle model as the equation of state for QGP. We calculate the survival probability for color screening, gluonic dissociation, and collision damping under QGP scenario. We also consider recombination of mesons through gluonic de-excitation approach. Among cold nuclear matter effects, we include nuclear shadowing. We finally calculate the survival probability of D0 meson as a function of transverse momentum and centrality and compare it with the nuclear modification factor data available at LHC. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - Recognizing the enemy: do predator cues influence hatching in Neotropical annual killifish?
VL  - 99
IS  - 4
SP  - 1476-1484
AB  - Annual fish species have evolved complex adaptations to survive in temporary wetlands. The main adaptation of these fish is the ability to produce embryos that survive dry periods. Embryo development of this fish can show variation at multiple levels influenced by many environmental factors, such as photoperiod and temperature. Predator cues are another factor that can influence the embryonic stage. One way in which annual fish could adapt to predators is by using risk-spreading strategies (through bet-hedging). Nonetheless, this strategy depends on the coevolutionary history between predators and preys and on the degree of environmental unpredictability, resulting in different responses across different species. This study investigated the influence of predator cues on the embryonic development and hatching of two Austrolebias species that inhabit ponds that present differences in hydroperiod and the risk of predator presence. The results confirmed a differentiated response between the two annual fish species tested, corroborating the modulation of hatching against the risk of predation by native predatory fish. The authors further showed that development times varied between the two annual fish species, regardless of the presence of predators. They highlight that the variation in embryonic development is strongly affected by different levels of hydroperiod unpredictability faced by the two species. To unravel finer-scale local adaptations in the annual fish embryo development, future studies should focus on a region with greater spatial gradient. © 2021 Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

TI  - Numerical simulation of geothermal energy productivity considering the evolution of permeability in various fractures
VL  - 201
AB  - The optimization of geothermal exploitation model and simulation of productivity is a hot spot in the thermal industry recently. Previously, the fracture permeability was considered as a constant during the thermal exploitation. However, the fracture permeability varies constantly during the thermal exploitation, and this causes an error in the numerical simulation of geothermal productivity. Here, the experiment in evolution of the fracture permeability in granite was performed, and the equations for evolution of the permeability in major fractures, branch fractures and natural fractures were established. On this basis, the thermal-hydro-mechanical coupling geothermal model was established to investigate the effect of well profiles, conditions for evolution of fracture permeability and natural fracture development degree on geothermal exploitation capacity. The results show that when considering the evolution of fracture permeability, the vertical well model is affected after 20 years of exploitation, and the produced thermal energy in the vertical well with developed fractures is about 4% (0.4 MW) lower than in the conventional vertical well model. Under the same conditions, the difference between horizontal wells is within 1%, which can be ignored. More heat is outputted in reservoirs with developed fractures than in those without fractures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Studies on Biochemical Responses of Table Sized Labeo Rohita (Hamilton, 1822) to the Thermal Exposure at Critical Maximum Temperature (CTmax)
VL  - 9
IS  - 2
SP  - 197-203
AB  - Water temperature of aquatic bodies is gradually getting warmer and may pose threat for survival, health and production of fish in future. The critical temperature maximum (CTmax) is the tool to estimate the upper limit of thermal tolerance of fish but information on biochemical events occurring at CTmax are limited for our selected fish, Labeo rohita. In the present study, biochemical alteration of table sized Labeo rohita (Rahu) was examined at CTmax (42.67 +/- 0.53 degrees C) against fish kept at acclimation temperature (30.5 +/- 1.0 degrees C) by increasing water temperature continuously at the rate of 0.28 degrees C minute(-1). Significant alteration was observed for all studied biomolecules with increased glucose and triglycerides and declined protein and cholesterol in serum at CTmax. Hormones also altered with increased value for thyroid hormones and decreased value for cortisol, however the alteration was significant only for T4. In liver glucose, triglycerides and cholesterol level was higher but protein was less at CTmax. Increased transaminase enzymes activities (GPT and GOT) in liver may have increased the production of the glucose from tissue protein. At CTmax, alteration in metabolic activities (higher amount of glucose and triglycerides in serum) for energy production and onset of heat shock responses (higher expression of hsp70 gene in liver) were occurred in Rahu. In this study, CTmax was 42.67 +/- 0.53 degrees C and warming tolerance was 12 degrees C indicating that Rahu can tolerate sudden increment of water temperature of a few degrees beyond present habitat temperature, although for few moments.

TI  - Evolutionary constraints on physiology confound range shift predictions of two nacellid limpets
VL  - 806
AB  - Physiological comparisons are fundamental to quantitative assessments of the capacity of species to persist within their current distribution and to predict their rates of redistribution in response to climate change. Yet, the degree to which physiological traits are conserved through evolutionary history may fundamentally constrain the capacity for species to adapt and shift their geographic range. Taxa that straddle major climate transitions provide the opportunity to test the mechanisms underlying evolutionary constraints and how such constraints may influence range shift predictions. Here we focus on two abundant and shallow water nacellid limpets which have representative species on either side of the Polar front. We test the thermal thresholds of the Southern Patagonian limpet, Nacella deaurata and show that its optimal temperatures for growth (4 °C), activity (-1.2 to -0.2 °C) and survival (1 to 8 °C) are mismatched to its currently experienced annual sea surface temperature range (5.9 to 10 °C). Comparisons with the congeneric Antarctic limpet, N. concinna, reveal an evolutionary constraint on N. deaurata physiology, with overlapping thermal capacities, suggesting that a cold climate legacy has been maintained through the evolution of these species. These physiological assessments predict that the South American range of N. deaurata will likely decline with continued warming. It is, however, one of the first species with demonstrated physiological capacity to successfully colonize the cold Southern Ocean. With the expected increase in opportunities for transport within high southern latitudes, N. deaurata has the potential to establish and drive ecological change within the shallow Southern Ocean. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Honey bee (Apis mellifera) size determines colony heat transfer when brood covering or distributed
VL  - 66

SP  - 1653-1663
AB  - Heat transfer is key to the survival of honey bee colonies (Apis mellifera L.) in the wide range of hot (e.g. sub-Saharan) and cool climates (e.g. maritime-temperate) in which they have evolved and adapted. Here, a validated computational fluid dynamics, conjugate heat transfer model was used to determine the heat transfer of honey bee colonies in simulated standard wooden hives, complete with combs and brood, for a broad range of honey bee sizes, from slender lowland African A.m. scutellata, to broader (larger diameter) Northern European A.m. mellifera, across the whole range of brood covering honey bee densities, as well as when evenly distributed throughout the hive. It shows that under cooling stress, brood covering, broad subspecies need less than a third of the number of bees per unit of brood area for thermal insulation compared to slender subspecies. Also, when distributed evenly around the nest, broad subspecies lose less brood heat than when brood covering. These simulations demonstrate that honey bee girth has climate-based evolutionary advantages directly for the colony as well as via the survival of the individual. In addition, it shows that non-clustering behavioural patterns of passive honey bees can make significant, subspecies distinctive changes to nest heat loss and therefore honey production and climate change survival. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Climate change is the biggest challenge facing humanity today. The associated global warming and humidification, increases in the severity and frequency of extreme climate events, extension of the ranges of vector-borne diseases, and the consequent social and economic stresses and disruption will have major negative consequences on many aspects of health care. People whose resilience to change is already impaired may suffer disproportionately from these environmental changes, which are of unprecedented reach and magnitude. There has been little connection made so far between climate change and epilepsy. We briefly review the history of climate change science and the subsequent response of the global scientific community. We consider how climate change effects might in general affect health and disease. We consider some of the underlying complex interactions that, for example, favor the spread of vector-borne diseases and how climate models operate and may help plan for global and local changes. We then speculate specifically on how these generic ideas may apply specifically to epilepsy. We consider these impacts at levels from molecular to the epidemiological. Data are sparse, and there is undoubtedly a need for more information to enable better estimation of possible effects of climate change on care in epilepsy. We also consider how the professional activities of those involved in epilepsy health care might contribute to global carbon emissions, for example, through flying for conference attendance. Healthcare organizations across the world are already considering, and responding to, many of these issues. We argue for more research in this area, but also for action today. Actions today are likely to generate cobenefits for health care, including care in epilepsy, resulting from efforts to decarbonize, mitigate effects of climate change that has already happened, and plan for adaptation to climate change. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Transcriptomic and functional analyses of the piRNA pathway in the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius prolixus
VL  - 12
IS  - 10
AB  - The piRNA pathway is a surveillance system that guarantees oogenesis and adult fertility in a range of animal species. The pathway is centered on PIWI clade Argonaute proteins and the associated small non-coding RNAs termed piRNAs. In this study, we set to investigate the evolutionary conservation of the piRNA pathway in the hemimetabolous insect Rhodnius prolixus. Our transcriptome profiling reveals that core components of the pathway are expressed during previtellogenic stages of oogenesis. Rhodnius’ genome harbors four putative piwi orthologs. We show that Rp-piwi2, Rp-piwi3 and Rp-ago3, but not Rp-piwi1 transcripts are produced in the germline tissues and maternally deposited in the mature eggs. Consistent with a role in Rhodnius oogenesis, parental RNAi against the Rp-piwi2, Rp-piwi3 and Rp-ago3 results in severe egg laying and female adult fertility defects. Furthermore, we show that the reduction of the Rp-piwi2 levels by parental RNAi disrupts oogenesis by causing a dramatic loss of trophocytes, egg chamber degeneration and oogenesis arrest. Intriguingly, the putative Rp-Piwi2 protein features a polyglutamine tract at its N-terminal region, which is conserved in PIWI proteins encoded in the genome of other Triatomine species. Together with R. prolixus, these hematophagous insects are primary vectors of the Chagas disease. Thus, our data shed more light on the evolution of the piRNA pathway and provide a framework for the development of new control strategies for Chagas disease insect vectors. © 2018 Brito et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

AB  - Over the last century research in Drosophila has resulted in many fundamental contributions to our understanding of the biology of multicellular organisms. Many of these breakthroughs have been based on the identification of novel gene functions in large-scale genetic screens. However, conventional forward-genetic screens have been limited by the random nature of mutagenesis and difficulties in mapping causal mutations, while reverse-genetic RNAi screens suffer from incomplete knockdown of gene expression. Recently developed large-scale CRISPR-Cas9 libraries promise to address these limitations by allowing the induction of targeted mutations in genes with spatial and temporal control. Here, we provide a guide for tissue-specific CRISPR screening in Drosophila, including the characterization of Gal4 UAS-Cas9 lines, selection of sgRNA libraries, and various quality control measures. We also discuss confounding factors that can give rise to false-positive and false-negative results in such experiments and suggest strategies on how to detect and avoid them. Conditional CRISPR screening represents an exciting new approach for functional genomics in vivo and is set to further expand our knowledge of the molecular underpinning of development, homeostasis, and disease. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Heat exposure effect on Ghanaian mining workers: A mediated-moderation approach
VL  - 788
AB  - The lack of empirical evidence on the effect of heat exposure on the health and safety, productivity, psychological behaviour and social well-being outcomes of small- and large-scale mining workers in Africa has derailed concrete policy directions and interventions. An explanatory cross-sectional survey involving 320 small- and large-scale mining workers was used to assess this research gap. A path analysis was used to model health and safety, productivity, psychological behaviour and social well-being as a function of heat exposure, mediated and moderated by adaptation strategies and barriers, while controlling for age, gender, level of education, years of working experience and workplace environment. Significant direct adverse effects of heat exposure on mining workers' health and safety, productivity and psychological behaviour outcomes were found. Using a pick-a-point approach, significant difference was found in simple slopes (SS) for heat exposure on adaptation strategies at medium level of barriers and a trend toward significance at the high level of barriers. Except for health and safety outcomes, there were significant conditional indirect effects of heat exposure on the performance outcomes at the medium and high levels of barriers to adaptation strategies. However, there was no evidence of mediated-moderation for heat exposure and health and safety, productivity, psychological behaviour and social well-being outcomes. We have provided empirical evidence to establish heat exposure effect on key performance outcomes of mining workers to initiate and guide the formulation of heat exposure management policies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 78
SP  - 265-277
AB  - Extreme high-speed laser material deposition (EHLA) can be utilized for mass customization owing to its enhanced process speed and productivity. Although EHLA has multiple similarities with additive manufacturing techniques such as conventional laser metal deposition (LMD), the variation in the process speed causes different phase transformations and residual stress distributions. Therefore, a combined heat source model is proposed to evaluate the performance of structures repaired by EHLA and optimize process strategies. The model considers the unique energy input associated with the densification process compared with that of the conventionally used Gaussian heat source model. The parameters within the model were calibrated based on the residual stress distribution and molten pool morphology. The evolution of temperature and residual stress was investigated under various process conditions such as scanning speed and power input using the model. The consistency between the simulation and experimental results verified the viability of the model for determining EHLA parameters and improving the performance of repaired parts. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers

AB  - Psychrophiles have evolved to produce cold-adapted enzymes to enable survival in low-temperature environments. In this study, the cold adaptation of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (CpsEPSPS) from Colwellia psychrerythraea, a model psychrophile, was analyzed. The optimum temperature for the activity of CpsEPSPS was found to be 25℃, with 35% activity remaining at 5℃. However, the unfolding temperature of CpsEPSPS was 54℃. This phenomenon is frequently observed in cold-active enzymes. As is the cases for most cold-active enzymes, the Km values of CpsEPSPS for its substrates were higher than those of Escherichia coli EPSPS. These results indicate that CpsEPSPS is cold-adapted, but not perfectly. © 2022, The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

TI  - Genome Functional Analysis of the Psychrotrophic Lignin-Degrading Bacterium Arthrobacter sp. C2 and the Role of DyP in Catalyzing Lignin Degradation
VL  - 13
AB  - In the cold regions of China, lignin-rich corn straw accumulates at high levels due to low temperatures. The application of psychrotrophic lignin-degrading bacteria should be an effective means of overcoming the low-temperature limit for lignin degradation and promoting the utilization of corn straw. However, this application is limited by the lack of suitable strains for decomposition of lignin; furthermore, the metabolic mechanism of psychrotrophic lignin-degrading bacteria is unclear. Here, the whole genome of the psychrotrophic lignin-degrading bacterium Arthrobacter sp. C2, isolated in our previous work, was sequenced. Comparative genomics revealed that C2 contained unique genes related to lignin degradation and low-temperature adaptability. DyP may participate in lignin degradation and may be a cold-adapted enzyme. Moreover, DyP was proven to catalyze lignin Cα-Cβ bond cleavage. Deletion and complementation of the DyP gene verified its ability to catalyze the first-step reaction of lignin degradation. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that the transcriptional expression of the DyP gene was upregulated, and the genetic compensation mechanism allowed C2ΔDyP to degrade lignin, which provided novel insights into the survival strategy of the psychrotrophic mutant strain C2ΔdyP. This study improved our understanding of the metabolic mechanism of psychrotrophic lignin-degrading bacteria and provided potential application options for energy-saving production using cold-adapted lignin-degrading enzymes.

AB  - We study the time evolution of the survival probability and the spin polarization of a dissipative nondegenerate two-level system in the presence of a magnetic field in the Faraday configuration. We apply the Extended Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble approach to model the stochastic system-environment interaction and calculate the survival and spin polarization to first and second order of the interaction picture. We present also the time evolution of the thermal average of these quantities as functions of the temperature, the magnetic field, and the energy-levels density, for ρ(ϵ)∝ϵs, in the subohmic, ohmic, and superohmic dissipation forms. We show that the behavior of the spin polarization calculated here agrees rather well with the time evolution of spin polarization observed and calculated, recently, for the electron-nucleus dynamics of Ga centers in dilute (Ga,N)As semiconductors. © 2019 P.

VL  - 40

SP  - 39-47
AB  - Aphids have intimate associations with facultative symbionts that can help their hosts against natural enemies or heat shocks. However, these partnerships with symbionts could also induce costs for the hosts. This study focused on such associations to unearth induced costs and coevolution. Our data indicated that two strains of Regiella insecticola had nega-tive effects on aphid fecundity, developmental time of the 3rd instar nymphs, and the age at first reproduction. Subsequently, the role of the R. insecticola was examined in the aphid’s resistance to a parasitoid, Aphidius gifuensis (Ashmaed), a major agent used in biological control of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae. Results revealed that a significant reduction in emer-gence rate of the wasp, but not the percentage of parasitism. These results provided more evidences on a hypothesis that aphid individuals hosting facultative symbionts have a fecundity cost associated with parasitoid resistances. Additional tests were conducted to determine fitness costs of harboring the symbiont on the remaining unparasitized aphid individuals, showing no difference in aphid fecundity and survival between aphids with and without the symbiont. However, when compared to the absence of the wasp, the reproduction rate of aphids showed a strong increase under the stress of the parasitism in three aphid lines, particularly in the aphids harboring R. insecticola. This may suggest a potential evolutionary direction. Overall, the study enhanced our knowledge of the role of symbionts in host and parasite coevolution and insect pest control. © 2019 E.

TI  - Adaptation of anopheles vectors to anthropogenic malaria-associated rubber plantations and indoor residual spraying: Establishing population dynamics and insecticide susceptibility
VL  - 2018
AB  - Anthropogenic activity such as the establishment of Anopheles-infested rubber plantations can influence local malaria transmission dynamics to which the population dynamics and insecticide susceptibility of local Anopheles vectors are related. Using human landing catch collections at a house protected by indoor residual spraying (IRS), the periodic assessment of species composition, abundance, and blood-feeding behaviors was done in pre-IRS, during IRS, and post-IRS at 3, 6, and 12 months in a malaria-associated rubber plantation (MRP) ecotope of the Bo Rai district, Trat Province, Thailand, after malaria outbreak occurred. The study MRP ecotope elicited the population ratio (pi) of Anopheles vectors: An. campestris (0.747), An. dirus (0.168), An. minimus (0.037), An. barbirostris (0.027), and An. pseudowillmori (0.002), and of An. jamesii nonvector (0.019). Among these, two predominant An. campestris and An. dirus night-biters were then used in the susceptibility test against 0.05% deltamethrin (DEL) and 0.09% bifenthrin (BT) insecticides currently used in IRS. An. campestris, a suspected vector of Plasmodium vivax, had a tendency to appear throughout the study and behaved both exophagy and endophagy. It was highly susceptible to BT, showing 95.0% mortality (95% CI, 79.1-100) while decreasing sensitivity of 87.2% (95% CI, 78.4-95.9) to DEL. An. dirus, a primary vector of Plasmodium falciparum, had a tendency to feed outdoors rather than indoors. Significant differences in the abundance (mean density and human landing rate) were observed at pre-IRS (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.046), and similarly, during IRS (P=0.001 and P=0.037). It was highly susceptible to DEL and BT, showing 100% mortality rate. Evidently, the study MRP ecotope contributed receptive environment to favor the abundant local Anopheles vectors and their outdoor biting preference. This can pose the risk for residual malaria parasite transmission in Anopheles vectors even though the house is protected by IRS. © 2018 Suntorn Pimnon and Adisak Bhumiratana.

TI  - Urbanization extends flight phenology and leads to local adaptation of seasonal plasticity in Lepidoptera
VL  - 118
IS  - 40
AB  - Urbanization is gaining force globally, which challenges biodiversity, and it has recently also emerged as an agent of evolutionary change. Seasonal phenology and life cycle regulation are essential processes that urbanization is likely to alter through both the urban heat island effect (UHI) and artificial light at night (ALAN). However, how UHI and ALAN affect the evolution of seasonal adaptations has received little attention. Here, we test for the urban evolution of seasonal life-history plasticity, specifically changes in the photoperiodic induction of diapause in two lepidopterans, Pieris napi (Pieridae) and Chiasmia clathrata (Geometridae). We used long-term data from standardized monitoring and citizen science observation schemes to compare yearly phenological flight curves in six cities in Finland and Sweden to those of adjacent rural populations. This analysis showed for both species that flight seasons are longer and end later in most cities, suggesting a difference in the timing of diapause induction. Then, we used common garden experiments to test whether the evolution of the photoperiodic reaction norm for diapause could explain these phenological changes for a subset of these cities. These experiments demonstrated a genetic shift for both species in urban areas toward a lower daylength threshold for direct development, consistent with predictions based on the UHI but not ALAN. The correspondence of this genetic change to the results of our larger-scale observational analysis of in situ flight phenology indicates that it may be widespread. These findings suggest that seasonal life cycle regulation evolves in urban ectotherms and may contribute to ecoevolutionary dynamics in cities. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Potential distribution of Musca domestica in Jesús María Municipality, Aguascalientes, Mexico, based on climate change scenarios
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
SP  - 14-29
AB  - The housefly M. domestica is a primary domestic pest responsible for food decomposition, and is a vector for more than 100 pathogens in humans and animals. Climate conditions including temperature and relative humidity influence M. domestica development and prevalence. As climate change advances control programs for this species will need to adapt to evolving conditions. A development assay was done of M. domestica at different temperatures and relative humidities to estimate its current potential incidence in Jesús María Municipality, Aguascalientes, Mexico. Local climate is temperate semi-dry (BS1k) with 16 to 18 °C annual average temperature and 500 to 600 mm annual average rainfall. In a completely randomized design, six treatments involving different temperatures and relative humidities during the entire fly lifecycle were analyzed. Development conditions were ideal between 20 and 30 °C, conditions present in the study area between June and August. The CNRMCM5 (RCP 4.5) climate change model was used to predict extreme minimum temperatures in three time horizons: Short (2015-2039); Medium (2040-2060); and Long (2075-2090). Under the Medium and Long scenarios ideal development conditions could last as long as five months, representing a potential increase in the time M. domestica is present in the region, and in the duration of the public and animal health challenges it generates. The present results are important for planning future prevention, monitoring and control programs and strategies. © 2019 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria. All Rights Reserved.

VL  - 75
IS  - 19
SP  - 3635-3647
AB  - When temperatures plummet below 0 °C, wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) can endure the freezing of up to ~ 65% of their body water in extracellular ice masses, displaying no measurable brain activity, no breathing, no movement, and a flat-lined heart. To aid survival, frogs retreat into a state of suspended animation characterized by global suppression of metabolic functions and reprioritization of energy usage to essential survival processes that is elicited, in part, by the regulatory controls of microRNAs. The present study is the first to investigate miRNA biogenesis and regulation in the brain of a freeze tolerant vertebrate. Indeed, proper brain function and adaptations to environmental stimuli play a crucial role in coordinating stress responses. Immunoblotting of miRNA biogenesis factors illustrated an overall reduction in the majority of these processing proteins suggesting a potential suppression of miRNA maturation over the freeze–thaw cycle. This was coupled with a large-scale RT-qPCR analysis of relative expression levels of 113 microRNA species in the brains of control, 24 h frozen, and 8 h thawed R. sylvatica. Of the 41 microRNAs differentially regulated during freezing and thawing, only two were significantly upregulated. Bioinformatic target enrichment of the downregulated miRNAs, performed at the low temperatures experienced during freezing and thawing, predicted their involvement in the potential activation of various neuroprotective processes such as synaptic signaling, intracellular signal transduction, and anoxia/ischemia injury protection. The predominantly downregulated microRNA fingerprint identified herein suggests a microRNA-mediated cryoprotective mechanism responsible for maintaining neuronal functions and facilitating successful whole brain freezing and thawing. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 2019
AB  - Culex sitiens Wiedemann (Diptera, Culicidae) is a mosquito vector that is found in coastal areas. Effective control of mosquitoes requires knowledge of the biology, ecology, and behavior of the vector as well as of various other aspects, including its morphology. Currently, variations in the wing size and shape of coastal Cx. sitiens have not been described. Here, morphological changes were studied in the wings of Cx. sitiens from a coastal area of Samut Songkhram Province, Thailand. Samples were collected at night (6:00 pm-6:00 am) during single weeks of September in the years 2015-2017 using Center for Disease Control light traps with dry ice as bait. Eighteen landmarks of each individual were selected and digitized for landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses. Wing size variability was estimated using the isometric estimator of centroid size. Wing-shape variables were computed as Procrustes superimposition with residual coordinates of the 18 landmarks following a Generalized Procrustes Analysis and the principal components of residual coordinates. Degrees of wing-shape dissimilarity among individuals were analyzed using discriminant analysis or canonical variate analysis, which was illustrated in a discriminant space of canonical variables. Differences in wing size and shape among populations were calculated using nonparametric permutations based on 1000 runs with Bonferroni correction tests at a p-value of <0.05. The wing sizes and shapes of the mosquitoes differed significantly between observation years in all population groups, as indicated by nonparametric tests (1000 runs) with the Bonferroni correction. Differing rainfall between observation years was related to morphological changes in mosquito populations, presumably reflecting environmental adaptation. Differences in the wing morphology of Cx. sitiens between annual populations reflect adaptation to environmental variables such as rainfall and may affect the potential to act as insect vectors of human disease. These observations may facilitate the development of tools for managing mosquito-borne disease. © 2019 Tanawat Chaiphongpachara and Sedthapong Laojun.

TI  - Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals ecological adaption of cold tolerance in northward invasion of Alternanthera philoxeroides
VL  - 21
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Alternanthera philoxeroides (alligator weed) is a highly invasive alien plant that has continuously and successfully expanded from the tropical to the temperate regions of China via asexual reproduction. During this process, the continuous decrease in temperature has been a key limiting environmental factor. Results: In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the cold tolerance of alligator weed via transcriptomics. The transcriptomic differences between the southernmost population and the northernmost population of China were compared at different time points of cold treatments. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses showed that the alligator weed transcriptional response to cold stress is associated with genes encoding protein kinases, transcription factors, plant-pathogen interactions, plant hormone signal transduction and metabolic processes. Although members of the same gene family were often expressed in both populations, the levels of gene expression between them varied. Further ChIP experiments indicated that histone epigenetic modification changes at the candidate transcription factor gene loci are accompanied by differences in gene expression in response to cold, without variation in the coding sequences of these genes in these two populations. These results suggest that histone changes may contribute to the cold-responsive gene expression divergence between these two populations to provide the most beneficial response to chilling stimuli. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the major alterations in gene expression levels belonging to the main cold-resistance response processes may be responsible for the divergence in the cold resistance of these two populations. During this process, histone modifications in cold-responsive genes have the potential to drive the major alterations in cold adaption necessary for the northward expansion of alligator weed. © 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Phenotypic plasticity is not a cline: Thermal physiology of an intertidal barnacle over 20° of latitude
VL  - 90
IS  - 8
SP  - 1961-1972
AB  - Our understanding of the plastic and evolutionary potential of ectothermic organisms and their populational impacts in the face of rapid global change remains limited. Studies attempting on the relationship between the magnitude of thermal variability across latitude and the degree of phenotypic plasticity exhibited by marine ectotherms are inconclusive. We state that the latter arises from the narrow range of thermal variability captured by the limited span of the latitudinal gradients studied to date. Using a mechanistic ecophysiological approach and a satellite-based assessment of the relevant environmental variables (i.e. temperature and food availability), we studied individuals of the intertidal barnacle Jehlius cirratus from seven local populations widely spread along the Humboldt current system that spanning two biogeographic regions. At the same time, we synthesized published information on the local abundance of our study species across a total of 76 sites representing 20° of latitude, and spanning from 18 to 42°S. We examined the effects of latitude and environmental variability on metabolic rate plasticity, thermal tolerance (thermal breadth and thermal safety margins) and their impacts on the abundance of this widespread marine invertebrate. We demonstrate that the phenotypic plasticity of metabolic rate in J. cirratus populations is not related to latitude. In turn, thermal breadth is explained by the temperature variability each population experiences. Furthermore, we found clinal variation with a poleward decrease of the critical thermal minimum, suggesting that episodic extreme low temperatures represent a ubiquitous selective force on the lower thermal limit for ectotherms. Across our study gradient, plasticity patterns indicate that populations at the equatorial extreme are more vulnerable to a warming climate, while populations located in the biogeographic transitional zone (i.e. high environmental heterogeneity), on the centre of the gradient, display higher levels of phenotypic plasticity and may represent a genetic buffer for the effects of ocean warming. Together, our results suggest the existence of a fitness trade-off involving the metabolic cost of plasticity and population density that is evident only across the vast latitudinal gradient examined. © 2021 British Ecological Society

TI  - Voltinism-associated differences in winter survival across latitudes: integrating growth, physiology, and food intake
VL  - 186
IS  - 4
SP  - 919-929
AB  - Species that span large latitudinal gradients face strong differences in voltinism and in winter conditions within their range. Latitudinal gradients in winter survival and especially their underlying mechanisms and association with voltinism patterns are poorly studied. We tested in the damselfly Enallagma cyathigerum whether high-latitude populations were better in dealing with the longer winters compared to central- and low-latitude populations and whether this was associated with changes in voltinism. We thereby evaluated whether higher initial levels and/or lower reductions during winter of energy storage (measured as fat content) and investment in immune function [measured as the activity of phenoloxidase (PO)], and/or stronger compensatory responses in food intake contributed to the higher winter survival in high-latitude populations. To this end, we simulated a long high-latitude winter at 4 °C under manipulated food conditions. Across food levels, winter survival was highest in Swedish larvae, intermediate in Belgian larvae, and lowest in Spanish larvae, indicating latitude-specific thermal adaptation that could be partly linked to differences in voltinism. The semi-voltine Swedish larvae were growing slower before winter and as a result accumulated the highest fat content and PO activity when the winter started compared to the univoltine, faster growing Belgian, and Spanish larvae. Fat content and PO activity declined during the winter, yet equally across latitudes, and were not buffered by compensatory food intake. Our data identified possible underlying physiological mechanisms of winter survival and support the hypothesis that widespread latitude-associated voltinism shifts may be a selective factor contributing to latitudinal shifts in winter survival. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Laboratory diet influences cold tolerance in a genotype-dependent manner in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 257
AB  - Cold stress can reduce insect fitness and is an important determinant of species distributions and responses to climate change. Cold tolerance is influenced by genotype and environmental conditions, with factors such as day length and temperature having a particularly strong influence. Recent studies also indicate that diet impacts cold tolerance, but it is unclear whether diet-mediated shifts in cold tolerance are consistent across distinct genotypes. The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which commonly used artificial diets influence cold tolerance in Drosophila melanogaster, and whether these effects are consistent across genetically distinct lines. Specifically, we tested the impact of different fly diets on 1) ability to survive cold stress, 2) critical thermal minimum (CTmin), and 3) the ability to maintain reproduction after cold stress. Experiments were conducted across six isogenic lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, and these lines were reared on different fly diets. Cold shock survival, CTmin, and reproductive output pre- and post-cold exposure varied considerably across diet and genotype combinations, suggesting strong genotype by environment interactions shape nutritionally mediated changes in cold tolerance. For example, in some lines cold shock survival remained consistently high or low across diets, while in others cold shock survival ranged from 5% to 75% depending on diet. Ultimately, these results add to a growing literature that cold tolerance is shaped by complex interactions between genotype and environment and inform practical considerations when selecting a laboratory diet for thermal tolerance experiments in Drosophila. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

VL  - 10706
AB  - Digital micromirror devices (DMDs) have the potential to revolutionize near infrared spectroscopy of crowded fields in astronomy. These devices, however, are not designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures as necessary for the infrared bandpass. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the viability of DMDs for use in infrared applications by testing the devices at cryogenic temperatures. In total, eleven DMDs were tested, each being cooled in a cryo-vacuum chamber to cryogenic temperature; approximately 90 K. Each device endured three cooldown and warmup cycles on average. Units tested include six stock, unaltered, DMDs from Texas Instruments™, as well as five re-windowed devices. Results indicate that stock devices function reliably at cryogenic temperature, however window-replaced devices had a high failure rate; likely due to contamination in the window-replacement process. Based on these results, it appears that stock devices perform reliably enough at cryogenic temperatures for reliable use in an instrument, but more research is needed into the re-windowing process before re-windowed devices are used within spectrographs. © 2018 SPIE.

SP  - 189-212
AB  - Cyanobacteria are interesting components of all polar habitats with many of them being present in different microhabitats. A long evolutionary history and strong adaptive tendencies allow these cyanobacteria to survive and thrive in these tough conditions with ease. They are known to be present in a wide array of microhabitats from the highly exposed barren rock surfaces having extreme doses of ultraviolet radiation to endolithic ecosystems having very less amount of light. The omnipresence of cyanobacteria is a result of the strategies they can design to adapt and flourish in these conditions. Key stress factors that test these survival capabilities include temperature, freeze-thaw cycles, desiccation, and intense light and ultraviolet radiations. In spite of their dominance and strong presence, cyanobacteria have been remarkably underrepresented in culture-based studies till now, which can be attributed to many reasons. It is hoped that in the coming times, better possibilities of cyanobacterial cultivation could be earmarked for efficient taxonomic and exploratory studies. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

VL  - 99
SP  - 106-113
AB  - Laboratory rearing of mosquitoes is commonly practiced by researchers studying mosquito-borne infectious diseases and vector control methods. In the absence of cryopreservation methods to stabilize unique or genetically modified strains, mosquito lines must be continuously maintained, a laborious process that risks selection effects, contamination, and genetic drift. Towards the development of a cryopreservation protocol, several commonly used cryoprotectants were systematically characterized here both individually and as cocktails. Among first instar, feeding-stage An. gambiae and An. stephensi larvae, cryoprotectant toxicity followed the order of dimethyl sulfoxide &gt; ethylene glycol &gt; methanol. The resulting LD50 values were used as the basis for the development of cryoprotectant cocktail solutions, where formulation optimization was streamlined using Taguchi methods of experimental design. Sensitivity to hypothermia was further evaluated to determine the feasibility of cryoprotectant loading at reduced temperatures and slow cooling approaches to cryopreservation. The information described here contributes to the knowledge base necessary to inform the development of a cryopreservation protocol for Anopheles larvae. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Physiology in ecological niche modeling: using zebra mussel's upper thermal tolerance to refine model predictions through Bayesian analysis
VL  - 43
IS  - 2
SP  - 270-282
AB  - Climate change and human-mediated dispersal are increasingly influencing species’ geographic distributions. Ecological niche models (ENMs) are widely used in forecasting species’ distributions, but are weak in extrapolation to novel environments because they rely on available distributional data and do not incorporate mechanistic information, such as species’ physiological response to abiotic conditions. To improve accuracy of ENMs, we incorporated physiological knowledge through Bayesian analysis. In a case study of the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, we used native and global occurrences to obtain native and global models representing narrower and broader understanding of zebra mussel’ response to temperature. We also obtained thermal limit and survival information for zebra mussel from peer-reviewed literature and used the two types of information separately and jointly to calibrate native models. We showed that, compared to global models, native models predicted lower relative probability of presence along zebra mussel's upper thermal limit, suggesting the shortcoming of native models in predicting zebra mussel's response to warm temperature. We also found that native models showed improved prediction of relative probability of presence when thermal limit was used alone, and best approximated global models when both thermal limit and survival data were used. Our result suggests that integration of physiological knowledge enhances extrapolation of ENM in novel environments. Our modeling framework can be generalized for other species or other physiological limits and may incorporate evolutionary information (e.g. evolved thermal tolerance), thus has the potential to improve predictions of species’ invasive potential and distributional response to climate change. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Transcriptomic analysis reveals Apis mellifera adaptations to high temperature and high humidity
VL  - 184
AB  - Temperature and humidity are the most important factors affecting the growth, reproduction, and survival of bees. Apis mellifera are important pollinating bees that are widely used in agricultural systems. However, the higher temperatures and humidity in greenhouses are not conducive to the survival of bees. Although previous research has revealed the behavioral responses and physiological mechanisms of honeybees to adapt to high temperature and humidity, there are few data on the exact molecular mechanisms involved. In our study, we investigated gene expression in A. mellifera under different temperature and humidity treatments, using transcriptomic analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and relevant biological processes. Based on the transcriptomic results, we selected several genes with significant differences in expression, and detected the expression patterns of these genes at different temperatures or humidity or different treatment times by q-RT PCR. In the high temperature treatments, 434 DEGs were identified; in the high humidity treatments, 86 DEGs were identified; in the combined high temperature and humidity treatments, 266 DEGs were identified. Analysis results showed that DEGs were enriched in pathways related to amino acid and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism under each treatment. In addition, heat shock proteins, zinc finger proteins, serine/threonine-protein kinases, and antioxidase were differentially expressed between the different treatments. The results of the q-RT PCR showed that the expression levels of these genes increased with increasing temperature and over treatment time. Our findings provide a general expression profile of the adaptive expression of heat-resistance genes responding to high temperature and high humidity in A. mellifera, including the expression patterns of several DEGs. Our data provide a basis for future research on the mechanisms underlying the adaptation of insects to high temperature and humidity. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Strict maternal transmission of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is hypothesized to permit the accumulation of mitochondrial variants that are deleterious to males but not females, a phenomenon called mother's curse. However, direct evidence that mtDNA mutations exhibit such sexually antagonistic fitness effects is sparse. Male-specific mutational effects can occur when the physiological requirements of the mitochondria differ between the sexes. Such male-specific effects could potentially occur if sex-specific cell types or tissues have energy requirements that are differentially impacted by mutations affecting energy metabolism. Here we summarize findings from a model mitochondrial-nuclear incompatibility in the fruit fly Drosophila that demonstrates sex-biased effects, but with deleterious effects that are generally larger in females. We present new results showing that the mitochondrial-nuclear incompatibility does negatively affect male fertility, but only when males are developed at high temperatures. The temperature-dependent male sterility can be partially rescued by diet, suggesting an energetic basis. Finally, we discuss fruitful paths forward in understanding the physiological scope for sex-specific effects of mitochondrial mutations in the context of the recent discovery that many aspects of metabolism are sexually dimorphic and downstream of sex-determination pathways in Drosophila. A key parameter of these models that remains to be quantified is the fraction of mitochondrial mutations with truly male-limited fitness effects across extrinsic and intrinsic environments. Given the energy demands of reproduction in females, only a small fraction of the mitochondrial mutational spectrum may have the potential to contribute to mother's curse in natural populations. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - The role of RNA-binding proteins in mediating adaptive responses in Gram-positive bacteria
VL  - 289
IS  - 7
SP  - 1746-1764
AB  - Bacteria are constantly subjected to stressful conditions, such as antibiotic exposure, nutrient limitation and oxidative stress. For pathogenic bacteria, adapting to the host environment, escaping defence mechanisms and coping with antibiotic stress are crucial for their survival and the establishment of a successful infection. Stress adaptation relies heavily on the rate at which the organism can remodel its gene expression programme to counteract the stress. RNA-binding proteins mediating co- and post-transcriptional regulation have recently emerged as important players in regulating gene expression during adaptive responses. Most of the research on these layers of gene expression regulation has been done in Gram-negative model organisms where, thanks to a wide variety of global studies, large post-transcriptional regulatory networks have been uncovered. Unfortunately, our understanding of post-transcriptional regulation in Gram-positive bacteria is lagging behind. One possible explanation for this is that many proteins employed by Gram-negative bacteria are not well conserved in Gram-positives. And even if they are conserved, they do not always play similar roles as in Gram-negative bacteria. This raises the important question whether Gram-positive bacteria regulate gene expression in a significantly different way. The goal of this review was to discuss this in more detail by reviewing the role of well-known RNA-binding proteins in Gram-positive bacteria and by highlighting their different behaviours with respect to some of their Gram-negative counterparts. Finally, the second part of this review introduces several unusual RNA-binding proteins of Gram-positive species that we believe could also play an important role in adaptive responses. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Mating patterns influence vulnerability to the extinction vortex
VL  - 26
IS  - 8
SP  - 4226-4239
AB  - Earth's biodiversity is undergoing mass extinction due to anthropogenic compounding of environmental, demographic and genetic stresses. These different stresses can trap populations within a reinforcing feedback loop known as the extinction vortex, in which synergistic pressures build upon one another through time, driving down population viability. Sexual selection, the widespread evolutionary force arising from competition, choice and reproductive variance within animal mating patterns could have vital consequences for population viability and the extinction vortex: (a) if sexual selection reinforces natural selection to fix ‘good genes’ and purge ‘bad genes’, then mating patterns encouraging competition and choice may help protect populations from extinction; (b) by contrast, if mating patterns create load through evolutionary or ecological conflict, then population viability could be further reduced by sexual selection. We test between these opposing theories using replicate populations of the model insect Tribolium castaneum exposed to over 10 years of experimental evolution under monogamous versus polyandrous mating patterns. After a 95-generation history of divergence in sexual selection, we compared fitness and extinction of monogamous versus polyandrous populations through an experimental extinction vortex comprising 15 generations of cycling environmental and genetic stresses. Results showed that lineages from monogamous evolutionary backgrounds, with limited opportunities for sexual selection, showed rapid declines in fitness and complete extinction through the vortex. By contrast, fitness of populations from the history of polyandry, with stronger opportunities for sexual selection, declined slowly, with 60% of populations surviving by the study end. The three vortex stresses of (a) nutritional deprivation, (b) thermal stress and (c) genetic bottlenecking had similar impacts on fitness declines and extinction risk, with an overall sigmoid decline in survival through time. We therefore reveal sexual selection as an important force behind lineages facing extinction threats, identifying the relevance of natural mating patterns for conservation management. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Cues for cavity nesters: investigating relevant zeitgebers for emerging leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata
VL  - 221
IS  - 10
AB  - Photoperiod is considered the universal zeitgeber, regulating physiological processes in numerous animals. However, for animals in light-restricted habitats (e.g. burrows or cavities), thermoperiod may be a more important cue. Our study tested this hypothesis in the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, which nests in cavities and undergoes development within a brood cell. We assessed the role of environmental cues (thermoperiod and photoperiod) on the process of adult emergence by examining: (1) whether those cues direct circadian rhythms, (2) which cue is more dominant and (3) how sensitive developing bees and emergence-ready adults are to cues. Although we found that 20% of light penetrates the brood cell, and bees respond to photoperiod by synchronizing emergence, thermoperiod is the dominant cue. When presented with a conflicting zeitgeber, bees entrained to the thermophase instead of the photophase. When temperature cues were removed, we observed free-running of emergence, indicating that underlying circadian mechanisms can be synchronized by daily fluctuations in temperature. We also found that emerging bees were highly sensitive to even small increases in temperature, entraining to a ramp speed of 0.33°C h−1. The response and sensitivity to temperature cues suggest that M. rotundata evolved a temperature-mediated clock to time emergence from light-restricted cavities. © 2018.

TI  - Neoproterozoic postglacial paleoenvironment and hydrocarbon potential: A review and new insights from the Doushantuo Formation Sichuan Basin, China
VL  - 212
AB  - The Neoproterozoic provides an important record of glacial–postglacial paleoenvironments, organic carbon cycling, and hydrocarbon accumulation. Here, to better understand the environmental, sedimentary, and petroleum geological potential of the Neoproterozoic, we summarize and review research on paleoenvironment and hydrocarbon prospectivity during the era for regions worldwide and also present a case study of the Marinoan postglacial Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation in the Sichuan Basin, upper Yangtze region, China. Sediments that were deposited during the Neoproterozoic postglaciations generally have hydrocarbon-generating potential. In some places, the sediments have reached stages of burial and thermal evolution appropriate for hydrocarbon generation, with some sites having been exploited for commercial production. In the Sichuan Basin, the distribution and thickness of Doushantuo Formation sediments were controlled by glacially eroded topography and/or extension-related subsidence. Abundant organic matter was produced through paleo-productivity (Ba/Al and Cu/Al proxies can reach up to 181.08 and 8.94, respectively) and anoxia (U-EF and Mo-EF proxies can reach up to 5.45 and 14.00, respectively) governed by marine transgression. In South China, many depocenters of the Doushantuo Formation sediments have a strip-shaped geometry in the plane and are expected to be prospective for oil and gas. The reported findings can be used as a reference for further studies of glacial and postglacial deposits with organic matter accumulation of the Neoproterozoic and other periods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Distinct sperm nucleus behaviors between genotypic and temperature-dependent sex determination males are associated with replication and expression-related pathways in a gynogenetic fish
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Coexistence and transition of diverse sex determination strategies have been revealed in some ectothermic species, but the variation between males caused by different sex determination strategies and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. Here, we used the gynogenetic gibel carp (Carassius gibelio) with both genotypic sex determination (GSD) and temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) strategies to illustrate this issue. Results: We found out that males of GSD and TSD in gibel carp had similar morphology, testicular histology, sperm structure and sperm vitality. However, when maternal individuals were mated with males of GSD, sperm nucleus swelling and fusing with the female pronucleus were observed in the fertilized eggs. On the contrary, when maternal individuals were mated with males of TSD, sperm nucleus remained in the condensed status throughout the whole process. Subsequently, semen proteomics analysis unveiled that DNA replication and gene expression-related pathways were inhibited in the sperm from males of TSD compared to males of GSD, and most differentially expressed proteins associated with DNA replication, transcription and translation were down-regulated. Moreover, via BrdU incorporation and immunofluorescence detection, male nucleus replication was revealed to be present in the fertilized eggs by the sperm from males of GSD, but absent in the fertilized eggs by the sperm from males of TSD. Conclusions: These findings indicate that DNA replication and gene expression-related pathways are associated with the distinct sperm nucleus development behaviors in fertilized eggs in response to the sperm from males of GSD and TSD. And this study is the first attempt to screen the differences between males determined via GSD and TSD in gynogenetic species, which might give a hint for understanding evolutionary adaption of diverse sex determination mechanisms in unisexual vertebrates. © 2018 The Author(s).

SP  - 291-307
AB  - Evidence for microbes has been detected in extreme subsurface environments as deep as 2.5 km with temperatures as high as 90 °C, demonstrating that microbes can adapt and survive extreme environmental conditions. Deep subsurface shales are increasingly exploited for their energy applications, thus characterizing the prevalence and role of microbes in these ecosystems essential for understanding biogeochemical cycles and maximizing production from hydrocarbon-bearing formations. Here, we describe the distribution of bacterial ester-linked phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) and diglyceride fatty acids (DGFA) in sidewall cores retrieved from three distinct geologic horizons collected to 2275 m below ground surface in a Marcellus Shale well, West Virginia, USA. We examined the abundance and variety of PLFA and DGFA prior to energy development within and above the Marcellus Shale Formation into the overlying Mahantango Formation of the Appalachian Basin. Lipid biomarkers in the cores suggest the presence of microbial communities comprising Gram (+), Gram (-) as well as stress indicative biomarkers. Microbial PLFA and DGFA degradation in the subsurface can be influenced by stressful environmental conditions associated with the subsurface. The PLFA concentration and variety were higher in the transition zone between the extremely low permeability Marcellus Shale Formation and the more permeable Mahantango Formation. In contrast to this distribution, more abundant and diverse DGFA membrane profiles were associated with the Mahantango Formation. The stress indicative biomarkers like the trans-membrane fatty acids, oxiranes, keto-, and dimethyl lipid fatty acids were present in all cores, potentially indicating that the bacterial communities had experienced physiological stress or nutrient deprivation during or after deposition. The DGFA profiles expressed more stress indicative biomarkers as opposed to the PLFA membrane profiles. These findings suggest the probable presence of indigenous microbial communities in the deep subsurface shale and also improves our understanding of microbial survival mechanisms in ancient deep subsurface environments. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - The thermal–orbital evolution of the Earth–Moon system with a subsurface magma ocean and fossil figure
VL  - 389
AB  - Various theories have been proposed to explain the Moon's current inclined orbit. We test the viability of these theories by reconstructing the thermal–orbital history of the Moon. We build on past thermal–orbital models and incorporate the evolution of the lunar figure including a fossil figure component. Obliquity tidal heating in the lunar magma ocean would have produced rapid inclination damping, making it difficult for an early inclination to survive to the present-day. An early inclination is preserved only if the solid-body of the early Moon were less dissipative than at present. If instabilities at the Laplace plane transition were the source of the inclination, then the Moon had to recede slowly, which is consistent with previous findings of a weakly dissipative early Earth. If collisionless encounters with planetesimals up to 140 Myr after Moon formation excited the inclination, then the Moon had to migrate quickly to pass through the Cassini state transition at 33 Earth radii and reach a period of limited inclination damping. The fossil figure was likely established before 16 Earth radii to match the present-day degree-2 gravity field observations. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Maternal GABAergic and GnRH/corazonin pathway modulates egg diapause phenotype of the silkworm Bombyx mori
VL  - 118
IS  - 1
AB  - Diapause represents a major developmental switch in insects and is a seasonal adaptation that evolved as a specific subtype of dormancy in most insect species to ensure survival under unfavorable environmental conditions and synchronize populations. However, the hierarchical relationship of the molecular mechanisms involved in the perception of environmental signals to integration in morphological, physiological, behavioral, and reproductive responses remains unclear. In the bivoltine strain of the silkworm Bombyx mori, embryonic diapause is induced transgenerationally as a maternal effect. Progeny diapause is determined by the environmental temperature during embryonic development of the mother. Here, we show that the hierarchical pathway consists of a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic and corazonin signaling system modulating progeny diapause induction via diapause hormone release, which may be finely tuned by the temperature-dependent expression of plasma membrane GABA transporter. Furthermore, this signaling pathway possesses similar features to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling system for seasonal reproductive plasticity in vertebrates. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Molecular evidence of intertidal habitats selecting for repeated ice-binding protein evolution in invertebrates
VL  - 225
AB  - Ice-binding proteins (IBPs) have evolved independently in multiple taxonomic groups to improve their survival at sub-zero temperatures. Intertidal invertebrates in temperate and polar regions frequently encounter sub-zero temperatures, yet there is little information on IBPs in these organisms. We hypothesized that there are far more IBPs than are currently known and that the occurrence of freezing in the intertidal zone selects for these proteins. We compiled a list of genome-sequenced invertebrates across multiple habitats and a list of known IBP sequences and used BLAST to identify a wide array of putative IBPs in those invertebrates. We found that the probability of an invertebrate species having an IBP was significantly greater in intertidal species than in those primarily found in open ocean or freshwater habitats. These intertidal IBPs had high sequence similarity to fish and tick antifreeze glycoproteins and fish type II antifreeze proteins. Previously established classifiers based on machine learning techniques further predicted ice-binding activity in the majority of our newly identified putative IBPs. We investigated the potential evolutionary origin of one putative IBP from the hard-shelled mussel Mytilus coruscus and suggest that it arose through gene duplication and neofunctionalization. We show that IBPs likely readily evolve in response to freezing risk and that there is an array of uncharacterized IBPs, and highlight the need for broader laboratory-based surveys of the diversity of ice-binding activity across diverse taxonomic and ecological groups. © 2022.

TI  - Climate vulnerability assessment for Pacific salmon and steelhead in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem
VL  - 14
IS  - 7
AB  - Major ecological realignments are already occurring in response to climate change. To be successful, conservation strategies now need to account for geographical patterns in traits sensitive to climate change, as well as climate threats to species-level diversity. As part of an effort to provide such information, we conducted a climate vulnerability assessment that included all anadromous Pacific salmon and steelhead (Oncorhynchus spp.) population units listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Using an expert-based scoring system, we ranked 20 attributes for the 28 listed units and 5 additional units. Attributes captured biological sensitivity, or the strength of linkages between each listing unit and the present climate; climate exposure, or the magnitude of projected change in local environmental conditions; and adaptive capacity, or the ability to modify phenotypes to cope with new climatic conditions. Each listing unit was then assigned one of four vulnerability categories. Units ranked most vulnerable overall were Chinook (O. tshawytscha) in the California Central Valley, coho (O. kisutch) in California and southern Oregon, sockeye (O. nerka) in the Snake River Basin, and spring-run Chinook in the interior Columbia and Willamette River Basins. We identified units with similar vulnerability profiles using a hierarchical cluster analysis. Life history characteristics, especially freshwater and estuary residence times, inter-played with gradations in exposure from south to north and from coastal to interior regions to generate landscape-level patterns within each species. Nearly all listing units faced high exposures to projected increases in stream temperature, sea surface temperature, and ocean acidification, but other aspects of exposure peaked in particular regions. Anthropogenic factors, especially migration barriers, habitat degradation, and hatchery influence, have reduced the adaptive capacity of most steelhead and salmon populations. Enhancing adaptive capacity is essential to mitigate for the increasing threat of climate change. Collectively, these results provide a framework to support recovery planning that considers climate impacts on the majority of West Coast anadromous salmonids.

TI  - Gut Microbial Composition and Diversity in Four Ophiuroid Species: Divergence Between Suspension Feeder and Scavenger and Their Symbiotic Microbes
VL  - 12
AB  - Gut microbiota have important roles in the survival and adaptation of the host. Ophiuroids, as the worldwide dominant benthos, have ecological roles in benthic–pelagic coupling in the sea floor. However, little is known about the composition and diversity of their gut microbiota and its potential functions in benthic ecosystems. In present study, we preformed 16S rRNA sequencing and function analysis in four dominant species (Stegophiura sladeni, Ophiopholis mirabilis, Ophiura sarsii vadicola, and Ophiura kinbergi) with two feeding types (suspension feeding/herbivores and scavenger/carnivores) from the Yellow Sea, China. Results showed that 56 phyla and 569 genera of microbiota were identified among ophiuroid guts. Multivariate and diversity analyses showed that the ophiuroid gut microbiota were independent and have higher biodiversity to the sediment microbial in the Yellow Sea. Phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Tenericutes, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacteria, with more than 80% abundance among the four ophiuroid species. A comparison among the gut microbial compositions among four ophiuroids showed the similarity of two offshore carnivore ophiuroids (S. sladeni and O. sarsii vadicola) and variation in the dominant microbiota types of three nearshore ophiuroids (S. sladeni, O. mirabilis, and O. kinbergi). The functional analysis revealed the significant differences of the environment-related expression in S. sladeni gut microbiota between nearshore and offshore environments. The Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) functional annotation showed the significant divergence of metabolism pathways between two nearshore species, the herbivores O. mirabilis and carnivores S. sladeni, such as the Lipid metabolism, Carbohydrate metabolism, and Metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. The homolog search and phylogenetic analysis identified the first gut symbiotic Candidatus Hepatoplasma in S. sladeni with important roles for the nutrient metabolisms. Overall, our study reported the comprehensive data of ophiuroid gut microbiota, while the functional microbiome provides insight into the physiology and environmental adaptation in ophiuroids. © Copyright © 2021 Dong, Li, He, Wang, Fan, Zhang, Zhang and Xu.

TI  - In a nutshell, a reciprocal transplant experiment reveals local adaptation and fitness trade-offs in response to urban evolution in an acorn-dwelling ant
VL  - 75
IS  - 4
SP  - 876-887
AB  - Urban-driven evolution is widely evident, but whether these changes confer fitness benefits and thus represent adaptive urban evolution is less clear. We performed a multiyear field reciprocal transplant experiment of acorn-dwelling ants across urban and rural environments. Fitness responses were consistent with local adaptation: we found a survival advantage of the “home” and “local” treatments compared to “away” and “foreign” treatments. Seasonal bias in survival was consistent with evolutionary patterns of gains and losses in thermal tolerance traits across the urbanization gradient. Rural ants in the urban environment were more vulnerable in the summer, putatively due to low heat tolerance, and urban ants in the rural environment were more vulnerable in winter, putatively due to an evolved loss of cold tolerance. The results for fitness via fecundity were also generally consistent with local adaptation, if somewhat more complex. Urban-origin ants produced more alates in their home versus away environment, and rural-origin ants had a local advantage in the rural environment. Overall, the magnitude of local adaptation was lower for urban ants in the novel urban environment compared with rural ants adapted to the ancestral rural environment, adding further evidence that species might not keep pace with anthropogenic change. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Zooplankton body size is filtered by a thermo-oxygenic niche at the regional scale
VL  - 48
IS  - 12
SP  - 2981-2988
AB  - Aim: There is ongoing debate regarding the extent to which body size is selected by the environment. To address this issue, we assessed how thermo-oxygenic conditions select body size of rotifer species composing a regional species pool. Location: Approximately 600 different water bodies in Sweden. Taxon: Rotifers (188 species). Methods: Data were acquired from previously published studies. For the environmental parameters, we conducted principal component analysis (PCA) to recognize the pattern among the species-specific thermal and oxygenic preferences of rotifers of different ecology. We assigned a standard body length to each species. We performed phylogenetically correlated analyses to evaluate the relationships between body length and the parameters that were selected as PCA drivers. Results: Thermal and oxygenic tolerance ranges, designated by the differences between the minimum and maximum of species occurrence, were grouped separately from the optima designated by the conditions referring to the highest species abundance, according to PC1 versus PC2. The parameters representing temperature and oxygen occupied opposite positions on the PC2 axis. Body size selection was driven by both temperature and oxygen, but the cues for this selection differed; species with higher thermal optima were smaller, while species with wider oxygen tolerance ranges were larger. Main conclusion: The body sizes of rotifer species are filtered by both thermal and oxygenic conditions. Selection is driven by tolerance ranges and optima. Oxygenic conditions are as important as thermal conditions in body size selection within a species assemblage. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Chemical evolution of the gas in C-type shocks in dark clouds
VL  - 363
IS  - 7
AB  - A magnetohydrodynamic model of a steady, transverse C-type shock in a dense molecular cloud is presented. A complete gas–grain chemical network is taken into account: the gas-phase chemistry, the adsorption of gas species on dust grains, various desorption mechanisms, the grain surface chemistry, the ion neutralization on dust grains, the sputtering of grain mantles. The population densities of energy levels of ions CI, CII and OI and molecules H2, CO, H2O are computed in parallel with the dynamical and chemical rate equations. The large velocity gradient approximation is used in the line radiative transfer calculations. The simulations consist of two steps: (i) modelling of the chemical and thermal evolution of a static molecular cloud and (ii) shock simulations. A comparison is made with the results of publicly available models of similar physical systems. The focus of the paper is on the chemical processing of gas material and ice mantles of dust grains by the shock. Sputtering of ice mantles takes place in the shock region close to the temperature peak of the neutral gas. At high shock speeds, molecules ejected from ice mantles are effectively destroyed in hot gas, and their survival time is low—of the order of dozens of years. After a passage of high-speed C-type shock, a zone of high abundance of atomic hydrogen appears in the cooling postshock gas that triggers formation of complex organic species such as methanol. It is shown that abundances of some complex organic molecules (COMs) in the postshock region can be much higher than in the preshock gas. These results are important for interpretation of observations of COMs in protostellar outflows. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Evolutionary development: A universal perspective
SP  - 23-92
AB  - This paper offers a general systems definition of the phrase “evolutionary development” and an introduction to its application to autopoetic (self-reproducing) complex systems, including the universe as a system. Evolutionary development, evo devo or ED, is a term that can be used by philosophers, scientists, historians, and others as a replacement for the more general term “evolution,” whenever a scholar thinks experimental, selectionist, stochastic, and contingent or “evolutionary” processes, and also convergent, statistically deterministic (probabilistically predictable), or “developmental” processes, including replication, may be simultaneously contributing to selection and adaptation in any complex system, including the universe as a system. Like living systems, our universe broadly exhibits both contingent and deterministic components, in all historical epochs and at all levels of scale. It has a definite birth and it is inevitably senescing toward heat death. The idea that we live in an “evo devo universe,” one that has self-organized over past replications both to generate multilocal evolutionary variation (experimental diversity) and to convergently develop and pass to future generations selected aspects of its accumulated complexity (“intelligence”), is an obvious hypothesis. Yet today, few cosmologists or physicists, even among theorists of universal replication and the multiverse, have entertained the hypothesis that our universe may be both evolving and developing (engaging in both unpredictable experimentation and goal-driven, teleological, directional change and a replicative life cycle), as in living systems. Our models of universal replication, like Lee Smolin’s cosmological natural selection (CNS), do not yet use the concept of universal development, or refer to development literature. I will argue that some variety of evo devo universe models must emerge in coming years, including models of CNS with Intelligence (CNSI), which explore the ways emergent intelligence can be expected to constrain and direct “natural” selection, as it does in living systems. Evo devo models are one of several early approaches to an Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES), one that explores adaptation in both living and nonliving replicators. They have much to offer as a general approach to adaptive complexity, and may be required to understand several important phenomena under current research, including galaxy formation, the origin of life, the fine-tuned universe hypothesis, possible Earthlike and life fecundity in astrobiology, convergent evolution, the future of artificial intelligence, and our own apparent history of unreasonably smooth and resilient acceleration of both total and “leading edge” adapted complexity and intelligence growth, even under frequent and occasionally extreme past catastrophic selection events. If they are to become better validated in living systems and in nonliving adaptive replicators, including stars, prebiotic chemistry, and the universe as a system, they will require both better simulation capacity and advances in a variety of theories, which I shall briefly review. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

TI  - Flexible polyandry in female flies is an adaptive response to infertile males
VL  - 30
IS  - 6
SP  - 1715-1724
AB  - Infertility is common in nature despite its obvious cost to individual fitness. Rising global temperatures are predicted to decrease fertility, and male sterility is frequently used in attempts to regulate pest or disease vector populations. When males are infertile, females may mate with multiple males to ensure fertilization, and changes in female mating behavior in turn could intensify selection on male fertility. Fertility assurance is a potentially wide-spread explanation for polyandry, but whether and how it actually contributes to the evolution of polyandry is not clear. Moreover, whether a drop in male fertility would lead to a genetic increase in polyandry depends on whether females respond genetically or through behavioral plasticity to male infertility. Here, we experimentally manipulate male fertility through heat-exposure in Drosophila pseudoobscura, and test female discrimination against infertile males before and after mating. Using isogenic lines, we compare the roles of behaviorally plastic versus genetically fixed polyandry. We find that heat-exposed males are less active and attractive, and that females are more likely to remate after mating with these males. Remating rate increases with reduced reproductive output, indicating that females use current sperm storage threshold to make dynamic remating decisions. After remating with fertile males, females restore normal fecundity levels. Our results suggest that male infertility could explain the evolution of adaptively flexible polyandry, but is less likely to cause an increase in genetic polyandry. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Fitness Distance Balance Based LSHADE Algorithm for Energy Hub Economic Dispatch Problem
VL  - 10
SP  - 66770-66796
AB  - This paper presents an improved version of Linear Population Size Reduction Success History Based Adaptive Differential Evolution (LSHADE) algorithm for solving global optimization problems. Fitness Distance Balance (FDB) selection method was used to redesign the mutation operator in order to enhance the search performance of the LSHADE algorithm. In order to test and validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a comprehensive experimental study was carried out. For this purpose, it was tested on the CEC14 and CEC17 benchmark problems, consisting of different problem types and dimensions. Results of the FDB-LSHADE was compared to the performance of 8 other up-to-date and highly preferred metaheuristic search (MHS) algorithms. According to Friedman test results, the proposed FDBLSHADE algorithm ranked first among the all competing algorithms. Moreover, the proposed algorithm was used to solve single- and multi-objective energy hub economic dispatch (EHED) problems, which were a non-convex, a nonlinear, and high dimensional problems. To analyze the results of the proposed algorithm obtained from experimental studies, two non-parametric statistical methods, which are Wilcoxon and Friedman tests, were used. The simulation results of the proposed algorithm were compared to the results of the 8 other MHS algorithms. The results demonstrated that the FDB-LSHADE was a superior performance compared to other MHS algorithms for solving both benchmark and EHED problems. © 2013 IEEE.

TI  - Coupling high-resolution coral bleaching modeling with management practices to identify areas for conservation in a warming climate: Keramashoto National Park (Okinawa Prefecture, Japan)
VL  - 790
AB  - Increases in sea-surface temperature due to global warming are a major threat to tropical and subtropical corals as exposure to high water temperatures is the primary cause of coral bleaching. To continue receiving high ecosystem services from coral reef ecosystems in the future, it is important to predict the growth conditions of corals and take appropriate countermeasures to protect them at both global and local scales. The Kerama Islands (part of the Nansei Islands, Japan) were selected as the study area. The islands have been designated as a national park and attract substantial tourism, which utilizes the coral reef ecosystem. The selected study site is significant as it is known to act as a source of coral larvae for the surrounding area. In this study, coral bleaching and mortality rates under present and +1.5 °C/+2.0 °C water temperature conditions were estimated using a 1) three-dimensional hydrodynamic model with a spatial resolution of 100 m and 2) statistical model describing the relationship between various environmental parameters and coral bleaching and mortality rates. Applying a local hydrodynamic model enabled us to obtain high-resolution spatial and temporal variations in water temperature and current speed, and these data were used to obtain statistical model data. Coral conservation sites were prioritized based on 1) projections of the spatial distribution of bleaching and mortality rates under global warming conditions and 2) locations of the main diving and conservation points, with the intention of continuing the present use and management locations. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the management of coral reef ecosystems through conservation and adaptation strategies at local scales. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Generalist grasshoppers from thermally variable sites do not have higher thermal tolerance than grasshoppers from thermally stable sites - A study of five populations
VL  - 88
AB  - Thermal tolerance allows many organisms, including insects, to withstand stressful temperatures. Thermal generalists are expected to have higher thermal tolerance than specialists, but the environmental conditions leading to the evolution of a thermal generalist life history are not fully understood. Thermal variability has been put forth as an evolutionary driver of high thermal tolerance, but rarely has this been empirically tested. We used a generalist agricultural pest grasshopper, Melanoplus differentialis, to test upper and lower thermal limits of populations that experienced different levels of thermal variability. We quantified thermal heterogeneity at five sites in a longitudinal transect in the Midwestern U.S. by examining, over a 101-year period, 1) variance in daily thermal maxima and minima; and 2) daily range. Also, as a measure of a biologically relevant thermal extreme, we depicted days per month at each site that reached a stressfully high temperature for M. differentialis. We collected individuals from these sites and tested their upper and lower thermal limits. We found that most of our metrics of thermal heterogeneity differed among sites, while all sites experienced an average of at least two stressfully high temperature events per month. We found that heavier males from these sites were able to withstand both warmer and colder temperatures than smaller males, while heavier females had no thermal advantage over lighter females. However, site of origin had no effect on thermal tolerance. Our findings indicate three things: 1) there is no clear correlation between thermal variability and thermal tolerance in the populations we studied; 2) weight affects thermal tolerance range among sites for M. differentialis males, and 3) thermal extremes may be more important than thermal variability in determining CTMax in this species. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - A differential transcriptional profile by Culex quinquefasciatus larvae resistant to Lysinibacillus sphaericus IAB59 highlights genes and pathways associated with the resistance phenotype
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: The study of the mechanisms by which larvae of the Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito survive exposure to the entomopathogen Lysinibacillus sphaericus has benefited substantially from the generation of laboratory-selected colonies resistant to this bacterium. One such colony, RIAB59, was selected after regular long-term exposure of larvae to the L. sphaericus IAB59 strain. This strain is characterized by its ability to produce the well known Binary (Bin) toxin, and the recently characterized Cry48Aa/Cry49Aa toxin, able to kill Bin-resistant larvae. Resistance to Bin is associated with the depletion of its receptor, Cqm1 α-glucosidase, from the larvae midgut. This study aimed to identify novel molecules and pathways associated with survival of the RIAB59 larvae and the resistance phenotype. Methods: A transcriptomic approach and bioinformatic tools were used to compare the profiles derived from the midguts of larvae resistant and susceptible to L. sphaericus IAB59. Results: The RNA-seq profiles identified 1355 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 673 down- and 682 upregulated transcripts. One of the most downregulated DEGs was cqm1, which validates the approach. Other strongly downregulated mRNAs encode the enzyme pantetheinase, apolipoprotein D, lipases, heat-shock proteins and a number of lesser known and hypothetical polypeptides. Among the upregulated DEGs, the top most encodes a peroxisomal enzyme involved in lipid metabolism, while others encode enzymes associated with juvenile hormone synthesis, ion channels, DNA binding proteins and defense polypeptides. Further analyses confirmed a strong downregulation of several enzymes involved in lipid catabolism while the assignment of DEGs into metabolic pathways highlighted the upregulation of those related to DNA synthesis and maintenance, confirmed by their clustering into related protein networks. Several other pathways were also identified with mixed profiles of down- and upregulated transcripts. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the changes in levels seen for selected mRNAs. Conclusions: Our transcriptome-wide dataset revealed that the RIAB59 colony, found to be substantially more resistant to Bin than to the Cry48Aa/Cry49Aa toxin, developed a differential expression profile as well as metabolic features co-selected during the long-term adaptation to IAB59 and that are most likely linked to Bin resistance.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Multiple anthropogenic stressors in the Galápagos Islands' complex social–ecological system: Interactions of marine pollution, fishing pressure, and climate change with management recommendations
AB  - For decades, multiple anthropogenic stressors have threatened the Galápagos Islands. Widespread marine pollution such as oil spills, persistent organic pollutants, metals, and ocean plastic pollution has been linked to concerning changes in the ecophysiology and health of Galápagos species. Simultaneously, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing are reshaping the composition and structure of endemic and native Galápagos pelagic communities. In this novel review, we discuss the impact of anthropogenic pollutants and their associated ecotoxicological implications for Galápagos species in the face of climate change stressors. We emphasize the importance of considering fishing pressure and marine pollution, in combination with climate-change impacts, when assessing the evolutionary fitness of species inhabiting the Galápagos. For example, the survival of endemic marine iguanas has been negatively affected by organic hydrocarbons introduced via oil spills, and endangered Galápagos sea lions exhibit detectable concentrations of DDT, triggering potential feminization effects and compromising the species' survival. During periods of ocean warming (El Niño events) when endemic species undergo nutritional stress, climate change may increase the vulnerability of these species to the impacts of pollutants, resulting in the species reaching its population tipping point. Marine plastics are emerging as a deleterious and widespread threat to endemic species. The Galápagos is treasured for its historical significance and its unparalleled living laboratory and display of evolutionary processes; however, this unique and iconic paradise will remain in jeopardy until multidisciplinary and comprehensive preventative management plans are put in place to mitigate and eliminate the effects of anthropogenic stressors facing the islands today. We present a critical analysis and synthesis of anthropogenic stressors with some progress from local and international institutional efforts and call to action more precautionary measures along with new management philosophies focused on understanding the processes of change through research to champion the conservation of the Galápagos.

VL  - 48

SP  - 174-186
AB  - Apis mellifera intermissa is the native honey bee subspecies of Algeria, and approximates a position among bee races between tropical African and European breeds. This bee is very aggressive, nervous, and produces many broods with many queen cells. It is prone to swarming and exhibits defensive behavior and an abundant use of propolis. In the present study, pure line samples of A. m. intermissa collected from Blida (Algeria; 36°31′N, 2°58′E) with preferable Varroa resistance confirmed their through hygienic cleaning behavior and high temperature adaptation, were selected as a reference sample for full-genome sequencing. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was also performed on the same samples to validate genomic variations. These analyses will be an important source of information for the honey bee research community worldwide. The 240-Mb genome was annotated with 26 355 transcripts and analyzed. Analysis of 133 pathways indicated an abundance of pathways related to metabolic processes, the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and biodegradation of xenobiotics. In addition to simple sequence repeat markers, variant analysis for beneficial trait genes, transposons, and phylogeny was performed. The mitochondrial genome and genes involved in immunity and chemoreception were identified and compared with those from other sequenced insect models. The indels obtained by sequencing were validated by aCGH. The genome sequence, annotation, and analysis of A. m. intermissa provides new understanding of the function of bee genes, and comparison with the genome of other A. mellifera subspecies promises to yield insights into the evolution of the adaptations to high temperature and resistance to Varroa parasite infestation. © 2018 The Entomological Society of Korea and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

TI  - Genetic Diversity and Structure of Tropical Porites lutea Populations Highlight Their High Adaptive Potential to Environmental Changes in the South China Sea
VL  - 9
AB  - Global climate change and anthropogenic disturbance have significantly degraded biodiversity in coral reef ecosystems. The genetic potential and adaptability of corals are key factors used to predict the fate of global coral reefs under climate change. In this study, we used eight microsatellite loci to study the patterns of reproduction, genetic diversity, and genetic structure of 302 Porites lutea samples across 13° latitudes in the South China Sea (8.8644°N–22.6117°N). The results indicated that P. lutea reproduces largely via sexual reproduction on scales of 5 m and greater and has abundant gene diversity. Additionally, the tropical populations harbored high genetic diversity (based on alleles, effective number of alleles, gene diversity, and heterozygosity). In contrast, genetic diversity was lower in subtropical coral populations. Genetic variation values and pairwise FST revealed that tropical and subtropical populations had significantly different genetic structures. Finally, the Mantel tests showed that the genetic differentiation and genetic variation of P. lutea were strongly correlated with sea surface temperature and slightly correlated with geographical distance. These results indicated that tropical P. lutea populations have high genetic potential and adaptability because of their sexual reproduction and genetic diversity, giving them a greater capacity to cope with climate change. Subtropical coral populations showed lower genetic diversity and, thus, relatively poor genetic resilience in response to low average sea surface temperature and human activities. Our study provides a theoretical basis for the protection and restoration of coral reefs. Copyright © 2022 Luo, Huang, Yu, Li, Chen, Huang and Qin.

TI  - Geographic variation in offspring size: Long- and short-term climate affect mean seed mass of Streptanthus populations
VL  - 103
IS  - 7
AB  - Offspring size is a key functional trait that can affect subsequent life history stages; in many species, it exhibits both local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. Variation among populations in offspring size may be explained by various factors, including local climatic conditions. However, geographic variation in climate may be partitioned into long-term and interannual sources of variation, which may differ in their effects on population mean offspring size. To assess environmental correlates of offspring size, we evaluated geographic variation in seed mass among 88 populations representing 6 species of Streptanthus (Brassicaceae) distributed across a broad climatic gradient in California. We examined the effects of temperature-mediated growing season length and precipitation on population mean seed mass to determine whether it is best explained by (1) long-term mean climatic conditions; (2) interannual climate anomalies (i.e., deviations in climate from long-term means) during the year of seed development, or (3) interactions between climate variables. Both long-term mean climate and climate anomalies in the year of collection were associated with population mean seed mass, but their effects differed in direction and magnitude. Relatively large seeds were produced at chronically wet sites but also during drier-than-average years. This contrast indicates that these associations may be generated by different mechanisms (i.e., adaptive evolution vs. phenotypic plasticity) and may be evidence of countergradient plasticity in seed mass. In addition, populations occurring in locations characterized by relatively long growing seasons produced comparatively large seeds, particularly among chronically dry sites. This study highlights the need to consider that the responses of seed mass to long-term versus recent climatic conditions may differ and that climate variables may interact to predict seed mass. Such considerations are especially important when using these patterns to forecast the long- and short-term responses of seed mass to climate change. The results presented here also contribute to our broader understanding of how climate drives long-term (e.g., local adaptation) and short-term (e.g., phenotypic plasticity) variation in functional traits, such as offspring size across landscapes. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Forecasting future recruitment success for Atlantic cod in the warming and acidifying Barents Sea
VL  - 24
IS  - 1
SP  - 526-535
AB  - Productivity of marine fish stocks is known to be affected by environmental and ecological drivers, and global climate change is anticipated to alter recruitment success of many stocks. While the direct effects of environmental drivers on fish early life stage survival can be quantified experimentally, indirect effects in marine ecosystems and the role of adaptation are still highly uncertain. We developed an integrative model for the effects of ocean warming and acidification on the early life stages of Atlantic cod in the Barents Sea, termed SCREI (Simulator of Cod Recruitment under Environmental Influences). Experimental results on temperature and CO2 effects on egg fertilization, egg and larval survival and development times are incorporated. Calibration using empirical time series of egg production, temperature, food and predator abundance reproduces age-0 recruitment over three decades. We project trajectories of recruitment success under different scenarios and quantify confidence limits based on variation in experiments. A publicly accessible web version of the SCREI model can be run under www.oceanchange.uni-bremen.de/;SCREI. Severe reductions in average age-0 recruitment success of Barents Sea cod are projected under uncompensated warming and acidification toward the middle to end of this century. Although high population stochasticity was found, considerable rates of evolutionary adaptation to acidification and shifts in organismal thermal windows would be needed to buffer impacts on recruitment. While increases in food availability may mitigate short-term impacts, an increase in egg production achieved by stock management could provide more long-term safety for cod recruitment success. The SCREI model provides a novel integration of multiple driver effects in different life stages and enables an estimation of uncertainty associated with interindividual and ecological variation. The model thus helps to advance toward an improved empirical foundation for quantifying climate change impacts on marine fish recruitment, relevant for ecosystem-based assessments of marine systems under climate change. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Individual-based population genomics reveal different drivers of adaptation in sympatric fish
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Connectivity and local adaptation are two contrasting evolutionary forces highly influencing population structure. To evaluate the impact of early-life traits and environmental conditions on genetic structuring and adaptation, we studied two sympatric fish species in the Western Mediterranean Sea: Symphodus tinca and S. ocellatus. We followed an individual-based approach and measured early-life history traits from otolith readings, gathered information on environmental variables and obtained genome-wide markers from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). The two species presented contrasting population structure across the same geographic gradient, with high and significant population differentiation in S. ocellatus, mostly determined by oceanographic fronts, and low differentiation and no front effect in S. tinca. Despite their different levels of genetic differentiation, we identified in both species candidate regions for local adaptation by combining outlier analysis with environmental and phenotypic association analyses. Most candidate loci were associated to temperature and productivity in S. ocellatus and to temperature and turbulence in S. tinca suggesting that different drivers may determine genomic diversity and differentiation in each species. Globally, our study highlights that individual-based approach combining genomic, environmental and phenotypic information is key to identify signals of selection and the processes mediating them. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - Effect of environmental temperature on body temperature during reproductive period and embryonic development in different geographic populations of Rana dybowskii
VL  - 38
IS  - 8
SP  - 2965-2973
AB  - How global warming affects amphibians is a current hot topic because temperature is the most important and variable climatic factor that affects many biological processes and is strongly related with temporal variation. Amphibians are ectotherms, which means that they receive heat from external sources and can control their temperature through their bodies or behavior. The Dybowski's frog (Rana dybowskii) is a cold-resistant species found in Northeast Asia with an extensive geographic variation in life-history traits. In this paper, the specimens were taken from Yichun, Baishan, and Shangzhi to measure body temperature and embryonic development speed. The results showed that body temperature was positively correlated with environmental temperature, and that heat increased the rate of growth, while cold temperature slowed it. The species showed higher selected body temperature, stronger temperature regulation ability, and faster embryo development speed in the hot environment than in the cold environment. There were significant differences among the three geographic populations of R. dybowskii in the selected body temperature. The crossing point temperature at which the linear regression equation intersects with isothermal line (y = x) was the lowest in the Yichun population (18.51 °C for males and 21.74X1 for females), and was the highest in the Shangzhi population (20.00°C for males and 23.06°C for females). The body temperature of the Yichun population was the lowest, while that of the Shangzhi population was the highest among the three populations under the low temperature conditions (8-22°C for males and 8-26°C for females). In contrast, body temperature of the Yichun population was the highest, while that of the Shangzhi population was the lowest under high temperature conditions (24-30°C for males and 28-30°C for females). Thermoregulation ability of the Shangzhi population was the strongest, followed by the Baishan population, and the Yichun population was the weakest among the three populations. The embryonic development time of the Shangzhi, Baishan, and Yichun populations increased successively and the gaps among the three populations were becoming increasingly obvious with the development of embryos. The development completion time of different stages was not reduced in proportion with the increasing of ambient temperature. The second and third stage of embryonic development, and the 21st phase (mouth open stage) of fourth stage were significantly shortened. This indicates that different embryo development stages have different sensitivity to temperature, and that heating can accelerate the developmental rate during certain developmental periods of this species. Thus, tadpoles and developing frogs are more susceptible to temperature than adults. This may lead to changes in morphological structure and functions in some organs. In summary, body temperature and embryonic development are different among the three geographic populations of R. dybowskii, which is a type of adaptive evolution to the environment. The temperature rise has an effect on all populations under the background of global warming. We conclude that different geographic populations have different adaptation strategies to cope with the change of environmental temperature. This study provides a basis for the artificial breeding of amphibians and the adaptation mechanism to climate change in the future. © 2018 Science Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparative genomics of exiguobacterium reveals what makes a cosmopolitan bacterium
VL  - 6
IS  - 4
AB  - Although the strategies used by bacteria to adapt to specific environmental conditions are widely reported, fewer studies have addressed how microbes with a cosmopolitan distribution can survive in diverse ecosystems. Exiguobacterium is a versatile genus whose members are commonly found in various habitats. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the universality of Exiguobacterium, we collected 105 strains from diverse environments and performed large-scale metabolic and adaptive ability tests. We found that most Exiguobacterium members have the capacity to survive under wide ranges of temperature, salinity, and pH. According to phylogenetic and average nucleotide identity analyses, we identified 27 putative species and classified two genetic groups: Groups I and II. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the Exiguobacterium members utilize a variety of complex polysaccharides and proteins to support survival in diverse environments and also employ a number of chaperonins and transporters for this purpose. We observed that the group I species can be found in more diverse terrestrial environments and have a larger genome size than the group II species. Our analyses revealed that the expansion of transporter families drove genomic expansion in group I strains, and we identified 25 transporter families, many of which are involved in the transport of important substrates and resistance to environmental stresses and are enriched in group I strains. This study provides important insights into both the overall general genetic basis for the cosmopolitan distribution of a bacterial genus and the evolutionary and adaptive strategies of Exiguobacterium. © 2021 Zhang et al.

TI  - Effect of acclimation on thermal limits and hsp70 gene expression of the New Zealand sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus
VL  - 250
AB  - Seawater temperature is projected to increase globally due to climate change, affecting physiological responses, fitness and survival of marine organisms. Thermal tolerance studies are critical to determine the ability of animals to adapt to future environmental conditions. In this study, we aimed to determine if the thermal limits of the New Zealand Evechinus chloroticus would shift with animal's thermal history. We tested the effect of six thermal regimes on the righting ability, temperature of loss of righting (T-LOR), median lethal temperature (LT50), lethal temperature (LT) and the gene expression of the heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) of the New Zealand sea urchin E. chloroticus when exposed to a thermal shock of 1 degrees C day(-1) (duration of 7-16 days depending on the treatment). Treatments consisted of laboratory acclimation for one and four weeks to 18 degrees C and 24 degrees C (mean winter (15 degrees C) and summer temperature (21 degrees C) + 3 degrees C of warming, respectively), compared to non-acclimated sea urchins collected during winter (14.6 degrees C) and summer seasons (20.4 degrees C). Thermal history did not have a significant effect on the righting ability of E. chloroticus (T-LOR ranged between 28 and 29 degrees C for all treatments) and LT50 (ranged between 29 and 30 degrees C for all treatments). However, LT of E. chloroticus collected during winter season was significantly lower than animals acclimated for one week at 18 degrees C. Maximum expression of hsp70 mRNA (T-max) was observed at around 27-28 degrees C regardless of treatment; however, relative hsp70 mRNA levels were significantly higher in animals acclimated for four weeks at 24 degrees C. Despite proving to be a thermotolerant species with LTs around 30 degrees C, E. chloroticus was unable to increase thermal tolerance and Tmax when acclimated to high temperatures, suggesting that E. chloroticus may have a limited adaptive capacity to modify its phenotype; however, evolutionary adaptations may allow E. chloroticus to adapt to future ocean temperatures.

VL  - 46
IS  - 4
SP  - 790-799
AB  - 1. Invasive species present unique natural experiments through which to study evolutionary processes associated with spatial spread, especially with respect to rapid morphological evolution of dispersal-related traits. 2. The kudzu bug, Megacopta cribraria (Fabricius), established and expanded radially across the southeastern United States beginning in 2009. Here, M. cribraria is used as a model for studying rapid morphological change across an introduced range. 3. Kudzu bugs were collected throughout the invasive range to test the hypothesis that body and wing size would increase with greater distance from the invasion source owing to dispersal-related selection. The effects of sex, local temperature, and latitude were also evaluated to investigate how such factors might influence body and wing size across this range expansion. 4. Females were significantly larger than males across all traits. Distance from the invasion core, temperature, and their interaction significantly influenced body size and wing length, suggesting that M. cribraria were larger near the invasion periphery. This was especially pronounced at cooler sites. Sex and distance were found to both weakly influence wing length after removing the effect of body size, suggesting that wing size may be disproportionally larger along the invasion front. 5. The combined results indicate that a combination of spatial, environmental, and sexual factors must be considered when examining or predicting invasive species responses to new selective pressures and environments. © 2021 The Royal Entomological Society

TI  - A multi-staged niched evolutionary approach for allocating parallel tasks with joint optimization of performance, energy, and temperature
VL  - 134
SP  - 65-74
AB  - This paper presents a multi-stage multi-objective evolutionary approach (MS-MOEA) for allocating parallel computations on multi-core processors by joint optimizing performance (P), energy (E), and temperature (T). Evolutionary techniques have been shown to be effective for solving optimization problems, including our own previous work on solving the PET-optimized scheduling (PETOS) problem. There have long been a great many debates and rivalries between various evolutionary approaches, such as the SPEA or NSGA, with regard to their relative matters. The novelty of the proposed MS-MOEA approach is its amalgamation of the basic evolutionary algorithms that are already shown to be highly effective, thereby creating a niche of these techniques. The niche takes advantages of the strengths of each baseline technique for achieving additional enhancement in the precision of the optimization. We propose six multi-stage hybrids, each designed with either niched fitness assignment strategy, or combining populations from multiple MOEAs, or incorporating the problem knowledge into the conventional technique. The experimental results measure the quality of resulting Pareto fronts and demonstrate that the proposed MS-MOEAs yield better optimization for the PETOS problem in achieving three-objective in parallel task-to-core mapping.

AB  - While fish reproduction has played a critical role in development of life-history theory, the collective effects of a marine-to-freshwater invasion on a clade's reproductive ecology have rarely been explored in a phylogenetic context. We analysed and compared a range of quantitative and qualitative components of reproductive ecology in the Australasian terapontid fishes, a family distributed widely across marine, estuarine and freshwater habitats in the Indo-Pacific region. We specifically tested hypotheses that life-history strategies such as larger egg sizes and reduced fecundities are a key characteristic of freshwater species in comparison with their close marine relatives, and also fit a range of currently available evolutionary models describing the processes of ecomorphological and macrohabitat-related diversification. Using recently developed phylogenetic comparative methods, differences in several quantitative reproductive traits were evident between marine and freshwater species, with reductions in average fecundity and increases in average egg size specifically characterising freshwater species. Evolutionary modelling of major trait axes, as well as specific traits across the family, highlighted significant increases in rates of evolutionary diversification across both freshwater lineages and within freshwater subclades. Modelling also supported the evolution of distinctive morpho-ecotype optima between marine and freshwater species over simpler models of random-walk evolution or single morphological optima. Review of life-history behaviour identified environmental stimuli related to photoperiod, temperature, and lunar-tidal cycles (and possibly combinations thereof) as playing an important role in stimulating spawning behaviour in most marine–euryhaline species. While some of these variables (temperature and photoperiod) continue to play an important role in some freshwater species, flow regime, particularly streamflow increases, appear more important in stimulating spawning responses, underlining the role of flow regime emerging as a master variable shaping evolutionary trajectories in freshwater clades. In this review and meta-analysis, we document that adaptation to an entirely freshwater existence has catalysed significant, and in several cases, relatively rapid adaptive evolution to very different life-history strategies within freshwater species. The invasion of freshwaters has had profound impacts on the trajectory of terapontid life-history evolution, driving significant changes in a range of traits relating to fecundity, egg size, spawning stimuli, and spawning substratum. Collective results suggest a distinct adaptive landscape difference between marine and freshwaters. Terapontids can provide a useful model for assessing the consistency of these outcomes with other freshwater-invading groups. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - FSHR-1/GPCR regulates the mitochondrial unfolded protein response in Caenorhabditis elegans
VL  - 213
IS  - 4
SP  - 409-418
AB  - The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is an evolutionarily conserved adaptive response that functions to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis following mitochondrial damage. In C. elegans, the nervous system plays a central role in responding to mitochondrial stress by releasing endocrine signals that act upon distal tissues to activate the UPRmt. The mechanisms by which mitochondrial stress is sensed by neurons and transmitted to distal tissues is not fully understood. Here, we identify a role for the conserved follicle-stimulating hormone G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), FSHR-1, in promoting UPRmt activation. Genetic deficiency of fshr-1 severely attenuates UPRmt activation and organism-wide survival in response to mitochondrial stress. FSHR-1 functions in a common genetic pathway with SPHK-1/sphingosine kinase to promote UPRmt activation, and FSHR-1 regulates the mitochondrial association of SPHK-1 in the intestine. Through tissue-specific rescue assays, we show that FSHR-1 functions in neurons to activate the UPRmt, to promote mitochondrial association of SPHK-1 in the intestine, and to promote organism-wide survival in response to mitochondrial stress. We propose that FSHR-1 functions cell non-autonomously in neurons to activate UPRmt upstream of SPHK-1 signaling in the intestine. © 2019 Genetics Society of America. All rights reserved.

TI  - Does caching strategy vary with microclimate in endangered Mt. Graham red squirrels?
VL  - 14
IS  - 11
AB  - Food hoarding is a common behavior used by a variety of animals to cope with periods of low food availability. At the retreating edge of species’ distribution, the stressful environment and unfavourable climate conditions may impose severe costs on hoarding behavior. Since relict populations are hotspots for evolution and adaptation, and considering that food hoarding behavior has a strong evolutionary basis, we decided to evaluate the occurrence of behavioral variability in the amount of food cached by the endangered Mount Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus fremonti grahamensis). We tested the variation in cache size in response to microclimate, soil relief, vegetation, food availability and squirrel sex. The number of pits excavated by squirrels to cache cones was used as a proxy of cache size and was affected by mountain slope aspect and density of trees. More pits were excavated in the northeast facing slopes. The density of trees negatively affects the cache volume on southwest slopes, but not on northeast slopes. The sex of the resident squirrel also affects the number of pits in the squirrel midden, with males excavating 47% more pits than females. Males and females also presented different responses to the mountain slope aspect, with females excavating more pits on northeastern slopes than on southwestern slopes, whereas male cache size did not vary with the slope aspect. Finally, the squirrel’s caching behavior did not vary in response to midden microclimate variation, a result with possible implications for the survival of the Mt Graham red squirrels, given the predicted temperature increases in the region due to climate change. © 2019 Pereira Mendes, Koprowski.

TI  - Fate of faecal pathogen indicators during faecal sludge composting with different bulking agents in tropical climate
VL  - 232
AB  - In recent years, composting has increasingly been promoted as a reliable method for sanitizing Faecal Sludge (FS) from onsite sanitation systems, particularly where there are opportunities to use the recovered nutrients in agriculture. However, there remain gaps in our understanding of the fate of infectious faecal pathogens during composting, particularly in tropical climates. This study investigated the influence of different locally available bulking agents on the inactivation efficiency of composting by tracking the fate of four key indicator organisms (E. coli, Salmonella spp., Enterococci spp., and viable helminth eggs). Dewatered FS was mixed with different bulking agents - i.e. Sawdust (SD), Coffee husks (CH) and Brewery waste (BW). Compost piles of FS:SD, FS:CH, and FS:BW in a volumetric ratio of 1:2 were set-up in duplicate (3 m3 each), composted on a pilot scale and monitored weekly for the survival of pathogen indicators for a period of 15 weeks. The study findings suggest that the different bulking agents have a statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) effect on the temperature evolution and survival of pathogen indicators in compost. CH was the most suitable bulking agent for composting with FS as piles containing CH exhibited higher pathogen inactivation efficiency and shorter inactivation periods of 6 weeks compared to 8 weeks for SD and BW piles. Time-temperature was the most important factor responsible for pathogen inactivation. However, other mechanisms such as indigenous microbial and toxic by-products such as NH4+-N also played an important role in the inactivation of pathogens. The results suggest that co-composting of FS with a sawdust, coffee husk or brewery waste for 8 weeks with thermophilic temperatures of about 48–60 °C sustained in the composting piles for more than 38 days, using 7 days turning frequency, is sufficient to ensure complete sanitization of FS before reuse in agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - CM2Mc-LPJmL v1.0: Biophysical coupling of a process-based dynamic vegetation model with managed land to a general circulation model
VL  - 14
IS  - 6
SP  - 4117-4141
AB  - The terrestrial biosphere is exposed to land-use and climate change, which not only affects vegetation dynamics but also changes land-atmosphere feedbacks. Specifically, changes in land cover affect biophysical feedbacks of water and energy, thereby contributing to climate change. In this study, we couple the well-established and comprehensively validated dynamic global vegetation model LPJmL5 (Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land) to the coupled climate model CM2Mc, the latter of which is based on the atmosphere model AM2 and the ocean model MOM5 (Modular Ocean Model 5), and name it CM2Mc-LPJmL. In CM2Mc, we replace the simple land-surface model LaD (Land Dynamics; where vegetation is static and prescribed) with LPJmL5, and we fully couple the water and energy cycles using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Flexible Modeling System (FMS). Several improvements to LPJmL5 were implemented to allow a fully functional biophysical coupling. These include a sub-daily cycle for calculating energy and water fluxes, conductance of the soil evaporation and plant interception, canopy-layer humidity, and the surface energy balance in order to calculate the surface and canopy-layer temperature within LPJmL5. Exchanging LaD with LPJmL5 and, therefore, switching from a static and prescribed vegetation to a dynamic vegetation allows us to model important biospheric processes, including fire, mortality, permafrost, hydrological cycling and the impacts of managed land (crop growth and irrigation). Our results show that CM2Mc-LPJmL has similar temperature and precipitation biases to the original CM2Mc model with LaD. The performance of LPJmL5 in the coupled system compared to Earth observation data and to LPJmL offline simulation results is within acceptable error margins. The historical global mean temperature evolution of our model setup is within the range of CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) models. The comparison of model runs with and without land-use change shows a partially warmer and drier climate state across the global land surface. CM2Mc-LPJmL opens new opportunities to investigate important biophysical vegetation-climate feedbacks with a state-of-the-art and process-based dynamic vegetation model. © Authors 2021

TI  - New Evidence of Tiger Subspecies Differentiation and Environmental Adaptation: Comparison of the Whole Genomes of the Amur Tiger and the South China Tiger
VL  - 12
IS  - 14
AB  - Panthera tigris is a top predator that maintains the integrity of forest ecosystems and is an integral part of biodiversity. No more than 400 Amur tigers (P. t. altaica) are left in the wild, whereas the South China tiger (P. t. amoyensis) is thought to be extinct in the wild, and molecular biology has been widely used in conservation and management. In this study, the genetic information of Amur tigers and South China tigers was studied by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). A total of 647 Gb of high-quality clean data was obtained. There were 6.3 million high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), among which most (66.3%) were located in intergenic regions, with an average of 31.72% located in coding sequences. There were 1.73 million insertion-deletions (InDels), among which there were 2438 InDels (0.10%) in the coding region, and 270 thousand copy number variations (CNVs). Significant genetic differences were found between the Amur tiger and the South China tiger based on a principal component analysis and phylogenetic tree. The linkage disequilibrium analysis showed that the linkage disequilibrium attenuation distance of the South China tiger and the Amur tiger was almost the same, whereas the r2 of the South China tiger was 0.6, and the r2 of the Amur tiger was 0.4. We identified functional genes and regulatory pathways related to reproduction, disease, predation, and metabolism and characterized functional genes related to survival in the wild, such as smell, vision, muscle, and predatory ability. The data also provide new evidence for the adaptation of Amur tigers to cold environments. PRKG1 is involved in temperature regulation in a cold climate. FOXO1 and TPM4 regulate body temperature to keep it constant. Our results can provide genetic support for precise interspecies conservation and management planning in the future. © 2022 by the authors.

VL  - 36

SP  - 367-373
AB  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is most commonly diagnosed at an early (T1a) stage and is typically amenable to several effective treatments. The current gold standard therapy is partial nephrectomy, given its decreased morbidity and similar oncologic outcomes when compared with radical nephrectomy. Thermal ablation is an evolving definitive therapy for T1a RCC which is even less invasive than partial nephrectomy. This article reviews the evidence for thermal ablation in the treatment of T1a RCC and compares outcomes of existing ablation modalities with surgical management. © 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag.

TI  - From depth to regional spatial genetic differentiation of Eunicella cavolini in the NW Mediterranean
VL  - 341
IS  - 9
SP  - 421-432
AB  - Connectivity studies in the marine realm are of great importance to understand the evolutionary potential of populations in a context of growing pressures on the marine environment. Here, we investigated the effect of the local, regional, and depth spatial scale on the population genetic structure of the yellow gorgonian Eunicella cavolini, one of the most common octocoral species of the Mediterranean hard-bottom communities. This species, along with other sessile metazoans typical of coralligenous ecosystems, plays an important role in supporting biodiversity, but is also impacted by direct and indirect consequences of human activities, such as physical destruction or mortality events due to thermal anomalies. Samples were taken from 15 sites located in the Ligurian Sea (NW Mediterranean) in two adjacent regions 100 kilometres apart, i.e. from the areas of Marseille (France) and Portofino (Genoa, Italy), and were analysed using six microsatellite loci. A pattern of isolation by distance was observed at the regional as well as the local scales. Although E. cavolini showed less genetic structure than other Mediterranean octocorallian species, we observed a significant genetic differentiation between populations a few kilometres apart. A low genetic differentiation was also observed between shallow and deep populations. The occurrence of genetically differentiated populations of E. cavolini at the scale of kilometres has important consequences for the management of this species and of the associated communities.

TI  - Timing of increased temperature sensitivity coincides with nervous system development in winter moth embryos
VL  - 224
IS  - 17
AB  - Climate change is rapidly altering the environment and many species will need to genetically adapt their seasonal timing to keep up with these changes. Insect development rate is largely influenced by temperature, but we know little about the mechanisms underlying the temperature sensitivity of development. Here, we investigate seasonal timing of egg hatching in the winter moth, one of the few species which has been found to genetically adapt to climate change, likely through selection on temperature sensitivity of egg development rate. To study when during development winter moth embryos are most sensitive to changes in ambient temperature, we gave eggs an increase or decrease in temperature at different moments during their development. We measured their developmental progression and time of egg hatching, and used fluorescence microscopy to construct a timeline of embryonic development for the winter moth. We found that egg development rate responded more strongly to temperature once embryos were in the fully extended germband stage. This is the phylotypic stage at which all insect embryos have developed a rudimentary nervous system. Furthermore, at this stage, timing of ecdysone signaling determines developmental progression, which could act as an environment dependent gateway. Intriguingly, this may suggest that, from the phylotypic stage onward, insect embryos can start to integrate internal and environmental stimuli to actively regulate important developmental processes. As we found evidence that there is genetic variation for temperature sensitivity of egg development rate in our study population, such regulation could be a target of selection imposed by climate change. © 2021 Company of Biologists Ltd.

TI  - Hot and dry conditions predict shorter nestling telomeres in an endangered songbird: Implications for population persistence
VL  - 119
IS  - 25
AB  - Climate warming is increasingly exposing wildlife to sublethal high temperatures, which may lead to chronic impacts and reduced fitness. Telomere length (TL) may link heat exposure to fitness, particularly at early-life stages, because developing organisms are especially vulnerable to adverse conditions, adversity can shorten telomeres, and TL predicts fitness. Here, we quantify how climatic and environmental conditions during early life are associated with TL in nestlings of wild purple-crowned fairy-wrens (Malurus coronatus), endangered songbirds of the monsoonal tropics. We found that higher average maximum air temperature (range 31 to 45 °C) during the nestling period was associated with shorter early-life TL. This effect was mitigated by water availability (i.e., during the wet season, with rainfall), but independent of other pertinent environmental conditions, implicating a direct effect of heat exposure. Models incorporating existing information that shorter early-life TL predicts shorter lifespan and reduced fitness showed that shorter TL under projected warming scenarios could lead to population decline across plausible future water availability scenarios. However, if TL is assumed to be an adaptive trait, population viability could be maintained through evolution. These results are concerning because the capacity to change breeding phenology to coincide with increased water availability appears limited, and the evolutionary potential of TL is unknown. Thus, sublethal climate warming effects early in life may have repercussions beyond individual fitness, extending to population persistence. Incorporating the delayed reproductive costs associated with sublethal heat exposure early in life is necessary for understanding future population dynamics with climate change.

TI  - Ips typographus and Dendroctonus ponderosae Models Project Thermal Suitability for Intra- and Inter-Continental Establishment in a Changing Climate
VL  - 2
AB  - Climate change is altering legacies of native insect-caused disturbances and contributing to non-native invasions globally. Many insect fitness traits are temperature dependent and projected climatic changes are expected to cause continued alterations in insect-caused tree mortality, with uncertain consequences for forest ecosystems and their management. Dendroctonus ponderosae in Pinus habitats of western North America and Ips typographus in European Picea are among the most significant tree mortality agents on each continent. Changing climate is influencing both species in their native habitats, although thermal suitability if they should invade new continents and novel forest habitats has not been investigated. We assessed thermal suitability for intra- and inter-continental establishment using physiological models that describe evolved, temperature-dependent traits of each species. Models were driven by projections from two Global Climate Models representing RCP 8.5. Simulations suggest that for both species the common phenological strategy of one generation annually (univoltine) will shift northward with warming throughout this century. As optimum habitat for I. typographus univoltinism shifts northward, habitat supporting a 2nd generation, a historically common strategy in warm European Picea forests, expands on both continents. In contrast, a 2nd D. ponderosae generation has been historically rare due to traits that evolved for phenological synchrony in its cool native habitats. As thermal habitat for D. ponderosae univoltinism shifts northward, suitability for a 2nd generation is limited to the warmest Pinus forests on both continents. In the near future (2011–2040), models project extensive thermal suitability for inter-continental establishment of both species, highlighting the need for effective mitigation policies and continued monitoring at ports in an era of climate change and increasing global trade. Throughout the century, thermal suitability remains high for I. typographus population success on both continents, for D. ponderosae in warm areas of Europe, and for D. ponderosae expansion into novel North American Pinus habitats. Portions of the historical D. ponderosae range, however, are projected to become thermally unsuitable. © 2019, At least a portion of this work is authored by Barbara J.

AB  - The two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), is one of the most important pests of cultivated plants. Its control is mainly based on the application of acaricides with concomitant adverse environmental and human health effects. Consequently, we examined the potential of using temperature as an alternative. To that end, we conducted bioassays of the temperature-mortality response of eggs, larvae, protonymphs, deutonymphs, and adult females of T. urticae. Groups of 20 individuals from each stage were placed on 4-cm diameter bean leaf (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) discs. A stream of air at the designated temperature was passed over the disc at a rate of 3.7 ± 1 m s-1) for 2 ± 1 s. Mortality was evaluated at 24 h (larva, protonymph, deutonymph, and female) or 72 h (egg) after exposure. Based on preliminary mortality responses, we selected 10 temperatures with a response range between 0 and 100% mortality. Those were 30, 35, 40, 45, 47, 50, 53, 55, 60, and 65°C [SD, ± 1.5 for each]). In total, 30 replications were conducted, and each repetition included these temperatures and untreated controls. The median lethal temperature ranged from 41.8°C for adult females to 46.9°C for eggs. The lethal temperature to kill 95% of the exposed individuals ranged from 55°C for females to 62.5°C for eggs. There were no survivors at 65°C (eggs), 60°C (larva, protonymph, and deutonymph), or 55°C (adult females). © 2022 Georgia Entomological Society Inc.. All rights reserved.

TI  - The recently identified flavivirus Bamaga virus is transmitted horizontally by Culex mosquitoes and interferes with West Nile virus replication in vitro and transmission in vivo
VL  - 12
IS  - 10
AB  - Arthropod-borne flaviviruses such as yellow fever (YFV), Zika and dengue viruses continue to cause significant human disease globally. These viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes when a female imbibes an infected blood-meal from a viremic vertebrate host and expectorates the virus into a subsequent host. Bamaga virus (BgV) is a flavivirus recently discovered in Culex sitiens subgroup mosquitoes collected from Cape York Peninsula, Australia. This virus phylogenetically clusters with the YFV group, but is potentially restricted in most vertebrates. However, high levels of replication in an opossum cell line (OK) indicate a potential association with marsupials. To ascertain whether BgV could be horizontally transmitted by mosquitoes, the vector competence of two members of the Cx. sitiens subgroup, Cx. annulirostris and Cx. sitiens, for BgV was investigated. Eleven to thirteen days after imbibing an infectious blood-meal, infection rates were 11.3% and 18.8% for Cx. annulirostris and Cx. sitiens, respectively. Cx. annulirostris transmitted the virus at low levels (5.6% had BgV-positive saliva overall); Cx. sitiens did not transmit the virus. When mosquitoes were injected intrathoracially with BgV, the infection and transmission rates were 100% and 82%, respectively, for both species. These results provided evidence for the first time that BgV can be transmitted horizontally by Cx. annulirostris, the primary vector of pathogenic zoonotic flaviviruses in Australia. We also assessed whether BgV could interfere with replication in vitro, and infection and transmission in vivo of super-infecting pathogenic Culex-associated flaviviruses. BgV significantly reduced growth of Murray Valley encephalitis and West Nile (WNV) viruses in vitro. While prior infection with BgV by injection did not inhibit WNV super-infection of Cx. annulirostris, significantly fewer BgV-infected mosquitoes could transmit WNV than mock-injected mosquitoes. Overall, these data contribute to our understanding of flavivirus ecology, modes of transmission by Australian mosquitoes and mechanisms for super-infection interference. © 2018 Colmant et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

AB  - Understanding the interplay between genetic differentiation, ancestral plasticity, and the evolution of plasticity during adaptation to environmental variation is critical to predict populations’ responses to environmental change. However, the role of plasticity in rapid adaptation in nature remains poorly understood. We here use the invasion of the horned beetle Onthophagus taurus in the United States during the last half century to study the contribution of ancestral plasticity and post-invasion evolution of plastic responses in rapid population differentiation. We document latitudinal variation in life history and morphology, including genetic compensation in development time and body size, likely adaptive responses to seasonal constraints in the North. However, clinal variation in development time and size was strongly dependent on rearing temperature, suggesting that population differentiation in plasticity played a critical role in successful adaptation on ecological timescales. Clinal variation in wing shape was independent of ancestral plasticity, but correlated with derived plasticity, consistent with evolutionary interdependence. In contrast, clinal variation in tibia shape aligned poorly with thermal plasticity. Overall, this study suggests that post-invasion evolution of plasticity contributed to range expansions and concurrent adaptation to novel climatic conditions. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Understanding how organisms adapt to complex environments is a central goal of evolutionary biology and ecology. This issue is of special interest in the current era of rapidly changing climatic conditions. Here, we investigate clinal variation and plastic responses in life history, morphology and physiology in the butterfly Pieris napi along a pan-European gradient by exposing butterflies raised in captivity to different temperatures. We found clinal variation in body size, growth rates and concomitant development time, wing aspect ratio, wing melanization and heat tolerance. Individuals from warmer environments were more heat-tolerant and had less melanised wings and a shorter development, but still they were larger than individuals from cooler environments. These findings suggest selection for rapid growth in the warmth and for wing melanization in the cold, and thus fine-tuned genetic adaptation to local climates. Irrespective of the origin of butterflies, the effects of higher developmental temperature were largely as expected, speeding up development; reducing body size, potential metabolic activity and wing melanization; while increasing heat tolerance. At least in part, these patterns likely reflect adaptive phenotypic plasticity. In summary, our study revealed pronounced plastic and genetic responses, which may indicate high adaptive capacities in our study organism. Whether this may help such species, though, to deal with current climate change needs further investigation, as clinal patterns have typically evolved over long periods. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Fabrication and characterization of titanium-based lead dioxide electrode by electrochemical deposition with Ti4O7 particles
VL  - 93
IS  - 1
SP  - 42-50
AB  - A novelly modified Ti/PbO2 electrode was synthesized with Ti4O7 particles through electrochemical deposition method (marked as PbO2-Ti4O7). The properties of the as-prepared electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), hydroxyl radical concentration, accelerated life test, etc. Azophloxine was chosen as the model pollutant for electro-catalytic oxidation to evaluate electrochemical activity of the electrode. The experimental results indicated that Ti4O7 modification could prominently improve the properties of the electrodes, especially, improve the surface morphology, enhance the current response, and reduce the impedance. However, the predominant phases of PbO2 electrodes were unchanged, which were completely pure β-PbO2. During the electrochemical oxidation process, the PbO2-Ti4O7(1.0) electrode showed the best performance on degradation of AR1 (i.e., the highest removal efficiency and the lowest energy consumption), which could be attributed to its high oxygen evolution potential (OEP) and strong capability of HO· generation. Moreover, the accelerated service lifetime of PbO2-Ti4O7(1.0) electrode was 175 hr, 1.65 times longer than that of PbO2 electrode (105.5 hr). Practitioner points: PbO2/Ti4O7 composite anode was fabricated through electrochemical co-deposition. Four concentration gradients of Ti4O7 particle were tested. PbO2-Ti4O7(1.0) showed optimal electrocatalytic ability due to its high OEP and HO· productivity. © 2020 Water Environment Federation

TI  - Determination of melt pool dimensions using DOE-FEM and RSM with process window during SLM of Ti6Al4V powder
VL  - 103
SP  - 59-76
AB  - Selective laser melting (SLM) shows a positive prospect as an additive manufacturing (AM) technique for fabrication of 3D parts with complicated structures. A transient thermal model was developed by the finite element method (FEM) to simulate the thermal behavior for predicting the time evolution of temperature field and melt pool dimensions of Ti6Al4V powder during SLM. The FEM predictions were then compared with published experimental measurements and calculation results for model validation. This study applied the design of experiment (DOE) scheme together with the response surface method (RSM) to conduct the regression analysis based on four processing parameters (exactly, the laser power, scanning speed, preheating temperature and hatch space) for predicting the dimensions of the melt pool in SLM. The preliminary RSM results were used to quantify the effects of those parameters on the melt pool size. The process window was further implemented via two criteria of the width and depth of the molten pool to screen impractical conditions of four parameters for including the practical ranges of processing parameters. The FEM simulations confirmed the good accuracy of the critical RSM models in the predictions of melt pool dimensions for three typical SLM working scenarios. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Insight into evolution of chemical structure and mineralogy to reveal the mechanism of temperature-dependent phosphorus release from hydrochars
VL  - 185
AB  - Shrimp shell (SS) is sustainable biomass with abundant minerals and developable phosphorus (P) resource. Hydrothermal carbonization of SS can solve the shortage of P resources and the utilization of waste. However, few studies on the application of SS hydrochar as fertilizer have been conducted. Having an insight into the evolution of chemical structure and mineralogy could understand the mechanism of P release. In this study, Olsen method was employed to determine the available P (AP) release, and the temperature-dependent evolution of crystalline phase, carbon skeleton structures and surface functionalities were characterized by XRD, XPS, FTIR and TG. The results of AP release from SS hydrochar showed the following temperature (120−280 °C in 20 °C intervals) dependence: 120 °C derived hydrochars (2.30 mg/g) &gt;feedstock (1.51 mg/g) &gt; 160−280 °C derived hydrochars. In addition, AP dissolution kinetic data were well fitted to pseudo-second-order equation (R2 &gt;0.999). Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy revealed that phosphate crystallinity degree was negatively corresponding to release behavior. Meanwhile, calcite crystal growth and the transformation of P species influence the P bioavailability of SS hydrochar. Therefore, hydrochar with lower phosphate crystalline could benefit the P fertilizing efficiency. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Predictability of temporal variation in climate and the evolution of seasonal polyphenism in tropical butterfly communities
VL  - 34
IS  - 9
SP  - 1362-1375
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity in heterogeneous environments can provide tight environment-phenotype matching. However, the prerequisite is a reliable environmental cue(s) that enables organisms to use current environmental information to induce the development of a phenotype with high fitness in a forthcoming environment. Here, we quantify predictability in the timing of precipitation and temperature change to examine how this is associated with seasonal polyphenism in tropical Mycalesina butterflies. Seasonal precipitation in the tropics typically results in distinct selective environments, the wet and dry seasons, and changes in temperature can be a major environmental cue. We sampled communities of Mycalesina butterflies from two seasonal locations and one aseasonal location. Quantifying environmental predictability using wavelet analysis and Colwell's indices confirmed a strong periodicity of precipitation over a 12-month period at both seasonal locations compared to the aseasonal one. However, temperature seasonality and periodicity differed between the two seasonal locations. We further show that: (a) most females from both seasonal locations synchronize their reproduction with the seasons by breeding in the wet season but arresting reproduction in the dry season. In contrast, all species breed throughout the year in the aseasonal location and (b) species from the seasonal locations, but not those from the aseasonal location, exhibited polyphenism in wing pattern traits (eyespot size). We conclude that seasonal precipitation and its predictability are primary factors shaping the evolution of polyphenism in Mycalesina butterflies, and populations or species secondarily evolve local adaptations for cue use that depend on the local variation in the environment. © 2021 The Authors.

VL  - 21

SP  - 1027-1033
AB  - Marine teleost fish species in colder environments generally produce larger eggs than those in warmer environments. This pattern is thought to reflect changes in the optimal strategy of allocation to offspring size and number across temperatures, yet quantitative assessments of this hypothesis are lacking. Here, we model optimal offspring size across temperatures in marine teleost fishes based on the trade-off between offspring survivorship and number. In doing so, we derive quantitative predictions for the relationship of optimal egg size to temperature based on the size and temperature dependences of the growth and mortality, and hence survivorship, of eggs and larvae. Our model shows that smaller eggs are favoured at warmer temperatures largely because egg survivorship declines with both egg size and temperature. The predictions of our model (egg mass in grams = 0.013*e−0.11*T ºC) were comparable to the observed interspecific relationship (0.0029*e−0.09*T ºC; N = 221 spp.). Thus, our results provide insights into how temperature shapes the evolution of egg size in marine teleost fishes. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Thermophilic response post feeding in Pleurodema nebulosum (Anura: Leptodactylidae) from Monte desert, Argentina
VL  - 90
AB  - We studied the thermophilic response to feeding of a typical desert adapted anuran from the Monte Desert. Our aim was to evaluate thermal changes in the selected body temperature of adult frogs of Pleurodema nebulosum, and measure the intestinal passage time, and food digestion. Our results show that after feeding, they selected higher micro-environmental temperatures similar to + 2 degrees C than frogs that remained starved. Pleurodema nebulosum would present a postprandial thermophilic response. The time of retention of food in the digestive tract was thermo-dependent, being lower in those individuals who were incubated at high temperatures (25 degrees C) compared to those subjected to lower temperatures (20 degrees C). Although we did not detect effects of temperature on digestive efficiency, the mass of faecal material indicates an increase at temperatures closer to the selected ones, suggesting that the defecation rate is influenced by temperature. Laiuoperinae frogs are characterized by explosive breeding behavior and fast growing rate. The digestive efficiency is essential for acquiring energy necessary for growth, reproduction and refuge-seeking, among others. In this framework, the differential selection of temperatures between moments of fasting and feeding allows the frogs to maintain a high digestive efficiency, maximizing the absorption of nutrients.

TI  - Heterotrimeric G Protein Signaling in Abiotic Stress
VL  - 11
IS  - 7
AB  - As sessile organisms, plants exhibit extraordinary plasticity and have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to adapt and mitigate the adverse effects of environmental fluctuations. Heterotrimeric G proteins (G proteins), composed of α, β, and γ subunits, are universal signaling molecules mediating the response to a myriad of internal and external signals. Numerous studies have identified G proteins as essential components of the organismal response to stress, leading to adaptation and ultimately survival in plants and animal systems. In plants, G proteins control multiple signaling pathways regulating the response to drought, salt, cold, and heat stresses. G proteins signal through two functional modules, the Gα subunit and the Gβγ dimer, each of which can start either independent or interdependent signaling pathways. Improving the understanding of the role of G proteins in stress reactions can lead to the development of more resilient crops through traditional breeding or biotechnological methods, ensuring global food security. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current knowledge on the roles of the different G protein subunits in response to abiotic stress and suggest future directions for research. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Evolution of spirorbin brooding: A phylogenetic analysis and a test of an oxygen limitation hypothesis
VL  - 16
IS  - 4
SP  - 409-430
AB  - Spirorbinae is a group of small calcareous tubeworms (family Serpulidae) living in flat coiled tubes and incubating their embryos either in tubes or in opercular chambers. The controversy whether tube or opercular incubation is ancestral is unresolved and the costs and benefits of the two incubation types are not understood. The oxygen limitation hypothesis (Harris, 1972) suggests that as opercular incubators predominantly live in tropical waters and opercular incubation evolved as an adaptation to lower oxygen content experienced by embryos of tube incubators. The hypothesis implies that tube incubation is ancestral and opercular incubation evolved as spirorbins penetrated into lower latitudes. The aim of this study was to examine the evolution of brooding in spirorbins. The phylogenetic analysis of morphological characters was used to determine whether the opercular incubation is derived and whether types of opercular incubation evolved independently. We also tested for a relationship between the type of brooding and the geographical distribution in relation to the dissolved oxygen content. The results confirmed that opercular brooding is derived and that two types of opercular brooding originated independently. Tube brooders inhabit waters with higher oxygen content that opercular brooders do. We re-formulated the oxygen limitation hypothesis suggesting that the constraints imposed on tube incubation in warmer waters are related to the increased energetic costs of parental brood ventilation. © INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY, 2019.

TI  - Future Representation of Species’ Climatic Niches in Protected Areas: A Case Study With Austrian Endemics
VL  - 9
AB  - Climate driven species’ range shifts may interfere with existing protected area (PA) networks, resulting in a mismatch between places where species are currently protected and places where they can thrive in the future. Here, we assess the climate-smartness of the Austrian PA network by focusing on endemic species’ climatic niches and their future representation within PAs. We calculated endemic species’ climatic niches and climate space available in PAs within their dispersal reach under current and future climates, with the latter represented by three climate change scenarios and three time-steps (2030, 2050, and 2080). Niches were derived from the area of occupancy of species and the extent of PAs, respectively, and calculated as bivariate density kernels on gradients of mean annual temperature and annual precipitation. We then computed climatic representation of species’ niches in PAs as the proportion of the species’ kernel covered by the PA kernel. We found that under both a medium (RCP 4.5) and severe (RCP 8.5) climate change scenario, representation of endemic species’ climatic niches by PAs will decrease to a sixth for animals and to a third for plants, on average, toward the end of the century. Twenty to thirty percent of Austrian endemic species will then have no representation of their climatic niches in PAs anymore. Species with larger geographical and wider elevational ranges will lose less climatic niche representation. The declining representation of climatic niches in PAs implies that, even if PAs may secure the persistence of a part of these endemics, only a small portion of intraspecific diversity of many species may be represented in PAs in the future. We discuss our findings in the context of the varied elevational gradients found in Austria and suggest that the most promising strategies for safeguarding endemic species’ evolutionary potential are to limit the magnitude of climate change and to reduce other pressures that additionally threaten their survival. © Copyright © 2021 Semenchuk, Moser, Essl, Schindler, Wessely, Gattringer and Dullinger.

AB  - An insect species' geographic distribution is probably delimited in part by physiological tolerances of environmental temperatures. Gloomy scale (Melanaspis tenebricosa (Comstock)) is a native insect herbivore in eastern U.S. forests. In eastern U.S. cities, where temperatures are warmer than nearby natural areas, M. tenebricosa is a primary pest of red maple (Acer rubrum L.; Sapindales: Sapindaceae) With warming, M. tenebricosa may spread to new cities or become pestilent in forests. To better understand current and future M. tenebricosa distribution boundaries, we examined M. tenebricosa thermal tolerance under laboratory conditions. We selected five hot and five cold experimental temperatures representative of locations in the known M. tenebricosa distribution. We built models to predict scale mortality based on duration of exposure to warm or cold experimental temperatures. We then used these models to estimate upper and lower lethal durations, i.e., temperature exposure durations that result in 50% mortality. We tested the thermal tolerance for M. tenebricosa populations from northern, mid, and southern locations of the species' known distribution. Scales were more heat and cold tolerant of temperatures representative of the midlatitudes of their distribution where their densities are the greatest. Moreover, the scale population from the northern distribution boundary could tolerate cold temperatures from the northern boundary for twice as long as the population collected near the southern boundary. Our results suggest that as the climate warms the M. tenebricosa distribution may expand poleward, but experience a contraction at its southern boundary. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Thermal Weakening, Convergent Flow, and Vertical Heat Transport in the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream Shear Margins
VL  - 46
IS  - 14
SP  - 8184-8193
AB  - Ice streams are bounded by abrupt transitions in speed called shear margins. Some shear margins are fixed by subglacial topography, but others are thought to be self-organizing, evolving by thermal feedback to ice viscosity and basal drag which govern the stress balance of ice sheets. Resistive stresses (and properties governing shear-margin formation) manifest nonuniquely at the surface, motivating the use of subsurface observations to constrain ice sheet models. In this study, we use ice-penetrating radar data to evaluate three 3-D thermomechanical models of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream, focusing on model reproductions of ice temperature (a primary control on viscosity) and subsurface velocity. Data/model agreement indicates elevated temperatures in the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream margins, with depth-averaged temperatures between 2 °C and 6 °C warmer in the southeast margin compared to ice in streaming flow, driven by vertical heat transport rather than shear heating. This work highlights complexity in ice divergence across stagnant/streaming transitions. ©2019. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Study on electrochemical degradation of nicosulfuron by IrO 2 -based DSA electrodes: Performance, kinetics, and degradation mechanism
VL  - 16
IS  - 3
AB  - The widely used sulfonylurea herbicides have caused negative effects on the environment and human beings. Electrochemical degradation has attracted much attention in the treatment of refractory organic compounds due to its advantage of producing no secondary pollution. Three kinds of IrO 2 -based dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) were used to degrade nicosulfuron by a batch electrochemical process. The results showed that a well-distributed crack network was formed on the Ti/Ta 2 O 5 -IrO 2 electrode and Ti/Ta 2 O 5 -SnO 2 -IrO 2 electrode due to the different coefficients of thermal expansion between the Ti substrate and oxide coatings. The oxygen evolution potential (OEP) increased according to the order of Ti/RuO 2 -IrO 2 &lt; Ti/Ta 2 O 5 -SnO 2 -IrO 2 &lt; Ti/Ta 2 O 5 -IrO 2 . Among the three electrodes, the Ti/Ta 2 O 5 -IrO 2 electrode showed the highest efficiency and was chosen as the experimental electrode. Single factor experiments were carried out to obtain the optimum electrolysis condition, shown as follows: currency intensity 0.8 A; electrode spacing 3 cm, electrolyte pH 3. Under the optimum conditions, the degradation of nicosulfuron followed first-order kinetics and was mainly due to indirect electrochemical oxidation. It was a typical diffusion-controlled electrochemical process. On the basis of the intermediate identified by high performance liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS), two possible degradation routes were proposed. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - The influence of an ECAP-based deformation process on the microstructure and properties of electrolytic tough pitch copper
VL  - 53
IS  - 5
SP  - 3862-3875
AB  - Samples of electrolytic tough pitch copper were deformed in equal channel angular pressing with enhanced productivity to quickly refine its initial coarse-grained microstructure at room temperature. The evolution in microstructure and changes in a broad range of properties were compared to a sample in the undeformed state. The microstructure evolution was evaluated using electron backscatter diffraction for both states and transmission electron microscopy for a detailed microstructure characterization of the deformed sample. The microstructure observations were correlated with the results of tensile tests, electrochemical tests in 3.5 wt% NaCl, electrical conductivity measurements and thermal stability up to 200 °C. The ECAP process employed in this study caused a grain refinement from about 16 µm to about 600 nm. The microstructure refinement caused a 50% increase in both the YS and UTS. The elongation to failure, due to the high amount of LAGBs, maintained a high value of 13.3%. The corrosion and pitting potentials were higher for the deformed sample. Furthermore, the grain refinement caused a decrease in electrical conductivity from 100.2% IACS to 93.1% IACS, a drop of 7% IACS. The deformed sample displayed thermal stability up to a temperature of 175 °C, where there was a drop in micro-hardness of more than 10%. © 2017, The Author(s).

TI  - Design optimization methods for high-performance research reactor core design
VL  - 352
AB  - Common objectives of high-performance research reactors include neutron scattering, materials irradiation, and isotope production. The design of a core that optimizes these multiple objectives often presents a multidimensional (i.e., in design space), multiobjective optimization problem. The developed systematic approach discussed herein draws on response surface methodology to validate and leverage a surrogate model to serve in place of high-fidelity computational analyses. Optimization and design analysis methods leverage this surrogate model to provide a flexible tool for generating optimized designs and understanding the impact of design decisions on desired metrics. In applications to High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) low-enriched uranium (LEU) core designs, neutronic, isotopic evolution, and thermal hydraulic analyses are used to generate key performance and safety metrics for assessing the feasibility and fitness of given designs. Three optimized designs that consider different desired metrics and constraints (e.g., key metric weighting and fabrication constraints) are presented, providing potential design options that satisfy the requirements for HFIR's conversion from high enriched uranium to LEU fuel. © 2019

TI  - Surface cooling caused by rare but intense near-inertial wave induced mixing in the tropical Atlantic
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - The direct response of the tropical mixed layer to near-inertial waves (NIWs) has only rarely been observed. Here, we present upper-ocean turbulence data that provide evidence for a strongly elevated vertical diffusive heat flux across the base of the mixed layer in the presence of a NIW, thereby cooling the mixed layer at a rate of 244Wm(-2) over the 20h of continuous measurements. We investigate the seasonal cycle of strong NIW events and find that despite their local intermittent nature, they occur preferentially during boreal summer, presumably associated with the passage of atmospheric African Easterly Waves. We illustrate the impact of these rare but intense NIW induced mixing events on the mixed layer heat balance, highlight their contribution to the seasonal evolution of sea surface temperature, and discuss their potential impact on biological productivity in the tropical North Atlantic. How the tropical mixed layer of the ocean reacts to near-inertial waves has rarely been observed directly. Here, the authors present new data that shows strongly elevated vertical diffusive heat flux in the presence of near-inertial waves, causing a cooling of the mixed layer that is particularly strong in summer.

TI  - Ovigeny index increases with temperature in an aphid parasitoid: Is early reproduction better when it is hot?
VL  - 109
SP  - 157-162
AB  - Studying relative investment of resources towards early and delayed reproduction is central to understand life history evolution since these traits are generally negatively correlated and traded-off against several other fitness components. For this purpose, ovigeny index (OI), which is calculated as the fraction of the maximum potential lifetime egg complement that is mature upon female emergence, has been developed in insects. Despite the central role of temperature on life history evolution in ectotherms, its influence on ovigeny index has never been tested. Adaptive models imply that OI should increase with temperature because of changes in body size, but the same influence may be expected considering physiological effects of temperature on egg maturation rate or amount of energy available. We investigated in the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi the influence of temperature experienced by the immature and/or the adult (from 12 degrees C to 28 degrees C) on ovigeny index and oviposition behaviour. As predicted, OI increased between 16 and 28 degrees C, i.e. females were able to reproduce earlier as temperature increased but this was traded off against a lower delayed reproduction. The highest OI was however observed at 12 degrees, probably because this temperature was too low for females to mature eggs. Females that developed at 20 degrees C and were transferred as adult at 24 degrees C and 28 degrees C had the highest ovigeny index and laid more eggs during the early oviposition period while those transferred at 16 degrees C laid more eggs at the end of their life. Our results suggest that ovigeny index is not only influenced by body size - i.e. the adaptive explanation - but also by adult egg maturation rate, lifespan or amount of energy available - i.e. a physiological and adaptive explanation.

TI  - Potential regulation by miRNAs on glucose metabolism in liver of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) at different temperatures
VL  - 32
AB  - Water temperature can affect the metabolism of fish. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a representative eurythermic fish that can survive at a wide range of ambient temperatures, allowing it to live in an extensive geographical range. The goal of this work was to study the glucose metabolism of common carp at different temperatures and determine the miRNAs involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. We determined the indicators related to glucose metabolism after long-term temperature stress and constructed nine small RNA libraries of livers under different temperature stress (5 °C, 17 °C, and 30 °C, with three biological replicates for each temperature), and subjected these samples to high-throughput sequencing. A positive relationship was observed between weight gain rate (WGR) and temperature increase after 18 days of temperature stress. However, the glucose level in the plasma maintained a gentle decrease. Unexpectedly, liver lactic acid levels were elevated in HTG (high temperature group) and LTG (low temperature group). Six down-regulated miRNAs (miR-122, miR-30b, miR-15b-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-1, and miR-7b) were identified as involved in the regulation of glycolysis. Twelve genes were predicted as targets of these miRNAs, and these genes are in pathways related to pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and the citrate cycle (TCA cycle). The results allowed prediction of a potential regulatory network of miRNAs involved in the regulation of glycolysis. The target genes of six down-regulated miRNAs were up-regulated under temperature stress, including Aldolase C, fructose-bisphosphate, b (ALDOCB), multiple inositol-polyphosphate phosphatase 1 (MINPP1), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha 1 (PDHA1), aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 family member A1a (ALDH9A1A), Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (ACSS), lactate dehydrogenase b (LDH-b), and glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR). Other key genes of glycolysis, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), pyruvate kinase PKM (PKM), and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) were significantly up-regulated in LTG and HTG. Overall, the results suggest that miRNAs maintain their energy requirements by regulating glycolysis and play an important role in the molecular response to cold and heat stress of common carp. These data provide the foundation for further studies of the role of miRNAs in environmental adaptation in fish. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Variation in developmental rates is not linked to environmental unpredictability in annual killifishes
VL  - 11
IS  - 12
SP  - 8027-8037
AB  - Comparative evidence suggests that adaptive plasticity may evolve as a response to predictable environmental variation. However, less attention has been placed on unpredictable environmental variation, which is considered to affect evolutionary trajectories by increasing phenotypic variation (or bet hedging). Here, we examine the occurrence of bet hedging in egg developmental rates in seven species of annual killifish that originate from a gradient of variation in precipitation rates, under three treatment incubation temperatures (21, 23, and 25°C). In the wild, these species survive regular and seasonal habitat desiccation, as dormant eggs buried in the soil. At the onset of the rainy season, embryos must be sufficiently developed in order to hatch and complete their life cycle. We found substantial differences among species in both the mean and variation of egg development rates, as well as species-specific plastic responses to incubation temperature. Yet, there was no clear relationship between variation in egg development time and variation in precipitation rate (environmental predictability). The exact cause of these differences therefore remains enigmatic, possibly depending on differences in other natural environmental conditions in addition to precipitation predictability. Hence, if species-specific variances are adaptive, the relationship between development and variation in precipitation is complex and does not diverge in accordance with simple linear relationships. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Thermal biology research compares field with laboratory data to elucidate the evolution of temperature-sensitive traits in ectotherms. The hidden challenge of many of these studies is discerning whether animals actively thermoregulate, since motivation is not typically assessed. By studying the behaviours involved in thermoregulation, we can better understand the mechanisms underlying body temperature control. Using an integrative approach, we assessed the thermoregulatory and thermotactic behaviours of two sympatric snake species with contrasting life histories: the generalist Eastern Garter Snake (Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis (Linnaeus, 1758)) and the semi-fossorial Northern Red-bellied Snake (Storeria occipitomaculata occipitomaculata (Storer, 1839)). We expected that thermoregulatory behaviours would be optimized based on life history, in that T. s. sirtalis would show higher evidence for thermally oriented behaviours than S. o. occipitomaculata due to its active nature. Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis actively thermoregulated, had higher thermal preferences (29.4 6 2.5 vs. 25.3 6 3.6 °C), and was more active than S. o. occipitomaculata, which showed relatively low evidence for thermotaxis. Our results build on the notion that evaluating movement patterns and rostral orientation towards a heat source can help ascertain whether animals make thermally motivated choices. Our data provide insight into the thermoregulatory strategies used by snakes with different life histories and maximize the information provided by behavioural thermoregulation experiments. © Canadian Science Publishing.

TI  - Expanding niche and degrading forests: Key to the successful global invasion of Lantana camara (sensu lato)
VL  - 23
AB  - Estimating the distribution of invasive species and understanding the ecological reasons for their success is crucial for their management. Moreover, their ability to invade biogeographically distinct regions in short timespans poses interesting ecological questions. Lantana camara (sensu lato) is one such invasive species of global concern. In an unprecedented effort, we surveyed 207,100 km(2) of Indian forests by sampling 13715 grids of 5 x 5 km, each with 1-31 plots of 10 m diameter, to record the abundance of Lantana. For India, we modeled occupancy of Lantana in the sampled area by accounting for imperfect detection; and potential invasion outside the sampled area using MaxEnt with covariates of climate, soil, forest and human disturbance. Further, Lantana's response in comparable areas of its native and global invaded range was modeled using MaxEnt to provide a better understanding of its changing relationship with environmental factors. Lantana invaded 154,837 km2 of the surveyed area, and threatened 303,607 km2 of total Indian forests (44%); with preference to warm, humid, fertile areas, degraded by extractive human use. By combining our large-scale ground surveys with published data, we show that Lantana has expanded its climatic niche worldwide, with >11 million km2 suitable for its invasion. Niche comparison revealed that Lantana might have adaptive plasticity in its invaded range; where it was found to be more tolerant to higher temperatures, lower fertility and shade as compared to its native range. In light of Lantana's introduction history that suggest excessive hybridization between previously allopatric populations, and its known genetic diversity in the invaded range, the existing adaptive plasticity is suggestive of contemporary evolution. This adaptive nature can increase area under its invasion and pose an ecological conundrum of managing an evolving neophyte. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Induction Heating (IH) method is gaining traction in the field of Additive Manufacturing (AM) as it is a low cost, clean, safe, and precise energy source. Wire as a feedstock material is highly efficient as compared to the powder form in terms of material utilization and economic viability. Thus, the combination of IH and wire feedstock delivery to additive manufacture a part has been explored on an in-house developed novel AM setup. The processing of aluminum wire (Al-5356) in semi-solid form from the extruder, heated using IH method has been performed. The approach adopted in this paper is to perform an in situ infrared imaging to analyze the evolution of thermal field during the extruder heating and metal deposition process. An effective thermal cartography has been undertaken to acquire temperature history of filament, extruder, and deposition process. The temperature profile plot is utilized to understand the temperature distribution and average temperature in the heating, extrusion, and layering process during layer fabrication. The presented work facilitates a priori anticipation to utilize IH as a potential energy source for the metal AM systems. © IMechE 2021.

TI  - Thermal analysis of laser additive manufacturing of aluminium alloys: Experiment and simulation
VL  - 1960
AB  - Laser additive manufacturing (LAM) has become increasingly popular in industry in recent decades because it enables exceptional degrees of freedom regarding the structural design of lightweight components compared to subtractive manufacturing techniques. Laser metal deposition (LMD) of wire-fed material shows in particular the advantages such as high process velocity and efficient use of material compared to other LAM processes. During wire-based LMD, the material is deposited onto a substrate and supplemented by successive layers allowing a layer-wise production of complex three-dimensional structures. Despite the increased productivity of LMD, regarding the ability to process aluminium alloys, there is still a lack in quality and reproducibility due to the inhomogeneous temperature distribution during the process, leading to undesired residual stresses, distortions and inconsistent layer geometries and poor microstructures. In this study, the aluminium alloy AA5087 as wire and AA5754 as substrate material were utilized for LMD. In order to obtain information about the temperature field during LMD, thermocouple and thermography measurements were performed during the process. The temperature measurements were used to validate a finite element model regarding the heat distribution, which will be further used to investigate the temperature field evolution over time. To consider the continuous addition of material within the FE-model, an inactive/active element approach was chosen, where initially deactivated elements are activated corresponding to the deposition of material. The first results of the simulation and the experiments show good agreement. Therefore, the model can be used in the future for LMD process optimization, e.g., in terms of minimizing local variations of the thermal load for each layer. © 2018 Author(s).

TI  - Thermal exposure and transgenerational plasticity influence embryonic success in a bivoltine estuarine sea hare
VL  - 634
SP  - 199-211
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity has the potential to influence environmental adaptation on extremely short evolutionary timescales. Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) allows parents to provision their offspring for rapid environmental shifts in as little as one generation. We hypothesized that organisms that produce multiple generations of offspring each year use TGP to maximize their fitness under predictable fluctuations in seasonal environments. Using the direct-developing bivoltine eelgrass sea hare Phyllaplysia taylori as a test case, we examined the impacts of seasonal thermal variation (i.e. average temperature and acute heat stress) on physiological tolerance, maternal provisioning, and developmental plasticity across multiple generations. In the laboratory, we acclimated seasonally acclimatized adults from successive generations at 13, 17, and 21°C in order to assess plasticity of thermal tolerance limits. We also examined the effects of thermal acclimation and heat stress on reproductive output within a single generation in order to characterize TGP. Physiological plasticity, including but not limited to TGP, successfully maintained the viability of offspring under 2 seasonal conditions regularly experienced in the wild, despite differences in the density of offspring per clutch and large individual differences in offspring numbers under these conditions. These results indicate that warmer conditions (21°C) disrupt current patterns of plasticity and warrant further investigation of the long-term effects of chronic stress on TGP under climate change. © Inter-Research 2020 · www.int-res.com

SP  - 617-625
AB  - Ethanol fermentation in very high gravity (VHG) saves energy consumption for ethanol distillation. As the technology offers high ethanol yield and low waste generation and it can be operated at low cost, it could be more efficient at an industrial scale than other ethanol production methods. This work studied ethanol production using a fed-batch bioreactor with a working volume of 1.5 L. The main objective of this research was evaluate the effects of temperature, sugar concentration, and cellular concentration using a Central Composite Design (CCD). Experimental conditions were selected using the surface response technique obtained from the CCD, and the results were validated to test the reproducibility. The following operating conditions were selected: temperature of 27.0 °C, sugar concentration 300.0 g/L, and cell concentration 15.0% (v/v). Under these conditions, after 30 h of fermentation the ethanol concentration, productivity and yield were 135.0 g/L, 4.42 g/(L·h) and 90.0%, respectively. All sugar was completely consumed. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 43
IS  - 5
SP  - 759-768
AB  - Reproductive diapause is a primary mechanism used by arthropods to synchronize their life cycle with seasonal changes in temperate regions. Our study species, Drosophila montana, represents the northern insect species where flies enter reproductive diapause under short day conditions and where the precise timing of diapause is crucial for both survival and offspring production. We have studied clinal variation in the critical day length for female diapause induction (CDL) and their overall susceptibility to enter diapause (diapause incidence), as well as the temperature sensitivity of these traits. The study was performed using multiple strains from four latitudinal clines of the species – short clines in Finland and Alaska and long clines in the Rocky Mountains and the western coast of North America – and from one population in Kamchatka, Russia. CDL showed strong latitudinal clines on both continents, decreasing by one hour per five degrees decline in latitude, on average. CDL also decreased in all populations along with an increase in fly rearing temperature postponing the diapause to later calendar time, the effects of temperature being stronger in southern than in northern population. Female diapause incidence was close to 100% under short day/low temperature conditions in all populations, but decreased below 50% even under short days in 19°C in the southern North American western coast populations and in 22°C in most populations. Comparing a diversity of climatic data for the studied populations showed that while CDL is under a tight photoperiodic regulation linked with latitude, its length depends also on climatic factors determining the growing season length. Overall, the study deepens our understanding of how spatial and environmental parameters affect the seasonal timing of an important biological event, reproductive diapause and helps to estimate the evolutionary potential of insect populations to survive in changing climatic conditions. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Shell morphology, growth pattern and population dynamics of the land snail Xerolenta obvia (Menke, 1828) in two areas of different climatic conditions within a temperate climate region
VL  - 66
IS  - 1
SP  - 69-84
AB  - To determine the relative role of climatic variables (temperature and precipitation) on land snail Xerolenta obvia populations, field surveys were conducted in Poland at two sites (SW and NE) with striking differences in climatic regime during two growing seasons. In a temperate climate of Central Europe X. obvia is an annual species with the majority of snails hatching in autumn. They overwinter as juveniles, continue their growth in spring and summer, and reproduce in the following autumn. Due to the comparatively milder climate, the SW population is more plastic, some individuals can live and reproduce longer. The two variants of the growth model are presented. We found that the length of growing season and temperature were additional factors determining differences in snails' growth and population dynamics between the sites. The growth rate of X. obvia is negatively correlated with the initial size of their shells and varies among sites. These two geographically distant populations differ in terms of their shell size and morphology. The SW population is characterised by larger, dark banded shells compared to the NE one, which is dominated by snails with smaller, white shells. A pattern of decreasing body size in areas with shorter growing season may explain differences in the shell size of X. obvia. Larger shells in regions with warmer and drier environment perhaps constitute responses to selection by environmental factors. © 2020, Hungarian Natural History Museum.

VL  - 19
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Improving feed efficiency in fish is crucial at the economic, social and environmental levels with respect to developing a more sustainable aquaculture. The important contribution of genetic improvement to achieve this goal has been hampered by the lack of accurate basic information on the genetic parameters of feed efficiency in fish. We used video assessment of feed intake on individual fish reared in groups to estimate the genetic parameters of six growth traits, feed intake, feed conversion ratio (FCR) and residual feed intake in 40 pedigreed families of the GIFT strain of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. Feed intake and growth were measured on juvenile fish (22.4 g mean body weight) during 13 consecutive meals, representing 7 days of measurements. We used these data to estimate the FCR response to different selection criteria to assess the potential of genetics as a means of increasing FCR in tilapia. Results: Our results demonstrate genetic control for FCR in tilapia, with a heritability estimate of 0.32 ± 0.11. Response to selection estimates showed FCR could be efficiently improved by selective breeding. Due to low genetic correlations, selection for growth traits would not improve FCR. However, weight loss at fasting has a high genetic correlation with FCR (0.80 ± 0.25) and a moderate heritability (0.23), and could be an easy to measure and efficient criterion to improve FCR by selective breeding in tilapia. Conclusion: At this age, FCR is genetically determined in Nile tilapia. A selective breeding program could be possible and could help enabling the development of a more sustainable aquaculture production. © 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - Life-history responses of insects to water-deficit stress: A case study with the aphid Sitobion avenae
VL  - 18
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Drought may become one of the greatest challenges for cereal production under future warming scenarios, and its impact on insect pest outbreaks is still controversial. To address this issue, life-history responses of the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), from three areas of different drought levels were compared under three water treatments. Results: Significant differences were identified in developmental time, fecundity and adult weight among S. avenae clones from moist, semiarid and arid areas under all the three water treatments. Semiarid and arid area clones tended to have higher heritability for test life-history traits than moist area clones. We identified significant selection of water-deficit on the developmental time of 1st instar nymphs and adult weight for both semiarid and arid area clones. The impact of intermediate and severe water-stress on S. avenae's fitness was neutral and negative (e.g., decreased fecundity and weight), respectively. Compared with arid-area clones, moist- and semiarid-area clones showed higher extents of adaptation to the water-deficit level of their respective source environment. Adult weight was identified as a good indicator for S. avenae's adaptation potential under different water-stress conditions. After their exposure to intermediate water-deficit stress for only five generations, adult weight and fecundity tended to decrease for moist- and semiarid-area clones, but increase for arid-area clones. Conclusions: It is evident from our study that S. avenae clones from moist, semiarid and arid areas have diverged under different water-deficit stress, and such divergence could have a genetic basis. The impact of drought on S. avenae's fitness showed a water-level dependent pattern. Clones of S. avenae were more likely to become adapted to intermediate water-deficit stress than severe water-deficit stress. After continuous water-deficit stress of only five generations, the adaptation potential of S. avenae tended to decrease for moist and semiarid area clones, but increase for arid area clones. The rapid shift of aphids' life-history traits and adaptation potential under drought could have significant implications for their evolutionary dynamics and outbreak risks in future climate change scenarios. © 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - Geographic variation and thermal plasticity shape salamander metabolic rates under current and future climates
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - Predicted changes in global temperature are expected to increase extinction risk for ectotherms, primarily through increased metabolic rates. Higher metabolic rates generate increased maintenance energy costs which are a major component of energy budgets. Organisms often employ plastic or evolutionary (e.g., local adaptation) mechanisms to optimize metabolic rate with respect to their environment. We examined relationships between temperature and standard metabolic rate across four populations of a widespread amphibian species to determine if populations vary in metabolic response and if their metabolic rates are plastic to seasonal thermal cues. Populations from warmer climates lowered metabolic rates when acclimating to summer temperatures as compared to spring temperatures. This may act as an energy saving mechanism during the warmest time of the year. No such plasticity was evident in populations from cooler climates. Both juvenile and adult salamanders exhibited metabolic plasticity. Although some populations responded to historic climate thermal cues, no populations showed plastic metabolic rate responses to future climate temperatures, indicating there are constraints on plastic responses. We postulate that impacts of warming will likely impact the energy budgets of salamanders, potentially affecting key demographic rates, such as individual growth and investment in reproduction. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Sedimentary Environment and Enrichment of Organic Matter During the Deposition of Qiongzhusi Formation in the Upslope Areas—A Case Study of W207 Well in the Weiyuan Area, Sichuan Basin, China
VL  - 10
AB  - For a more in-depth analysis on the marine chemical condition during the earliest Cambrian, mechanism of organic matter enrichment and exploration potential of shale gas resources, based on the petrology, organic geochemistry, and elemental characteristics of the W207 Well, this study discuss the Early Cambrian paleo-ocean environment and factors controlling of organic matter enrichment during the deposition of black strata Qiongzhusi Formation in the upslope areas, southwestern Sichuan Basin, Yangtze Block, China. The sedimentary cycles show that during the depositon of fine-grained Qiongzhusi Fm, interactive cycles of multiple deep-water and shallow-water shelf developed, and were controlled by the rise and fall in sea level. In particular, the slope turbidite (fan) and gravity flow sediments indicate that the shallow-water shelf facies were dominant in the upslope area (SW Sichuan Basin), where not in deep water for a long time, and the sedimentary thickness of the organic rich black shale was limited. Evidence from organic geochemistry indicates that the organic matter of the Qiongzhusi Fm from the W207 Well was mainly of type I kerogen, with a high degree of thermal evolution, little residual hydrocarbon, and low capacity for hydrocarbon generation. The redox parameters indicate that the marine environment on the upslope was medium restrictive, with some upwelling. The seawater had undergone a transformation according to anoxic–oxidic. Therefore, paleo-ocean productivity in the upslope area was generally low, and exhibited a prominent downward trend from bottom to top. Given its high risk of exploration, the authors suggest that the direction of shale gas resource evaluation should change to the intracratonic sag (downslope) area, which is characterized by deep-water shelf facies.

VL  - 104
IS  - 5
SP  - 1967-1984
AB  - This study predicts in real time the evolution of temperature and density for arbitrary long tracks in laser-based additive manufacturing using artificial neural networks (ANNs). First, a random laser path is transformed appropriately to serve as an ANN input via a custom trajectory decomposition method providing a local description of each trajectory point relative to its surroundings, which is calculated and load-optimized using K-d trees. For each trajectory point, a “Master” ANN calculates the present temperature, using the trajectory descriptors and previous step temperature as inputs. This is made into a parallel procedure by exploiting a “Pilot” ANN without temperature feedback, making a first pass over the whole trajectory to estimate temperature responses. The Master ANN uses these results as a feedback that is iteratively refined. A “Rider” ANN uses the final temperatures as input and calculates local density evolution. Four hundred fifty finite element model experiments of short random walk trajectories were used for ANN training. Results are presented for various types of laser paths, including random, hatch, spiral, fractal, and spline. ANN simulation execution time consistently taking under 50% of the real process time in all validated cases for track length in excess of 100 m proved the ability of the platform to operate at the full layer-scale of LBAM. © 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Multigenerational heat acclimation increases thermal tolerance and expression levels of Hsp70 and Hsp90 in the rice leaf folder larvae
VL  - 81
SP  - 103-109
AB  - Physiological response and acclimation to thermal stress is a key strategy of insects to cope with changing climate. The underlying mechanism of heat acclimation in insects is still unclear. Here, the heat selection and transcript level response in the larvae of the rice leaf folder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis Guenee, a serious pest of rice in summer, were studied. The survival and fecundity of larvae during multigenerational heat selection at 39 degrees C were examined, and heat tolerance and mRNA expression of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and 90 (Hsp90) were examined under heat stress. The results showed that survival and fecundity of larvae increased notably and then kept constant after two or three generations of heat selection. Heat selection improved thermal tolerance of larvae. The Hsp70 mRNA expression of the 3rd-instar larvae increased in all five generations of heat selection, but Hsp90 increased only in the first two generations. The response of Hsp70 to 39 degrees C heat treatment in the larvae kept at 27 degrees C was different from the larvae exposed to the conditioning heat treatments, but the response of Hsp 90 was similar. Moreover, the Hsp70 and Hsp90 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in the heat-acclimated larvae than that in the unacclimated larvae at a comparable duration of exposure to 37 and 41 degrees C. Selection at a high temperature across multiple generations led larvae to heat acclimation, and Hsp70 and Hsp90 were involved in this acclimation process.

TI  - Transgenerational phenotypic plasticity of diapause induction and related fitness cost in a commercial strain of the parasitoid Aphidius ervi Haliday
VL  - 28
IS  - 3
SP  - 780-792
AB  - Diapause is an adaptation that insects have evolved to synchronize their life cycle with that of seasonal climatic changes and resources availability. However, cues for its induction are not always clear and, in some cases, a maternal effect may be involved. At the population level, just a part of the individuals may exhibit diapause with important consequences in terms of winter survival. Moreover, clear indicators of diapause state are difficult to identify. Diapause induction was thus investigated in the aphid parasitoid species Aphidius ervi Haliday (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) developing in the aphid Sitobion avenae (Hemiptera: Aphididae) at four crossed photothermal regimes (16 °C and 8 °C, 16:8 h L:D and 8:16 h L:D), and during 2 successive generations. We analyzed the reliability of changes in mummy color to assess for the diapausing state compared to dissections, and we measured parasitoid morphological and physiological traits. We observed that the proportion of dark brown mummies increased after one generation under low photothermal regime compared to other regimes. No diapause was recorded at 16 °C, 16:8 h L:D, while we observed 16.2% and 67.5% diapause incidence at 8 °C, 8:16 h L:D, at 1st and 2nd generation, respectively. Diapause induction is thus increased by short day-length conditions and low temperatures as well as by maternal effects. All parasitoid life-history traits (weight, size, fat content, water content, egg-load, and longevity) were affected by the photothermal regime and/or the generation. These results raise new questions on the environmental thresholds needed to induce diapause and on survival and adaptation potential of commercially available parasitoid strains in different environments. © 2020 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

AB  - Despite strong selective pressure to optimize larval life history in marine environments, there is a wide diversity with regard to developmental mode, size, and time larvae spend in the plankton. In the present study, we assessed if adaptive hypotheses explain the distribution of the larval life history of thoracican barnacles within a strict phylogenetic framework. We collected environmental and larval trait data for 170 species from the literature, and utilized a complete thoracican synthesis tree to account for phylogenetic nonindependence. In accordance with Thorson's rule, the fraction of species with planktonic-feeding larvae declined with water depth and increased with water temperature, while the fraction of brooding species exhibited the reverse pattern. Species with planktonic-nonfeeding larvae were overall rare, following no apparent trend. In agreement with the “size advantage” hypothesis proposed by Strathmann in 1977, egg and larval size were closely correlated. Settlement-competent cypris larvae were larger in cold water, indicative of advantages for large juveniles when growth is slowed. Planktonic larval duration, on the other hand, was uncorrelated to environmental variables. We conclude that different selective pressures appear to shape the evolution of larval life history in barnacles. © 2019 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Divergence and plasticity shape adaptive potential of the Pacific oyster
VL  - 2
IS  - 11
SP  - 1751-1760
AB  - The interplay between divergence and phenotypic plasticity is critical to our understanding of a species’ adaptive potential under rapid climate changes. We investigated divergence and plasticity in natural populations of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas with a congeneric oyster Crassostrea angulata from southern China used as an outgroup. Genome re-sequencing of 371 oysters revealed unexpected genetic divergence in a small area that coincided with phenotypic divergence in growth, physiology, heat tolerance and gene expression across environmental gradients. These findings suggest that selection and local adaptation are pervasive and, together with limited gene flow, influence population structure. Genes showing sequence differentiation between populations also diverged in transcriptional response to heat stress. Plasticity in gene expression is positively correlated with evolved divergence, indicating that plasticity is adaptive and favoured by organisms under dynamic environments. Divergence in heat tolerance—partly through acetylation-mediated energy depression—implies differentiation in adaptive potential. Trade-offs between growth and survival may play an important role in local adaptation of oysters and other marine invertebrates. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

TI  - Divergent transcriptomic responses underlying the ranaviruses-amphibian interaction processes on interspecies infection of Chinese giant salamander
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Ranaviruses (family Iridoviridae, nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses) have been reported as promiscuous pathogens of cold-blooded vertebrates. Rana grylio virus (RGV, a ranavirus), from diseased frog Rana grylio with a genome of 105.79 kb and Andrias davidianus ranavirus (ADRV), from diseased Chinese giant salamander (CGS) with a genome of 106.73 kb, contains 99% homologous genes. Results: To uncover the differences in virus replication and host responses under interspecies infection, we analyzed transcriptomes of CGS challenged with RGV and ADRV in different time points (1d, 7d) for the first time. A total of 128,533 unigenes were obtained from 820,858,128 clean reads. Transcriptome analysis revealed stronger gene expression of RGV than ADRV at 1 d post infection (dpi), which was supported by infection in vitro. RGV replicated faster and had higher titers than ADRV in cultured CGS cell line. RT-qPCR revealed the RGV genes including the immediate early gene (RGV-89R) had higher expression level than that of ADRV at 1 dpi. It further verified the acute infection of RGV in interspecies infection. The number of differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways from RGV were lower than that from ADRV, which reflected the variant host responses at transcriptional level. No obvious changes of key components in pathway "Antigen processing and presentation" were detected for RGV at 1 dpi. Contrarily, ADRV infection down-regulated the expression levels of MHC I and CD8. The divergent host immune responses revealed the differences between interspecies and natural infection, which may resulted in different fates of the two viruses. Altogether, these results revealed the differences in transcriptome responses among ranavirus interspecies infection of amphibian and new insights in DNA virus-host interactions in interspecies infection. Conclusion: The DNA virus (RGV) not only expressed self-genes and replicated quickly after entry into host under interspecies infection, but also avoided the over-activation of host responses. The strategy could gain time for the survival of interspecies pathogen, and may provide opportunity for its adaptive evolution and interspecies transmission. © 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - Fine-Scale Adaptations to Environmental Variation and Growth Strategies Drive Phyllosphere Methylobacterium Diversity
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Methylobacterium is a prevalent bacterial genus of the phyllosphere. Despite its ubiquity, little is known about the extent to which its diversity reflects neutral processes like migration and drift, versus environmental filtering of life history strategies and adaptations. In two temperate forests, we investigated how phylogenetic diversity within Methylobacterium is structured by biogeography, seasonality, and growth strategies. Using deep, culture-independent barcoded marker gene sequencing coupled with culture-based approaches, we uncovered a considerable diversity of Methylobacterium in the phyllosphere. We cultured different subsets of Methylobacterium lineages depending upon the temperature of isolation and growth (20°C or 30°C), suggesting long-term adaptation to temperature. To a lesser extent than temperature adaptation, Methylobacterium diversity was also structured across large (.100 km; between forests) and small (,1.2 km; within forests) geographical scales, among host tree species, and was dynamic over seasons. By measuring the growth of 79 isolates during different temperature treatments, we observed contrasting growth performances, with strong lineage- and season-dependent variations in growth strategies. Finally, we documented a progressive replacement of lineages with a high-yield growth strategy typical of cooperative, structured communities in favor of those characterized by rapid growth, resulting in convergence and homogenization of community structure at the end of the growing season. Together, our results show how Methylobacterium is phylogenetically structured into lineages with distinct growth strategies, which helps explain their differential abundance across regions, host tree species, and time. This work paves the way for further investigation of adaptive strategies and traits within a ubiquitous phyllosphere genus. IMPORTANCE Methylobacterium is a bacterial group tied to plants. Despite the ubiquity of methylobacteria and the importance to their hosts, little is known about the processes driving Methylobacterium community dynamics. By combining traditional culture-dependent and -independent (metabarcoding) approaches, we monitored Methylobacterium diversity in two temperate forests over a growing season. On the surface of tree leaves, we discovered remarkably diverse and dynamic Methylobacterium communities over short temporal (from June to October) and spatial (within 1.2 km) scales. Because we cultured different subsets of Methylobacterium diversity depending on the temperature of incubation, we suspected that these dynamics partly reflected climatic adaptation. By culturing strains under laboratory conditions mimicking seasonal variations, we found that diversity and environmental variations were indeed good predictors of Methylobacterium growth performances. Our findings suggest that Methylobacterium community dynamics at the surface of tree leaves results from the succession of strains with contrasting growth strategies in response to environmental variations.

TI  - Geological conditions and exploration potential of shale gas reservoir in Wufeng and Longmaxi Formation of southeastern Sichuan Basin, China
VL  - 191
AB  - The Lower Paleozoic Ordovician Wufeng Formation and the Silurian Longmaxi Formation shale in the southeastern part of Sichuan Basin in China are the key strata for shale gas exploration. In this paper, based on a large number of outcrops, cores and natural gamma spectroscopy logs combined with scanning electron microscopy, geochemical parameter testing and mineral component analysis, the geological conditions and exploration potential of shale gas accumulation were studied in this area, and the relationship between structure and shale gas preservation is discussed. The vertical reduction in the U/Th ratio measured in the outcrop sandstone lenses and core horizontal bedding and observed in the energy spectrum logs indicates that the sedimentary water body transformed from a low-energy anoxic reducing environment to a high-energy oxidizing environment. The TI index and the kerogen carbon isotope indicate that the organic matter type of the shale is mainly type I kerogen. The TOC content of high-quality shale is generally above 2.50%, and the Ro value is between 2.00% and 3.08%. High organic matter abundance, moderate thermal evolution and a large thickness of high-quality shale ensure an adequate supply of hydrocarbon resources. Multiple types of inorganic pores, primary organic pores and pores formed during hydrocarbon generation provide abundant reservoir space for the enrichment of shale gas. The tectonics have an important influence on the preservation of shale gas. Moderate fracture development, a late tectonic uplift time, small-scale tectonic uplift, and high formation pressure coefficient are conducive to the preservation of shale gas, and the gas content and productivity will be higher. Overall, a structural stability zone with a high formation pressure coefficient is a favorable area for shale gas exploration. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Screening of self-assembling of collagen iv fragments into stable structures potentially useful in regenerative medicine
VL  - 22
IS  - 24
AB  - The aim of the research was to check whether it is possible to use fragments of type IV collagen to obtain, as a result of self-assembling, stable spatial structures that could be used to prepare new materials useful in regenerative medicine. Collagen IV fragments were obtained by using DMT/NMM/TosO− as a coupling reagent. The ability to self-organize and form stable spatial structures was tested by the CD method and microscopic techniques. Biological studies covered: resazurin assay (cytotoxicity assessment) on BJ, BJ-5TA and C2C12 cell lines; an alkaline version of the comet assay (genotoxicity), Biolegend Legendplex human inflammation panel 1 assay (SC cell lines, assessment of the inflammation activity) and MTT test to determine the cytotoxicity of the porous materials based on collagen IV fragments. It was found that out of the pool of 37 fragments (peptides 1–33 and 2.1–2.4) reconstructing the outer sphere of collagen IV, nine fragments (peptides: 2, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 25, 26 and 30), as a result of self-assembling, form structures mimicking the structure of the triple helix of native collagens. The stability of spatial structures formed as a result of self-organization at temperatures of 4 °C, 20 °C, and 40 °C was found. The application of the MST method allowed us to determine the Kd of binding of selected fragments of collagen IV to ITGα1β1. The stability of the spatial structures of selected peptides made it possible to obtain porous materials based on their equimolar mixture. The formation of the porous materials was found for cross-linked structures and the material stabilized only by weak interactions. All tested peptides are non-cytotoxic against all tested cell lines. Selected peptides also showed no genotoxicity and no induction of immune system responses. Research on the use of porous materials based on fragments of type IV collagen, able to form stable spatial structures as scaffolds useful in regenerative medicine, will be continued. © 2021 by the authors.

VL  - 34
IS  - 12
SP  - 2513-2523
AB  - One of the best-known biogeographic rules for ectotherms is the temperature-size rule, which asserts that ectotherms produce smaller adults at warmer temperatures. Although this is often true, it has become clear that there is no single process behind the pattern and many exceptions to the rule. To disentangle such complex temperature–size relationships, individual clades must be examined at ecological and evolutionary scales. We examined temperature–size relationships for 2,106 individuals from 64 populations and 40 species of Cephaloleia rolled-leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae; Cassidinae) occurring along two tropical elevational gradients: Barva and the Talamanca Cordillera in Costa Rica, Central America. We tested whether the temperature-size rule applied to interspecific elevational assemblages, intraspecific elevational populations or different rearing temperatures for individual populations. At the interspecific scale, evolutionary history, rather than elevation, explains body size. At the intraspecific scale, only one of seven species followed the temperature–size rule across elevations. When larvae were reared at different temperatures, only one of five populations followed the temperature–size rule. Most populations grew to a fixed size regardless of temperature. Size in Cephaloleia beetles is constrained by their evolutionary history and responds to factors that rarely correlate with temperature. As temperature increases, ectotherms will not universally shrink, but determining if and why their size will change will require further investigation.

TI  - Photovoltaic Fuzzy Logical Control MPPT Based on Adaptive Genetic Simulated Annealing Algorithm-Optimized BP Neural Network
VL  - 10
IS  - 7
AB  - The P–U characteristic curve of the photovoltaic (PV) cell is a single peak curve with only one maximum power point (MPP). However, the fluctuation of the irradiance level and ambient temperature will cause the drift of MPP. In the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm of PV systems, BP neural network (BPNN) has an unstable learning rate and poor performance, while the genetic algorithm (GA) tends to fall into local optimum. Therefore, a novel PV fuzzy MPPT algorithm based on an adaptive genetic simulated annealing-optimized BP neural network (AGSA-BPNN-FLC) is proposed in this paper. First, the adaptive GA is adopted to generate the corresponding population and increase the population diversity. Second, the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is applied to the parent and offspring with a higher fitness value to improve the convergence rate of GA, and the optimal weight threshold of BPNN are updated by GA and SA algorithm. Third, the optimized BPNN is employed to predict the MPP voltage of PV cells. Finally, the fuzzy logical control (FLC) is used to eliminate local power oscillation and improve the robustness of the PV system. The proposed algorithm is applied and compared with GA-BPNN, simulated annealing-genetic (SA-GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimization (GWO) and FLC algorithm under the condition that both the irradiance and temperature change. Simulation results indicate that the proposed MPPT algorithm is superior to the above-mentioned algorithms with efficiency, steady-state oscillation rate, tracking time and stability accuracy, and they have a good universality and robustness. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - A bioenergetics evaluation of temperature-dependent selection for the spawning phenology by Snake River fall Chinook salmon
VL  - 8
IS  - 19
SP  - 9633-9645
AB  - High water temperatures can increase the energetic cost for salmon to migrate and spawn, which can be important for Snake River fall-run Chinook salmon because they migrate great distances (>500 km) at a time when river temperatures (18–24°C) can be above their optimum temperatures (16.5°C). Average river temperatures and random combinations of migration and spawning dates were used to simulate fish travel times and determine the energetic consequences of different thermal experiences during migration. An energy threshold criterion (4 kJ/g) was also imposed on survival and spawning success, which was used to determine how prevailing temperatures might select against certain migration dates and thermal experiences, and in turn, explain the selection for the current spawning phenology of the population. Scenarios of tributary use for thermal refugia under increasing water temperatures (1, 2, and 3°C) were also run to determine which combinations of migration dates, travel rates, and resulting thermal experiences might be most affected by energy exhaustion. As expected, when compared to observations, the model under existing conditions and energy use could explain the onset, but not the end of the observed spawning migration. Simulations of early migrants had greater energy loss than late migrants regardless of the river temperature scenario, but higher temperatures disproportionately selected against a larger fraction of early-migrating fish, although using cold-water tributaries during migration provided a buffer against higher energy use at higher temperatures. The fraction of simulated fish that exceeded the threshold for migration success increased from 58% to 72% as average seasonal river temperatures over baseline temperatures increased. The model supports the conclusion that increases in average seasonal river temperatures as little as 1°C could impose greater thermal constraints on the fish, select against early migrants, and in turn, truncate the onset of the current spawning migration. © 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Polaron assisted electrical transport and fertile field emission response in polycrystalline LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 with theoretical insight by density functional theory
VL  - 891
AB  - Polycrystalline LiCo0.33Ni0.33Mn0.33O2 compounds were prepared via a sol-gel auto combustion synthesis route to examine its conduction mechanism with thermal assessment and a new window of its application as a field emitter is explored. The structural modules and molecular footmarks have been confirmed by XRD, Raman, FTIR, XPS and FESEM techniques. The Nyquist plots (Z' vs. Z '') exhibits significant contribution of electrode solid interface effect with compared to intra and inter granular contribution. The variation of real and imaginary impedance, modulus, and conductivity spectra with thermal evolution is attributed with the creation of a quasi-particle called "polaron" and the migration of small polaron by tunneling/hopping creates localized state in high temperature. However, a weak crossover between small polaron hopping (SPH) and Mott's variable range hopping (VRH) is observed near 323 K. The colossal dielectric permittivity (epsilon'(r))similar to 5 x 10(6) is originated from inhomogeneous electronic conduction process in LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 due to the creation of absorption current in the flimsy grain boundary which leads to the stockpile of charge carriers in the external-electrode sample interface and induces Maxwell-Wagner electrode interfacial polarization. The exquisite field emission properties were discovered in LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 with low turn-on field@ 1 mu A/cm(2)similar to 2.75 V/mu m and threshold field@ 10 mu A/cm(2)similar to 4.39 V/mu m with field enhancement factor (beta) similar to 4251. The structural and electronic properties of LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 and the local work function (phi) similar to 4.94 eV is computed employing the Density functional theory (DFT). It further supports the conduction mechanism due to self-trapping electrons and strong spin polarization of the O-2p state under applied electric field. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Analysis of miRNA-seq in the liver of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) in response to different environmental temperatures
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SP  - 265-280
AB  - Water temperature affects the survival, growth, immunity, reproduction, and productivity of farmed fish. The temperature beyond suitable range will disrupt the normal physiological activity. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) is a representative eurythermic fish; they are able to sense and respond to changes in water temperature by adjusting their physiology. To investigate the miRNAs in common carp at different temperatures, nine liver small-RNA libraries (5 °C, 17 °C, and 30 °C, each group have three biological repetitions) were constructed and sequenced using high-throughput sequencing. A total of 110 known miRNAs were identified. Twenty-nine known miRNAs were differentially expressed compared with in control group. GO and KEGG analysis indicated that the miRNAs may play important roles in metabolism and environment information processing. Specifically, we considered the insulin-signaling and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway, and the results show that in 30 °C, miR-301a, miR-203b-5p, and miR-210-3p were upregulated; their target genes which are the mechanistic targets of the rapamycin kinase (mtor) gene and the protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1 (prkaa1) gene in the insulin-signaling pathway were downregulated. And miR-9-5p, miR-27d, miR-92b-3p, and miR-155 were upregulated; their target genes, 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase 3 (agpat3), CDP-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase (cdipt), glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase mitochondrial (gpam), and phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase 1 (pgs1), in glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway were downregulated. But in 5 °C, the situation was opposite. These findings suggest that significant changes occur in energy metabolism and metabolic processes with components of the cell membrane in different temperatures, which significantly advance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying the physiological change of temperature stress-induced in liver, specifically with regard to miRNAs. These data provide a foundation for further studies of the role of miRNAs in environmental adaptation in fish. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - An empirical test for a zone of canalization in thermal reaction norms
VL  - 31
IS  - 7
SP  - 936-943
AB  - Theoretical models on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity predict a zone of canalization where reaction norms cross, and genetic variation is minimized in the environment a population most frequently encounter. Empirical tests of this prediction are largely missing, in particular for life-history traits. We addressed this prediction by quantifying thermal reaction norms of three life-history traits (somatic growth rate, age and size at maturation) of a Norwegian population of Daphnia magna and testing for the occurrence of an intermediate temperature (Tm) at which genetic variance in the traits is minimized. Size at maturation changed relatively little with temperature compared to the other traits, and there was no genetic variance in the shape of the reaction norm. Consequently, age at maturation and somatic growth rate were strongly negatively correlated. Both traits showed a strong genotype–environment interaction, and the estimated Tm was 14 °C for both age at maturation and growth rate. This value of Tm corresponds well with mean summer temperatures experienced by the population and suggests that the population has evolved under stabilizing selection in temperatures that fluctuate around this mean temperature. These results suggest local adaptation to temperature in the studied population and allow predicting evolutionary trajectories of thermal reaction norms under changing thermal regimes. © 2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - The role of deep geofluids in the enrichment of sedimentary organic matter: A case study of the late ordovician-early silurian in the upper yangtze region and early cambrian in the lower Yangtze region, South China
VL  - 2020
AB  - Organic matter is the material basis for shales to generate hydrocarbon, as well as the main reservoir space and seepage channel for shale gas. When the thermal evolution degree is consistent, the organic carbon content in present shales is subject to the abundance of primitive sedimentary organic matter. Deep geofluids significantly influence the sedimentary organic matter's enrichment, but the mechanism remains unclear. This paper is aimed at determining how hydrothermal and volcanic activities affected the enrichment of sedimentary organic matter by studying lower Cambrian shales in the lower Yangtze region and upper Ordovician-lower Silurian shales. Oxidation-reduction and biological productivity are used as indicators in the study. The result shows that hydrothermal or volcanic activities affected the enrichment of sedimentary organic matter by influencing climate changes and the nutrients' sources on the waterbody's surface and reducing water at the bottom. In the lower Cambrian shales of the Wangyinpu Formation in the lower Yangtze region, hydrothermal origin caused excess silicon. During the sedimentary period of the lower and middle-upper Wangyinpu Formation, vigorous hydrothermal activities increased the biological productivity on the waterbody's surface and intensified the reducibility at the bottom of the waterbody, which enabled the rich sedimentary organic matter to be well preserved. During the sedimentary period of the lower upper Ordovician Wufeng Formation and the lower Silurian Longmaxi Formation in the upper Yangtze region, frequent volcanic activities caused high biological productivity on the waterbody surface and strong reducibility at the bottom of the waterbody. As a result, the abundant organic matter deposited from the water surface can be well preserved. During the sedimentary period of the upper Longmaxi Formation, volcanic activities died down gradually then disappeared, causing the biological productivity on the water surface to decrease. Besides, the small amount of organic matter deposited from the water surface was destroyed due to oxidation. © 2020 Kun Zhang et al.

TI  - Moonlight enhances growth in larval fish
VL  - 100
IS  - 1
AB  - Moonlight mediates trophic interactions and shapes the evolution of life-history strategies for nocturnal organisms. Reproductive cycles and important life-history transitions for many marine organisms coincide with moon phases, but few studies consider the effects of moonlight on pelagic larvae at sea. We evaluated effects of moonlight on growth of pelagic larvae of a temperate reef fish using “master chronologies” of larval growth constructed from age-independent daily increment widths recorded in otoliths of 321 individuals. We found that daily growth rates of fish larvae were enhanced by lunar illumination after controlling for the positive influence of temperature and the negative influence of cloud cover. Collectively, these results indicate that moonlight enhances growth rates of larval fish. This pattern is likely the result of moonlight's combined effects on foraging efficiency and suppression of diel migrations of mesopelagic predators, and has the potential to drive evolution of marine life histories. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America

TI  - Southern introgression increases adaptive immune gene variability in northern range margin populations of Fire-bellied toad
VL  - 11
IS  - 14
SP  - 9776-9790
AB  - Northern range margin populations of the European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) have rapidly declined during recent decades. Extensive agricultural land use has fragmented the landscape, leading to habitat disruption and loss, as well as eutrophication of ponds. In Northern Germany (Schleswig-Holstein) and Southern Sweden (Skåne), this population decline resulted in decreased gene flow from surrounding populations, low genetic diversity, and a putative reduction in adaptive potential, leaving populations vulnerable to future environmental and climatic changes. Previous studies using mitochondrial control region and nuclear transcriptome-wide SNP data detected introgressive hybridization in multiple northern B. bombina populations after unreported release of toads from Austria. Here, we determine the impact of this introgression by comparing the body conditions (proxy for fitness) of introgressed and nonintrogressed populations and the genetic consequences in two candidate genes for putative local adaptation (the MHC II gene as part of the adaptive immune system and the stress response gene HSP70 kDa). We detected regional differences in body condition and observed significantly elevated levels of within individual MHC allele counts in introgressed Swedish populations, associated with a tendency toward higher body weight, relative to regional nonintrogressed populations. These differences were not observed among introgressed and nonintrogressed German populations. Genetic diversity in both MHC and HSP was generally lower in northern than Austrian populations. Our study sheds light on the potential benefits of translocations of more distantly related conspecifics as a means to increase adaptive genetic variability and fitness of genetically depauperate range margin populations without distortion of local adaptation. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Thermal architecture of cratonic India and implications for decratonization of the Western Dharwar Craton: Evidence from mantle xenoliths in the Deccan Traps
VL  - 382
AB  - The mantle beneath the Western Dharwar Craton of the Indian shield comprises a suite of refractory and fertile peridotites and mafic granulites. Detailed petrographic studies coupled with new mineral analysis and geothermobarometric estimations permit to decipher the thermal architecture and get an insight into the evolution of this ancient craton. The refractory rocks are coarse grained harzburgites/dunites, whereas the more fertile ones are at times, porphyroclastic lherzolites. Both show a similar range of equilibration temperatures and pressures indicating intermixing between the two at various levels. The peridotites contain undeformed interstitial REE-enriched clinopyroxene, phlogopite, apatite and carbonates recording post-kinematic modal and cryptic metasomatic events in the Precambrian cratonic lithosphere. Xenoliths of mafic granulite contain layers of clinopyroxenite which also vein the granulite. The P-T range of the granulites overlaps that of the ultramafic rocks. This study in combination with previous investigations reveals a distinct change in the thermal architecture of the craton from a warm/hot geotherm in the Proterozoic to a highly perturbed, still hotter geotherm of the Palaeocene. The Cenozoic thermotectonic rifting episodes heated, refertilized and thinned the bulk of the cratonic lithosphere beneath the Western Dharwar Craton, which has witnessed the most re-activation among cratons of the Indian shield. The waning of the Deccan Traps volcanism in Palaeocene time saw the reworking of ancient cratonic lithosphere and its replacement by non-cratonic, juvenile mantle and magmatic accretions, indicated by compound xenoliths. Differing petrological and geochemical characteristics of refractory xenoliths and fertile lherzolites serve to constrain the relative timing and composition of non-cratonic lithosphere. By the end of the Palaeocene the Western Dharwar Craton was characterised by a thermal high, an attenuated continental lithosphere (60–80 km), and a thin crust (<10- ~ 21 km), reflecting the decratonization of at least the western part of the Western Dharwar Craton. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 10

SP  - 1594-1603
AB  - The interaction between the continuous microstructure evolution during thermal cycling and the long-term reliability of wafer-level chip-scale packages (WLCSPs) with Sn-1.0Ag-0.5Cu (wt%) (SAC105), Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu (wt%) (SAC305), and Sn-3.9Ag-0.6Cu (wt%) (SAC396) solder ball interconnects were investigated. Three different body-sized WLCSP with three different solder alloys on three different board thickness were thermally cycled from 0 °C to 100 °C with 10 min of dwell time, and the microstructure evolution and their impact to the life cycle numbers were identified. Based on both experimental and calculated data, higher Ag contained solder alloys perform better in thermal cycling. However, the comparison between the calculated life cycle and the experimental results revealed mismatch, which is due to the localized recrystallization areal fraction differences. Smaller die WLCSP with 4×4 mm2 and 3.2×3.2 mm2 exhibited a large difference in expected life cycle numbers. The calculated life cycles expected a lower cycle number with thicker boards for both SAC105 and SAC396 WLCSPs, but the experimental data revealed an increase with SAC105 and a similar level of life cycle time with SAC396, for thicker boards. A widely distributed areal fraction of damage accumulation through the solder rows were observed in SAC105 compared with higher Ag solder alloy joints, which show localized damage accumulation at corner joints. The difference of areal recrystallization distribution explains the difference between SAC105 and SAC305/396 thermal cycling behavior between the calculated and experimental thermal cycling results. © 2011-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Population genomics of wild Chinese rhesus macaques reveals a dynamic demographic history and local adaptation, with implications for biomedical research
VL  - 7
IS  - 9
AB  - Background: The rhesus macaque (RM, Macaca mulatta) is the most important nonhuman primate model in biomedical research.We present the first genomic survey of wild RMs, sequencing 81 geo-referenced individuals of five subspecies from 17 locations in China, a large fraction of the species' natural distribution. Results: Populations were structured into five genetic lineages on the mainland and Hainan Island, recapitulating current subspecies designations. These subspecies are estimated to have diverged 125.8 to 51.3 thousand years ago, but feature recent gene flow. Consistent with the expectation of a larger body size in colder climates and smaller body size in warmer climates (Bergman's rule), the northernmost RM lineage (M. m. tcheliensis), possessing the largest body size of all Chinese RMs, and the southernmost lineage (M. m. brevicaudus), with the smallest body size of all Chinese RMs, feature positively selected genes responsible for skeletal development. Further, two candidate selected genes (Fbp1, Fbp2) found in M. m. tcheliensis are involved in gluconeogenesis, potentially maintaining stable blood glucose levels during starvation when food resources are scarce in winter. The tropical subspecies M. m. brevicaudus showed positively selected genes related to cardiovascular function and response to temperature stimuli, potentially involved in tropical adaptation. We found 118 single-nucleotide polymorphisms matching human disease-causing variants with 82 being subspecies specific. Conclusions: These data provide a resource for selection of RMs in biomedical experiments. The demographic history of Chinese RMs and their history of local adaption offer new insights into their evolution and provide valuable baseline information for biomedical investigation. © The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - Survival of the cheapest: How proteome cost minimization drives evolution
AB  - Darwin's theory of evolution emphasized that positive selection of functional proficiency provides the fitness that ultimately determines the structure of life, a view that has dominated biochemical thinking of enzymes as perfectly optimized for their specific functions. The 20th-century modern synthesis, structural biology, and the central dogma explained the machinery of evolution, and nearly neutral theory explained how selection competes with random fixation dynamics that produce molecular clocks essential e.g. for dating evolutionary histories. However, quantitative proteomics revealed that selection pressures not relating to optimal function play much larger roles than previously thought, acting perhaps most importantly via protein expression levels. This paper first summarizes recent progress in the 21st century toward recovering this universal selection pressure. Then, the paper argues that proteome cost minimization is the dominant, underlying 'non-function' selection pressure controlling most of the evolution of already functionally adapted living systems. A theory of proteome cost minimization is described and argued to have consequences for understanding evolutionary trade-offs, aging, cancer, and neurodegenerative protein-misfolding diseases.

TI  - Analytical Estimation of Clutch Life for Manual Transmission
VL  - 2019
AB  - The clutch is the connecting link between engine and the power train. It connects and disconnects the engine to the gearbox as per the wish of the driver. Clutch has a friction disc which acts like a fuse wire which wears in the process of the connection. This paper tries to calculate the clutch life analytically (In terms of Kms. run by vehicle), of automotive vehicles having manual transmission. As the clutch engages and disengages the engine to the gearbox, during this time due to slippage, energy is dissipated which results in the wear of the clutch disc. It calculates life based on the volumetric wear of the clutch disc and wear allowance available. The work done by other people in this domain include the empirical estimation of clutch life based on the past data, effect of the surface topography on the friction characteristics of the wet clutches, modeling of clutch housing and facing temperature for the estimation of the clutch life of a manual transmission etc. The present work simplifies the estimation of clutch performance using fundamental principles, without high end analysis software or past data. It helps to estimate the clutch performance in the concept stage itself thereby saving time and labor making the selection of the right clutch at the very first time. The complete work was done in-house and its purpose was to estimate the life of the clutch in terms of vehicle run in Kms. The results estimated were closely compared with respect to the field data of vehicles. This tool will be of immense help in such a fast changing automotive world where competition is cut-throat and product development time is shrinking continuously. © 2019 SAE International.

VL  - 130

SP  - 1758-1769
AB  - Aims: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of Cronobacter strains isolated from foods (n = 50) and clinical samples (n = 6) in Brazil and genotype selected strains (n = 18) using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Methods and Results: The cytotoxic activity of C. sakazakii (n = 29), C. dublinensis (n = 13), C. malonaticus (n = 6), C. turicensis (n = 6) and C. muytjensii (n = 2) was screened using Vero, RK13, Hep2c, NCTC clone 929 and BHK-21 cell lines. Selected Cronobacter strains were assigned to C. sakazakii ST 21, C. turicensis ST 252, C. sakazakii ST 647, and three newly assigned STs: C. turicensis STs 738–740. The maximum death caused by non-heat-treated filtrates was 20·4, 86·2, 47·0 and 84·0%, in Vero, RK13, Hep2c and NCTC clone 929 cells, respectively. These were caused by C. sakazakii strains C291 and C292 (ST 494) which had been isolated during neonatal Cronobacter meningitis infection, and C110 (ST 395) isolated from flaxseed flour. Thermal treatment (100°C/20 min) significantly reduced the cytotoxicity activity in NCTC clone 929 and Vero cells (P ≤ 2 × 10−6), but not in RK13 (P = 0·12) and Hep2c (P = 0·85), indicating the cytotoxin(s) were probably proteinaceous. Electron microscopy revealed that cytotoxic compounds from C. sakazakii induced several cell death characteristics, including loss of cell–cell contact, microvilli reduction and cellular lysis. Autophagic vacuoles and mitochondrial damage were the most common ultrastructural features observed. Conclusions: It was concluded that Cronobacter strains, especially C. sakazakii, could produce heat-labile cytotoxic compounds in cell filtrates. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study providing insights into the pathogenesis of the Cronobacter genus. Cytotoxins were identified in excreted filtrates of C. sakazakii strains isolated from food and clinical specimens. The presence of Cronobacter strains that can produce cytotoxins in foods can be a potential threat to human health and highlight the need for high levels of hygiene. © 2020 The Society for Applied Microbiology

TI  - Developmental timing of Drosophila pachea pupae is robust to temperature changes
VL  - 106
AB  - Rearing temperature is correlated with the timing and speed of development in a wide range of poikiloterm animals that do not regulate their body temperature. However, exceptions exist, especially in species that live in environments with high temperature extremes or oscillations. Drosophila pachea is endemic to the Sonoran desert in Mexico, in which temperatures and temperature variations are extreme. We wondered if the developmental timing in D. pachea may be sensitive to differing rearing temperatures or if it remains constant. We determined the overall timing of the Drosophila pachea life-cycle at different temperatures. The duration of pupal development was similar at 25 °C, 29 °C and 32 °C, although the relative progress differed at particular stages. Thus, D. pachea may have evolved mechanisms to buffer temperature effects on developmental speed, potentially to ensure proper development and individual's fitness in desert climate conditions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Evolutionary stabilization of cooperative toxin production through a bacterium-plasmid-phage interplay
VL  - 11
IS  - 4
SP  - 1-18
AB  - Colicins are toxins produced and released by Enterobacteriaceae to kill competitors in the gut. While group A colicins employ a division of labor strategy to liberate the toxin into the environment via colicin-specific lysis, group B colicin systems lack cognate lysis genes. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm), the group B colicin Ib (ColIb) is released by temperate phage-mediated bacteriolysis. Phage-mediated ColIb release promotes S. Tm fitness against competing Escherichia coli. It remained unclear how prophage-mediated lysis is realized in a clonal population of ColIb producers and if prophages contribute to evolutionary stability of toxin release in S. Tm. Here, we show that prophage-mediated lysis occurs in an S. Tm subpopulation only, thereby introducing phenotypic heterogeneity to the system. We established a mathematical model to study the dynamic interplay of S. Tm, ColIb, and a temperate phage in the presence of a competing species. Using this model, we studied long-term evolution of phage lysis rates in a fluctuating infection scenario. This revealed that phage lysis evolves as bet-hedging strategy that maxi-mizes phage spread, regardless of whether colicin is present or not. We conclude that the ColIb system, lacking its own lysis gene, is making use of the evolutionary stable phage strategy to be released. Prophage lysis genes are highly prevalent in nontyphoidal Salmonella genomes. This suggests that the release of ColIb by temperate phages is widespread. In conclusion, our findings shed new light on the evolution and ecology of group B colicin systems. IMPORTANCE Bacteria are excellent model organisms to study mechanisms of social evolution. The production of public goods, e.g., toxin release by cell lysis in clonal bacterial populations, is a frequently studied example of cooperative behavior. Here, we analyze evolutionary stabilization of toxin release by the enteric pathogen Sal-monella. The release of colicin Ib (ColIb), which is used by Salmonella to gain an edge against competing microbiota following infection, is coupled to bacterial lysis mediated by temperate phages. Here, we show that phage-dependent lysis and subsequent release of colicin and phage particles occurs only in part of the ColIb-expressing Salmonella population. This phenotypic heterogeneity in lysis, which rep-resents an essential step in the temperate phage life cycle, has evolved as a bet-hedging strategy under fluctuating environments such as the gastrointestinal tract. Our findings suggest that prophages can thereby evolutionarily stabilize costly toxin release in bacterial populations. © 2020 Spriewald et al.

TI  - Current challenges for trait economic values in animal breeding
VL  - 65

AB  - Modern selection approaches are expected to bring about the cumulative and permanent improvement of animal performance and profitability of animal production. Breeding values of traits along with trait economic values (EVs) are utilised for economic selection purposes with many species all over the world. Currently, some challenges related to trait EVs in animal breeding should be considered. First, the selection response based on the higher accuracy of genomic selection may be reduced due to improper weighting of the trait breeding values of selection candidates. A comprehensive approach applied in bioeconomic models allows suitable trait EV calculations. Further challenges comprise the new breeding objectives associated with climate change, environmental mitigation and animal adaptability. The estimation of EVs for traits influencing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been mostly based on including the value of CO2 emission equivalent in the trait EVs, on calculating EVs for feed efficiency traits and on methane yield as a direct trait of GHG emission. Genetic improvement of production, functional, feed efficiency and methane traits through the application of multi-trait selection indices was found to be crucial for mitigation of emissions and farm profitability. Defining the non-market values of traits connected with climate protection could be a useful solution for including these traits in an economic breeding objective. While GHG emissions mostly change the costs per unit of production, animal adaptability in its complexity influences animal performance. Clear definitions of disease, fertility, mortality and other breeding objective traits allow the proper calculation of trait EVs, and an accurate estimation of trait genetic parameters could lead to sufficient economic selection response. This complex approach could be beneficial for more effective utilisation of inputs and overall economic and environmental sustainability of animal production. © 2020 Czech Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

TI  - Intraspecific ecological niche divergence and reproductive shifts foster cytotype displacement and provide ecological opportunity to polyploids
VL  - 121
IS  - 6
SP  - 1183-1196
AB  - Background and Aims Niche divergence between polyploids and their lower ploidy progenitors is one of the primary mechanisms fostering polyploid establishment and adaptive divergence. However, within-species chromosomal and reproductive variability have usually been neglected in community ecology and biodiversity analyses even though they have been recognized to play a role in the adaptive diversification of lineages. Methods We used Paspalum intermedium, a grass species with diverging genetic systems (diploidy vs. autopolyploidy, allogamy vs. autogamy and sexuality vs. apomixis), to recognize the causality of biogeographic patterns, adaptation and ecological flexibility of cytotypes. Chromosome counts and flow cytometry were used to characterize within-species genetic systems diversity. Environmental niche modelling was used to evaluate intraspecific ecological attributes associated with environmental and climatic factors and to assess correlations among ploidy, reproductive modes and ecological conditions ruling species' population dynamics, range expansion, adaptation and evolutionary history. Key Results Two dominant cytotypes non-randomly distributed along local and regional geographical scales displayed niche differentiation, a directional shift in niche optima and signs of disruptive selection on ploidyrelated ecological aptitudes for the exploitation of environmental resources. Ecologically specialized allogamous sexual diploids were found in northern areas associated with higher temperature, humidity and productivity, while generalist autogamous apomictic tetraploids occurred in southern areas, occupying colder and less productive environments. Four localities with a documented shift in ploidy and four mixed populations in a zone of ecological transition revealed an uneven replacement between cytotypes. Conclusions Polyploidy and contrasting reproductive traits between cytotypes have promoted shifts in niche optima, and increased ecological tolerance and niche divergence. Ecologically specialized diploids maintain cytotype stability in core areas by displacing tetraploids, while broader ecological preferences and a shift from sexuality to apomixis favoured polyploid colonization in peripheral areas where diploids are displaced, and fostered the ecological opportunity for autotetraploids supporting range expansion to open southern habitats. © The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - Genomic Insights of Cryobacterium Isolated From Ice Core Reveal Genome Dynamics for Adaptation in Glacier
VL  - 11
AB  - Glacier is the dominant cold habitat in terrestrial environments, providing a model ecosystem to explore extremophilic strategies and study early lives on Earth. The dominant form of life in glaciers is bacteria. However, little is known about past evolutionary processes that bacteria underwent during adaptation to the cryosphere and the connection of their genomic traits to environmental stressors. Aiming to test the hypothesis that bacterial genomic content and dynamics are driven by glacial environmental stressors, we compared genomes of 21 psychrophilic Cryobacterium strains, including 14 that we isolated from three Tibetan ice cores, to their mesophilic counterparts from the same family Microbacteriaceae of Actinobacteria. The results show that psychrophilic Cryobacterium underwent more dynamic changes in genome content, and their genomes have a significantly higher number of genes involved in stress response, motility, and chemotaxis than their mesophilic counterparts (P < 0.05). The phylogenetic birth-and-death model imposed on the phylogenomic tree indicates a vast surge in recent common ancestor of psychrophilic Cryobacterium (gained the greatest number of genes by 1,168) after the division of the mesophilic strain Cryobacterium mesophilum. The expansion in genome content brought in key genes primarily of the categories “cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments,” “monosaccharides metabolism,” and “membrane transport.” The amino acid substitution rates of psychrophilic Cryobacterium strains are two orders of magnitude lower than those in mesophilic strains. However, no significantly higher number of cold shock genes was found in psychrophilic Cryobacterium strains, indicating that multi-copy is not a key factor for cold adaptation in the family Microbacteriaceae, although cold shock genes are indispensable for psychrophiles. Extensive gene acquisition and low amino acid substitution rate might be the strategies of psychrophilic Cryobacterium to resist low temperature, oligotrophy, and high UV radiation on glaciers. The exploration of genome evolution and survival strategies of psychrophilic Cryobacterium deepens our understanding of bacterial cold adaptation. © Copyright © 2020 Liu, Shen, Zeng, Xing, Xu and Wang.

TI  - The relationship between mantle potential temperature and oceanic lithosphere buoyancy
VL  - 518
SP  - 86-99
AB  - The Earth's mantle potential temperature (T-p) is thought to have cooled by similar to 250 degrees C since the Archean, causing a progressive change in both the structure and composition of oceanic lithosphere. These variables affect the negative buoyancy of subducting slabs, which is known to be an important force in driving plate motions. However, the relationship between T-p and slab buoyancy remains unclear. Here, we model the formation and subduction of oceanic lithosphere as a function of T-p, to investigate how T-p influences the buoyancy of subducting slabs, and by extension how buoyancy forces may have changed through time. First, we simulate isentropic melting of peridotite at mid-ocean ridges over a range of T-p (1300-1550 degrees C) to calculate oceanic lithosphere structure and composition. Second, we model the thermal evolution of oceanic plates undergoing subduction for a variety of scenarios (by varying lithospheric thickness, slab length and subduction velocity). Finally, we integrate the structural, compositional and thermal constraints to forward model subduction metamorphism of oceanic plates to determine downgoing slab density structures. When compared with ambient mantle, these models allow us to calculate buoyancy forces acting on subducting slabs. Our results indicate that oceanic lithosphere derived from hotter mantle has a greater negative buoyancy, and therefore subduction potential, than lithosphere derived from cooler mantle for a wide range of subduction scenarios. With respect to the early Earth, this conclusion supports the viability of subduction, and models of subduction zone initiation that invoke the concept of oceanic lithosphere being primed to subduct. However, we also show that decreases to lithosphere thickness and slab length, and reduced crustal hydration, progressively reduce slab negative buoyancy. These results highlight the need for robust estimates of early Earth lithospheric properties when considering whether subduction was operative at this time. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that subduction processes on the early Earth may have been uniformitarian. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 91

SP  - 673-681
AB  - The thermal environment of embryos differs significantly along a latitudinal cline, and the mechanism by which embryos respond to this geographic temperature variation has attracted increasing attention recently. Here, we carried out a commongarden experiment of egg incubation at two fluctuating temperature regimes to elucidate the latitudinal pattern and thermal dependence of the embryonic development rate and offspring performance in theChinese soft-shelled turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis). Our results demonstrated significant temperature-by-population interactions on variations in the incubation period and hatchling righting response.The incubationperiod wasshorter and the daily number of heart beats was higher in the medium-and highlatitude populations than in the low-latitude population at low incubation temperatures but not at high temperatures. Offspring fromthe medium-and high-latitude populations showed a faster righting response than those from the low-latitude population when incubated at low temperatures, whereas offspring from the high-latitude population showed a faster righting response than those from the medium-latitude population when incubated at high temperatures. This indicates that turtle embryos from different latitudinal locations may have evolved divergent thermal sensitivities of embryonic development in response to their respective nest environments. © 2018, University of Chicago Press.

VL  - 146

SP  - 2049-2057
AB  - Rock phosphate is the fundamental component for the manufacture of phosphoric acid and phosphate fertilizers. The aim of this study is to predict how sample preparation of Kef Essennoun phosphate responds to heat treatment and to estimate the purity of the raw and calcined phosphates. The influence of temperature (600–900 °C) was evaluated. The evolution of thermal treatment and the characterization of the Kef Essennoun ore (Djebel Onk mine, Algeria) were carried out by various analytical techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the raw phosphate is a mixture of six phases, of which carbonate hydroxyapatite [Ca10(PO4)3(CO3)3(OH)2] is the dominant phase. With heat treatment, at 700 °C, a fluorapatite [Ca5(PO4)3F] phase appeared, as confirmed by XRD analysis, with good crystallization indicated by SEM. The P2O5 content was increased from 28.389% in raw phosphate to 31.085% in the calcined product. The dissolution of the calcined phosphate at 900 °C was completed by HNO3 acid attack, and occurred rapidly at ambient temperature. The results show that the production of phosphoric acid by Ca5(PO4)3F was more easily achieved with optimized consumption of the acid attack. © 2020, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.

AB  - Herbicide-resistant weeds, especially those with resistance to multiple herbicides, represent a growing worldwide threat to agriculture and food security. Natural selection for resistant genotypes may act on standing genetic variation, or on a genetic and physiological background that is fundamentally altered because of stress responses to sublethal herbicide exposure. Stress-induced changes include DNA mutations, epigenetic alterations, transcriptional remodeling, and protein modifications, all of which can lead to herbicide resistance and a wide range of pleiotropic effects. Resistance selected in this manner is termed systemic acquired herbicide resistance, and the associated pleiotropic effects are manifested as a suite of constitutive transcriptional and post-translational changes related to biotic and abiotic stress adaptation, representing the evolutionary signature of selection. This phenotype is being investigated in two multiple herbicide-resistant populations of the hexaploid, self-pollinating weedy monocot Avena fatua that display such changes as well as constitutive reductions in certain heat shock proteins and their transcripts, which are well known as global regulators of diverse stress adaptation pathways. Herbicide-resistant populations of most weedy plant species exhibit pleiotropic effects, and their association with resistance genes presents a fertile area of investigation. This review proposes that more detailed studies of resistant A. fatua and other species through the lens of plant evolution under stress will inform improved resistant weed prevention and management strategies. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

TI  - Petrology and U–Pb geochronology of high-grade metavolcano-sedimentary rocks from central Xolapa Complex, southern Mexico
VL  - 378
AB  - The Xolapa Complex (XC) is a high-grade metamorphic belt exposed along the southern margin of the North American plate in Mexico. Its evolution includes an episode of widespread anatexis related to crustal thickening and subsequent uplift to upper crustal levels, which culminated in the Paleocene. On the basis of field and petrographic work, this study integrates a petrological modelling approach with LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon and monazite geochronology to elucidate the tectonothermal evolution of this metamorphic belt. The study area in central XC includes a suite of alternating migmatitic paragneiss and garnet-bearing mafic schist. Petrological evidence and phase equilibria calculations demonstrate that a staurolite-kyanite grade metamorphism occurred at-640-670 degrees C and 8-9 kbar before extensive migmatization took place. Differential anatexis of fertile and refractory layers occurred progressively via biotite and amphibole dehydration-melting reactions, and continued during peak metamorphism at granulite-facies conditions of-800-820 degrees C and-5-7 kbar. According to Ti-in-zircon thermometry, melt generation/mobilization progressed during cooling until crystallize at-700 degrees C. The age of pro grade metamorphism was likely recorded by monazite cores that give midto Late Cretaceous ages. Cooling and melt crystallization could be constrained by leucosome zircon dated at 61.80.6 Ma. Both zircon and low-Y monazite from whole rock and melanosome portions, respectively, are consistent with an episode of growth around 60.9 +/- 0.5 Ma. Monazite, however, would have continued its crystallization process for a period of ca. 10 Ma. Thin zircon and high-Y monazite rims show ages between-34-25 Ma and are interpreted to reflect a stage of reheating by magmatic advection related to large Oligocene plutonism in the region. Age and nature of central XC basement show good correlation with other Early-Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary basins of central and southern Mexico. A period of crustal thickening would have buried the sequence at depths of-30 km, causing Barrovian-type metamorphism during midto Late Cretaceous time and eventually, anatexis that evolved at granulite-facies conditions during orogenic collapse in the Paleocene (>= 62 Ma). The time span from leucosome crystallization to late-stage reheating in central XC would imply a protracted high-temperature evolution indicating a middleto upper-crustal residence time of at least ca. 30 Ma.

AB  - Interactions between environmental factors and complex life-history characteristics of marine organisms produce the genetic diversity and structure observed within species. Our main goal was to test for genetic differentiation among eastern oyster populations from the coastal region of Canadian Maritimes against expected genetic homogeneity caused by historical events, taking into account spatial and environmental (temperature, salinity, turbidity) variation. This was achieved by genotyping 486 individuals originating from 13 locations using RADSeq. A total of 11,321 filtered SNPs were used in a combination of population genomics and environmental association analyses. We revealed significant neutral genetic differentiation (mean F ST  = 0.009) between sampling locations, and the occurrence of six major genetic clusters within the studied system. Redundancy analyses (RDAs) revealed that spatial and environmental variables explained 3.1% and 4.9% of the neutral genetic variation and 38.6% and 12.2% of the putatively adaptive genetic variation, respectively. These results indicate that these environmental factors play a role in the distribution of both neutral and putatively adaptive genetic diversity in the system. Moreover, polygenic selection was suggested by genotype–environment association analysis and significant correlations between additive polygenic scores and temperature and salinity. We discuss our results in the context of their conservation and management implications for the eastern oyster. © 2018 The Authors. Evolutionary Applications published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Microporosity and parent body of the rubble-pile NEA (162173) Ryugu
VL  - 358
AB  - Both observations of C-type near-Earth asteroids and laboratory investigations of carbonaceous chondritic meteorites provide strong evidence for a high microporosity of C-type asteroids. Boulder microporosity values derived from in-situ measurements at the surface of the rubble-pile NEA (162173) Ryugu are as high as 55 %, which is substantially higher than for water-rich carbonaceous chondrite samples and could indicate distinct evolution paths for the parent body of Ryugu and parent bodies of carbonaceous chondrites, despite spectral similarities. In the present study, we calculate the evolution of the temperature and porosity for early solar system's planetesimals in order to constrain the range of parameters that result in microporosities compatible with Ryugu's high-porosity material and likely burial depths for the boulders observed at the surface. By varying key properties of the parent body, such as accretion time t(0) and radius R that have strong influence on temperature and porosity and by comparing the interior porosity distribution with the measured boulder micro-porosity, hydration, and partial dehydration of the material, we constrain a field within the (R, t(0))-diagram appropriate for bodies that are likely to have produced such material. Our calculations indicate a parent body size of only a few km and its early accretion within less than or similar to 2 - 3 Myr after the formation of Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs). A gradual final porosity profile of best-fit bodies indicates production of both low- and high-density boulders from the parent body material. By contrast, parent body properties for CI and CM chondrites obtained by fitting carbonate formation data indicate a radius of approximate to 20 - 25 km and an accretion time of approximate to 3.75 Myr after CAIs. These results imply a population of km-sized early accreting highly porous planetesimals as parent bodies of the rubble-pile NEA Ryugu (and, potentially, other NEAs) and a population of larger and late accreting less porous planetesimals as parent bodies of water-rich carbonaceous chondrites.

VL  - 166

AB  - There is growing evidence of a range of theoretical and applied Indigenous climate change adaptation strategies, yet analyses of African examples are generally focused at single local spatial scales, with limited description of how they have evolved over time. Drawing from research across three districts in northern Ghana, this study employs a mixed-methods approach and an interpretivist framework to develop understanding of how farmers are implementing Indigenous adaptation strategies in response to climate change risks at both household and community scales. Farmers are perceiving multiple climate risks such as increased temperatures, erratic rainfall and prolonged droughts, which are disrupting cropping calendars and decreasing productivity. In response to those impacts, farming households are utilising Indigenous knowledge to individually implement diverse strategies such as rainwater harvesting, relocation of farms to water sources, neem leaf extract and organic manure applications, while communities are collectively engaging in congregational prayers, rituals for rainmaking, taboos, investment in local irrigation systems and tree planting. Farmers’ adaptation strategies are evolving over time, as many people are integrating Indigenous practices with modern knowledge and technologies to facilitate improvements in irrigation, organic manure application, planting drought-resistant crops, agroforestry and crop diversification. Decision-makers in local, regional and national government institutions could work to design multi-scalar adaptation interventions that support the integration of Indigenous and modern knowledge to address the complexity of climate change risks across different scales to promote sustainable livelihoods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

VL  - 39
IS  - 5
AB  - Climatic variation is a key driver of genetic differentiation and phenotypic traits evolution, and local adaptation to temperature is expected in widespread species. We investigated phenotypic and genomic changes in the native range of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus. We first refine the phylogeographic structure based on genome-wide regions (1,901 double-digest restriction-site associated DNA single nucleotide polymophisms [ddRAD SNPs]) from 41 populations. We then explore the patterns of cold adaptation using phenotypic traits measured in common garden (wing size and cold tolerance) and genotype-Temperature associations at targeted candidate regions (51,706 exon-capture SNPs) from nine populations. We confirm the existence of three evolutionary lineages including clades A (Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos), B (China and Okinawa), and C (South Korea and Japan). We identified temperature-Associated differentiation in 15 out of 221 candidate regions but none in ddRAD regions, supporting the role of directional selection in detected genes. These include genes involved in lipid metabolism and a circadian clock gene. Most outlier SNPs are differently fixed between clades A and C, whereas clade B has an intermediate pattern. Females are larger at higher latitude yet produce no more eggs, which might favor the storage of energetic reserves in colder climate. Nondiapausing eggs from temperate populations survive better to cold exposure than those from tropical populations, suggesting they are protected from freezing damages but this cold tolerance has a fitness cost in terms of egg viability. Altogether, our results provide strong evidence for the thermal adaptation of A. albopictus across its wide temperature range. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

VL  - 83
IS  - 2
SP  - 93-101
AB  - Chile is a country that presents a variety of thermal environments under which diverse species of amphibians reside. For these, the environmental temperature (Ta) is important since it affects their body temperature (Tb). Due to the high phenotypic plasticity of this taxa, the aclimation temperature to which they are exposed in captive conditions can influence their thermal responses. In addition, body size and/ or mass may influence such behavior, and therefore, sexual dimorphism may differentiate Tc. Based on the above, Pleurodema thaul is an optimal object of study to evaluate thermal behavior since it presents sexual dimorphism in body size, and a strong influence of acclimation temperature on behavior. To analyze this association, individuals were collected in the commune of Antuco (Biobío Region) and subjected to two acclimation temperatures (10º and 20°C). Their size, mass, Tb and selected temperature (Tsel) were compared. The results show that in thermally homogeneous environments P. thaul is a tigmothermal species with a thermo-conformist behavior. The acclimation temperature did not present a significant effect on its behavior and they selected a wide thermal range with an average over 24°C where there were no significant differences between the sexes. © 2019 The author(s).

VL  - 161
SP  - 171-191
AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to describe the mental health effects of high ambient temperatures and heat waves, determine whether heat-related morbidity and mortality are increased among people with known mental disorders and identify knowledge gaps to inform targeting of future research. Study design: Systematic literature review and narrative synthesis. Methods: A systematic review of published literature using MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO without geographical or temporal limits was conducted. We included studies that explicitly linked high ambient temperatures and/or heat waves to mental health outcomes. Evidence was graded using a National Institute of Health framework. Results: A total of 35 studies were included in the review, among which 34 were observational studies and one was a case-control study. Six broad mental health outcome categories were identified: suicide and heat; bipolar disorder, mania and depression and heat; schizophrenia and heat; organic mental health outcomes and heat including dementia; alcohol and substance misuse and heat; and multiple mental health outcomes/mental health service usage and heat. The studies included were heterogeneous in terms of study design, population, setting, exposure measures, outcomes and location making meta-analysis unfeasible. Fifteen studies showed an increased suicide risk with heat (relative risk [RR] 1.014-1.37 per 1 degrees C, P < 0.05; r = 0.10-0.64, P < 0.05). Increased risks of mental health-related admissions and emergency department visits at higher temperatures were also found. No evidence of change in community care use was found. Evidence for the impact of heat on other mental health outcomes was mixed. Conclusions: High ambient temperatures have a range of mental health effects. The strongest evidence was found for increased suicide risk. Limited evidence was found for an increase in heat-related morbidity and mortality among people with known mental health problems. Knowledge gaps exist on the impact of high temperatures on many common mental health disorders. Mental health impacts should be incorporated into plans for the public health response to high temperatures, and as evidence evolves, psychological morbidity and mortality temperature thresholds should be incorporated into hot weather -warning systems.

VL  - 601
AB  - This study reconstructs the climatic and oceanographic changes from 13 to 4 Ma at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Sites 999 (Caribbean) and 1241 (East Pacific) during Panama Isthmus closure. We used lipid biomarkers as marine production indicators and organic proxies (U37K´ and TEX86H) to estimate ocean surface and thermocline temperatures. Enhanced terrestrial input during the first 3 Ma of the record, possibly coupled to tectonic processes, may have triggered higher surface productivity at both sides of the Isthmus. Even though marine production is generally higher in the tropical Pacific, a peak in alkenone production at 12.4–10.6 Ma indicates unrestricted inflow of nutrient-rich waters into the Caribbean. Higher production is observed during the global late Miocene biogenic bloom (LMBB 8–4.5 Ma) coupled to enhanced nutrients from terrestrial sources and/or upwelling. We find a good correspondence between U37K´ and modern sea surface temperature (SST). The TEX86H is a good tracer for thermocline values, however, the deeper Thaumarchaeota distribution in the Caribbean may result in an underestimation of absolute temperatures at ODP Site 999. None the less, temperature records at both Sites show similar trends coupled to global climate dynamics, therefore Isthmus build up did not significantly affect surface or thermocline temperatures at a regional level. Globally reported decreasing temperatures during the late Miocene and early Pliocene coupled to decreasing CO2 levels are registered at both Sites down to at least 200 m. The late Miocene warm period (LMWP 9.5–7 Ma), late Miocene cold period (LMC 7–5.4 Ma) and the Pliocene warm period (PWP 4–3.5 Ma) are reflected by our temperature records confirming global climate is the main driver of temperature evolution in the study area. The reconstructed temperatures are mainly coupled to atmospheric forcing in the Caribbean, with a deviation possibly due to inflow of colder Pacific intermediate waters. While at ODP Site 1241 temperatures are mainly controlled by global climate, the Site also reflects changes in the water column as it migrates interacting with the complex current structure of the tropical Pacific. Decoupled temperature patterns at both Sites are related with differential changes in water column structure partially masking the climatic signal. Therefore, we could establish that while tectonic processes and related terrestrial input increases as well as upwelling control production and water column structure, climate in the study area remained tuned to global patterns regardless of Isthmus closure stage. © 2022 The Author(s)

VL  - 29

SP  - 59-72
AB  - Global warming and human activities increase the frequency and scope of marine low-oxygen environments, and hypoxia has a significant impact on marine benthic communities. Benthic foraminifera, among a few eukaryotes, can widely adapt to and survive in various marine low-oxygen environments, and the response of benthic foraminifera to hypoxia and the adaptation mechanisms are hot topics in marine research with many unsolved mysteries. This article summarizes the distribution characteristics of living foraminifera in various marine hypoxic environments and their response to artificially induced hypoxic environment, chemical composition characteristics of benthic foraminiferal shells in hypoxic environment, and survival mechanisms of foraminifera in hypoxic environments, seeking to provide a reference for future research on benthic foraminifera under marine hypoxic environment. Benthic foraminifera, as an important tool for the reconstruction of the ancient marine environment, are of great significance to our understanding of the evolutionary history of ocean hypoxia. Looking forward, future researches should focus on cellular, molecular and physiological investigation of the mechanisms of foraminiferal adaptation to hypoxic environment as well as gaining phylogenic insights into the historical evolutionary processes of eukaryotic adaptation to hypoxic environment, so as to provide a theoretical basis for using foraminifera as a tool to better reconstruct and predict changes under hypoxic conditions. © 2022 Science Frontiers editorial department.

TI  - Evidence of Wing Shape Sexual Dimorphism in Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus in Mallorca, Spain
VL  - 9
AB  - The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1894) is a highly invasive species widely distributed on the Spanish Mediterranean coast and the Balearic archipelago. Most studies involving this species in Spain have been focused on surveillance and control methods. However, micro-evolutionary studies for Ae. albopictus in Spain have been traditionally neglected. Morphological diversity could be the result of long-term evolutionary diversification in responses to selective pressures such as temperature, precipitation, food availability, predation, or competition that may influence flight activity, host-seeking, and blood-feeding behavior. Wing geometric morphometric have been used not only to study micro- and macro-evolution in mosquitoes but also in studies of population structuring and sexual dimorphism. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to investigate the wing shape patterns of Ae. albopictus populations to unveil sexual dimorphism that could provide information about their ecology and behavior. Mosquito eggs were collected using oviposition traps at the main campus of the University of the Balearic Islands (Palma de Mallorca, Spain) and reared under laboratory conditions. In order to study wing shape variation patterns in Ae. albopictus males and females, the left wing of each adult mosquito was removed and analyzed based on 18 landmarks. Our results indicated strong levels of sexual dimorphism between Ae. albopictus males and females. Furthermore, according to the cross-validated reclassification test, males were correctly distinguished from females with an accuracy of 84% and females from males 75%. We observed a significant sexual dimorphism in the wing shape patterns of Ae. albopictus when considering different seasonal patterns (spring vs. autumn). Our results suggested that selective pressures may affect males differently to females. Host-seeking, blood-feeding, and oviposition behavior of females may act as a major driver for wing shape sexual dimorphism. These results should be considered for the development of more effective and targeted mosquito control strategies. © Copyright © 2021 López-Mercadal, Barretto Bruno Wilke, Barceló and Miranda.

TI  - Future temperature-related mortality considering physiological and socioeconomic adaptation: a modelling framework
VL  - 6
IS  - 10
SP  - e784-e792
AB  - Background: As the climate changes, it is crucial to focus not only on mitigation measures but also on building climate change resilience by developing efficient adaptation strategies. Although population adaptation is a major determinant of future climate-related health burden, it is not well accounted for in studies that project the health impact of climate change. We propose a methodological framework for temperature-related mortality that incorporates two simultaneous adaptation-sensitivity pathways: the physiological pathway, considering both heat adaptation and cold sensitivity, and the socioeconomic pathway, which is influenced by changes in future adaptive capacities. To demonstrate its utility we apply the framework to a case study mortality time-series dataset from Bavaria, Germany. Methods: In this modelling framework, we used extrapolated location-specific and age-specific baseline exposure–response functions and propose different future scenarios of cold sensitivity and heat adaptation on the basis of varying slopes of these exposure–response functions. We also incorporated future socioeconomic adaptation in the exposure–response functions using projections of gross domestic product under the respective shared socioeconomic pathways. Future adaptable fractions, representing the deaths avoided under each of the future scenarios, are projected under combinations of two climate change scenarios (shared socioeconomic pathway [SSP]1–2.6 and SSP3–7.0) and the respective plausible population projection scenarios (SSP1 and SSP3), also incorporating the future changes in demographic age structure and mortality. The case study for this framework was done for five districts in Bavaria, for both total non-accidental mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality. The baseline data was obtained for the period 1990–2006, and the future period was defined as 2083–99. Findings: In our Bavaria case study, average temperature was projected to increase by 2099 by an average of 1·1°C under SSP1–2.6 and by 4·1°C under SSP3–7.0. We observed the adaptable fraction to be largely influenced by socioeconomic adaptation for both total mortality and cardiovascular disease mortality, and for both climate change scenarios. For example, for total mortality, the highest adaptable fraction of 18·56% (95% empirical CI 10·77–23·67) was observed under the SSP1–2.6 future scenario, in the presence of socioeconomic adaptation and under the highest heat adaptation (10%) provided the cold sensitivity remains 0%. The cold adaptable fraction is lower than the heat adaptable fraction under all scenarios. In the absence of socioeconomic adaptation, population ageing will lead to higher temperature-related mortality. Interpretation: Our developed framework helps to systematically understand the effectiveness of adaptation mechanisms. In the future, socioeconomic adaptation is estimated to play a major role in determining temperature-related excess mortality. Furthermore, cold sensitivity might outweigh heat adaptation in the majority of locations worldwide. Similarly, population ageing is projected to continue to determine future temperature-related mortality. Funding: EU Horizon 2020 (EXHAUSTION). © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Thermotolerance and acclimation in the immature stages of Aedes aegypti (L) (Diptera: Culicidae) to simulated thermal stress
VL  - 41
IS  - 1
SP  - 333-344
AB  - Temperature tolerance is an important factor limiting the distribution of arthropod vectors, with limited information on the ability of mosquitoes to evolve different temperature levels. Under laboratorial conditions effect of thermal stress in late third instar larvae ofAedes aegyptidetermined by subjecting them to temperature regimes such as 37 degrees C, 39 degrees C, 41 degrees C, 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C, and the lethal time required to inflict mortality of 50% (LT50) and 90% (LT90) were also computed. To understand the adaptive thermotolerance in immature stages ofAe.aegypti, late third instar larvae were exposed to 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C, and these larvae were further re-exposed to temperatures 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C respectively. The median mortality of the larvae exposed to sub-lethal temperatures at 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C was 140 and 30 min respectively. While the median mortality for the larvae adapted at 39 degrees C and exposed to 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C was 230 and 50 min. All the larvae exposed at 39 degrees C were survived up to 420 min whereas at 45 degrees C within 60 min of exposure time 100% mortality was observed. Larvae pre-adapted at 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C were re-exposed to 43 degrees C and 45 degrees C and it was observed that larvae pre-adapted at 39 degrees C were more thermotolerant than larvae pre-adapted at 37 degrees C. LT(50)values were 82.9 and 213.7 min as compared to the non-adapted larvae. Similarly, the LT(50)values were 30.5 min and in larvae pre-adapted at 39 degrees C when re-exposed to 45 degrees C showed 2 fold increases in thermotolerancein comparison to the same stage larvae kept at room temperature. Larvae pre-adapted from higher temperature showed more thermotolerance than the larvae pre-adapted at lower temperature.

TI  - Orientation of process parameter values of TIG assisted FSW of copper to obtain improved mechanical properties
VL  - 400
AB  - Welding copper and its alloys is usually difficult to achieve by conventional fusion welding processes because of high thermal diffusivity of copper, which is at least 10 times higher than most steel alloys. In order to reduce the increased temperature loss, it would be advantageous to use a process that is carried out at lower temperatures. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a solid state joining process that relies on frictional heating and plastic deformation and was explored as a feasible welding process. In order to achieve an increased productivity this process is assisted by another one, TIG (tungsten inert gas), which generates and adds heat to the process. The aim of this paper is to determine the progress direction of the process parameter values in order to maintain the productivity of the hybrid process and also to increase the values of the mechanical properties. Are analysed the evolution of the temperature, of the plunging force, of the microhardness and of the tensile strength in order to evaluate the changes generated by the application of the hybrid process. Then changes to the process parameter values of the hybrid process based on the evaluation of the previously mentioned properties are suggested in order to improve its mechanical properties. © 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Evolution of microstructures on stainless steel induced by ultra-short pulsed laser ablation
VL  - 2
IS  - 4
AB  - Ultra-short pulsed laser ablation of stainless steel is accompanied by the evolution of different microstructures. Depending on the fluence, accumulated energy and number of laser passes cones from impurities, laser induced periodic surface structures, cone-like protrusion (CLP), and thermal bumps evolve at the surface. These often unwanted morphologies can be induced or inhibited by carefully choosing the strategy and laser parameters. The investigated range reveals a small processing window for defined 515 nm sub 1 ps ablation leading to low surface roughness using circular polarization. Hitherto, the origin and dependencies of CLP are still not well understood and for the first time a precursor ripple structure reported. These precursor ripples reveal supra-wavelength periodicity with about 2μm spacing and evolve earliest after the second layer of ablation. Potentially, low spatial frequency laser-induced periodic surface structure generated with the first laser pass with pulse and hatch overlap are the root cause of CLP evolution. Moreover, the CLP growth is grain orientation and strongly polarization state dependent. Preferentially, CLP start to evolve at the {110} planes of the face-centered cubic crystals of the inspected austenitic stainless steel and linear polarized laser radiation revealing a 1:1 aspect ratio of 10μm. A nanoindentation study at the interface near region on cross-sections reveals robust mechanical properties of this CLP structure. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - COMPUTATIONAL MODELING AND SIMULATION OF ALUMINIUM SMELTING PROCESS USING OPENFOAM
VL  - 2021
SP  - 789-802
AB  - The electrolytic smelting is the process in aluminum industries to produce liquid aluminium metal from refined alumina powder. Smelting occurs in an electrolytic cell filled with an electrolyte subjected to Direct Current (DC). Alumina powder fed into the cell dissolves into the electrolyte and is reduced to aluminium metal on cathode. To ensure optimum productivity and energy efficiency of the cells, a distinct understanding of flow physics inside the cell is required, involving multiphase momentum, heat and mass transfer, along with magneto hydrodynamics. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on a multi-fluid Eulerian-Eulerian approach is proposed to model the smelting physics. The CFD model accounts for several physics involving (1) Voltage drop and current densities (2) Turbulent multiphase phase flow (3) Alumina dissolution, transport and consumption, (4) thermal energy evolution due to alumina dissolution and (5) magnetohydrodynamics. The proposed CFD model is implemented in the multiphaseEulerFoam solver framework available in the OpenFOAM-v8 group of multiphase solvers. The CFD modeling of the smelting physics and implementation in OpenFOAM is discussed herein. An Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulation is performed on an industry-representative computer-aided design (CAD) model for a unit anode electrolytic cell. Limited validation and verification of the simulation are performed. The preliminary results obtained from the simulation indicate that the CFD model predicts the trends of the above listed multi-physics reasonably well. The future plan involves extending the model with additional physics and rigorous validation, along with high fidelity turbulence modeling approaches with realistic smelting cells. © 2021 Begell House Inc..

TI  - Genetic Variation in Heat Tolerance of the Coral Platygyra Daedalea Indicates Potential for Adaptation to Ocean Warming
VL  - 9
AB  - Ocean warming represents the greatest threat to the persistence of reef ecosystems. Most coral populations are projected to experience temperatures above their current bleaching thresholds annually by 2050. Adaptation to higher temperatures is necessary if corals are to persist in a warming future. While many aspects of heat stress have been well studied, few data are available for predicting the capacity for adaptive cross-generational responses in corals. Consistent sets of heat tolerant genomic markers that reliably predict thermal tolerance have yet to be identified. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified the heritability and genetic variation associated with heat tolerance in Platygyra daedalea from the Great Barrier Reef. We tracked the survival of ten quantitative genetic crosses of larvae produced form six parental colonies in a heat tolerance selection experiment. We also identified allelic shifts in heat-selected (35°C) survivors compared with paired, non-selected controls (27°C). The narrow-sense heritability of survival under heat stress was 0.66 and a total of 1,069 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with different survival probabilities. While 148 SNPs were shared between several experimental crosses, no common SNPs were identified for all crosses, which suggests that specific combinations of many markers are responsible for heat tolerance. However, we found two regions that overlap with previously identified loci associated with heat tolerance in Persian Gulf populations of P. daedalea, which reinforces the importance of these markers for heat tolerance. These results illustrate the importance of high heritability and the complexity of the genomic architecture underpinning host heat tolerance. These findings suggest that this P. daedalea population has the genetic prerequisites for adaptation to increasing temperatures. This study also provides knowledge for the development of high throughput genomic tools which may screen for variation within and across populations to enhance adaptation through assisted gene flow and assisted migration.

TI  - Equivalency and Replaceability between Different Permeability Models of Hydrate-Bearing Porous Media When Applied to Numerical Modeling of Hydrate Dissociation: Implications for Model Selection and Parameter Assignment
VL  - 35
IS  - 7
SP  - 6090-6100
AB  - As a key input parameter in laboratory-scale numerical simulations of the hydrate dissociation process, effective and intrinsic permeability is among the most important factors controlling the hydrate dissociation dynamics and the productivity of hydrate-bearing porous media. A wide variety of permeability models have been developed to capture the effective permeability variations due to hydrate dissociation. The choice of the appropriate application-orientated permeability model is predominantly empirically based without reliable criteria. In this paper, we summarize the classical and popular permeability models associated with hydrate dissociation. Based on systematic numerical sensitivity analysis of modeling outputs (e.g., gas production rate, cumulative gas production volume, hydrate dissociation front characteristics, temperature, and pressure evolution) to alternative permeability model types and permeability model parameters, we demonstrate that there exists an equivalency and replaceability relationship between different permeability models in producing consistent modeling outputs. According to their equivalency and replaceability, various permeability models can be correlated to the frequently used Masuda model, which accordingly largely simplifies the selection of permeability models. This study also suggests the most representative parameter values for the Masuda model at low, medium, and high intrinsic permeabilities, which offers an efficient way to reduce uncertainties in modeling input. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

TI  - In Vitro Evolution of Listeria monocytogenes Reveals Selective Pressure for Loss of SigB and AgrA Function at Different Incubation Temperatures
VL  - 88
IS  - 11
AB  - The alternative sigma factor B (sB) contributes to the stress tolerance of the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes by upregulating the general stress response. We previously showed that sB loss-of-function mutations arise frequently in strains of L. monocytogenes and suggested that mild stresses might favor the selection of such mutations. In this study, we performed in vitro evolution experiments (IVEE) where L. monocytogenes was allowed to evolve over 30 days at elevated (42°C) or lower (30°C) incubation temperatures. Isolates purified throughout the IVEE revealed the emergence of sigB operon mutations at 42°C. However, at 30°C, independent alleles in the agr locus arose, resulting in the inactivation of Agr quorum sensing. Colonies of both sigB mutants and agr mutants exhibited a greyer coloration on 7-days-old agar plates than those of the parental strain. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a more complex colony architecture in the wild type than in the mutant strains. sigB mutant strains outcompeted the parental strain at 42°C but not at 30°C, while agr mutant strains showed a small increase in competitive fitness at 30°C. Analysis of 40,080 L. monocytogenes publicly available genome sequences revealed a high occurrence rate of premature stop codons in both the sigB and agrCA loci. An analysis of a local L. monocytogenes strain collection revealed 5 out of 168 strains carrying agrCA alleles. Our results suggest that the loss of sB or Agr confer an increased competitive fitness in some specific conditions and this likely contributes to the emergence of these alleles in strains of L. monocytogenes. IMPORTANCE To withstand environmental aggressions, L. monocytogenes upregulates a large regulon through the action of the alternative sigma factor B (sB). However, sB becomes detrimental for L. monocytogenes growth under mild stresses, which confer a competitive advantage to sB loss-of-function alleles. Temperatures of 42°C, a mild stress, are often employed in mutagenesis protocols of L. monocytogenes and promote the emergence of sB loss-of-function alleles in the sigB operon. In contrast, lower temperatures of 30°C promote the emergence of Agr loss-of-function alleles, a cell-cell communication mechanism in L. monocytogenes. Our findings demonstrate that loss-of-function alleles emerge spontaneously in laboratory-grown strains. These alleles rise in the population as a consequence of the trade-off between growth and survival imposed by the activation of sB in L. monocytogenes. Additionally, our results demonstrate the importance of identifying unwanted hitchhiker mutations in newly constructed mutant strains. Copyright © 2022 American Society for Microbiology.

TI  - Genome-Wide Association Analysis With a 50K Transcribed Gene SNP- Chip Identifies QTL Affecting Muscle Yield in Rainbow Trout
VL  - 9
AB  - Detection of coding/functional SNPs that change the biological function of a gene may lead to identification of putative causative alleles within QTL regions and discovery of genetic markers with large effects on phenotypes. This study has two-fold objectives, first to develop, and validate a 50K transcribed gene SNP-chip using RNA-Seq data. To achieve this objective, two bioinformatics pipelines, GATK and SAMtools, were used to identify ~21K transcribed SNPs with allelic imbalances associated with important aquaculture production traits including body weight, muscle yield, muscle fat content, shear force, and whiteness in addition to resistance/susceptibility to bacterial cold-water disease (BCWD). SNPs ere identified from pooled RNA-Seq data collected from ~620 fish, representing 98 families from growth- And 54 families from BCWD-selected lines with divergent phenotypes. In addition, ~29K transcribed SNPs without allelic-imbalances were strategically added to build a 50K Affymetrix SNP-chip. SNPs selected included two SNPs per gene from 14K genes and ~5K non-synonymous SNPs. The SNP-chip was used to genotype 1728 fish. The average SNP calling-rate for samples passing quality control (QC; 1,641 fish) was ≥ 98.5%. The second objective of this study was to test the feasibility of using the new SNP-chip in GWA (Genome-wide association) analysis to identify QTL explaining muscle yield variance. GWA study on 878 fish (representing 197 families from 2 consecutive generations) with muscle yield phenotypes and genotyped for 35K polymorphic markers (passing QC) identified several QTL regions explaining together up to 28.40% of the additive genetic variance for muscle yield in this rainbow trout population. The most significant QTLs were on chromosomes 14 and 16 with 12.71 and 10.49% of the genetic variance, respectively. Many of the annotated genes in the QTL regions were previously reported as important regulators of muscle development and cell signaling. No major QTLs were identified in a previous GWA study using a 57K genomic SNP chip on the same fish population. These results indicate improved detection power of the transcribed gene SNP-chip in the target trait and population, allowing identification of large-effect QTLs for important traits in rainbow trout. © 2007 - 2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

TI  - Single nucleotide polymorphism markers with applications in aquaculture and assessment of its impact on natural populations
VL  - 31
AB  - An increase in aquatic animal production can be achieved by extending aquaculture areas geographically, utilizing new species for culture, and using new technologies. Among new technologies useful for the increase of aquaculture production is the application of genetics and genomics. New molecular tools that benefit aquaculture have been developed. There has been a large number of experimental and review papers published concerning molecular markers and the range of their applications, including aquaculture and food product analyses. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has emerged as genotyping technology with wide and significant applications in aquaculture. SNPs can be used for construction of genetic linkage maps, finding quantitative trait loci (QTL) for useful traits like growth, body weight, grilsing, thermal and low oxygen tolerance, resistance to stress and diseases, mapping sex determination loci and identification of progeny in selection and chromosome manipulation experiments, assessment of genomic selectionand marker assisted selection in aquaculture. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) facilitate the finding associations between SNPs and a trait in related or unrelated specimens. However, many traits are complex and can be controlled by number of QTL. Genotyping by genome reduction complexity sequencing emerged as an efficient and applicable technology in genomic selection. Identification of genes, sequences and nucleotides (substitutions) directly influencing phenotypic variations opens the possibility of marker-assisted selection for desirable characters in culture. SNP and QTL associations can be enhanced using genome editing technology. Examples of successful applications of SNPs in aquaculture of fish, crustacean and mollusk species, representing most geographic areas, and ecological risks assessment are reviewed. © EDP Sciences 2017.

VL  - 74
IS  - 9
SP  - 1923-1941
AB  - Understanding how environmental variation affects phenotypic evolution requires models based on ecologically realistic assumptions that include variation in population size and specific mechanisms by which environmental fluctuations affect selection. Here we generalize quantitative genetic theory for environmentally induced stochastic selection to include general forms of frequency- and density-dependent selection. We show how the relevant fitness measure under stochastic selection relates to Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection, and present a general class of models in which density regulation acts through total use of resources rather than just population size. In this model, there is a constant adaptive topography for expected evolution, and the function maximized in the long run is the expected factor restricting population growth. This allows us to generalize several previous results and to explain why apparently “ (Formula presented.) -selected” species with slow life histories often have low carrying capacities. Our joint analysis of density- and frequency-dependent selection reveals more clearly the relationship between population dynamics and phenotypic evolution, enabling a broader range of eco-evolutionary analyses of some of the most interesting problems in evolution in the face of environmental variation. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - A high-quality carabid genome assembly provides insights into beetle genome evolution and cold adaptation
VL  - 21
IS  - 6
SP  - 2145-2165
AB  - The hyperdiverse order Coleoptera comprises a staggering ~25% of known species on Earth. Despite recent breakthroughs in next generation sequencing, there remains a limited representation of beetle diversity in assembled genomes. Most notably, the ground beetle family Carabidae, comprising more than 40,000 described species, has not been studied in a comparative genomics framework using whole genome data. Here we generate a high-quality genome assembly for Nebria riversi, to examine sources of novelty in the genome evolution of beetles, as well as genetic changes associated with specialization to high-elevation alpine habitats. In particular, this genome resource provides a foundation for expanding comparative molecular research into mechanisms of insect cold adaptation. Comparison to other beetles shows a strong signature of genome compaction, with N. riversi possessing a relatively small genome (~147 Mb) compared to other beetles, with associated reductions in repeat element content and intron length. Small genome size is not, however, associated with fewer protein-coding genes, and an analysis of gene family diversity shows significant expansions of genes associated with cellular membranes and membrane transport, as well as protein phosphorylation and muscle filament structure. Finally, our genomic analyses show that these high-elevation beetles have endosymbiotic Spiroplasma, with several metabolic pathways (e.g., propanoate biosynthesis) that might complement N. riversi, although its role as a beneficial symbiont or as a reproductive parasite remains equivocal. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Decreased thermal niche breadth as a trade-off of antibiotic resistance
VL  - 16
IS  - 7
SP  - 1843-1852
AB  - Evolutionary theory predicts that adaptations, including antibiotic resistance, should come with associated fitness costs; yet, many resistance mutations seemingly contradict this prediction by inducing no growth rate deficit. However, most growth assays comparing sensitive and resistant strains have been performed under a narrow range of environmental conditions, which do not reflect the variety of contexts that a pathogenic bacterium might encounter when causing infection. We hypothesized that reduced niche breadth, defined as diminished growth across a diversity of environments, can be a cost of antibiotic resistance. Specifically, we test whether chloramphenicol-resistant Escherichia coli incur disproportionate growth deficits in novel thermal conditions. Here we show that chloramphenicol-resistant bacteria have greater fitness costs at novel temperatures than their antibiotic-sensitive ancestors. In several cases, we observed no resistance cost in growth rate at the historic temperature but saw diminished growth at warmer and colder temperatures. These results were consistent across various genetic mechanisms of resistance. Thus, we propose that decreased thermal niche breadth is an under-documented fitness cost of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that the cost of antibiotic resistance shifts rapidly as the environment changes; these context-dependent resistance costs should select for the rapid gain and loss of resistance as an evolutionary strategy. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Power-law Inflation in the f (R) Gravity
VL  - 926
IS  - 1
AB  - We investigate a form of f(R)=R1+δ/Rcδ and study the viability of the model for inflation in the Jordan and the Einstein frames. We have extended this form to f(R)=R+R1+δ/Rcδ in an attempt to solve the problems of the former model. This model is further analyzed by using the power spectrum indices of inflation and the reheating temperature. During the inflationary evolution, the model predicts a value of the δ parameter very close to one (δ = 0.98), while the reheating temperature Tre∼1016 GeV at δ = 0.98 is consistent with the standard approach to inflation and observations. We calculate the slow roll parameters for the minimally coupled scalar field within the framework of our models. It is found that the values of the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are very close to the recent observational data, including those released by Planck. Further, we find the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio are exactly the same in the first model because the Jordan and the Einstein frames are conformally equivalent. We also attempt to provide a constraint through the non-Gaussianity parameter. © 2022. The Author(s). Published by the American Astronomical Society.

TI  - Male-limited secondary sexual trait interacts with environment in determining female fitness
VL  - 72
IS  - 8
SP  - 1716-1722
AB  - Selection for secondary sexual trait (SST) elaboration may increase intralocus sexual conflict over the optimal values of traits expressed from shared genomes. This conflict can reduce female fitness, and the resulting gender load can be exacerbated by environmental stress, with consequences for a population's ability to adapt to novel environments. However, how the evolution of SSTs interacts with environment in determining female fitness is not well understood. Here, we investigated this question using replicate lines of bulb mites selected for increased or decreased prevalence of a male SST-thickened legs used as weapons. The fitness of females from these lines was measured at a temperature to which the mites were adapted (24 degrees C), as well as at two novel temperatures: 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C. We found the prevalence of the SST interacted with temperature in determining female fecundity. At 28 degrees C, females from populations with high SST prevalence were less fecund than females from populations in which the SST was rare, but the reverse was true at 18 degrees C. Thus, a novel, environment does not universally depress female fitness more in populations with a high degree of sexually selected dimorphism. We discuss possible consequences of the interaction we detected for adaptation to novel environments.

TI  - Evolutionary Dynamics in the RNA Bacteriophage Q beta Depends on the Pattern of Change in Selective Pressures
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
AB  - The rate of change in selective pressures is one of the main factors that determines the likelihood that populations can adapt to stress conditions. Generally, the reduction in the population size that accompanies abrupt environmental changes makes it difficult to generate and select adaptive mutations. However, in systems with high genetic diversity, as happens in RNA viruses, mutations with beneficial effects under new conditions can already be present in the population, facilitating adaptation. In this work, we have propagated an RNA bacteriophage (Qβ) at temperatures higher than the optimum, following different patterns of change. We have determined the fitness values and the consensus sequences of all lineages throughout the evolutionary process in order to establish correspondences between fitness variations and adaptive pathways. Our results show that populations subjected to a sudden temperature change gain fitness and fix mutations faster than those subjected to gradual changes, differing also in the particular selected mutations. The life-history of populations prior to the environmental change has great importance in the dynamics of adaptation. The conclusion is that in the bacteriophage Qβ, the standing genetic diversity together with the rate of temperature change determine both the rapidity of adaptation and the followed evolutionary pathways. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - ATP synthase: Evolution, energetics, and membrane interactions
VL  - 152
IS  - 11
AB  - This review outlines a holistic framework for studying ATP synthase and emphasizes the importance of considering interactions with the lipid environment in shaping the function and evolutionary history of membrane proteins. The synthesis of ATP, life's "universal energy currency," is the most prevalent chemical reaction in biological systems and is responsible for fueling nearly all cellular processes, from nerve impulse propagation to DNA synthesis. ATP synthases, the family of enzymes that carry out this endless task, are nearly as ubiquitous as the energy-laden molecule they are responsible for making. The F-type ATP synthase (F-ATPase) is found in every domain of life and has facilitated the survival of organisms in a wide range of habitats, ranging from the deep-sea thermal vents to the human intestine. Accordingly, there has been a large amount of work dedicated toward understanding the structural and functional details of ATP synthases in a wide range of species. Less attention, however, has been paid toward integrating these advances in ATP synthase molecular biology within the context of its evolutionary history. In this review, we present an overview of several structural and functional features of the F-type ATPases that vary across taxa and are purported to be adaptive or otherwise evolutionarily significant: ion channel selectivity, rotor ring size and stoichiometry, ATPase dimeric structure and localization in the mitochondrial inner membrane, and interactions with membrane lipids. We emphasize the importance of studying these features within the context of the enzyme's particular lipid environment. Just as the interactions between an organism and its physical environment shape its evolutionary trajectory, ATPases are impacted by the membranes within which they reside. We argue that a comprehensive understanding of the structure, function, and evolution of membrane proteins-including ATP synthase-requires such an integrative approach.

TI  - The set up of an experimental testing rig to measure time and space temperature profiles in laser sintering of polymeric powders
VL  - 86
SP  - 781-786
AB  - Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is the most common type of Additive Manufacturing (AM) process using granular materials which has the potential to revolutionize the manufacturing industry. However, in the layer-wise build-up of the three-dimensional specimen, the complex laser-material interactions and the poor selection of associated process parameters can give rise to an increase to a number of defects of the artifacts. In fact, the temperature distribution along the surface and in depth at the laser spot, which are strongly affected by the thermal conductivity of the powder bed, do affect the hatch distance and the thickness of the powder layer, as well as on the quality of the final artifact. In this study, a laser sintering experimental set-up, equipped with an Infra-red thermographic camera and a K-type thermocouple, is built to measure the temperature distribution at the surface and 1mm below the surface in a special Polyamide 12 (PA12) powder bed. A one-watt stationary diode laser is used as heat source on samples characterized by various particle size distributions (PSD). Using the set-up, an accurate in-situ thermal characterization of the powder bed along with heat distribution study can be performed. Preliminary tests were conducted and the pixelwise temperature profile along the surface and temperature at the depth of 1mm below the surface of the powder bed has been reported. On the basis of the results, it is possible to provide good estimates of the global energy balances on the system, which are essential in evaluating the energy required to optimize the sintering and melting process of the polymeric powders.

TI  - The importance of considering the duration of extreme temperatures when investigating responses to climate change
VL  - 28
IS  - 22
SP  - 6577-6585
AB  - The frequency and duration of heatwaves are increasing because of human activities. To cope with the changes, species with longer generation times may have to rely on plastic responses. The probability that their responses are adaptive is higher if the species have experienced temperature fluctuations also in their evolutionary past. However, experimental studies investigating responses to heatwaves often use exposure times that are significantly shorter than recent heatwaves. We show that this can lead to faulty conclusions and that the duration of higher temperature has to be considered in experimental designs. We recorded the response of threespine stickleback to prolonged duration of higher temperature during the breeding season, using a population that has experienced large fluctuations in temperature in its past and, hence, is expected to endure temperature changes well. We found males to adaptively adjust their reproductive behaviours to short periods of higher temperature, but not to longer periods that extended across two breeding cycles. Males initially increased their reproductive activities—nest building, courtship and parental care—which ensured high reproductive success during the first breeding cycle, but decreased their reproductive activities during the second breeding cycle when exposed to sustained high temperature. This reduced their courtship success and resulted in fewer offspring. Thus, a species expected to cope well with higher temperature suffers fitness reductions when the duration of high temperature is prolonged. The results stress the importance of considering the duration of extreme environmental conditions when investigating the impact that human activities have on species. Responses to short-term exposures cannot be extrapolated to assess responses to longer periods of extreme conditions. © 2022 The Authors. Global Change Biology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

VL  - 10
IS  - 5
AB  - Gene modification is a promising tool for plant breeding, and gradual application from the laboratory to the field. Selectable marker genes (SMG) are required in the transformation process to simplify the identification of transgenic plants; however, it is more desirable to obtain transgenic plants without selection markers. Transgene integration mediated by site-specific recombination (SSR) systems into the dedicated genomic sites has been demonstrated in a few different plant species. Here, we present an auto-elimination vector system that uses a heat-inducible Cre to eliminate the selectable marker from transgenic maize, without the need for repeated transformation or sexual crossing. The vector combines an inducible site-specific recombinase (hsp70::Cre) that allows for the precise elimination of the selectable marker gene egfp upon heating. This marker gene is used for the initial positive selection of transgenic tissue. The egfp also functions as a visual marker to demonstrate the effectiveness of the heat-inducible Cre. A second marker gene for anthocyanin pigmentation (Rsc) is located outside of the region eliminated by Cre and is used for the identification of transgenic offspring in future generations. Using the heat-inducible auto-excision vector, marker-free transgenic maize plants were obtained in a precisely controlled genetic modification process. Genetic and molecular analyses indicated that the inducible auto-excision system was tightly controlled, with highly efficient DNA excision, and provided a highly reliable method to generate marker-free transgenic maize. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In 2003, experiments on rootstock breeding and grafting for melon, pepper, tomato and cowpea were started in Chhattisgarh, a state in Central India. Muskmelon cultivation in India is challenged by Fusarium wilt. Landraces of 220 melons were collected in 2009. Snap melon (SM), acid melon (AM) and wild melon (WM) were self-crossed for eight generations, grown on wilt infected soil and 20 hybrid combinations made from the selected lines. Parent lines and crosses were used for grafting melons and tested along-with self-grafted (check) melons, led to selection of an F1 hybrid rootstock, which is a combination of SM×AM. Other rootstock solutions developed by VNR include eggplant rootstock for grafting tomatoes, hot pepper rootstock for grafting of sweet pepper and hot pepper, interspecific pumpkin and citron (Citrullus lanatus var. citroides) rootstocks for grafting of water melon, and cowpea rootstock for grafting cowpea for resistance against nematodes and Fusarium wilt. Healing of grafted plants was a challenge due to extremely high temperatures and was solved by replacing the polyethylene with thin white muslin cloth on healing tunnels. This improved grafting success to 98% and making production with grafted plants economical. The technology was commercialized in Chhattisgarh and disseminated to nine other states of India by training staff at more than 50 professional nurseries. Grafting has enabled farmers to grow the crop according to market needs and improve profitability. © 2021 International Society for Horticultural Science. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of process parameters on the phase transformation behavior and tensile properties of NiTi shape memory alloys fabricated by selective laser melting
VL  - 36
AB  - In this work, we show that selective laser melting (SLM), apart from producing complex structures, can also act as a metallurgical method to modify the Ni/Ti ratio of NiTi shape memory alloys, and thus providing a feasible approach to tailor the transformation temperatures and to modify the mechanical performance of NiTi alloys. NiTi samples were fabricated by SLM with a large variation of process parameters, e.g. scanning speed (v) from 400 to 1200 mm s−1, hatch spacing (h) from 40 to 110 μm, and laser power (P) from 60 to 200 W. It is found that the martensite transformation temperature changes monotonously with the respective change of v, h or P. The composition analysis suggests that the different amount of Ni-loss under various SLM process conditions is the main reason for the evolution of transformation temperatures. Most importantly, good mechanical (total elongation &gt;10 %) and functional properties under tensile mode have been obtained despite of the large variation of SLM process parameters and the presence of extensive defects. The good tensile properties and tailorable phase transformation temperatures will provide great potential to make novel NiTi smart structures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Research on damages evaluation method with multi-objective feature extraction optimization scheme for M/OD impact risk assessment
VL  - 7
SP  - 98530-98545
AB  - As the number of space debris (also called meteoroid/orbital debris-M/OD) increases in recent years, the hypervelocity-impact (HVI) events of M/OD on spacecrafts have become one of the most main risks threatening human activity in space. For the automatical M/OD risk assessment, some effective nondestructive testing (NDT) methods are critical to realizing the evaluation of the HVI damages. In this paper, a novel HVI damage evaluation method based on the active infrared thermal wave image detection technology with multi-objective feature extraction optimization (MO-FEO) is proposed to achieve the quantitative evaluation of M/OD HVI damages. For the precise selection of representative temperature point in thermal infrared image data, the proposed MO-FEO method has the advantage not only of considering the difference among temperature points in different thermal temperature categories but also considering the correlation among temperature points of each thermal temperature category. The multi-objective feature extraction problem decomposed by Tchebycheff aggregation is used to seek the representative temperature points through an evolution process brought the selection pressure and fitness value. In addition to the MO-FEO frame, the variable step search and classification of temperature points are also implemented in the HVI damage evaluation strategy to improve efficiency. Some experimental results of infrared detection for the real M/OD HVI test articles are proposed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Based on formation testing data of more than 40 wells with industrial oil flow, systematic observation of 1 010.26 m long cores taken from 4 wells and test data of over 10 000 core samples combining with drilling and pilot fracturing data of multiple wells, the geological characteristics of the upper submember of the Sha 4 Member to the lower submember of the Sha 3 Member of Paleogene (Es4s-Es3x) in Jiyang Depression were investigated to find out factors controlling the enrichment of shale oil and the accumulation model of shale oil, and a comprehensive evaluation method for shale oil sweet spots was established. It is found through the study that the target shale layer is characterized by strong heterogeneity, weak diagenesis, low thermal evolution and high content of clay and carbonate minerals. Shale lithofacies, microcrack, thin interlayer and abnormal pressure are the main factors affecting enrichment and stable production of shale oil, the organic rich laminar shale has the best storage and oil-bearing capacity, microcrack network system improve the storage capacity and permeability of the shale, the thin interlayer is the main flow channel for stable shale oil production, and the abnormal high pressure layer is rich in free state shale oil and high in oil content. The shale oil layers in the target section were divided into three types: matrix, interlayer and fracture ones. According to the occurrence state and exploration practice of shale oil at home and abroad, it is concluded that the interlayer shale oil is the most profitable type at present. The selection parameters for the different types of shale oil were determined, and accordingly the favorable areas were pointed out by comprehensive evaluation of multiple factors. Vertical wells in the interlayer shale oil reservoir, such as Fan 159, Fan 143 and GX 26, were stimulated by volume fracturing and high conductivity channel fracturing jointly. After fracturing, they had a daily oil production of over 6 t, up to 44 t, and stable productivity. Shale oil is expected to become an important replacement energy resource in Jiyang Depression. © 2020, The Editorial Board of Petroleum Exploration and Development. All right reserved.

TI  - Climate Change Strengthens Selection for Mast Seeding in European Beech
VL  - 30
IS  - 17
SP  - 3477-3483.e2
AB  - Climate change is altering patterns of seed production worldwide [1–4], but the potential for evolutionary responses to these changes is poorly understood. Masting (synchronous, annually variable seed production by plant populations) is selectively beneficial through economies of scale that decrease the cost of reproduction per surviving offspring [5–7]. Masting is particularly widespread in temperate trees [8, 9] impacting food webs, macronutrient cycling, carbon storage, and human disease risk [10–12], so understanding its response to climate change is important. Here, we analyze inter-individual variability in plant reproductive patterns and two economies of scale—predator satiation and pollination efficiency—and document how natural selection acting upon them favors masting. Four decades of observations for European beech (Fagus sylvatica) show that predator satiation and pollination efficiency select for individuals with higher inter-annual variability of reproduction and higher reproductive synchrony between individuals. This result confirms the long-standing theory that masting, a population-level phenomenon, is generated by selection on individuals. Furthermore, recent climate-driven increases in mean seed production have increased selection pressure from seed predators but not from pollination efficiency. Natural selection is thus acting to restore the fitness benefits of masting, which have previously decreased under a warming climate [13]. However, selection will likely take far longer (centuries) than climate warming (decades), so in the short-term, tree reproduction will be reduced because masting has become less effective at satiating seed predators. Over the long-term, evolutionary responses to climate change could potentially increase inter-annual variability of seed production of masting species. © 2020 Elsevier Inc. Bogdziewicz et al. show how predator satiation and pollination efficiency select for high inter-annual variability and synchrony of reproduction in masting trees. Climate change increased the selection pressure for masting from predators, showing how natural selection is acting to restore fitness benefits of masting that decreased because of warming. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Characterization and analysis of the full-length transcriptomes of multiple organs in pseudotaxus chienii (W.C.Cheng) W.C.Cheng
VL  - 21
IS  - 12
SP  - 1-32
AB  - Pseudotaxus chienii, a rare tertiary relict species with economic and ecological value, is a representative of the monotypic genus Pseudotaxus that is endemic to China. P. chienii can adapt well to habitat isolation and ecological heterogeneity under a variety of climate and soil conditions, and is able to survive in harsh environments. However, little is known about the molecular and genetic resources of this long-lived conifer. Herein, we sequenced the transcriptomes of four organs of P. chienii using the PacBio Isoform Sequencing and Illumina RNA Sequencing platforms. Based on the PacBio Iso-Seq data, we obtained 44,896, 58,082, 50,485, and 67,638 full-length unigenes from the root, stem, leaf, and strobilus, respectively, with a mean length of 2692 bp, and a mean N50 length of 3010.75 bp. We then comprehensively annotated these unigenes. The number of organ-specific expressed unigenes ranged from 4393 in leaf to 9124 in strobilus, suggesting their special roles in physiological processes, organ development, and adaptability in the different four organs. A total of 16,562 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among the four organs and clustered into six subclusters. The gene families related to biotic/abiotic factors, including the TPS, CYP450, and HSP families, were characterized. The expression levels of most DEGs in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and plant–pathogen interactions were higher in the root than in the three other organs, suggesting that root constitutes the main organ of defensive compound synthesis and accumulation and has a stronger ability to respond to stress. The sequences were analyzed to predict transcription factors, long non-coding RNAs, and alternative splicing events. The expression levels of most DEGs of C2H2, C3H, bHLH, and bZIP families in the root and stem were higher than those in the leaf and strobilus, indicating that these TFs may play a crucial role in the survival of the root and stem. These results comprise the first comprehensive gene expression profiles obtained for different organs of P. chienii. Our findings will facilitate further studies on the functional genomics, adaptive evolution, and phylogeny of P. chienii, and lay the foundation for the development of conservation strategies for this endangered conifer. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Physiological and comparative genomic analysis of Arthrobacter sp. SRS-W-1-2016 provides insights on niche adaptation for survival in uraniferous soils
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Arthrobacter sp. strain SRS-W-1-2016 was isolated on high concentrations of uranium (U) from the Savannah River Site (SRS) that remains co-contaminated by radionuclides, heavy metals, and organics. SRS is located on the northeast bank of the Savannah River (South Carolina, USA), which is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) managed ecosystem left historically contaminated from decades of nuclear weapons production activities. Predominant contaminants within the impacted SRS environment include U and Nickel (Ni), both of which can be transformed microbially into less toxic forms via metal complexation mechanisms. Strain SRS-W-1-2016 was isolated from the uraniferous SRS soils on high concentrations of U (4200 μM) and Ni (8500 μM), but rapid growth was observed at much lower concentrations of 500 μMU and 1000 μMNi, respectively. Microcosm studies established with strain SRS-W-1-2016 revealed a rapid decline in the concentration of spiked U such that it was almost undetectable in the supernatant by 72 h of incubation. Conversely, Ni concentrations remained unchanged, suggesting that the strain removed U but not Ni under the tested conditions. To obtain a deeper understanding of the metabolic potential, a draft genome sequence of strain SRS-W-1-2016 was obtained at a coverage of 90×, assembling into 93 contigs with an N50 contig length of 92,788 bases. The genomic size of strain SRS-W-1-2016 was found to be 4,564,701 bases with a total number of 4327 putative genes. An in-depth, genome-wide comparison between strain SRS-W-1-2016 and its four closest taxonomic relatives revealed 1159 distinct genes, representing 26.7% of its total genome; many associating with metal resistance proteins (e.g., for cadmium, cobalt, and zinc), transporter proteins, stress proteins, cytochromes, and drug resistance functions. Additionally, several gene homologues coding for resistance to metals were identified in the strain, such as outer membrane efflux pump proteins, peptide/nickel transport substrate and ATP-binding proteins, a high-affinity nickel-transport protein, and the spoT gene, which was recently implicated in bacterial resistance towards U. Detailed genome mining analysis of strain SRS-W-1-2016 also revealed the presence of a plethora of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters likely facilitating resistance to antibiotics, biocides, and metals. Additionally, several gene homologous for the well-known oxygenase enzyme system were also identified, potentially functioning to generate energy via the breakdown of organic compounds and thus enabling the successful colonization and natural attenuation of contaminants by Arthrobacter sp. SRS-W-1-2016 at the SRS site. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Optimizing machining responses of homologous TiNiCu shape memory alloys using hybrid ANN-GA approach
VL  - 62
SP  - 4402-4410
AB  - Fabrication of shape memory alloys using wire electro discharge machining (WEDM) has gained popularity over the last few years. Most widely used machining parameters of WEDM process are pulse on time (oon), pulse off time (ooff), servo voltage (r) and wire feed (x). WEDM responses like material removal rate (MR), surface roughness (SR), kerf width (KW) and recast layer thickness (LT) have been evaluated by researchers to determine machining characteristics and are also considered for this study. These machining responses determine the quality of machining and are majorly influenced by thermal conductivity and melting temperature of the WEDM workpiece. Actuation behavior of shape memory alloys is a function of phase transformation characteristics which in turn depends on elemental composition of the selected alloys. Therefore, dissimilar machining responses of Ti50Ni40Cu10 and Ti50Ni25Cu25 have been observed even though similar machining input values were used. This study utilized artificial neural network (ANN) mapping to establish WEDM response function - which was used as fitness function to perform multi objective optimization using genetic algorithm (GA). It was found that ANN successfully predicted machining responses of selected homologous alloys and GA helped in identifying suitable input parameter values to optimize machining responses.

TI  - Under pressure: The extraordinary survival of seal lice in the deep sea
VL  - 223
IS  - 17
AB  - Lice from pinnipeds-sea lions, seals and walruses- A re the only insects capable of surviving marine dives. Throughout their evolutionary history, they have adapted to tolerate hypoxia, high salinity, low temperature and, in particular, to tolerate conditions of high hydrostatic pressure. To understand the limits of the capacity of lice to survive during host deep dives, we conducted a series of controlled experiments in the laboratory. We collected lice from elephant seals and submitted the different life stages to high pressure conditions. Lice were first exposed to one of four hydrostatic pressures: 30, 80, 150 or 200 kg cmâ'2. They were then exposed a second time to higher or lower hydrostatic pressure conditions to test for the impact of the first experience, which could either be deleterious or trigger physiological adaption, allowing them a better tolerance to high pressure. We found that lice from elephant seals can tolerate hydrostatic pressures higher than 200 kg cmâ'2 (close to 200 atm), which is equivalent to 2000 m depth. Adults exhibited lower recovery times than nymphs after immersion at high hydrostatic pressure. Our findings show that lice have developed unique adaptations to endure extreme marine conditions.We discuss these extreme performances in relation to the morphological characteristics and physiological responses to diving in these insects. © 2020 Company of Biologists Ltd.

VL  - 16
IS  - 5
AB  - Among underwater vehicles, fish-inspired designs are often selected for their efficient gaits; these designs, however, remain limited in their maneuverability, especially in confined spaces. This paper presents a new design for a fish-inspired robot with two degree-of-freedom pectoral fins and a single degree-of-freedom caudal fin. This robot has been designed to operate in open-channel canals in the presence of external disturbances. With the complex interactions of water in mind, the composition of goal-specific swimming gaits is trained via a machine learning workflow in which automated trials in the lab are used to select a subset of potential gaits for outdoor trials. The goal of this process is to minimize the time cost of outdoor experimentation through the identification and transfer of high-performing gaits with the understanding that, in the absence of complete replication of the intended target environment, some or many of these gaits must be eliminated in the real world. This process is motivated by the challenge of balancing the optimization of complex, high degree-of-freedom robots for disturbance-heavy, random, niche environments against the limitations of current machine learning techniques in real-world experiments, and has been used in the design process as well as across a number of locomotion goals. The key contribution of this paper involves finding strategies that leverage online learning methods to train a bio-inspired fish robot by identifying high-performing gaits that have a consistent performance both in the laboratory experiments and the intended operating environment. Using the workflow described herein, the resulting robot can reach a forward swimming speed of 0.385 m s-1 (0.71 body lengths per second) and can achieve a near-zero turning radius. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Mild hypothermia upregulates myc and xbp1s expression and improves anti-TNFα production in CHO cells
VL  - 13
IS  - 3
AB  - Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the most frequently used host for commercial production of therapeutic proteins. However, their low protein productivity in culture is the main hurdle to overcome. Mild hypothermia has been established as an effective strategy to enhance protein specific productivity, although the causes of such improvement still remain unclear. The self-regulation of global transcriptional regulatory factors, such as Myc and XBP1s, seems to be involved in increased the recombinant protein production at low temperature. This study evaluated the impact of low temperature in CHO cell cultures on myc and xbp1s expression and their effects on culture performance and cell metabolism. Two anti-TNFα producing CHO cell lines were selected considering two distinct phenotypes: i.e. maximum cell growth, (CN1) and maximum specific anti-TNFα production (CN2), and cultured at 37, 33 and 31C in a batch system. Low temperature led to an increase in the cell viability, the expression of the recombinant anti-TNFα and the production of anti-TNFα both in CN1 and CN2. The higher production of anti-TNFα in CN2 was mainly associated with the large expression of anti-TNFα. Under mild hypothermia myc and xbp1s expression levels were directly correlated to the maximal viable cell density and the specific anti-TNFα productivity, respectively. Moreover, cells showed a simultaneous metabolic shift from production to consumption of lactate and from consumption to production of glutamine, which were exacerbated by reducing culture temperature and coincided with the increased anti-TNFα production. Our current results provide new insights of the regulation of myc and xbp1s in CHO cells at low temperature, and suggest that the presence and magnitude of the metabolic shift might be a relevant metabolic marker of productive cell line. © 2018 Torres et al.

AB  - Metabolism shapes the ecosystem role of organisms by dictating their energy demand and nutrient recycling potential. Metabolic theory (MTE) predicts consumer metabolic and recycling rates will rise with warming, especially if body size declines, but it ignores potential for adaptation. We measured metabolic and nutrient excretion rates of individuals from populations of a globally invasive fish that colonized sites spanning a wide temperature range (19–37°C) on two continents within the last 100 yr. Fish body size declined across our temperature gradient and MTE predicted large rises in population energy demand and nutrient recycling. However, we found that the allometry and temperature dependency of metabolism varied in a countergradient pattern with local temperature in a way that offset predictions of MTE. Scaling of nutrient excretion was more variable and did not track temperature. Our results suggest that adaptation can reduce the metabolic cost of warming, increasing the prospects for population persistence under extreme warming scenarios. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America

TI  - Characterization and salt response in recurrent halotolerant exiguobacteriumsp. SH31 isolated from sediments of salar de huasco, chilean altiplano
VL  - 9
AB  - Poly-extremophiles microorganisms have the capacity to inhabit hostile environments and can survive several adverse conditions that include as variations in temperature, pH, and salinity, high levels UV light and atmospheric pressure, and even the presence of toxic compounds and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A halotolerant Exiguobacterium strain was isolated from Salar de Huasco (Chilean Altiplano), a well-known shallow lake area with variable salinity levels, little human intervention, and extreme environmental conditions, which makes it ideal for the study of resistant mechanisms and the evolution of adaptations. This bacterial genus has not been extensively studied, although its cosmopolitan location indicates that it has high levels of plasticity and adaptive capacity. However, to date, there are no studies regarding the tolerance and resistance to salinity and osmotic pressure. We set out to characterize the Exiguobacterium sp. SH31 strain and describe its phenotypical and genotypical response to osmotic stress. In this context, as a first step to characterize the response to the SH31 strain to salinity and to establish the bases for a molecular study, we proposed to compare its response under three salt conditions (0, 25, and 50 g/l NaCl). Using different physiology, genomic, and transcriptomic approaches, we determined that the bacterium is able to grow properly in a NaCl concentration of up to 50 g/l; however, the best growth rate was observed at 25 g/l. Although the presence of flagella is not affected by salinity, motility was diminished at 25 g/l NaCl and abolished at 50 g/l. Biofilm formation was induced proportionally with increases in salinity, which was expected. These phenotypic results correlated with the expression of related genes: fliG and fliS Motility); opuBA and putP (transport); glnA, proC, gltA, and gbsA (compatible solutes); ywqC, bdlA, luxS y pgaC (biofilm and stress response); and therefore, we conclude that this strain effectively modifies gene expression and physiology in a differential manner when faced with different concentrations of NaCl and these modifications aid survival. © 2007-2018 Frontiers Media S.A.

VL  - 40

SP  - 34-40
AB  - Based on the analyses of geochemical data like gas composition and carbon and hydrogen isotopes, the study is made on the geochemical characteristics, origin and source of natural gas in the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation in Malubei area, northeastern Sichuan Basin. The results indicate that the natural gas in the Xujiahe Formation in Malubei area is mainly composed of methane, with the content ranging from 92.60% to 99.04%, averaging out at 97.59%, and its gas dry coefficient is generally higher than 0.990 0, with the average value of 0.992 2, indicating a higher degree of thermal evolution. Compared with the Xujiahe natural gas in adjacent areas, the values of gas δ13C1 in Malubei area are bigger (ranging from -33.70‰ to -28.60‰, with an average of -30.88‰), but the values of δ13C2 are smaller (ranging from -30.88‰ to -28.90‰, with an average of -33.11‰), and the carbon isotopes of methane and ethane in the gas of the study area are mainly in reversed distribution: the carbon isotope of methane is relatively heavier while the carbon isotope of ethane is lighter. The identification of gas origin and analysis of gas-source correlation indicate that the natural gas in the Xujiahe Formation in Malubei area is the mixed thermogenic gas of coal-type gas and oil-type gas generated by kerogen Type III and II, and mainly sourced from the coal-measure source rocks in the Upper Triassic Xujiahe Formation and the marine source rocks in the Upper Permian Wujiaping Formation. And the carbon isotopic reversal of methane and ethane for the Xujiahe gas just results from the mixing of the coal-type gas and oil-type gas. The accumulation and high productivity of the natural gas in the Xujiahe Formation in Malubei area is closely related to hydrocarbon generation by both marine and terrestrial source rocks and the connectivity of several quality marine and terrestrial source rocks to the Xujiahe reservoir by means of deep and large faults, which have played a significant role in natural gas accumulation and later adjustment in the Xujiahe Formation in Malubei area. © 2019, OIL & GAS GEOLOGY Editorial Board.

TI  - Testing the Adaptive Potential of Yellowtail Kingfish to Ocean Warming and Acidification
VL  - 7
AB  - Estimating the heritability and genotype by environment (GxE) interactions of performance-related traits (e.g., growth, survival, reproduction) under future ocean conditions is necessary for inferring the adaptive potential of marine species to climate change. To date, no studies have used quantitative genetics techniques to test the adaptive potential of large pelagic fishes to the combined effects of elevated water temperature and ocean acidification. We used an experimental approach to test for heritability and GxE interactions in morphological traits of juvenile yellowtail kingfish, Seriola lalandi, under current-day and predicted future ocean conditions. We also tracked the fate of genetic diversity among treatments over the experimental period to test for selection favoring some genotypes over others under elevated temperature and CO2. Specifically, we reared kingfish to 21 days post hatching (dph) in a fully crossed 2 × 2 experimental design comprising current-day average summer temperature (21°C) and seawater pCO2 (500 μatm CO2) and elevated temperature (25°C) and seawater pCO2 (1,000 μatm CO2). We sampled larvae and juveniles at 1, 11, and 21 dph and identified family of origin of each fish (1,942 in total) by DNA parentage analysis. The animal model was used to estimate heritability of morphological traits and test for GxE interactions among the experimental treatments at 21 dph. Elevated temperature, but not elevated CO2 affected all morphological traits. Weight, length and other morphological traits in juvenile yellowtail kingfish exhibited low but significant heritability under current day and elevated temperature. However, there were no measurable GxE interactions in morphological traits between the two temperature treatments at 21 dph. Similarly, there was no detectable change in any of the measures of genetic diversity over the duration of the experiment. Nonetheless, one family exhibited differential survivorship between temperatures, declining in relative abundance between 1 and 21 dph at 21°C, but increasing in relative abundance between 1 and 21 dph at 25°C. This suggests that this family line could perform better under future warming than in current-day conditions. Our results provide the first preliminary evidence of the adaptive potential of a large pelagic fisheries species to future ocean conditions. © Copyright © 2019 Munday, Schunter, Allan, Nicol, Parsons, Pether, Pope, Ravasi, Setiawan, Smith and Domingos.

TI  - Incorporation of probiotics (Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis) into 3D printed mashed potatoes: Effects of variables on the viability
VL  - 128
AB  - 3D printing is an emerging technology with the potential to revolutionize people's eating habits. This study firstly optimized the mashed potatoes (MP) formulation and correlated its 3D performance with rheological properties. Yield stress and consistency index (K) were closely related with MP's extrusion behavior, and too high values of them (like 2558 Pa and 2794 Pa·sn) caused the difficulty in extrusion process. Yield stress and elastic modulus (G′) were critical to MP's self-supporting performance and too low values of them resulted in the deformation of printed parts during storage. The feasibility of incorporation of probiotics (Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis BB-12) into 3D printed mashed potatoes (MP) was then studied. MP with probiotics was printed with different nozzle diameter (0.6, 1.0 and 1.4 mm), printing temperature (25, 35, 45 and 55 °C) and evaluated for survival during extrusion and storage at 5 °C. It was found only the small nozzle diameter (0.6 mm) resulted in the reduction of probiotic viability from 9.93 log CFU/g to 9.74 log CFU/g. Greater reduction of viable counts of probiotics (from 10.07 log CFU/g to 7.99 log CFU/g) was found when the MP was held in a heating nozzle barrel at 55 °C for 45 min. No significant difference of probiotics viability in 3D printed samples was found during 12-day storage period at 5 °C. This study provides a new dimension on the development of functional foods by 3D printing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Urbanization-driven changes in web building and body size in an orb web spider
VL  - 88
IS  - 1
SP  - 79-91
AB  - In animals, behavioural responses may play an important role in determining population persistence in the face of environmental changes. Body size is a key trait central to many life-history traits and behaviours. Correlations with body size may constrain behavioural variation in response to environmental changes, especially when size itself is influenced by environmental conditions. Urbanization is an important human-induced rapid environmental change that imposes multiple selection pressures on both body size and (size-constrained) behaviour. How these combine to shape behavioural responses of urban-dwelling species is unclear. Using web building, an easily quantifiable behaviour linked to body size and the garden spider Araneus diadematus as a model, we evaluated direct behavioural responses to urbanization and body size constraints across a network of 63 selected populations differing in urbanization intensity. We additionally studied urbanization at two spatial scales to account for some environmental pressures varying across scales and to obtain first qualitative insights about the role of plasticity and genetic selection. Spiders were smaller in highly urbanized sites (local scale only), in line with expectations based on reduced prey biomass availability and the Urban Heat Island effect. Web surface and mesh width decreased with urbanization at the local scale, while web surface also increased with urbanization at the landscape scale. The latter two responses are expected to compensate, at least in part, for reduced prey biomass availability in cities. The use of multivariate mixed modelling reveals that although web traits and body size are correlated within populations, behavioural responses to urbanization do not appear to be constrained by size: there is no evidence of size–web correlations among populations or among landscapes, and web traits appear independent from each other. Our results demonstrate that responses in size-dependent behaviours may be decoupled from size changes, thereby allowing fitness maximization in novel environments. The spatial scale at which traits respond suggests contributions of both genetic adaptation (for web investment) and plasticity (for mesh width). Although fecundity decreased with local-scale urbanization, A. diadematus abundances were similar across urbanization gradients; behavioural responses thus appear overall successful at the population level. © 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Detecting Local Adaptation between North and South European Atlantic Salmon Populations
VL  - 11
IS  - 6
AB  - Simple Summary Atlantic salmon is a diadromous species that has the particularity that it returns to reproduce to its river of birth. This means that, in most cases, each river can be considered a population and that these populations can be adapted to the characteristics of the river. The Atlantic Salmon in the rivers of the Iberian Peninsula has been in decline since the 80's of the last century. At that time, to alleviate the decline in the number of individuals, the rivers were stocked with salmon from Scotland and other northern European rivers, but the result was not positive. In this work, we studied eight salmon populations using a 220,000 high-density SNP array (Affymetrix) specific to Atlantic salmon. Our results revealed potential evidence of local adaptation for North Spanish and Scottish populations, which may be the cause of the failure of restocking programs. In addition, by performing a review of previous studies, we demonstrated that, as suggested, NADP-dependent malic enzyme-2 is a candidate for local adaptation in salmon from the Iberian Peninsula. Pollution and other anthropogenic effects have driven a decrease in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in the Iberian Peninsula. The restocking effort carried out in the 1980s, with salmon from northern latitudes with the aim of mitigating the decline of native populations, failed, probably due to the deficiency in adaptation of foreign salmon from northern Europe to the warm waters of the Iberian Peninsula. This result would imply that the Iberian populations of Atlantic salmon have experienced local adaptation in their past evolutionary history, as has been described for other populations of this species and other salmonids. Local adaptation can occur by divergent selections between environments, favoring the fixation of alleles that increase the fitness of a population in the environment it inhabits relative to other alleles favored in another population. In this work, we compared the genomes of different populations from the Iberian Peninsula (Atlantic and Cantabric basins) and Scotland in order to provide tentative evidence of candidate SNPs responsible for the adaptive differences between populations, which may explain the failures of restocking carried out during the 1980s. For this purpose, the samples were genotyped with a 220,000 high-density SNP array (Affymetrix) specific to Atlantic salmon. Our results revealed potential evidence of local adaptation for North Spanish and Scottish populations. As expected, most differences concerned the comparison of the Iberian Peninsula with Scotland, although there were also differences between Atlantic and Cantabric populations. A high proportion of the genes identified are related to development and cellular metabolism, DNA transcription and anatomical structure. A particular SNP was identified within the NADP-dependent malic enzyme-2 (mMEP-2*), previously reported by independent studies as a candidate for local adaptation in salmon from the Iberian Peninsula. Interestingly, the corresponding SNP within the mMEP-2* region was consistent with a genomic pattern of divergent selection.

VL  - 26
IS  - 1
SP  - 80-102
AB  - Although cross generation (CGP) and multigenerational (MGP) plasticity have been identified as mechanisms of acclimation to global change, the weight of evidence indicates that parental conditioning over generations is not a panacea to rescue stress sensitivity in offspring. For many species, there were no benefits of parental conditioning. Even when improved performance was observed, this waned over time within a generation or across generations and fitness declined. CGP and MGP studies identified resilient species with stress tolerant genotypes in wild populations and selected family lines. Several bivalves possess favourable stress tolerance and phenotypically plastic traits potentially associated with genetic adaptation to life in habitats where they routinely experience temperature and/or acidification stress. These traits will be important to help ‘climate proof’ shellfish ventures. Species that are naturally stress tolerant and those that naturally experience a broad range of environmental conditions are good candidates to provide insights into the physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in CGP and MGP. It is challenging to conduct ecologically relevant global change experiments over the long times commensurate with the pace of changing climate. As a result, many studies present stressors in a shock-type exposure at rates much faster than projected scenarios. With more gradual stressor introduction over longer experimental durations and in context with conditions species are currently acclimatized and/or adapted to, the outcomes for sensitive species might differ. We highlight the importance to understand primordial germ cell development and the timing of gametogenesis with respect to stressor exposure. Although multigenerational exposure to global change stressors currently appears limited as a universal tool to rescue species in the face of changing climate, natural proxies of future conditions (upwelling zones, CO2 vents, naturally warm habitats) show that phenotypic adjustment and/or beneficial genetic selection is possible for some species, indicating complex plasticity–adaptation interactions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

VL  - 26
IS  - 15
AB  - The deficiency of available silicon (Si) incurred by year-round agricultural and horticultural practices highlights the significance of Si fertilization for soil replenishment. This study focuses on a novel and economical route for the synthesis of Si fertilizer via the calcination method using talc and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as starting materials. The molar ratio of talc to CaCO3 of 1:2.0, calcination temperature of 1150◦ C and calcination time of 120 min were identified as the optimal conditions to maximize the available Si content of the prepared Si fertilizer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characterizations elucidate the principles of the calcination temperature-dependent microstructure evolution of Si fertilizers, and the akermanite Ca2 Mg(Si2 O7) and merwinite Ca3 Mg(SiO4)2 were identified as the primary silicates products. The results of release and solubility experiments suggest the content of available metallic element and slow-release property of the Si fertilizer obtained at the optimum preparation condition (Si-OPC). The surface morphology and properties of Si-OPC were illuminated by the results of scanning electron microscope (SEM), surface area and nitrogen adsorption analysis. The acceleration action of CaCO3 in the decomposition process of talc was demonstrated by the thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) test. The pot experiment corroborates that 5 g kg−1 soil Si-OPC application sufficed to facilitate the pakchoi growth by providing nutrient elements. This evidence indicates the prepared Si fertilizer as a promising candidate for Si-deficient soil replenishment. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Response to selection for increasing resistance to the spring mortality outbreaks in Mytilus edulis occurring in France since 2014
VL  - 511
AB  - Massive spring mortality outbreaks have been reported in Mytilus spp. in France since 2014. The main areas affected are the Pertuis Charentais Sounds and the coast of the Pays de la Loire, which cultivate mainly M. edulis, and the putative causal agents remain unknown. We report the results of the first generation of mass selection focused on survival and resistance to the spring mortality in M. edulis. Two stocks of mussels were sampled in the Pertuis Charentais Sounds in 2014; one of these went through a spring mortality outbreak and the survivors were used to produce the selected stock, while the second stock was M. edulis considered to be naïve against the putative causal agents of the mortality outbreak and was used to produce the control stock. A first cohort was produced in 2015 and tested at one site in the Pertuis Charentais Sounds. In April and May 2016, a spring mortality outbreak was observed when seawater temperature ranged from 10 to 15 °C. In October 2016, the selected stock had a lower mortality (44%) than the control stock (78%). To confirm this result and investigate genotype by environment interaction, a second cohort was produced in 2016 and tested at six sites. Although no significant mortality was reported at the four sites in the Pertuis Charentais Sounds in 2017, the selected stock had a lower mortality (17–27%) than the control stock (61–74%) at the two sites along the coast of the Pays de la Loire. The survival had increased of 34–48% after one generation of mass selection and the realized heritability was high, ranging from 0.55 to 1.15, but further generations of selection are required to obtain a better estimation of the heritability. Our study showed a positive response to selection in three environments that were different to the site from which mussels were selected, suggesting the absence of strong genotype by environment interaction in sites where spring mortality outbreaks occurred. Selection to enhance M. edulis survival of the spring mortality should be efficient and should be capable of easy implementation through mass selection. Apparently, selection to enhance the survival of M. edulis did not affect the mussel growth in comparison with the controls, but automatically improved the yield of M. edulis in sites affected by the spring mortality outbreaks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Cooption of heat shock regulatory system for anhydrobiosis in the sleeping chironomid Polypedilum vanderplanki
VL  - 115
IS  - 10
SP  - E2477-E2486
AB  - Polypedilum vanderplanki is a striking and unique example of an insect that can survive almost complete desiccation. Its genome and a set of dehydration–rehydration transcriptomes, together with the genome of Polypedilum nubifer (a congeneric desiccation-sensitive midge), were recently released. Here, using published and newly generated datasets reflecting detailed transcriptome changes during anhydrobiosis, as well as a developmental series, we show that the TCTAGAA DNA motif, which closely resembles the binding motif of the Drosophila melanogaster heat shock transcription activator (Hsf), is significantly enriched in the promoter regions of desiccation-induced genes in P. vanderplanki, such as genes encoding late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, thioredoxins, or trehalose metabolism-related genes, but not in P. nubifer. Unlike P. nubifer, P. vanderplanki has double TCTAGAA sites upstream of the Hsf gene itself, which is probably responsible for the stronger activation of Hsf in P. vanderplanki during desiccation compared with P. nubifer. To confirm the role of Hsf in desiccation-induced gene activation, we used the Pv11 cell line, derived from P. vanderplanki embryo. After preincubation with trehalose, Pv11 cells can enter anhydrobiosis and survive desiccation. We showed that Hsf knockdown suppresses trehalose-induced activation of multiple predicted Hsf targets (including P. vanderplanki-specific LEA protein genes) and reduces the desiccation survival rate of Pv11 cells fivefold. Thus, cooption of the heat shock regulatory system has been an important evolutionary mechanism for adaptation to desiccation in P. vanderplanki. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - The Supercooling Responses of the Solitary Bee Osmia excavata (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) under the Biological Stress of Its Brood Parasite, Sapyga coma (Hymenoptera: Sapygidae)
VL  - 13
IS  - 3
AB  - Simple Summary Insects have different strategies to adapt to environment change and parasites, but the supercooling response of pollinator populations under the biological stress has not been sufficiently investigated. This study assessed the supercooling traits of the solitary bee and its brood parasite. We discovered significant differences in the supercooling points were found between the solitary bee and its brood parasite in the same sex, and also between sexes of same species. The supercooling traits (supercooling points, fresh weight, and fat content) of the two species were significantly positively correlated. Our results suggest that the supercooling points of the solitary bee increase under the biological stress of its brood parasite at a certain level. Overall, the supercooling of pollinator populations varies regularly under brood parasitism pressure. (1) Background: Many insects have evolved different strategies to adapt to subzero temperatures and parasites, but the supercooling response of pollinator populations under the brood parasitism pressure has not been sufficiently investigated. (2) Methods: This study assessed the supercooling traits (supercooling points, fresh weight and fat content) of the solitary bee Osmia excavata Alfken and its brood parasite, Sapyga coma Yasumatsu & Sugihara. We measured 4035 samples (3025 O. excavata and 1010 S. coma, one individual as one sample) and discovered the supercooling traits relations between solitary bee and brood parasite. (3) Results: Significant differences in the supercooling points were found between O. excavata (females: -24.18 (-26.02 similar to-20.07) vs. males: -23.21 (-25.15 similar to-18.65) degrees C) and S. coma (females: -22.19 (-25.46 similar to-18.38) vs. males: -20.65 (-23.85 similar to-16.15) degrees C, p < 0.0001) in the same sex, and also between sexes of same species. The two species' supercooling traits (supercooling points, fresh weight, and fat content) were significantly positively correlated. The supercooling points of the solitary bee varies regularly under brood parasitism pressure. (4) Conclusions: Our study indicates the supercooling traits relationships between a solitary bee and its brood parasite and suggests that the supercooling points of the solitary bee increase under the biological stress of its brood parasite in a certain level.

VL  - 75

SP  - 30-37
AB  - Phenotypic variation along environmental gradients - particularly in body size - occurs in a variety of species. Larger-bodied individuals are usually found in colder climates, as predicted by Bergmann's rule. In ectotherms, this pattern remains controversial. Among thermoconformers, smaller body sizes are expected in colder climates because these species might have relatively shorter warm-up times (advantageous in cold climates), whereas the reverse pattern can be expected in thermoregulators (heat-balance hypothesis). In amphibians, additional factors like humidity and thermal niche might also contribute to body-size variation. Following Allen's rule, there can also be a negative relationship between temperature and relative limb length. Here, we described associations among temperature, precipitation, body size, and relative limb length in Calotriton asper. We expected individuals from higher elevations (colder climates) to be smaller when compared to lowelevation conspecifics. We found an influence of temperature on body-size variation but, contrary to expectations, salamanders from colder climates were larger compared to low-elevation populations, which corroborates with the heat-balance hypothesis. In accordance with the converse water-availability hypothesis, we also demonstrated that precipitation was related to body-size variation in this species. Finally, our results supported the predictions of Allen's rule. This trend could be the result of evolutionary responses to harsh environments, driven by either local adaptation, plasticity processes, or a combination of both. © 2019 by The Herpetologists' League, Inc.

AB  - Energy transfer within an arc is of crucial importance in numerous applications, such as thermal spraying and electric propulsion (arcjet and magnetoplasmadynamic thruster). Its control will frequently determine the viability of a process or a device. However, a lot of numerical works done to model arc discharge using finite volume or finite element method consider the arc core only, while the near-electrode layers are ignored and replaced by a presumed boundary condition. This greatly limits the reliability of the simulation model. The goal of this paper is to make the bulk plasma coupled with electrode regions, where the special space charge layer (sheath) on cathode is taken into account. This is achieved by a simplified 1-D sheath model developed in this paper, which is then applied on a nontransferred dc plasma torch to study the thermodynamic and electromagnetic interaction between plasma and electrodes. The simulated results in electrode and plasma regions are presented, the predicted temporal evolution of electric potential with sheath model is in good agreement with the experimental measurements. © 2017 IEEE.

TI  - An Adaptive Building Skin Concept Resulting from a New Bioinspiration Process: Design, Prototyping, and Characterization
VL  - 15
IS  - 3
AB  - Building envelopes can manage light, heat gains or losses, and ventilation and, as such, play a key role in the overall building performance. Research has been focusing on increasing their efficiency by proposing dynamic and adaptive systems, meaning that they evolve to best meet the internal and external varying conditions. Living organisms are relevant examples of adaptability as they have evolved, facing extreme conditions while maintaining stable internal conditions for survival. From a framework based on the inspiration of living envelopes such as animal constructions or biological skins, the concept of an adaptive envelope inspired by the Morpho butterfly was proposed. The system can manage heat, air, and light transfers going through the building and includes adaptive elements with absorption coefficients varying with temperature. This paper presents the developed framework that led to the final concept as well as the concept implementation and assessment. A prototype for heat and light management was built and integrated into a test bench. Measurements were performed to provide a first assessment of the system. In parallel, geometrical parametric models were created to compare multiple configurations in regards to indicators such as air, light, or heat transfers. One of the models provided light projections on the system that were compared with measurements and validated as suitable inputs in grey-box models for the system characterization. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Hsp70–Bag3 complex is a hub for proteotoxicity-induced signaling that controls protein aggregation
VL  - 115
IS  - 30
SP  - E7043-E7052
AB  - Protein abnormalities in cells are the cause of major pathologies, and a number of adaptive responses have evolved to relieve the toxicity of misfolded polypeptides. To trigger these responses, cells must detect the buildup of aberrant proteins which often associate with proteasome failure, but the sensing mechanism is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that this mechanism involves the heat shock protein 70–Bcl-2–associated athanogene 3 (Hsp70–Bag3) complex, which upon proteasome suppression responds to the accumulation of defective ribosomal products, preferentially recognizing the stalled polypeptides. Components of the ribosome quality control system LTN1 and VCP and the ribosome-associated chaperone NAC are necessary for the interaction of these species with the Hsp70–Bag3 complex. This complex regulates important signaling pathways, including the Hippo pathway effectors LATS1/2 and the p38 and JNK stress kinases. Furthermore, under proteotoxic stress Hsp70–Bag3–LATS1/2 signaling regulates protein aggregation. We established that the regulated step was the emergence and growth of abnormal protein oligo-mers containing only a few molecules, indicating that aggregation is regulated at very early stages. The Hsp70–Bag3 complex therefore functions as an important signaling node that senses proteo-toxicity and triggers multiple pathways that control cell physiology, including activation of protein aggregation. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Formation and evolution of coal– and oil–bearing source rocks in the Lower Cretaceous Shahai Formation in the Fuxin Basin (NE China): Evidence from organic and inorganic geochemical analyses
VL  - 202
AB  - Two source rocks were deposited in the Lower Cretaceous Shahai Formation (K1sh) in the Fuxin Basin (NE China): the third Member (K1sh3) coal–bearing and the fourth Member (K1sh4) oil–bearing source rock. However, the differences between the two Fuxin Basin source rocks remain poorly constrained. This study systematically reveals the formation and evolution of these source rocks through sedimentological and geochemical analyses. During the K1sh3 deposition, the intermittently warm–humid climate promoted organic matter (OM) input from terrestrial plants. Meanwhile, the restricted swamp with suboxic water conditions enhanced OM preservation and reduced OM dilution. Thus, warm–humid climate, suboxic water conditions of swamp controlled the formation of excellent coal–bearing source rock with highest total organic carbon (TOC) content (avg. 28.68 wt%) and Type III kerogen (perhydrous). The post–mature maturity (avg. 484 °C Tmax) indicates that the K1sh3 coal–bearing source rocks have reached the wet to dry gas generation stage. During the K1sh4 deposition, rapid basin subsidence and a humid–prone climate resulted in lake expansion, enhancing the dysoxic bottom water conditions. Moreover, the rapid basin subsidence triggered frequent gravity flows. The turbidity flows delivered terrestrial OM fragments and nutrients, promoting the lacustrine productivity and producing OM dominated by aquatic organisms with some terrestrial plants. However, hyperconcentrated density flows disturbed the dysoxic bottom water conditions and strongly diluted the OM. Hence, the humid–prone climate, dysoxic bottom water conditions and gravity flows have controlled the formation of the K1sh4 oil–bearing source rock with high TOC contents (avg. 2.73 wt%). The oil–bearing source rocks show good hydrocarbon potential (avg. 6.17 mg HC/g rock S2) and Type II to III kerogen (perhydrous). The mature oil–bearing source rocks (avg. 443 °C Tmax) in the lower K1sh4 were at the oil generation peak and may be the chief source rock in the Fuxin Basin. During the Early Cretaceous, similar rift basins were developed in Northeast China, so this study provides a typical sample for source rock prediction in other adjoining rift basins. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

SP  - 1285-1289
AB  - Vermiculite is an industrial mineral used mainly in building construction and agriculture and also used as anticorrosive and thermal and acoustic insulator. Vermiculite mineralization is associated with structurally controlled hydrothermal alteration processes in phlogopite-rich mafic-ultramafic intrusions hosted by granodioritic orthogneisses. In this research, we use airborne magnetic and radiometric data to characterize known deposits and select possible targets in the study region. First, we measured magnetic susceptibility on drill cores to define ore correlation with magnetic responses. Second, we selected known deposits to establish airborne geophysical signatures related to the mineralization. Magnetic data was used to enhance shallow sources and map intrusion extents and fertile structural zones. Radiometric data was used to map mafic-ultramafic rocks of low responses. Magnetic anomaly amplitudes were quantified and correlated to three types of known deposits. Based on the correlation, 59 potential targets were selected and prioritized. © 2021 Society of Exploration Geophysicists First International Meeting for Applied Geoscience & Energy

AB  - Introduction. Understanding the biophysical phenomena related to the Hofmeister series or cosmotropic/chaotropic properties of ions requires experimental data on specific ion effects of large organic molecules. Problem Statement. Specific ion effects are of significant importance for biophysics and medicine. It is interesting to find out if additives with biologically relevant anions can interact with proteins and avoid aggregation. Purpose. The purpose of this research is to study the stabilizing/destabilizing effects in Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM)/water, hen egg white/water systems under influence of substances of various classes of different hydrophobia. Materials and Methods. Materials: sodium salts: salicylate, ferulate, benzoate, vanillate, cinnamate; humic acid sodium salt, hydroxy-sodium benzoate, glycine, L-alanine, sodium L-glutamate, D-(-)-quinnic acid, PNIPAM, egg white. Methods: measurement of the transition temperature (TT) of PNIPAM/water and the denaturation temperature of the egg white / water systems. Results. Ion-specific effects have been studied with the use of models based on the research of the transition temperature (TT) evolution of binary PNIPAM / water mixtures (for heating from 0 to 35°C) and the denaturation temperature of the egg white / water (for heating from 48 to 65°C). The dependences of these temperatures on the content of substances that occur in live nature have been received at pH = 7.4. Conclusions. The results have shown the tendencies of the additive solubilizing effects on PNIPAM and egg white. The majority of substances studied has the salting-out effect on PNIPAM / water in the order NaBz ~ NaCinn < L-NaGlu ~ NaFer. For NaSal and NaHum; the salting-in effect has been established. For the egg white, all additives show the salting-in effect. In PNIPAM and egg white systems, NaBz and L-NaGlu demonstrate the opposite effects. The results have been compared with the ones for binary mixtures of water/di-propylene glycol propyl ether (DPnP). © 2021 North Caucasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, State Technological University.

TI  - Multi-factor control of seed mass of species on the eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau: Integration of environmental filters, local adaptation and correlated evolution
VL  - 187
AB  - Seed mass is a central plant life history trait that varies and evolves due to selection by biotic or abiotic factors. To determine the factors affecting seed mass variation among species and phylogeny, we used linear and regression tree analyses of three biotic traits and four niche traits to quantify the relative importance of each trait on seed mass for 1340 angiosperm species from the eastern part of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Dispersal mode was the strongest predictor of both species and phylogenetic seed mass variation, whereas life form only had a small impact. These results suggest that seed mass has responded to dispersers rather than the life history or available stored resources. Moreover, in both inter-specific and phylogenetic comparisons, species with similar light, moisture and disturbance niche positions tended to have similar seed mass, indicating that adaptation to local environments is a second force driving species-level seed mass variation. The lack of any relationship between thermal niche and seed mass in the phylogenetic analysis implies that seed mass variation along thermal gradients may be a result of regional species sorting, or alternatively, a plastic response to the variation in plant size. All species and phylogenetic multivariate models showed that both dispersal mode and species light/moisture niche explain seed mass variation, suggesting the importance of coevolution or covariation between seeds and vertebrates and the selection or filter effect of habitats on early life-history stages of plants in affecting individual seed development. Lastly, our results imply that phylogenetic constraints and niche conservatism may operate simultaneously in determining regional patterns of seed mass variation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Long-term multigenerational experimental simulations of climate change on insect pests of economically and socially important crops are crucial to anticipate challenges for feeding humanity in the not-so-far future. Mexican bean weevil Zabrotes subfasciatus, is a worldwide pest that attacks the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris seeds, in crops and storage. We designed a long term (i.e., over 10 generations), experimental simulation of climate change by increasing temperature and CO2 air concentration in controlled conditions according to model predictions for 2100. Higher temperature and CO2 concentrations favored pest's egg-to-adult development survival, even at high female fecundity. It also induced a reduction of fat storage and increase of protein content but did not alter body size. After 10 generations of simulation, genetic adaptation was detected for total lipid content only, however, other traits showed signs of such process. Future experimental designs and methods similar to ours, are key for studying long-term effects of climate change through multigenerational experimental designs. © 2020 The Authors.

VL  - 45
IS  - 12

AB  - Great efforts have been made recently to totally or partially replace calcium aluminate cement (CAC) by alternative materials in refractory castables, in order to attain an enhanced thermomechanical performance of these ceramic linings at intermediate temperatures (600–1200 °C). Besides that, using additives that induce earlier sintering/densification of the refractory microstructure may also reduce the energy costs derived from the production of pre-formed pieces. Based on these aspects, this work investigated the viability of replacing CAC by calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2] to ensure a suitable binding action and effective sintering/densification of the designed compositions at intermediate temperatures. Six high-alumina castables containing these alternative additives or their blend were prepared and their green mechanical strength, apparent porosity and Young's modulus evolution with temperature were evaluated within the 30–1400 °C range. After that, the most promising compositions were characterized via X ray diffraction and thermomechanical tests, such as cold and hot modulus of rupture, thermal shock resistance, etc. Although the selected binders did not result in specimens with green mechanical strength values as high as the ones for the cement-bonded materials (2–8 MPa versus ∼18 MPa, respectively), they could be demolded and handled without any problems. CaCO3 and/or Ca(OH)2-bonded compositions presented a sintering effect at intermediate temperatures (600–1000 °C) due to the so-called “sintering-coarsening-coalescence” phenomenon. These transformations favored the faster sintering/densification of the tested castables, resulting in samples with improved cold and hot mechanical strength at 900 °C, reaching values within the range of 28–30 MPa instead of 10–13 MPa for the CAC-bonded one. After firing the evaluated compositions at higher temperatures (up to 1500 °C), all compositions presented similar results regarding their modulus of rupture or thermal shock resistance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

TI  - Three generations of selective breeding improved rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) disease resistance against natural challenge with Flavobacterium psychrophilum during early life-stage rearing
VL  - 497
SP  - 414-421
AB  - Bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) is a frequent cause of mortality in freshwater rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the implementation of a family-based genetic selection program to improve disease resistance has been previously described. To quantify and understand the consequences of selection, three lines of outbred rainbow trout were created by divergent selection: ARS-Fp-R (resistant), ARS-Fp-C (control) and ARS-Fp-S (susceptible). Herein, results from both field and laboratory studies are described comparing survival of third-generation ARS-Fp-R line eggs/fish stocked at equal proportions to control and susceptible lines and reared together in a common environment. The survival of the pooled-line cohort was compared to the survival of an age-matched hatchery line, Fish Lake-DeSmet (FLDS) during early life-stage rearing. A typical BCWD outbreak occurred in the FLDS line while a more limited mortality event occurred in tanks containing the pooled lines. Mortalities from days 42–70 of the trial were saved for pedigree assignment and pathogen load measurement. After accounting for differences in early post-hatch survival, ARS-Fp-R line fish demonstrated two-fold lower BCWD-related mortality while ARS-Fp-S line fish demonstrated two-fold higher mortality; however, there was not a survival advantage of the ARS-Fp-R line fish over ARS-Fp-C line fish. At the end of the trial period, F. psychrophilum was not detected in spleen tissue of live-sampled ARS-Fp-R line fish while 10.3% of the ARS-Fp-C line and 36.4% of the ARS-Fp-S line fish exhibited detectable loads. Experimental challenge of the genetic lines with two different F. psychrophilum strains confirmed significantly higher survival of the ARS-Fp-R line fish as compared to either the ARS-Fp-S or FLDS genetic lines, albeit the susceptibility of the FLDS line was confounded by slower growth rate. These data demonstrate that three generations of artificial selection translated into improved survival following either natural or experimental exposure to F. psychrophilum. These data also suggest that hatchery lines, such as Fish Lake-DeSmet, may have higher relative susceptibility to BCWD thereby contributing to location outbreak severity. © 2018

VL  - 27

SP  - 355-361
AB  - Ever since the Antarctic waters began to cool about 20 million years ago, Antarctic notothenioid fishes, comprising more than 120 species, have been living in the stable, extremely cold, and oxygen-rich Antarctic waters, when all other temperate fishes gradually disappeared. In order to survive the coldest area in the world, Antarctic notothenioid fishes have evolved many adaptive changes in their biochemical and physiological functions; among these changes, the origin and evolution of antifreeze proteins is one of the most important adaptations of Antarctic fishes. Antifreeze proteins are a family of macromolecules that are essential for survival in extreme cold conditions. For the time being, at least one antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP) and four structurally different antifreeze protein (AFPs) types, known as AFP I, AFP II, AFP III, and AFP IV, have been identified from polar and subpolar fishes. Although these AFPs have similar structures and functions, their origin and evolution are significantly different. AFPs have also been found in insects, plants, and bacteria living in cold habitats. In fish, AFPs are typically secreted into the blood and also produced in the skin, scales, fin, and gills. AFPs cause ice recrystallization inhibition and contribute to non-colligative freezing point depression by binding to small ice crystals in order to inhibit their growth. AFPs can reduce the freezing point of Antarctic notothenioid fishes' body fluids to-2.2 °C; this preserves the fluidity of body fluids at sub-zero temperatures and protects fishes from freezing damage. Due to the natural biological properties of AFPs, such as the thermal hysteresis activity (THA) and the inhibition of ice recrystallization activities (IRI), they have several commercial applications. AFPs can be used in the food industry for food preservation and ice cream production; they can also be used in the agricultural and biomedical fields to freeze and preserve a wide variety of biological samples including body tissues (cells, organs, embryos, and gametes) of human beings, animals, and fishes. Additionally, AFP transgenic plants show enhanced cold tolerance. Studies have demonstrated that AFPs are up to 300 times more effective than traditional antifreeze chemicals at the same concentrations and they can improve post-thaw viability regardless of the freezing method. Since AFPs show promising potential application prospects in the fields of medicine, food industry, agriculture, etc., there has been an accumulation of relevant published research recently. In this paper, the evolution, function, application, and current concerns regarding the use of AFPs were reviewed. © 2020, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences.

TI  - Variation in life-history traits of European anchovy along a latitudinal gradient: A bioenergetics modelling approach
VL  - 2018
SP  - 95-112
AB  - Anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus distribution in European waters spans from the Mediterranean Sea to the North Sea, and is expected to expand further north with global warming. Observations from the eastern Mediterranean (North Aegean Sea), the Bay of Biscay and the North Sea reveal latitudinal differences in growth, maximum size, fecundity and timing of reproduction. We set up a mechanistic framework combining a bioenergetics model with regional physical-biogeochemical models providing temperature and zooplankton biomass to investigate the underlying mechanisms of variation in these traits. The bioenergetics model, based on the Dynamic Energy Budget theory and initially calibrated in the Bay of Biscay, was used to simulate growth and reproduction patterns. Environment partly explained the increased growth rate and larger body size towards the north. However, regional calibration of the maximum assimilation rate was necessary to obtain the best model fit. This suggests a genetic adaptation, with a pattern of cogradient variation with increasing resource towards the north, in addition to a countergradient thermal adaptation. Overall, the seasonal energy dynamics supports the pattern of body-size scaling with latitude, i.e. food-limited growth but low maintenance costs in the warm Aegean Sea, and larger size in the North Sea allowing sufficient storage capacity for overwintering. Further, the model suggests a synchronisation of reproductive timing with environmental seasonality as a trade-off between thresholds of temperature and reserves for spawning and overwintering, respectively. Finally, low temperature, short productive and spawning seasons, and insufficient reserves for overwintering appear to be current limitations for an expansion of anchovy to the Norwegian Sea. © Inter-Research 2018.

AB  - We urgently need to predict species responses to climate change to minimize future biodiversity loss and ensure we do not waste limited resources on ineffective conservation strategies. Currently, most predictions of species responses to climate change ignore the potential for evolution. However, evolution can alter species ecological responses, and different aspects of evolution and ecology can interact to produce complex eco-evolutionary dynamics under climate change. Here we review how evolution could alter ecological responses to climate change on species warm and cool range margins, where evolution could be especially important. We discuss different aspects of evolution in isolation, and then synthesize results to consider how multiple evolutionary processes might interact and affect conservation strategies. On species cool range margins, the evolution of dispersal could increase range expansion rates and allow species to adapt to novel conditions in their new range. However, low genetic variation and genetic drift in small range-front populations could also slow or halt range expansions. Together, these eco-evolutionary effects could cause a three-step, stop-and-go expansion pattern for many species. On warm range margins, isolation among populations could maintain high genetic variation that facilitates evolution to novel climates and allows species to persist longer than expected without evolution. This ‘evolutionary extinction debt’ could then prevent other species from shifting their ranges. However, as climate change increases isolation among populations, increasing dispersal mortality could select for decreased dispersal and cause rapid range contractions. Some of these eco-evolutionary dynamics could explain why many species are not responding to climate change as predicted. We conclude by suggesting that resurveying historical studies that measured trait frequencies, the strength of selection, or heritabilities could be an efficient way to increase our eco-evolutionary knowledge in climate change biology. © 2019 The Authors

TI  - Physiological differences in preferred temperatures and evaporative water loss rates in two sympatric lacertid species
VL  - 126
SP  - 58-64
AB  - Sister species living in sympatry offer the opportunity to study the degree of divergence in their ecological, physiological and life-history traits. It has been hypothesized that closely related species with overlapping distribution should differ in their niche to reduce competition for resources. Furthermore, the investigation of sympatric species may shed light on how they may coexist without outcompeting each other. In the present study, we assess the degree of physiological divergence in two sympatric lacertid lizards, Podarcis bocagei and Podarcis guadarramae lusitanicus. These species share a Pliocenic ancestry and overlap at a both geographical and ecological scale. We assessed their thermal preferences and water loss rates, two physiological traits considered stable across congeneric species. We found that the two species differ in both traits, with P. bocagei selecting higher temperature than P. g. lusitanicus and losing more water than the latter at and above its preferred temperature. The results also showed that for both species body size has a relevant impact on thermal and hydric traits, with bigger individuals losing proportionally less water and selecting higher temperatures. These results, combined with previous evidence, suggest that physiological mechanisms, ecological preferences and morphology probably allow these two species to overlap in their distribution while selecting different microhabitats and thus decreasing possible competition between them. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Wind farm layout optimization based on support vector regression guided genetic algorithm with consideration of participation among landowners
VL  - 196
SP  - 1267-1281
AB  - Due to the existence of wake effect that causes the reduction of intake wind speed among wind turbines in the downwind direction, the wind farm efficiency is substantially discounted. An integral question to ask is how to find the optimal wind turbine layout given a wind farm. Inspired by the self-adjustment capability among individuals in the natural evolution process, a new algorithm called support vector regression guided genetic algorithm is proposed to solve the wind warm layout optimization problem which integrates the capability in each individual to adjust itself for a better “fitness” with guiding information sampled from a response surface approximated by support vector regression. It is also interesting to use the new proposed algorithm to evaluate the impact of the constraints imposed by landowners’ willingness whether to rent their land to the wind farm company. Extensive numerical experiments under different settings of wind distribution and wind farms with unusable cells are conducted to validate the proposed algorithm, shedding insights on the impact of landowners’ participation on the overall efficiency. The experiment showcases that the proposed algorithm outperforms two baseline algorithms under different conditions with improved efficiency.

TI  - Rootstock and potassium fertilization, in terms of phenology, thermal demand and chemical evolution, of berries on Niagara Rosada grapevine under subtropical conditions
VL  - 81
AB  - This study aimed to assess the effect of rootstocks (IAC 572 and IAC 766) and potassium fertilization at different concentrations (0, 75, 150 and 300 kg·ha-1 K2O) on the phenology and thermal demand of the Niagara Rosada grapevine, and to evaluate the development of chemical traits during maturation stage. The length of the main phenological stages was recorded within two production seasons. Total thermal demand was calculated using the degree-day concept. The berries’ titratable acidity and soluble solids contents were determined during maturation. Results indicated that IAC 572 and IAC 766 rootstocks along with potassium fertilization had no influence on the phenological cycle or thermal demand of the Niagara Rosada grapevine. The production cycle lasted 144 to 148 days with thermal demands ranging from 1,465.2 to 1,615.1 degree-days. For better grape quality, i.e., with a balance between soluble solids and acidity levels, it is estimated that the grape harvest is carried out around 21 to 24 days after the veraison. © 2022, Agronomic Institute of Campinas.

TI  - Phenology of the semiaquatic caterpillar Paracles klagesi and its response to environmental changes
VL  - 47
IS  - 5
SP  - 1113-1123
AB  - Phenological patterns can arise as a response to seasonal variation and are closely related to rain regimes and temperature. Organisms living in the water/atmosphere interface receive stimuli from both environments and require adaptations to survive. Paracles klagesi (Rothschild, 1910) is a semiaquatic caterpillar with a terrestrial adult form found in streams in a Brazilian savannah. We hypothesized that the semiaquatic larvae of this species respond to atmospheric environmental changes in rainfall and temperature by synchronizing their development throughout the year, with the highest abundance during the dry season and the lowest in the rainy season. We followed a caterpillar population for 1 year, counted and measured individuals every 15 days and obtained monthly average temperature and rainfall data. Currently, there is no description of P. klagesi instars; therefore, we categorized them into six size classes and a pupal stage. Since phenological and physiological responses are complex and may not be perceived at the time of the stimulus, we used a Pearson's correlation test with a time lag of up to 3 months to investigate the influence of rainfall and temperature. The caterpillars showed synchronized development over time, supporting our first hypothesis. The time-lag analysis identified an immediate inverse relationship between caterpillar abundance and monthly rainfall, while the temperature had a delayed positive relationship with pupae of 3 months. Our results showed that P. klagesi synchronized its development with time and, as a semiaquatic insect, used atmospheric cues for pupae to complete its development. This is the first study providing information about phenology and the role of temperature and rainfall in the development of a semiaquatic lepidopteran. We believe that unusual strategies by insects may provide data for understanding how evolutionary forces influence adaptations as insects colonize new environments. © 2022 Ecological Society of Australia.

TI  - On Machining behaviour of various cutting Inserts: A review on hardened steel
VL  - 62
SP  - 3485-3492
AB  - Cutting tool plays an important criterion for the overall performance of machining to achieve better tool-life, superior surface finish along with immense productivity. The evolution of cutting temperature along with increased cutting parameters accelerates the plastic deformation of insert tip, cutting edge breakage and thus affects the surface quality. Built-up-edge (BUE) formation also enhances rapid tool wear, fluctuations of cutting forces, and vibration. Therefore in modern manufacturing to enhance productivity considering good surface quality, there is striving for innovation and research in the area of novel cutting tool materials. Hard machining emerges as a newer process alternative to traditional grinding performance where popular cutting tool materials used as CBN (Cubic Boron Nitride), ceramics, and coated carbides etc. The benefits of hard machining serve as reduction of the manufacturing cycle, cost, and environmental friendly. Thermal softening and reduction of shear stress due to the rise of cutting temperature enable hard machining easier under dry environment compared to flood cooling. However, tool wear and surface roughness deteriorates and thus reduces tool life due to frequent failure of cutting edge. Thus in the current review, the performance of cutting tool materials during machining hardened steels is focused. Moreover, a proper selection of cooling and lubrication strategy can prolong the tool life and surface finish. Different hard thin layer coatings on carbide tools enhance the machining performance due to thermal barrier, abrasion, and diffusion resistance properties. Due to techno-economical feasibility, coated carbide cutting tools are extensively used during hard machining in recent years which has been developed by CVD/PVD method.

VL  - 78
IS  - 4
SP  - 521-534
AB  - The overwintering pattern of parasitic herbivorous arthropods is closely related to host phenology, because defoliation imposes strong selection pressures on various developmental stages. This relationship has been well studied in populations of spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae) on deciduous hosts, but is little studied in populations on evergreen hosts, probably because their leaves are always available. However, spring defoliation may also influence the life cycle. We studied the overwintering pattern of Schizotetranychus brevisetosus (Acari: Tetranychidae), a specialist on evergreen oak, Quercus glauca, in Kochi, Japan. Only adult females and their eggs (winter eggs) survived the coldest months. We also observed a conspicuous seasonal change in egg colour and size: December winter eggs were 1.7× larger than September summer eggs, suggesting the winter eggs are diapausing. Adult females produced summer eggs until November and winter eggs from late November until they disappeared in March. The winter eggs hatched in early March. The immature stages developed in mid- to late March, when 39% of old leaves fell, some of which carried hundreds of immature individuals. Therefore, even in evergreen hosts, defoliation places potentially strong selection pressure on the immature stages. Despite this, S. brevisetosus appears not to change its egg hatching season to avoid the defoliation season, so it may have evolved a behavioural adaptation to escape falling leaves. The existence of several species with similar lifestyles suggests the importance of host phenology and predation pressure for evolution of the overwintering pattern. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Enhancement of biohydrogen production from sustainable orange peel wastes using Enterobacter species isolated from domestic wastewater
VL  - 43
IS  - 1
SP  - 391-404
AB  - Five facultative anaerobic bacterial isolates were recovered from domestic wastewater. These isolates were identified based on the 16S rRNA as Enterobacter aerogenes (one isolate), Enterobacter cloacae (two isolates), and Cronobacter sakazakii (three isolates). These isolates were examined for their potential to evolve hydrogen on a glucose medium. The most potent hydrogen-producing isolates, E aerogenes (KY549389) and E cloacae (KY524293), were examined for their capacity to generate hydrogen, acetone, butanol, and ethanol using orange peel (OP) hydrolysate. OP powder was pretreated with n-hexane to remove the toxicity of d-limonene. Different concentrations (4%, 6%, and 8% w/v) of limonene-free OP were subjected to the boiling water (temperature of 100°C) or acid (HCl) treatments. The maximum fermentative H2 production of 1700 and 1620 mL/L was obtained from 6% OP hydrolysate extracted with boiling water using facultative anaerobic E aerogenes (KY549389) and E cloacae (KY524293), respectively. Hydrogen production efficiency was 0.99 and 1.19 mol H2/mol glucose for E aerogenes and E cloacae, respectively. The total fermentative acetone, butanol, and ethanol (ABE) generated by E aerogenes and E cloacae were 0.78 and 0.38 g/L including acetone (0.05 and 0.04 g/L), butanol (0.011 and 0.013 g/L), and ethanol (0.71 and 0.32 g/L), respectively. The maximum ABE productivity was 0.01 and 0.005 g/L/h generated at 60 g/L OP hydrolysate by E aerogenes and E cloacae, respectively. These strains were positive for nitrogen fixation (nitrogenase) capability estimated by the acetylene reduction assay. Application of OP hydrolysate without the addition of any nutritional components or reducing agent is considered an eco-friendly, economical, and commercial substrate for desired biofuel production. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

VL  - 46

AB  - 1. Phenotypic plasticity and/or genetic adaptation may allow species to live in a variable environment. It has been shown that eggs of the dark bush-cricket, Pholidoptera griseoaptera, which experienced an insufficient warm treatment (shorter and/or colder), had a longer development time and hatched predominantly after the second diapause. 2. Given the broad distribution of this species from sea level to the timber line, we expected variation in voltinism along a climatic gradient. To reveal the role of natural selection in egg-hatching patterns, we compared different and unrelated populations sampled along a 1000 m elevational gradient in a common laboratory experiment. 3. In the same rearing microclimate, we found that populations from mountains had mostly a shorter life cycle, whereas semivoltinism prevailed in lowland populations. 4. This demonstrated the genetically underpinned local adaptation of this insect to harsh mountain environments with a shorter growing season determined by elevation. © 2020 The Royal Entomological Society

TI  - Genome-wide association analysis reveals genetic variations and candidate genes associated with growth-related traits and condition factor in Takifugu bimaculatus
VL  - 1
IS  - 2
SP  - 89-99
AB  - Takifugu bimaculatus is a new breed of pufferfish that has emerged in the recent twenty years. As a euryhaline species, the habitat of T. bimaculatus ranges from the Yangtze River estuary to the South China Sea. It is always mix-bred with Penaeus monodon and Ruditapes philippinarum. The strong adaptability to temperature and salinity makes it become a candidate species for Takifugu aquaculture in south china. But the slower growth rate and smaller body size limit the further development and promotion of the T. bimaculatus breeding industry. In addition, the sexual maturity of the three years hinders the efficiency of traditional breeding methods. With the increasing demand of market, selecting and breeding new strains with excellent growth-related traits by the markers-assistance selection (MAS) and genome selection (GS) will accelerate the T. bimaculatus breeding industrial upgrading. In this study, 5 traits were employed to represent the growth, including body length (BL), body weight (BW), body length gain (BLG), body weight gain (BWG), and condition factor (K) at 8, 20 and 32-month after hatch. 167 individuals of a full-sib family were genotyped by Whole-genome Resequencing (WGS) and 122,573 SNPs were identified on 22 chromosomes. 9 genome-wide significant SNPs were identified to be associated with different growth-related traits through the Genome-wide association study by Mixed Linear Model (MLM). Surrounding these SNPs, we identified 17 growth-related candidate genes, including mstn1, igfbp5, igfbp2b, igf1r, fgfr3, fgf10 and tgfbr3. These genes are involved in the muscle growth, Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway, Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway and Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway. Besides, 10 genome-wide significant SNPs and 5 candidate genes were identified to be associated with K, including pth2r, myh7b, gdf10, hspb8a and midnb, which are involved in osteoblast differentiation, adipogenesis and heat stress response. These results above will contribute to the understanding of the genetic basis of growth and provide several reliable molecular markers for the MAS and GS in T. bimaculatus breeding project. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Development and validation of a supercritical fluid chromatography method for fast analysis of six flavonoids in Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium
VL  - 1133
AB  - The study is aimed to develop a rapid and efficient supercritical fluid chromatography coupled with diode-array detection (SFC-DAD) method for simultaneous quantification of six flavonoids in Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP). The chromatographic parameters including stationary phase, mobile phase composition, back pressure, temperature and flow rate, were systematically optimized with single-factor test. The results indicated that the six compounds were baseline separated on an Agilent Zorbax RX-SIL column using gradient elution within 10 min. The optimized mobile phase was constituted of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methanol. And the parameters were set as follows: backpressure, 95 bar; temperature, 45 °C; flow rate, 0.8 mL/min. The optimized method showed satisfactory retention and resolution for the analytes. The method was validated to demonstrate its selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and robustness. Thus, the verified SFC method was successfully applied to quantification of flavonoids present in CRP samples. The results indicated that SFC has the potential to become an excellent alternative for the analysis of flavonoids in herbal medicines, owning to its intrinsic features like high efficiency, separation speed and eco-friendly characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 26

SP  - 2184-2202
AB  - Climate change will affect the dynamics of the hydrogeological systems and their water resources quality; in particular nitrate, which is herein taken as a paradigmatic pollutant to illustrate the effects of climate change on groundwater quality. Based on climatic predictions of temperature and precipitation for the horizon of 2021 and 2050, as well as on land use distribution, water balances are recalculated for the hydrological basins of distinct aquifer systems in a western Mediterranean region as Catalonia (NE Spain) in order to determine the reduction of available water resources. Besides the fact that climate change will represent a decrease of water availability, we qualitatively discuss the modifications that will result from the future climatic scenarios and their impact on nitrate pollution according to the geological setting of the selected aquifers. Climate effects in groundwater quality are described according to hydrological, environmental, socio-economic, and political concerns. Water reduction stands as a major issue that will control stream-aquifer interactions and subsurface recharge, leading to a general modification of nitrate in groundwater as dilution varies. A nitrate mass balance model provides a gross estimation of potential nitrate evolution in these aquifers, and it points out that the control of the fertilizer load will be crucial to achieve adequate nitrate content in groundwater. Reclaimed wastewater stands as local reliable resource, yet its amount will only satisfy a fraction of the loss of available resources due to climate change. Finally, an integrated management perspective is necessary to avoid unplanned actions from private initiatives that will jeopardize the achievement of sustainable water resources exploitation under distinct hydrological scenarios. © 2018, The Author(s).

TI  - Transformation of block copolymer nanoparticles from ellipsoids with striped lamellae into onionlike spheres and dynamical control via coupled cahn−hilliard equations
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SP  - 1304-1314
AB  - Annealing of block copolymers has become a tool of great importance for the reconfiguration of nanoparticles. Here, we present the experimental results of annealing block copolymer nanoparticles and a theoretical model to describe the morphological transformation of ellipsoids with striped lamellae into onionlike spheres. A good correspondence between the experimental findings and predictions of the model was observed. The model based on finding the steepest direction of descent of an appropriate free energy leads to a set of Cahn−Hilliard equations that correctly describe the dynamical transformation of striped ellipsoids into onionlike spheres and reverse onionlike particles, regardless of the nature of the annealing process. This universality makes it possible to describe a variety of experimental conditions involving nanoparticles underlying a heating process. A notable advantage of the proposed approach is that it enables selective control of the interaction between the confined block copolymer and the surrounding medium. This feature endows the model with a great versatility to enable the reproduction of several combined effects of surfactants in diverse conditions, including cases with reverse affinities for the block copolymer segments. A phase diagram to describe a variety of morphologies is presented. We employ the relationship between the temperature-dependent Flory−Huggins parameter and the width of the interfaces to account for changes in temperature due to the heating process. Simulation results correctly show how the transformation evolves as the temperature increases. This increment in temperature corresponds to progressively smaller values of the interfacial width. We anticipate that the proposed approach will facilitate the design and more precise control of experiments involving various kinds of annealing processes. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

VL  - 35

AB  - The courtship song of male Drosophila melanogaster is generated by wing vibration and contains an interpulse interval (IPI) which is species-specific and usually falls in the mean range of 30–40 ms. The IPI is extremely temperature-sensitive, so we wondered whether flies collected along the eastern coast of Australia between latitudes 16.9°S and 42.9°S might have adapted to the different thermal conditions and show differences in mean IPI. We observe a significant correlation between IPI and latitude in addition to the well-known association between latitude and body size (Bergmannn’s Rule). However, somewhat surprisingly we could not detect a significant association between body size and IPI. We also examined flies collected from the North and South-facing slopes of ‘Evolution Canyon’ in Israel and observed differences in IPI that support the view that thermal adaptation can shape this important song character. We also examined the songs of flies from Kenya and observed no correlation between altitude of collection and IPI. In all three experiments, body size did not correlate with IPI. A global analysis of all three sets of populations on three continents revealed a strong association between IPI and latitude. We speculate that IPI is shaped by thermal and sexual selection whereas body size is also shaped by natural selection. © 2021 The Author(s).

VL  - 303

SP  - 1075-1103
AB  - Body size has thermal repercussions that impact physiology. Large-bodied dinosaurs potentially retained heat to the point of reaching dangerous levels, whereas small dinosaurs shed heat relatively easily. Elevated body temperatures are known to have an adverse influence on neurosensory tissues and require physiological mechanisms for selective brain and eye temperature regulation. Vascular osteological correlates in fossil dinosaur skulls from multiple clades representing different body-size classes were identified and compared. Neurovascular canals were identified that differentiate thermoregulatory strategies involving three sites of evaporative cooling that are known in extant diapsids to function in selective brain temperature regulation. Small dinosaurs showed similarly sized canals, reflecting a plesiomorphic balanced pattern of blood supply and a distributed thermoregulatory strategy with little evidence of enhancement of any sites of thermal exchange. Large dinosaurs, however, showed a more unbalanced vascular pattern whereby certain sites of thermal exchange were emphasized for enhanced blood flow, reflecting a more focused thermal strategy. A quantitative, statistical analysis of canal cross-sectional area was conducted to test these anatomical results, confirming that large-bodied, and often large-headed, species showed focused thermal strategies with enhanced collateral blood flow to certain sites of heat exchange. Large theropods showed evidence for a plesiomorphic balanced blood flow pattern, yet evidence for vascularization of the large antorbital paranasal air sinus indicates theropods may have had a fourth site of heat exchange as part of a novel focused thermoregulatory strategy. Evidence presented here for differing thermoregulatory strategies based on size and phylogeny helps refine our knowledge of dinosaur physiology.

TI  - Application of Gaussian process regression models for capturing the evolution of microstructure statistics in aging of nickel-based superalloys
VL  - 178
SP  - 45-58
AB  - Nickel-based superalloys, used extensively in advanced gas turbine engines, exhibit complex microstructures that evolve during exposure to high temperatures (i.e., aging treatments). In this work, we examine critically if the principal component (PC) representation of rotationally invariant 2-point spatial correlations can adequately capture the salient features of the microstructure evolution in the thermal aging of the superalloys. For this purpose, an experimental study involving microstructure characterization of 27 differently aged (i.e., different combinations of temperature and time of exposure) samples was designed and conducted. Of these, 23 samples were employed for training a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model that took the aging temperature and the aging time as inputs, and predicted the microstructure statistics as output. The viability of the approach described above was evaluated critically by comparing the predictions for the four samples that were not used in the training of the GPR model. Furthermore, a new strategy was developed and implemented to generate digital microstructures corresponding to the predicted microstructure statistics. The predicted microstructures were found to be in good agreement with the experimentally measured one, validating the novel framework presented in this work. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

TI  - Genome-wide analysis of natural and restored eastern oyster populations reveals local adaptation and positive impacts of planting frequency and broodstock number
VL  - 15
IS  - 1
SP  - 40-59
AB  - The release of captive-bred plants and animals has increased worldwide to augment declining species. However, insufficient attention has been given to understanding how neutral and adaptive genetic variation are partitioned within and among proximal natural populations, and the patterns and drivers of gene flow over small spatial scales, which can be important for restoration success. A seascape genomics approach was used to investigate population structure, local adaptation, and the extent to which environmental gradients influence genetic variation among natural and restored populations of Chesapeake Bay eastern oysters Crassostrea virginica. We also investigated the impact of hatchery practices on neutral genetic diversity of restored reefs and quantified the broader genetic impacts of large-scale hatchery-based bivalve restoration. Restored reefs showed similar levels of diversity as natural reefs, and striking relationships were found between planting frequency and broodstock numbers and genetic diversity metrics (effective population size and relatedness), suggesting that hatchery practices can have a major impact on diversity. Despite long-term restoration activities, haphazard historical translocations, and high dispersal potential of larvae that could homogenize allele frequencies among populations, moderate neutral population genetic structure was uncovered. Moreover, environmental factors, namely salinity, pH, and temperature, play a major role in the distribution of neutral and adaptive genetic variation. For marine invertebrates in heterogeneous seascapes, collecting broodstock from large populations experiencing similar environments to candidate sites may provide the most appropriate sources for restoration and ensure population resilience in the face of rapid environmental change. This is one of a few studies to demonstrate empirically that hatchery practices have a major impact on the retention of genetic diversity. Overall, these results contribute to the growing body of evidence for fine-scale genetic structure and local adaptation in broadcast-spawning marine species and provide novel information for the management of an important fisheries resource. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Age and annual growth rate cause spatial variation in body size in Phrynocephalus przewalskii (Agamid)
VL  - 10
IS  - 24
SP  - 14189-14195
AB  - Whether or not biogeographic rules dealing with spatial patterns of animal body sizes are valid for ectotherms is controversial. As the ectotherms grow all their lives, we explored the role of age and annual growth rate in body size variation in Phrynocephalus przewalskii in northern China. Morphological data were collected from 11 populations across a broad geographic gradient. Correlations between age, sex, climatic factors, and body size were analyzed using generalized linear model (GLM) and generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). GLM analysis indicated that the general body size of both sexes and the appendage size of females increased significantly with increasing temperature; however, the coefficient of determination was very small. GLMM analysis indicated that body size only correlated with age, whereas appendage size was affected by age, temperature, rainfall, and sunshine. Annual growth rates were positively correlated with temperature. We concluded that body size variation was mainly caused by age structure and plasticity of the growth rate in P. przewalskii and did not follow Bergmann's rule; however, females followed Allen's rule. Future studies to investigate the effect of energy restriction are needed to further understand the relationship between growth rate and body size. We also suggest that further studies on thermal advantage and sexual selection may be helpful to understand appendage size variation in P. przewalskii. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Temperature-associated selection linked to putative chromosomal inversions in king scallop (Pecten maximus)
VL  - 289
IS  - 1984
SP  - 20221573
AB  - The genomic landscape of divergence-the distribution of differences among populations or species across the genome-is increasingly characterized to understand the role that microevolutionary forces such as natural selection and recombination play in causing and maintaining genetic divergence. This line of inquiry has also revealed chromosome structure variation to be an important factor shaping the landscape of adaptive genetic variation. Owing to a high prevalence of chromosome structure variation and the strong pressure for local adaptation necessitated by their sessile nature, bivalve molluscs are an ideal taxon for exploring the relationship between chromosome structure variation and local adaptation. Here, we report a population genomic survey of king scallop (Pecten maximus) across its natural range in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, using a recent chromosome-level genome assembly. We report the presence of at least three large (12-22 Mb), putative chromosomal inversions associated with sea surface temperature and whose frequencies are in contrast to neutral population structure. These results highlight a potentially large role for recombination-suppressing chromosomal inversions in local adaptation and suggest a hypothesis to explain the maintenance of differences in reproductive timing found at relatively small spatial scales across king scallop populations.

TI  - Passiflora mucronata leaves extracts obtained from different methodologies: A phytochemical study based on cytotoxic and apoptosis activities of triterpenes and phytosterols constituents
VL  - 56
AB  - Cancer is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide and the natural products could be a source of bioactive compounds. Passiflora mucronata (PM) belongs to a very known vegetal genus, although, there are no studies about cytotoxic activity or isolated compounds. Different extracts from PM were obtained by liquid-liquid partition (P), Soxhlet (Sox) and supercritical fluid (SFE1-5) extraction techniques, being compared concerning their yields, chemical profile and cytotoxicity. The Sox extracts showed the highest yields (6.03%: hexane; 2.51%: dichloromethane) followed by SFE (from 4.34 to 1.63%) and partitions (1.06 and 2.26%). The hexane partition (HP) showed the best cytotoxic activity against K562 cell line (IC50 = 18.72 µg.mL-1). From HP, the following compounds were identified and analysed its cytotoxic activities: β-amyrin (IC50 = 3.92 µg.mL-1), β-sitosterol (IC50 = 3.37 µg.mL-1), stigmasterol (IC50 = 3.31 µg.mL-1) and oleanolic acid. Stigmasterol induced about 75% of K562 total apoptosis. The compounds were tested against MA-104 cell line and the selective index (SI) attributed (SI &gt;10 for all compounds). This indicates good selectivity to K562 cell line at the expense of MA-104. This is the first time, identifying those compounds to PM. © 2020, Faculdade de Ciencias Farmaceuticas (Biblioteca).

VL  - 329

SP  - 527-535
AB  - Habitat selection models can explain spatial patterns in the relative abundance of animals in different habitats based on the assumption that fitness declines as density in a habitat increases. Ectotherms, such as lizards, may not follow predictions of density-dependent habitat selection models because temperature, which is unaffected by density, strongly influences their habitat selection. If competition for limited resources decreases fitness, then crowding should cause a decrease in body size and growth rates. We used skeletochronology and body size data from tree lizards (Urosaurus ornatus) at six sites that each spanned two habitats varying in quality to test the hypothesis that habitat selection is density dependent because growth is limited by competition for resources and by habitat quality. First, we tested that the maximum body size of lizards decreased with higher densities in a habitat by comparing growth between sites. Second, we tested whether body size and growth were higher in the habitat with more resources by controlling for density in a habitat and comparing growth between habitats in different sites. We found evidence of density-dependent growth in females, but not in males. Females in more crowded sites reached a smaller maximum size. Females in the higher quality habitat also grew larger than females in the lower quality habitat after controlling for differences in density between the habitats. Therefore, we found partial support for our hypothesis that competition for resources limits growth and causes density-dependent habitat selection. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

VL  - 30

SP  - 4062-4076
AB  - Understanding how geographic and environmental heterogeneity drive local patterns of genetic variation is a major goal of ecological genomics and a key question in evolutionary biology. The tropical Andes and inter-Andean valleys are shaped by markedly heterogeneous landscapes, where species experience strong selective processes. We examined genome-wide SNP data together with behavioural and ecological traits (mating calls and body size) known to contribute to genetic isolation in anurans in the banana tree-dwelling frog, Boana platanera, distributed across an environmental gradient in Central Colombia (northern South America). Here, we analysed the relationships between environmentally (temperature and precipitation) associated genetic and phenotypic differentiation and the potential drivers of isolation by environment along an elevation gradient. We identified candidate SNPs associated with temperature and body size, which follow a clinal pattern of genome-wide differentiation tightly coupled with phenotypic variation: as elevation increases, B. platanera exhibits larger body size and longer call duration with more pulses but lower pulse rate and frequency. Thus, the environmental landscape has rendered a scenario where isolation by environment and candidate loci show concordance with phenotypic divergence in this tropical frog along an elevation gradient in the Colombian Andes. Our study sets the basis for evaluating the role of temperature in the genetic structure and local adaptation in tropical treefrogs and its putative effect on life cycle (embryos, tadpoles, adults) along elevation gradients. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Room without a view—Den excavation in relation to body size in brown bears
VL  - 10
IS  - 15
SP  - 8044-8054
AB  - Hibernation is an adaptive strategy to survive harsh winter conditions and food shortage. The use of well-insulated winter dens helps animals minimize energy loss during hibernation. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) commonly use excavated dens for hibernation. Physical attributes of excavated dens are expected to impact the bear's heat retention and energy conservation. The objective of this study was to examine the determinants of cavity size of excavated dens and the impact of physical attributes of excavated dens on energy conservation in hibernating bears, hypothesizing that bears excavate dens in a way to minimize heat loss and optimize energy conservation during hibernation. We predicted that den cavity size would be determined by the bear's body size and that older bears would excavate better-fitting cavities to minimize heat loss, due to their previous experience. We further predicted that physical attributes of excavated dens would affect the bears’ posthibernation body condition. Our results revealed that bears excavated a den cavity in relation to their body size, regardless of sex, and that older bears tended to excavate better-fitting den cavities compared to young bears, as we expected. Older bears excavated better-fitting den cavities, suggesting a potentially experience-based shift with age in den-excavation behavior and an optimum cavity size relative to a bear's body size. Our key finding is that insulation of excavated dens provided by wall/rood thickness and bedding materials had a significant positive effect on bears’ posthibernation body condition. We believe that our study provides new insight into how not only the quality of denning habitat, but also the quality of dens may affect hibernating animals, by presenting a potential adaptive aspect of den preparation (age effect on efficiency in den excavation) and effect of den attributes on the posthibernation body condition of brown bears. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Contrasting phenology responses to climate warming across the northern extra-tropics
VL  - 2
IS  - 5
SP  - 708-715
AB  - Climate warming has substantially advanced the timing of spring leaf-out of woody species at middle and high latitudes, albeit with large differences. Insights in the spatial variation of this climate warming response may therefore help to constrain future trends in leaf-out and its impact on energy, water and carbon balances at global scales. In this study, we used in situ phenology observations of 38 species from 2067 study sites, distributed across the northern hemisphere in China, Europe and the United States, to investigate the latitudinal patterns of spring leaf-out and its sensitivity (ST, advance of leaf-out dates per degree of warming) and correlation (RT, partial correlation coefficient) to temperature during the period 1980–2016. Across all species and sites, we found that ST decreased significantly by 0.15 ± 0.02 d °C−1 °N−1, and RT increased by 0.02 ± 0.001 °N−1 (both at P &lt; 0.001). The latitudinal patterns in RT and ST were explained by the differences in requirements of chilling and thermal forcing that evolved to maximize tree fitness under local climate, particularly climate predictability and summed precipitation during the pre-leaf-out season. Our results thus showed complicated spatial differences in leaf-out responses to ongoing climate warming and indicated that spatial differences in the interactions among environmental cues need to be embedded into large-scale phenology models to improve the simulation accuracy. © 2022

TI  - Daily rhythms in endocrine factors of the somatotropic axis and their receptors in gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) larvae
VL  - 250
AB  - Living organisms have adapted to environmental oscillations in light and temperature through evolving biological clocks. Biological rhythms are pervasive at all levels of the endocrine system, including the somatotropic (growth) axis. The objective of the present research was to study the existence of daily rhythms on the somatotropic axis of a marine teleost species, specifically, the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). Larvae of S. aurata at 30 dph (days post hatching), kept under a 9 L:15D (light-dark) photoperiod, were collected every 3 h throughout a 36 h cycle. The expression of the following somatotropic axis genes was analyzed by quantitative PCR: pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 1 (adcyap1), prepro-somatostatin-1 (pss1), growth hormone (gh), growth hormone receptor types 1 and 2 (ghr1 and ghr2, respectively), insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf1) and igf1 receptor a (igf1ra). All genes displayed significant differences among time points and, with the exception of adcyap1, all showed statistically significant daily rhythms. The acrophases of gh, ghr1, ghr2, igf1 and igf1ra were located around the end of the dark phase, between ZT19:44 and ZT0:48 h, whereas the highest expression levels of adcyap1 occurred at ZT18 h. On the other hand, the acrophase of pss1, an inhibitor of Gh secretion, was located at ZT10:16 h, hence it was shifted by several hours with respect to the other genes. The present results provide the first thorough description of somatotropic axis rhythms in gilthead sea bream. Such knowledge provides insights into the role of rhythmic regulation of the Gh/Igf1 axis system in larval growth and metabolism, and it can also improve the implementation of more species-specific feeding regimes. © 2020

VL  - 91

SP  - 1104-1118
AB  - Range expansions can be shaped by sex differences in behaviours and other phenotypic traits affecting dispersal and reproduction. Here, we investigate sex differences in morphology, behaviour and genomic population differentiation along a climate-mediated range expansion in the common bluetail damselfly (Ischnura elegans) in northern Europe. We sampled 65 sites along a 583-km gradient spanning the I. elegans range in Sweden and quantified latitudinal gradients in site relative abundance, sex ratio and sex-specific shifts in body size and mating status (a measure of sexual selection). Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 426 individuals from 25 sites, we further investigated sex-specific landscape and climatic effects on neutral genetic connectivity and migration patterns. We found evidence for sex differences associated with the I. elegans range expansion, namely (a) increased male body size with latitude, but no latitudinal effect on female body size, resulting in reduced sexual dimorphism towards the range limit, (b) a steeper decline in male genetic similarity with increasing geographic distance than in females, (c) male-biased genetic migration propensity and (d) a latitudinal cline in migration distance (increasing migratory distances towards the range margin), which was stronger in males. Cooler mean annual temperatures towards the range limit were associated with increased resistance to gene flow in both sexes. Sex ratios became increasingly male biased towards the range limit, and there was evidence for a changed sexual selection regime shifting from favouring larger males in the south to favouring smaller males in the north. Our findings suggest sex-specific spatial phenotype sorting at the range limit, where larger males disperse more under higher landscape resistance associated with cooler climates. The combination of latitudinal gradients in sex-biased dispersal, increasing male body size and (reduced) sexual size dimorphism should have emergent consequences for sexual selection dynamics and the mating system at the expanding range front. Our study illustrates the importance of considering sex differences in the study of range expansions driven by ongoing climate change. © 2021 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Predicting the Spread of Vector-Borne Diseases in a Warming World
VL  - 10
AB  - Predicting how climate warming affects vector borne diseases is a key research priority. The prevailing approach uses the basic reproductive number (R0) to predict warming effects. However, R0 is derived under assumptions of stationary thermal environments; using it to predict disease spread in non-stationary environments could lead to erroneous predictions. Here, we develop a trait-based mathematical model that can predict disease spread and prevalence for any vector borne disease under any type of non-stationary environment. We parameterize the model with trait response data for the Malaria vector and pathogen to test the latest IPCC predictions on warmer-than-average winters and hotter-than-average summers. We report three key findings. First, the R0 formulation commonly used to investigate warming effects on disease spread violates the assumptions underlying its derivation as the dominant eigenvalue of a linearized host-vector model. As a result, it overestimates disease spread in cooler environments and underestimates it in warmer environments, proving its predictions to be unreliable even in a constant thermal environment. Second, hotter-than-average summers both narrow the thermal limits for disease prevalence, and reduce prevalence within those limits, to a much greater degree than warmer-than-average winters, highlighting the importance of hot extremes in driving disease burden. Third, while warming reduces infected vector populations through the compounding effects of adult mortality, and infected host populations through the interactive effects of mortality and transmission, uninfected vector populations prove surprisingly robust to warming. This suggests that ecological predictions of warming-induced reductions in disease burden should be tempered by the evolutionary possibility of vector adaptation to both cooler and warmer climates.

TI  - The contribution of neutral and environmentally dependent processes in driving population and lineage divergence in Taiwania (Taiwania cryptomerioides)
VL  - 9
AB  - The question of what determines divergence both between and within species has been the central topic in evolutionary biology. Neutral drift and environmentally dependent divergence are predicted to play roles in driving population and lineage divergence. However, neutral drift may preclude adaptation if the rate of gene flow between populations is high. Here, we sampled populations of three Taiwania (Taiwania cryptomerioides) lineages occurring in Taiwan, the mainland of China (Yunnan-Myanmar border), and northern Vietnam, and tested the relative strength of neutral drift and divergent selection in shaping divergence of those populations and lineages. We quantified genetic and epigenetic variation, respectively, using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and methylation-sensitive amplification polymorphism (MSAP). Analysis of 1413 AFLP and 462 MSAP loci using frequency-based genome scan methods and generalized linear models (GLMs) found no potential selective outliers when only Taiwanese populations were examined, suggesting that neutral drift was the predominant evolutionary process driving differentiation between those populations. However, environmentally associated divergence was found when lineages were compared. Thirty-two potential selective outliers were identified based on genome scans and their associations with environmental variables were tested with GLMs, generalized linear mixed effect models (GLMMs), and model selection with a model averaging approach. Ten loci (six AFLP and four MSAP) were found to be strongly associated with environmental variables, particularly monthly temperature variation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using model selection and a model averaging approach. Because only a small portion of genetic and epigenetic loci were found to be potential selective outliers, neutral evolutionary process might also have played crucial roles in driving lineage divergence, particularly between geographically and genetically isolated island and mainland Asia lineages. Nevertheless, the vast amount of neutral drift causing genetic and epigenetic variations might have the potential for adaptation to future climate changes. These could be important for the survival of Taiwania in different geographic areas. © 2018 Li, Chang, Wang, Thomas, Chung and Hwang.

TI  - Disentangling evolutionary, environmental and morphological drivers of plant anatomical adaptations to drought and cold in Himalayan graminoids
VL  - 128
IS  - 11
SP  - 1576-1587
AB  - Understanding what determine plants ability to survive drought and cold is crucial for predicting how plants may respond to ongoing climate change. Plant survival strategies are usually characterized by morphological and physiological adaptations, while their underlying anatomical settings are largely unknown. Woody angiosperms and herbaceous dicots have repeatedly evolved small water transporting conduits and large storage parenchyma tissues at colder or drier places to cope with freezing- and drought-induced damages. However, whether these adaptations are also valid for graminoids remains unclear. Here we show that stem anatomical variations in grasses, sedges and rushes dominating in western Himalayan grasslands are driven by elevation and soil moisture via control over aboveground plant stature and belowground clonal growth, while phylogenetic constraints have only a weak effect. Phylogenetic comparative analyses controlling for confounding factors showed that the elevation-related cooling controls the conductive system through reduced vessel diameter and extended assimilatory and storage tissues with more chlorenchyma and less sclerenchyma around vessels. The soil moisture deficit, on the other hand, determines stabilization structures by promoting short-rhizomatous turf graminoids with hollow stems, thicker epidermis and deep adventitious roots in dry steppes and semi-deserts. Saline wetlands and moist alpine pastures promote long-rhizomatous short-stature plants with lower need for mechanical support (absence of hollow stem) and exposure to high evaporative forcing (thinner epidermis). Observed trends of decreasing vessel sizes and lignification rate with elevation supports the existing knowledge that narrower vessels and extensive parenchyma assist plants to grow in cold environments by avoiding freezing-induced cavitation. Our results bring novel information on ecological drivers influencing the evolution of anatomical adaptations in high mountain graminoids. Distinct grassland types, covering elevations from 2650 to 6150 m, harbor unrelated species with different evolutionary histories that have converged towards similar anatomical structures. © 2019 The Authors

TI  - Intraspecific evolution of sexually dimorphic characters in a female diving beetle can be promoted by demographic history and temperature
VL  - 76
IS  - 5
SP  - 1003-1015
AB  - Previous studies have predicted that antagonistic intraspecific evolution of sexually dimorphic characters causing rapid speciation can be driven by demographic history and environmental variations. However, researchers have rarely examined this issue in the wild. Here, we examined intraspecific evolution of sexually dimorphic characters and its driving force by using a diving beetle, Acilius japonicus, which has very marked sexually dimorphic characters. Males with wider big suction cups could copulate with females with a higher success rate, whereas the mating durations of females with more hairs on their pronota were shorter. Females in a region with greater interpopulation genetic differentiation had more pronotal hairs. Considering that a previous study showed that less continuity among populations leads to a higher female cost of mating, this result suggests a greater female cost of mating in this region. Females at warmer sites also had more pronotal hairs. In light of the increase in O2 consumption in warmer water, our result suggests that more pronotal hairs in females at warmer sites have been maintained to prevent prolonged underwater mating at higher O2 demand. These findings suggest that demographic history and temperature can direct the evolution of sexually dimorphic characters related to sexual conflict in females. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Energy loss and mechanical efficiency forecasting model for aero-engine bevel gear power transmission
VL  - 231
AB  - Energy loss and mechanical efficiency directly affect the service performance and reliability of aero-engine bevel gear power transmission, but there is currently a lack of effective diagnosis in early design stage due to the complex tooth meshing interface state evolution under the thermal elastohydrodynamic lubrication (TEHL) condition. A new energy loss and mechanical efficiency prediction model is proposed by using the improved TEHL analysis considering the entrainment angle and non-Newtonian fluid effect. Firstly, numerical loaded tooth contact analysis (NLTCA) is developed to determine tooth meshing kinematic relating to the entrainment and sliding states. Then, the entrainment angle is taken into account the Non-Newtonian fluid TEHL model and separation flow method is applied for friction coefficient solution. Finally, new energy loss and mechanical efficiency model is established by simulating the complex tooth meshing interface TEHL. This model is enabling ever-higher levels of aero-engine bevel gear production efficiency and design sustainability. It can provide an important access to geometric and physical assessments that can improve the energy generation, conversion, transfer and utilization of the whole aero-engine power transmission system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The Need and Status of Sea Turtle Conservation and Survey of Associated Computer Vision Advances
AB  - For over hundreds of millions of years, sea turtles and their ancestors have swum in the vast expanses of the ocean. They have undergone a number of evolutionary changes, leading to speciation and sub-speciation. However, in the past few decades, some of the most notable forces driving the genetic variance and population decline have been global warming and anthropogenic impact ranging from large-scale poaching, collecting turtle eggs for food, besides dumping trash including plastic waste into the ocean. This leads to severe detrimental effects in the sea turtle population, driving them to extinction. This research focusses on the forces causing the decline in sea turtle population, the necessity for the global conservation efforts along with its successes and failures, followed by an in-depth analysis of the modern advances in detection and recognition of sea turtles, involving Machine Learning and Computer Vision systems, aiding the conservation efforts. © 2021 IEEE.

VL  - 11
IS  - 3
SP  - 1352-1367
AB  - Resilience to climate change depends on a species' adaptive potential and phenotypic plasticity. The latter can enhance survival of individual organisms during short periods of extreme environmental perturbations, allowing genetic adaptation to take place over generations. Along the U.S. East Coast, estuarine-dependent spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) populations span a steep temperature gradient that provides an ideal opportunity to explore the molecular basis of phenotypic plasticity. Genetically distinct spotted seatrout sampled from a northern and a southern population were exposed to acute cold and heat stress (5 biological replicates in each treatment and control group), and their transcriptomic responses were compared using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). The southern population showed a larger transcriptomic response to acute cold stress, whereas the northern population showed a larger transcriptomic response to acute heat stress compared with their respective population controls. Shared transcripts showing significant differences in expression levels were predominantly enriched in pathways that included metabolism, transcriptional regulation, and immune response. In response to heat stress, only the northern population significantly upregulated genes in the apoptosis pathway, which could suggest greater vulnerability to future heat waves in this population as compared to the southern population. Genes showing population-specific patterns of expression, including hpt, acot, hspa5, and hsc71, are candidates for future studies aiming to monitor intraspecific differences in temperature stress responses in spotted seatrout. Our findings contribute to the current understanding of phenotypic plasticity and provide a basis for predicting the response of a eurythermal fish species to future extreme temperatures. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - The impact of temperature on insecticide toxicity against the malaria vectors Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: It is anticipated that malaria elimination efforts in Africa will be hampered by increasing resistance to the limited arsenal of insecticides approved for use in public health. However, insecticide susceptibility status of vector populations evaluated under standard insectary test conditions can give a false picture of the threat, as the thermal environment in which the insect and insecticide interact plays a significant role in insecticide toxicity. Methods: The effect of temperature on the expression of the standard WHO insecticide resistance phenotype was examined using Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus strains: A susceptible strain and the derived resistant strain, selected in the laboratory for resistance to DDT or pyrethroids. The susceptibility of mosquitoes to the pyrethroid deltamethrin or the carbamate bendiocarb was assessed at 18, 25 or 30 °C. The ability of the pyrethroid synergist piperonyl-butoxide (PBO) to restore pyrethroid susceptibility was also assessed at these temperatures. Results: Temperature impacted the toxicity of deltamethrin and bendiocarb. Although the resistant An. funestus strain was uniformly resistant to deltamethrin across temperatures, increasing temperature increased the resistance of the susceptible An. arabiensis strain. Against susceptible An. funestus and resistant An. arabiensis females, deltamethrin exposure at temperatures both lower and higher than standard insectary conditions increased mortality. PBO exposure completely restored deltamethrin susceptibility at all temperatures. Bendiocarb displayed a consistently positive temperature coefficient against both susceptible and resistant An. funestus strains, with survival increasing as temperature increased. Conclusions: Environmental temperature has a marked effect on the efficacy of insecticides used in public health against important African malaria vectors. Caution must be exercised when drawing conclusions about a chemical's efficacy from laboratory assays performed at only one temperature, as phenotypic resistance can vary significantly even over a temperature range that could be experienced by mosquitoes in the field during a single day. Similarly, it might be inappropriate to assume equal efficacy of a control tool over a geographic area where local conditions vary drastically. Additional studies into the effects of temperature on the efficacy of insecticide-based interventions under field conditions are warranted. © 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - Assessment of safety culture in three selected thermal power plants situated in Sylhet, Bangladesh
SP  - 2780-2791
AB  - Hazards, accidents and ill management in thermal power plants have a big impact on business, whether it's due to reduced productivity, lost sales, lower staff morale, or even closure. To prevent and/or mitigate workplace injuries, hazards, accidents and to improve productivity, it is needed to establish safety culture practice in the entire management system. Use of safety signs is one of the ways for controlling hazards in the work environment. Safety signs are widely used to effectively control workplace hazards. In this research, different safety culture factors were taken from OHSAS 18001:2007 standard. The objective of this study was to assess the safety culture factors in three selected thermal power plants namely Sylhet 150 MW Combined Cycle Power Plant, Fenchuganj 90 MW Combined Cycle Power Plant and Bibiyana South 400 MW Combined Cycle Power Plant. This research work describes the key factors of organizational health and safety management system. The research also measures the existing safety practice performance of the three selected thermal power plants. The collected data were analyzed to explore research findings. Lastly recommendations were made to take corrective actions to improve existing safety culture practice in the three selected thermal power plants situated in Sylhet, Bangladesh. © IEOM Society International.

TI  - Why are ‘suboptimal’ temperatures preferred in a tropical intertidal ectotherm?
VL  - 91
IS  - 7
SP  - 1400-1415
AB  - In thermally extreme environments, it is challenging for organisms to maximize performance due to risks associated with stochastic variation in temperature and, subsequently, over evolutionary time minimizing the exposure to risk can serve as one of the mechanisms that result in organisms preferring suboptimal temperatures. We tested this hypothesis in a slow-moving intertidal snail on tropical rocky shores, where temperature variability increases with time from 30 min to 20 hr when recorded at 30 min intervals (due to short-term environmental autocorrelation where temperatures closer in time are more similar as compared to temperatures over a long period of time). Failure to accommodate temporal variation in thermal stress by selecting cool habitats can result in mortality. Thermal performance curves for different traits (heart rate and locomotion) were measured and compared to the snail's thermal preferences in both the field and laboratory. Predicted performances of the snails were simulated based on thermal performance curves for different traits over multiple time-scales and simulated carryover effects. A strong mismatch was found between physiological and behavioural thermal maxima of the snails (physiological thermal maximum being higher by ~7°C), but the snails avoided these maxima and sought temperatures 7–14°C cooler. Such a risk-averse strategy can be explained by their predicted performances where the snails should make decisions about preferred temperatures based on time periods ≥5 hr to avoid underestimating the temporal variation in body temperature. In extreme and stochastic environments, where the temporal variation in environmental conditions can lead to substantial divergence between instantaneous and time-averaged thermal performances, ‘cooler is better’ and ‘suboptimal’ body temperatures are preferred as they provide sufficient buffer to reduce mortality risk from heat stress. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Middle Miocene Temperature and Productivity Evolution at a Northeast Atlantic Shelf Site (IODP U1318, Porcupine Basin): Global and Regional Changes
VL  - 36
IS  - 7
AB  - We present a high-resolution multiproxy middle Miocene sea surface temperature (SST) and productivity (SSP) reconstruction of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1318, from the upper slope edge (∼400 m water depth) of the Porcupine Basin continental margin, eastern North Atlantic Ocean. Biomarker and dinoflagellate cyst proxies reveal warm and mostly stratified waters during the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO) that cooled ∼3°C across the Miocene Climate Transition (MCT). The organic biomarker (TEX86 and (Formula presented.)) paleothermometers document a series of 11 transient cooling events (CEs), superimposed on the long-term climate evolution. These CEs are associated with increases in cold-water dinocysts and correlate to global benthic δ18O shifts, including the Mi-2, Mi-3, and Mi-4 events. Most CEs are also associated with increases in primary productivity. A prolonged interval of high SSP between ∼13.8 and 13.6 Ma supports the idea that carbon production (and burial) in shallow areas represents a feedback mechanism contributing to long-term atmospheric CO2 decline and cooling during the MCT. SST comparison in three North Atlantic sites (Azores Site 608, Porcupine Basin Site U1318, and Rockall Plateau Site 982) reveals that MCO SSTs are much warmer at Site 608 than at the other two sites. The low-resolution SST record of Site 982 shows no decrease in temperature around the MCT. This may be linked to contemporaneous tectonic changes in the Tethys, Central American, and Arctic Seaways impacting local ocean circulation, superimposed on global drivers of climate change. © 2021.

TI  - Niche partitioning within a population of sea snakes is constrained by ambient thermal homogeneity and small prey size
VL  - 129
IS  - 3
SP  - 644-651
AB  - In many populations of terrestrial snakes, the phenotype of an individual (e.g. body size, sex, colour) affects its habitat use. One cause for that link is gape limitation, which can result in larger snakes eating prey that are found in different habitats. A second factor involves thermoregulatory opportunities, whereby individuals select habitats based upon thermal conditions. These ideas predict minimal intraspecific variation in habitat use in a species that eats small prey and lives in a thermally uniform habitat, such as the sea snake Emydocephalus annulatus, which feeds on tiny fish eggs and lives in inshore coral reefs. To test that prediction, we gathered data on water depths and substrate attributes for 1475 sightings of 128 free-ranging E. annulatus in a bay near Noumea, New Caledonia. Habitat selection varied among individuals, but with a preference for coral-dominated substrates. The body size and reproductive state of a snake affected its detectability in deep water, but overall habitat use was not linked to snake body size, colour morph, sex or pregnancy. A lack of ontogenetic shifts in habitat use allows extreme philopatry in E. annulatus, thereby reducing gene flow among populations and, potentially, delaying recolonization after local extirpation events. © 2020 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

TI  - The correlation between individual, occupational, and work environment factors to reproductive health of female workers in the beverage and plastic industries in Sidoarjo, Indonesia
VL  - 15
SP  - 30-33
AB  - PT.X and PT.Y are two companies that is located at Taman district, Sidoarjo Regency in East Java and engaged in the beverage manufacturing and plastic manufacturing industries respectively. As many as 109 respondents were selected using simple random sampling method. Data collection techniques was done by using questionnaires to find out individual factors, work, and psychological factors (work stress) and direct measurement of the work environment (measurement of temperature and noise). Work stress was measured using Job Stress Survey (JSS) by Vagg and Spielberger. Temperature measured using Thermal Environment Monitor, while noise was measured using Sound Level Meter device. Correlation analysis in this study was using contingency coefficient method. The results shows that a total of 63.3% (69 respondents out of total 109) of female workers experienced reproductive health problems. The result of the correlation test showed that the independent variable of parity numbers, work stress, work environment temperature, and work shift has significant effect on reproductive health (p-value &lt; 0.05). This can be seen from the probability value (p-value) of the correlation test. The p-value for parity number variable is 0.000, work stress is 0.000, temperature is 0.044 and work shift is 0.006. The contingency coefficient test sindicate that parity number, workshift, work station temperature, and work stress are asignificant contributor on reproductive health disorders, in this case menstrual disorders and pregnancy disorders in female workers. Therefore it is important for the company to address the issues of work shift arrangement,heat exposure and stress management in the work environment. © 2019 UPM Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of corrosion on mechanical and biological properties of nano-silver joints
AB  - In order to explore the mechanical and biological properties of nano-silver joints in corrosive environment, two series of experiments were carried out from the mechanical and biological perspectives. For mechanical perspectives a) Two sandwich-like gold-plated copper (3×5×10 mm)-nano-silver-gold-plated copper (3×5×10 mm) samples were corroded for 24h in 3% NaCl solution at 45.5 (heating table temperature 50). The microstructural evolution of corrosion products of nano-silver sintered joints were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). b) Twenty shear specimens were divided into two groups, corroded for 0h and 24h respectively. Besides, the corrosion shear strength of sintered nano-silver joints was measured. In order to explore the effects of nano-silver on organisms after it enters the body due to corrosion, the survival rate and apoptotic morphology of hamster lung cells were measured after incubation in nutrient solution containing 150, 175 and 200 μmol/l nano-silver for 24h. Through the above tests, it is found that the shear strength of joint decreases obviously after corrosion, and the fracture mode changes from interlayer failure to interfacial fracture. Biological experiments showed that the survival rate of hamster lung cells decreased with the increase of nano-silver concentration. © 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Nutritional, Functional, and Technological Characterization of a Novel Gluten- and Lactose-Free Yogurt-Style Snack Produced With Selected Lactic Acid Bacteria and Leguminosae Flours
VL  - 11
AB  - Aiming at meeting consumers’ requirements for healthy foods, dietary needs (vegetarianism, lactose- and gluten-free), as well as the nutrition recommendations of the Health Authorities in terms of protein, fibers and bioactive compounds, the present study proposes a novel yogurt-style snack made with plant-derived ingredients. The biotechnological protocol includes the fermentation of a thermal-treated blend of cereal and legume flours by the selected lactic acid bacteria (LAB) Lactoplantibacillus plantarum DSM33326 and Levilactobacillus brevis DSM33325. The yogurt-style snack was characterized by protein and fiber concentration of 3 and 4%, respectively, and a low-fat content. Compared to the unfermented control, the yogurt-style snack was characterized by a significant higher concentration of free amino acids and lower contents of the antinutritional factors, i.e., phytic acid, condensed tannins, saponins and raffinose (up to 90%) mainly due to the LAB metabolic activity. Hence, an in-vitro protein digestibility of 79% and improvements of all the nutritional indexes related to the quality of the protein fraction (e.g., GABA) were achieved at the end of fermentation. According to the Harvard Medical School recommendations, the novel snack can be potentially classified as low-glycemic index food (53%). Antioxidant properties of the fermented snack were also improved by means of increased the total phenol content and radical scavenging activity. High survival rate of the starter LAB and a commercial probiotic (added to the snack) was found through 30 days storage under refrigerated conditions. The biotechnological protocol to make the novel snack here proposed is suitable for the large-scale application in food industry, giving a platform product with a peculiar and appreciated sensory profile. © Copyright © 2020 Pontonio, Raho, Dingeo, Centrone, Carofiglio and Rizzello.

TI  - Thermal regime drives a latitudinal gradient in morphology and life history in a livebearing fish
VL  - 125

SP  - 126-141
AB  - Within-species diversity is often driven by changing selective regimes along environmental gradients. Here, we provide a direct test of the environmental factors underlying phenotypic diversity across the wide native distribution of eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). We investigated life-history and body-shape divergence (including multiple measures of body size) across more than 14 degrees of latitude in North America, and used Akaike's information criterion-based model selection to determine the relative contributions of thermal regime, population densities and habitat productivity as potential drivers of latitudinal phenotypic variation. We found thermal regime to be the most important driver of large-scale latitudinal phenotypic patterns: populations in colder climates with greater seasonality and range in temperature exhibited larger body size, larger reproductive investment coupled with smaller offspring size, and shallower bodies with a smaller head and more anterodorsally positioned pectoral fins. Nonetheless, population density and habitat productivity also influenced trait divergence, but independent of latitudinal patterns, and some variation in body shape was due to apparent covariation with life histories. Our study confirms thermal regime as an important driver of latitudinal phenotypic differentiation even in ectotherms, but also uncovers multiple additional factors that shape phenotypic diversity, emphasizing the importance of the multivariate approach we employed here. © 2018 The Linnean Society of London.

TI  - Immigration and extirpation selectivity patterns of brachiopods and bivalves across a Carboniferous glacial to non-glacial transition (Pennsylvanian, central western Argentina) and their influence in building the biotic bathymetric gradient
VL  - 516
SP  - 11-21
AB  - The growth and demise of glaciers during the Late Paleozoic ice age had profound consequences on the marine biota. In central western Argentina the transition from glacial to non-glacial interval during the Pennsylvanian, caused a major regional turnover which remodeled the bathymetric diversity gradient. In order to understand the nature of the environmental changes related to such turnover event, we compared selectivity patterns in extirpation and immigration of bivalves and brachiopods using logistic regression. We tested for a wide range of potential drivers of extirpation and immigration, namely body size, geographic range size, environmental breadth, preferred depth, metabolic rates, infaunalism and taxonomic identity. While extirpation preferentially hit brachiopods and genera having smaller geographic ranges and smaller body sizes, immigration was related to genera with preference for deeper environment and small geographic ranges. Extirpation selectivity was not uniform along the bathymetric gradient. Both geographic range and body size selectivity are stronger towards deeper environments. Each clade, on the other hand, showed idiosyncratic responses to climate change. While brachiopods show extirpation selectivity for smaller geographic ranges, small sized bivalves were preferentially extirpated. These contrasting selectivity regimes, however, could be reflecting different faunal responses to the same environmental changing factor, namely higher thermal amplitude. Immigration in both brachiopods and bivalves was related to preference to deep environments, confirming previous results. However, brachiopods also showed preferential immigration of small geographic range genera, which is puzzling given the extinction selectivity related to the glacial non-glacial transition. Possible explanations point to a brief time span in which an increase in thermal amplitude occurred. The rapid climate changes, particularly related to a rise in maximum temperatures, lead the ecological response of the benthic faunas. Differences in extinction and immigration selectivity along the bathymetric gradient, suggest that the turnover event also remodeled the bathymetric gradient in body size and biogeographic structure and brachiopod:bivalve proportions. Such changes were driven by extirpation, contrasting with the remodeling of the bathymetric diversity gradient that was driven by immigration. Our results, therefore, highlight that immigration and extirpation can shape different aspects of the bathymetric biotic gradient. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 504
IS  - 2
SP  - 2034-2050
AB  - The evolution of the atmospheres of low- and intermediate-mass planets is strongly connected to the physical properties of their host stars. The types and the past activities of planet-hosting stars can, therefore, affect the overall planetary population. In this paper, we perform a comparative study of sub-Neptune-like planets orbiting stars of different masses and different evolutionary histories. We discuss the general patterns of the evolved population as a function of parameters and environments of planets. As a model of the atmospheric evolution, we employ the own framework combining planetary evolution in Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (mesa) with the realistic prescription of the escape of hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. We find that the final populations look qualitatively similar in terms of the atmospheres survival around different stars, but qualitatively different, with this difference accentuated for planets orbiting more massive stars. We show that a planet has larger chances of keeping its primordial atmosphere in the habitable zone of a solar-mass star compared to M or K dwarfs and if it starts the evolution having a relatively compact envelope. We also address the problem of the uncertain initial temperatures (luminosities) of planets and show that this issue is only of particular importance for planets exposed to extreme atmospheric mass losses. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.

TI  - Survival of climate warming through niche shifts: Evidence from frogs on tropical islands
VL  - 28

AB  - How will organisms cope when forced into warmer-than-preferred thermal environments? This is a key question facing our ability to monitor and manage biota as average annual temperatures increase, and is of particular concern for range-limited terrestrial species unable to track their preferred climatic envelope. Being ectothermic, desiccation prone, and often spatially restricted, island-inhabiting tropical amphibians exemplify this scenario. Pre-Anthropocene case studies of how insular amphibian populations responded to the enforced occupation of warmer-than-ancestral habitats may add a valuable, but currently lacking, perspective. We studied a population of frogs from the Seychelles endemic family Sooglossidae which, due to historic sea-level rise, have been forced to occupy a significantly warmer island (Praslin) than their ancestors and close living relatives. Evidence from thermal activity patterns, bioacoustics, body size distributions, and ancestral state estimations suggest that this population shifted its thermal niche in response to restricted opportunities for elevational dispersal. Relative to conspecifics, Praslin sooglossids also have divergent nuclear genotypes and call characters, a finding consistent with adaptation causing speciation in a novel thermal environment. Using an evolutionary perspective, our study reveals that some tropical amphibians have survived episodes of historic warming without the aid of dispersal and therefore may have the capacity to adapt to the currently warming climate. However, two otherwise co-distributed sooglossid species are absent from Praslin, and the deep evolutionary divergence between the frogs on Praslin and their closest extant relatives (~8 million years) may have allowed for gradual thermal adaptation and speciation. Thus, local extinction is still a likely outcome for tropical frogs experiencing warming climates in the absence of dispersal corridors to thermal refugia. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

VL  - 107
SP  - 395-422
AB  - Mineral systems with their core of ore deposits require a rare conjunction of geodynamic settings, crustal or lithospheric fertility, crustal architecture and suitable host rocks, and preservation potential. They are thus an integral component of Earth's thermal and tectonic evolution which also control the supercontinent cycles with progressive assembly and breakup of Ur, Kenorland, Columbia, Rodinia, Gondwana, and Pangea. Despite the ongoing debate, some form of plate tectonics has operated on Earth since the Eoarchean. However, the hotter Archean mantle generated a long-term double-layered convection system which was disrupted by episodic mantle overturns, with the largest in the early Neoarchean potentially enriching the mantle in metals that form the Earth's core. Cratons with thick subcontinental mantle lithosphere (SCLM) or tectosphere keels commenced to form in the Mesoarchean as small continents amalgamated. The conjunction of pre-4.0 Ga crust, giant Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni and PGE-enriched layered mafic intrusions and major diamond fields provide strong evidence that the Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe Cratons and Wyoming Craton formed part of Ur with its early potentially core-metal-fertilized SCLM. Orogenic gold deposits and VMS Cu-Zn-Pb deposits with their high preservation potential were deposited in subduction-related convergent margins that activated the assembly of all supercontinents with giant provinces related to assembly of Kenorland, Columbia and Gondwana-Pangea. Erosion-susceptible porphyry Cu-Au and epithermal Au-Ag deposits were most abundant at the time of Gondwana and Pangea and in Cenozoic convergent margins and collisional orogens, although there are rare examples associated with assembly of all supercontinents. Magmatic intrusion-related Ni-Cu-PGE, and magmatic-hydrothermal IOCG Cu-Au and Kiruna-type Fe-P deposits formed near craton margins. However, although giant Ni-Cu-PGE deposits formed during the breakup of all supercontinents, giant IOCG deposits were largely restricted to extensional episodes related to Kenorland and Columbia and Kiruna-type deposits to those involved in Columbia. The evolution of the Earth's atmosphere-hydro sphere-biosphere was an additional influence on that of the supercontinent cycle in terms of the evolution of metallogenic provinces. The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) at ca. 2.4-2.0 Ga witnessed the end of the great era of deposition of BIFs that became the hosts to high-grade Fe and Mn deposits which formed under more oxidizing conditions, with Oligocene sediment-hosted Mn deposits and late-Cenozoic Mn nodules becoming the dominant Mn resources and potential resource, respectively. The GOE was also responsible for the evolution of U deposits from the Mesoarchean paleoplacer uraninite deposits of the Witwatersrand, through Mesoproterozoic unconformity-related deposits to Phanerozoic sandstone roll deposits. The Cambrian 'explosion of life', following a second GOE event, magnified the importance of organisms, particularly those secreting Ca and Mg, carbonate in the formation or ore deposits in sedimentary basins. Late Paleoproterozoic-Mesoproterozoic shale-hosted SEDEX Zn-Pb-Cu deposits were progressively replaced by Phanerozoic carbonate-hosted MVT Pb-Zn deposits and Neoproterozoic-Cambrian Zambian-type Cu-Co deposits hosted in calcareous sedimentary sequences. Carlin-type Au-Ag deposits hosted by calcareous and carbonaceous sequences appeared in the Cretaceous to Paleogene epochs to rival the more ubiquitous orogenic gold deposits in terms of global importance. It is evident that the evolution of the great metallogenic belts of the Earth was intrinsically linked to the thermal and tectonic evolution of the Earth and particularly to plate tectonics and the supercontinent cycles. The nature of contained mineral deposits of elements with multiple valency states and those requiring particularly reactive host rocks was strongly influenced by the evolution of the atmosphere-hydrosphere-biosphere system.

VL  - 35
IS  - 10
SP  - 2219-2228
AB  - Offspring size is a key life-history trait that often covaries negatively with temperature. Most studies focus on how temperature alters selection on offspring size during early life-history stages such as embryos or larvae. The degree to which temperature alters the relationship between offspring size and post-metamorphic performance remains unclear as field studies across multiple temperature regimes are rare. I deployed over 6,000 individuals of known offspring size, into the field across 28 cohorts spanning 4 years for the model marine invertebrate, Bugula neritina and monitored their survival, growth and reproduction. Offspring size closely tracked the local environmental temperature across cohorts. This offspring size–temperature covariance appeared to be adaptive, at least from the perspective of mothers. When temperatures were warmer, the relationship between offspring size and performance was weak; when temperatures were cooler, the relationship was strongly positive. The estimates of selection based on maternal fitness differed from those based on offspring fitness, suggesting temperature-mediated parent–offspring conflict over offspring provisioning exists. I also found evidence for temporal autocorrelation in temperature and selection on offspring size. The fact that temperature affects the relationship between offspring size and post-metamorphic performance further complicates the challenge in understanding the ubiquitous covariance between offspring size and temperature.

TI  - Thermoregulation of Eremias argus alters temperature-dependent toxicity of beta-cyfluthrin: Ecotoxicological effects considering ectotherm behavior traits
VL  - 293
AB  - Risk assessments of the ecotoxicological effects insecticides impose on ectotherms have increasingly considered temperature. However, the changes toxicants induce in thermoregulatory behavioral traits may lead to a divergence of thermal selection and temperature-dependent changes of contaminant toxicity. This study demonstrated the interaction of behavioral thermoregulation and temperature-dependent toxicity of beta-cyfluthrin (BC) in the lizard Eremias argus. Based on the negative relationship between temperature and BC toxicity, seeking a warming environment was assumed to represent a self-rescue behavior (and vice versa). The results showed that BC-treated lizards (0–20 μg/g body weight (bw)) showed such self-rescue behavior, while lizards exposed to an extremely high BC dose (200 μg/g bw) sought a cooler environment. Biochemical assays showed that BC affected neurotransmitter systems, caused oxidative stress, and interfered with ion-transport in the central nervous system. Biomarkers of the cholinergic and glutamatergic system, ion-transport function, and oxidative stress were identified as potential biochemical variables related to thermoregulatory behavior. Apparently, seeking a warmer environment is a survival strategy with the aim to neutralize BC toxicity, while seeking a cooler environment aims to attenuate the harmful effects of metabolic and oxidative stress, and to decelerate internal BC diffusion. This phenomenon could be also explained by the concept of the “cooling trap”, i.e., a behavior where cooler temperatures are sought. This impairs survival after exposure to BC at it has a negative temperature coefficient, derived from a dysfunction of the central nervous system regarding thermoregulation caused by the high dosage of neurotoxicant and resulting temperature maladaptation. Implications of the interaction between thermoregulatory behavior and temperature-dependent toxicity are presented, which may aid further temperature-dependent risk assessments. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 239
SP  - 41-53
AB  - This paper aims at the integration of Al2 O3, CuO, and TiO2 nanofluids for two configurations of solar desalination (SS distillation: SS with and without nanoparticle, named SSWN, SS respectively; and SS hybrid with and without nanoparticle, named SSHWN and SSH, respectively). In order to improve the productivity of a SS, a nanoparticle Al2 O3 is integrated with different concentrations (1%, 3% and 5%). The results show very well that the addition of nanofluid regardless of the configurations of SS increases the cumulative productivity whatever the SSHWN or SSWN configuration is important compared to that of SS and SSH (SSHWN admits a Pcu equal to 10.8 kg/m2 h and of the order of 1.6 kg/m2 h for SSWN) while Pcu does not exceed 6.8 kg/m2 h with SSH and 0.45 kg/ m2 h with SS configuration. We also notice that Pcu increases with the increase in the concentration of nanoparticles (5% the Pcu is 10.8 kg/m2 h for SSHWN and does not exceed 6 kg/m2 h SSH) the theoretical study well predicts the experimental results as regards the evolution of Pcu. The experimental study with different nanoparticles such as TiO2 and CuO with a concentration of 5% shows Pcu (Al2 O3) &gt; Pcu (TiO2) &gt; Pcu (CuO). The thermal conductivity for hybrid solar still for different volume fractions of nanofluid has been proved. Al2 O3 admits the highest thermal conductivity (knf /kbf) the highest equal to 1.249 than that of CuO with 1.245 and finally TiO2 1.205. A comparative study was carried out with that the correlations of Maxwell and Bruggeman gives a very good linear regression than that of our work (R2 = 0.99). © 2021 Desalination Publications.

TI  - The glucocorticoid response to environmental change is not specific to agents of natural selection in wild red squirrels
VL  - 146
AB  - Evolutionary endocrinology aims to understand how natural selection shapes endocrine systems and the degree to which endocrine systems themselves can induce phenotypic responses to environmental changes. Such responses may be specialized in that they reflect past selection for responsiveness only to those ecological factors that ultimately influence natural selection. Alternatively, endocrine responses may be broad and generalized, allowing organisms to cope with a variety of environmental changes simultaneously. Here, we empirically tested whether the endocrine response of female North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) was specialized or generalized. We first quantified the direction and magnitude of natural selection acting on three female life history traits (parturition date, litter size, offspring postnatal growth rate) during 32 years of fluctuations in four potential ecological agents of selection (food availability, conspecific density, predator abundance, and temperature). Only three of the four variables (food, density, and predators) affected patterns of natural selection on female life history traits. We then quantified fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) across 7 years and found that all four environmental variables, regardless of their effects on patterns of selection, were associated with glucocorticoid production. Our results provide support for a generalized, rather than specific, glucocorticoid response to environmental change that can integrate across multiple co-occurring environmental stressors. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Microstructure evaluation of polymer-modified bitumen by image analysis using two-dimensional fast Fourier transform
VL  - 137
SP  - 164-175
AB  - Aiming to quantitatively evaluate the microstructure of polymer-modified bitumen (PMB) for roads, this paper employs the two-dimensional fast Fourier transform(2D-FFT) to process the microscopic and numerical images of four PMBs. The related derivative parameters, including the characteristic frequency and wavelength, are computed from the 2D-FFT power spectrum. The results show that the absence/presence of a characteristic frequency (range) on the power spectrum can indicate the lack/existence of the corresponding periodical structural pattern(s) in the original PMB image. A lower characteristic frequency usually represents a coarser PMB microstructure while a higher one implies a finer PMB microstructure. The 2D-FFT method is thus valid for differentiating various PMB microstructures. The proposed method is also capable of quantitatively evaluating the effects of temperature and the temporal evolution of PMB microstructure during phase separation. As the separation continues, the decrease of characteristic frequency indicates the coarsening process of a PMB microstructure. Additionally, the numerical reproduction of the observed phase separation is evaluated with the same method. The quantitative comparison with the experimental results reveals that the simulations fairly reproduced the microscopy observation results despite some deviation. The proposed method provides a foundation for the microstructure-based modelling of PMB performance in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 53

SP  - 3981-4000
AB  - Current silicon melt-infiltrated (SMI) ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) are limited by the melting temperature of silicon (1414 °C) and the volatility of the thermally grown SiO2 scale in high-temperature water vapor environments. Replacement of the melt-infiltrated (MI) silicon with a rare-earth silicide offers the potential to address both limitations of SMI CMCs. This study focuses on the ability of yttrium silicides to form yttrium silicates (phases with greater stability in high-temperature water vapor than SiO2) in high-temperature oxidizing environments. Yttrium silicides with compositions of 41, 67 and 95 at.% Si–Y were fabricated using arc melting and oxidized in air at 1000 and 1200 °C for up to 24 h. Oxidation resulted in the rapid formation of a non-protective Y2O3 scale and rejected Si. Additional minor oxide phases of Y–Si–O, Y2SiO5, Y2Si2O7 and SiO2 were observed to form on and beneath the specimen surface. Characterization of the microstructural evolution with time and temperature helped elucidate the diffusion mechanisms that control oxide growth rates. Replacement of MI silicon with a MI yttrium silicide would significantly compromise the high-temperature performance of a CMC due to Y2O3 CTE mismatch with SiC, high oxygen permeability and the large volume change associated with its rapid subsurface formation. Results are utilized to examine the viability of other rare-earth silicides as MI materials for CMCs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Physical aspects for involvement of thermonuclear reactors into nuclear power systems
VL  - 1689
AB  - The paper analyzes a possibility to involve hybrid thermonuclear reactors into the existing nuclear power systems. The possibility is related with production of non-traditional nuclear fuel in thorium blanket of hybrid thermonuclear reactors on D-T plasma. Non-traditional peculiarity of such a fuel consists in significant amounts of some non-traditional isotopes, namely231Pa and232U, together with traditional uranium isotope233U in the fuel. High-energy (14.1 MeV) thermonuclear neutrons can provide accumulation of significant231Pa and232U quantities through threshold (n,2n) and (n,3n) reactions. The promising features of the non-traditional fuel composition for nuclear power thermal reactors, basic component of the existing world-wide nuclear power industry, are defined by the following factors. As is known, 233U is able to provide more economical neutron balance in thermal reactors than235U and reactor-grade plutonium. The better neutron balance can result in higher values of the fuel breeding ratio and, as a consequence, in relaxation of the thermal reactors fuel self-sustainability problem. Isotopes231Pa and232U, being fertile and moderate fissionable nuclides, are able to stabilize time-dependent evolution of the thermal reactors power, prolong the thermal reactors lifetime through higher values of the fuel burn-up. Isotope232U, being intense a-emitter, is able to prevent any attempts for unauthorized usage of233U in nuclear explosive devices, i.e.232U can strengthen regime of nuclear non-proliferation. Thus, the hybrid thermonuclear reactors on D-T plasma with thorium blanket can be involved into nuclear power systems for generation of non-traditional, very promising fuel compositions for traditional nuclear power reactors. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Upper thermal tolerance of tropical and temperate termite species (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae, Termitidae): a test of the climate variability hypothesis in termites
VL  - 67
IS  - 1
SP  - 51-57
AB  - Extrema in temperature tolerances are a selective factor contributing to variation between populations and species. The climate variability hypothesis (CVH) posits that organisms exposed to a wider range of temperatures are expected to have a wider thermal range. This pattern is common across many taxa. In this study, we investigate how social insects vary in thermal tolerance. We test if social role in termites influences tolerance to temperature maxima, and given ties between social roles and body size, whether it is a primary correlate. Our methods examined upper lethal limit (ULL) and dry weights of five termite species representing two families across four sites in Texas and Costa Rica. With the addition of previously recorded upper heat tolerances in the literature, we conclude that termites follow the CVH and upper heat tolerance is positively correlated with absolute latitude. Our results show a differentiation in heat tolerance by task (collected from foraging site versus from nest) for Nasutitermes corniger soldiers but not workers. In the remaining species, there was no ULL partitioning by caste (soldier versus worker). Body size significantly correlated with ULL with the exception of Cornitermes walkeri, an outlier in both body size and ULL. A better understanding of how termites cope with temperature is important for this essential wood decomposer in a changing climate. © 2019, International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI).

VL  - 75
IS  - 10
SP  - 2348-2370
AB  - The diversity of habitats generated by the Andes uplift resulted a mosaic of heterogeneous environments in South America for species to evolve a variety of ecological and physiological specializations. Species in the lizard family Liolaemidae occupy a myriad of habitats in the Andes. Here, we analyze the tempo and mode of evolution in the thermal biology of liolaemids. We assessed whether there is evidence of local adaptation (lability) or conservatism (stasis) in thermal traits. We tested the hypothesis that abiotic factors (e.g., geography, climate) rather than intrinsic factors (egg-laying [oviparous] or live-bearing [viviparous], substrate affinity) explain variation in field active body temperature (Tb), preferred temperature (Tp), hours of restriction of activity, and potential hours of activity. Although most traits exhibited high phylogenetic signal, we found variation in thermal biology was shaped by geography, climate, and ecological diversity. Ancestral character reconstruction showed shifts in Tb tracked environmental change in the past ∼20,000 years. Thermal preference is 3°C higher than Tb, yet exhibited a lower rate of evolution than Tb and air temperature. Viviparous Liolaemus have lower Tbs than oviparous species, whereas Tp is high for both modes of reproduction, a key difference that results in a thermal buffer for viviparous species to cope with global warming. The rapid increase in environmental temperatures expected in the next 50–80 years in combination with anthropogenic loss of habitats are projected to cause extirpations and extinctions in oviparous species. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Comparative modelling of the coupled thermal–hydraulic-mechanical (THM) processes in a heated bentonite pellet column with hydration
VL  - 77
IS  - 3
AB  - For the deep geological disposal of high-level radioactive waste in argillaceous rocks, the heat production of the waste is an important driver for thermal–hydraulic-mechanical (THM)-coupled processes. These THM processes influence the properties and conditions of the near field that in many repository designs contains bentonite as a clay buffer. One task in the DECOVALEX-2015 (DEvelopment of COupled models and their VALidation against Experiments) project was the modelling of a heated bentonite column (Villar et al. in Long-term THM tests reports: THM cells for the HE-E test: update of results until February 2014. Deliverable-no: D2.2-7.3. CIEMAT Technical Report IEMAT/DMA/2G210/03/2014, 2014) in preparation for the in situ heater experiment HE-E at the underground rock laboratory Mont Terri. DECOVALEX is an international cooperative project that focuses on the development and validation of mathematical models for simulating such coupled processes associated with disposal in deep geological repositories. Eight modelling teams developed their own THM-coupled models for the bentonite column experiment, using six different simulation codes. Each of the teams individually calibrated the THM parameters for the bentonite material. The eight resulting parameter sets agree well and allow a satisfactory reproduction of the TH measurements by all models. The modelling results for the evolution of temperature and relative humidity over time at three sensors in the bentonite column are in good agreement between the teams and with the measured data. Also, changes of the temperature due to modifications of the insulation and the adjustment of the heating power during the course of the experiment are well reproduced. The models were thus able to reproduce the main physical processes of the experiment, both for vapour-dominated diffusion during the heating phase and combined liquid and vapour transport during a subsequent heating and hydration phase. Based on the parameter sets, the teams predict a penetration of the water infiltration front in the 48-cm column filled with bentonite pellets to a depth between 25 and 35 cm over the 15,000 h (i.e. over 20 months) of the hydration phase of the experiment. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Genomic data support management of anadromous Arctic Char fisheries in Nunavik by highlighting neutral and putatively adaptive genetic variation
VL  - 14
IS  - 7
SP  - 1880-1897
AB  - Distinguishing neutral and adaptive genetic variation is one of the main challenges in investigating processes shaping population structure in the wild, and landscape genomics can help identify signatures of adaptation to contrasting environments. Arctic Char (Salvelinus alpinus) is an anadromous salmonid and the most harvested fish species by Inuit people, including in Nunavik (Québec, Canada), one of the most recently deglaciated regions in the world. Unlike many other anadromous salmonids, Arctic Char occupy coastal habitats near their natal rivers during their short marine phase restricted to the summer ice-free period. Our main objective was to document putatively neutral and adaptive genomic variation in anadromous Arctic Char populations from Nunavik and bordering regions to inform local fisheries management. We used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) to genotype 18,112 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 650 individuals from 23 sampling locations along >2000 km of coastline. Our results reveal a hierarchical genetic structure, whereby neighboring hydrographic systems harbor distinct populations grouped by major oceanographic basins: Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Ungava Bay, and Labrador Sea. We found genetic diversity and differentiation to be consistent both with the expected postglacial recolonization history and with patterns of isolation-by-distance reflecting contemporary gene flow. Results from three gene–environment association methods supported the hypothesis of local adaptation to both freshwater and marine environments (strongest associations with sea surface and air temperatures during summer and salinity). Our results support a fisheries management strategy at a regional scale, and other implications for hatchery projects and adaptation to climate change are discussed. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Black cherry fruit as a source of probiotic candidates with antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against Salmonella
VL  - 150
SP  - 861-872
AB  - Salmonella spp is one of the leading causes of bacterial foodborne illnesses worldwide resulting in acute gastroenteritis. The current study aimed to explore the inhibitory activity of two newly isolated probiotic candidates Lactiplantibacillus plantarum MYSAS1 and Enterococcus faecium MYSAS4 from fermented black cherry fruit, against Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Paratyphi A. Results demonstrated effective inhibitory activity of selected Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella Paratyphi A. In addition, the cell-free supernatant (CFS) of both strains showed potent antimicrobial activity on growth of S. Paratyphi A were demonstrated by agar well diffusion, broth microdilution assay, in vitro time-kill assay, and co-culture experiments. Besides, Salmonella sessile cells were effectively reduced by 70% after treatment with the CFS of L. plantarum MYSAS1 and E. faecium MYSAS4, as determined by crystal violet and 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1)-2, 5-diphenyltetra bromide (MTT) biofilm assays. The antimicrobial substances of CFS were thermostable but sensitive to pH neutralization, suggesting that the observed antisalmonella activity is likely due to organic acids. Liquid Chromatography- Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of CFS revealed that the antimicrobial activity is likely due to the presence of 11 different organic acids. The isolated strains exhibited important probiotic characteristics, such as sensitivity to most of the antibiotics tested (except vancomycin and kanamycin), anti-hemolytic activity, tolerance to acidic pH and 0.3% bile, and survival ability at different temperatures. L. plantarum MYSAS1 and E. faecium MYSAS4 also exhibited auto-aggregation and cell surface hydrophobicity of 45 and 80%, respectively. Our findings demonstrated important probiotic features isolated from black cherry fruits while inhibiting multiple pathogens, suggesting possible applications of these potential probiotic strains as alternatives for antibiotics and chemical preservatives in the veterinary and food sectors. © 2022 SAAB

TI  - Historical links between climate and fire on species dispersion and trait evolution
VL  - 223
IS  - 7
SP  - 711-732
AB  - The interaction effects between climate and fire regime in controlling the type of vegetation and species composition is well established among the Earth’s biomes. Climate and the associated fire regime are never stable for long, and annual temperatures, atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen levels, and burn probability have varied radically over the last 350 million years. At the scale of thousands of years, floras have oscillated between spreading and retracting as climate and the dependent fire regime have fluctuated. At the scale of millions of years, distinct traits have evolved along three lines: fire resistance, fire-stimulated dormancy release, and rapid postfire growth, all limited by the type of fire (as controlled by climate) and postfire weather. Eight pairings of fire- and postfire-related traits resulting from the interplay between fire and climate are noted here. Smoke-released seed dormancy is beneficial on two counts: it increases the chance of recruitment under the present fireprone climate and increases the chances of survival should the wet season shift to another time of year where temperatures are higher or lower. Four pathways can be recognized with respect to the fire regimes induced by climate changes: (1) from non-fireprone to fireprone habitats (gains fire-adapted trait, 13 studies covering the last 115 million years (My) described here); (2) from a surface fire to a crown fire-type habitat (gains a different fire-adapted trait, 13 studies); (3) from a crown fire-type to surface fire-type habitat (loss of fire-adapted trait, 12 studies); and (4) from moderately burnt (crown fire) to non-fireprone habitat, such as desert, rainforest, or alpine habitats (loss of fire-adapted trait, 6 studies). Four case studies, at decreasing taxonomic rank, are used to illustrate the intimate relationship between climate change with its associated vegetation and fire regime change as they promote adaptive trait evolution: gain then loss of heat-released seed dormancy in Dipterocarpaceae–Cistaceae–Bixaceae over 90 My, gain then loss of serotiny in Callitroid Cupressaceae over the last 65 My, gain then loss of smoke-released seed dormancy in Proteoid Proteaceae over the last 120 My, and gain then loss of resprouting and serotiny among Hakea species (Grevilleoid Proteaceae) over the last 20 My. Examples of within-species rates of migration and trait change, including a model describing increasing degree of serotiny with intensifying drought, are given. The relevance of this historical approach to current (anthropogenic) climate change and associated fire regime alteration is discussed. Despite major threats expected to species conservation status at both the macro-(biome) and micro-(population) scales, I conclude that insufficient time or opportunities remain for effective migration to less-stressed areas or suitable adaptive responses to climate/fire regime change to evolve. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Exposure to Temperature and Insecticides Modulates the Expression of Small Noncoding RNA-Associated Transcripts in the Colorado Potato Beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
AB  - The Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)) is an insect that can adapt to various challenges, including temperature fluctuations or select insecticide treatments. This pest is also an ongoing threat to the potato industry. Small noncoding RNAs such as miRNAs, which can control posttranscriptionally the expression of various genes, and piRNAs, which can notably impact mRNA turnover, are modulated in insects under different conditions. Unfortunately, information regarding the expression status of key players involved in their synthesis and function is for the most part lacking. The current study thus aims at assessing the levels of such targets in L. decemlineata exposed to hot and cold temperatures as well as treated to the insecticides chlorantraniliprole, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and spinosad. Transcript expression levels of Ago1, Ago2, Ago3, Dcr2a, Dcr2b, Expo-5, Siwi-1, and Siwi-2, components of pathways associated with small noncoding RNA production or function, were measured by qRT-PCR and revealed modulation of select transcripts in response to temperature challenges and to select insecticides. RNAi-mediated reduction of Ago2 transcript levels in L. decemlineata injected with Ago2-targeting dsRNA and exposed to cold and warm temperatures was also conducted. Changes in survival rates were observed for the latter condition in dsRNA- versus saline-injected insects. These results showcase the differential expression of select targets involved in small noncoding RNA homeostasis and provide leads for the subsequent assessment of their involvement during stress response in L. decemlineata using RNAi-based approaches. © 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Can Adaptive Response and Evolution Make Survival of Extremophile Bacteria Possible on Mars?
AB  - The humidity on the surface of the red planet, Mars, drops steeply during the daytime as the temperature rises. In this situation, Martian microorganisms should have the capability to cope with desiccation. Extremophiles are microorganisms that are capable of surviving in extreme environmental conditions. It has previously been shown that a pre-exposure to low levels of either ionizing or non-ionizing radiation can induce resistance against subsequent exposure to high levels of different stressors (e.g. high doses of ionizing radiation) in a wide variety of living systems. Moreover, it has been shown that E. coli bacteria repeatedly exposed to a dose needed for 1% survival, and increasing the dose each time due to increased radioresistance for the same survival (1%), generates extremely radioresistant bacteria through directed evolution. Mortazavi et al. have warned that in a similar manner with extremophiles such as Deinococcus radiodurans, it would be very likely that this type of human-directed radioresistance makes E. coli bacteria resistant to all physical and chemical agents (generation of serious life-threatening micro-organisms). There are reports about the possibility of the existence of microbes in the salty puddles of Mars. On Mars, with its thin atmosphere and lack of the protective magnetic field, higher levels of space radiation cause more genetic mutations. Interestingly, these mutations in bacteria, which can make them resistant against radiation, can also make them resistant against desiccation. Moreover, the adaptive response to radiation in bacteria might play an important role in this process. As stated in a NASA report, the cells in the astronauts will be traversed by multiple protons before exposure to HZE particles. This sequential exposure might significantly increase the resistance against radiation. The same exposure in bacteria might not only induce resistance against the high levels of damage caused by HZEs, but also to other life-threatening factors for bacteria such as desiccation. In this paper, the current understanding of extremophiles and their capability of surviving in extreme environmental conditions as well as current findings about radioadaptive responses in bacteria will be discussed. © 2020 IEEE.

TI  - Roost elevation and ambient temperature best predict use of summer heterothermy in eastern red bats
VL  - 313
IS  - 3
SP  - 216-223
AB  - Temperate bat species cope with environmental temperatures outside their thermoneutral zone through physiological responses, habitat selection, and social roosting. While there have been several studies examining these factors in bat species that form maternity colonies in tree cavities, underneath bark, or in manmade structures, such studies rarely focus on bats that roost solitarily in tree foliage. To better understand the thermal environment of a foliage-roosting bat and how they respond to thermal stimuli, we used temperature-sensitive radio-telemetry and environmental dataloggers to study the eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis) in southeast Ohio. We collected skin temperatures from eight male and nine reproductive female bats in combination with microclimate data from 25 bat roosts and 15 random trees. We found that elevation, minimum ambient temperature, and maximum ambient temperature best predicted bat skin temperatures, while sex had little effect. We also found that trees located at higher elevations had warmer canopy microclimates than those at lower elevations, but temperatures did not differ between roost and random trees. These results show that solitary, foliage-roosting species use torpor extensively in response to cool temperatures during summer. These results have conservation implications, indicating that areas on the landscape with warmer conditions are important for reducing the cost of maintaining euthermic body temperatures. In southeastern Ohio, this includes upland forests, but our data suggest that temperatures at slope positions, and not the elevation itself, are the important habitat feature for eastern red bats. © 2020 The Zoological Society of London

AB  - Outdoor workers may need to adapt to warming by moving labor from midday to cooler hours. Here the authors find this adaptation strategy loses efficacy under additional climate change due to increased heat exposure in the coolest hours of the day. Working in hot and potentially humid conditions creates health and well-being risks that will increase as the planet warms. It has been proposed that workers could adapt to increasing temperatures by moving labor from midday to cooler hours. Here, we use reanalysis data to show that in the current climate approximately 30% of global heavy labor losses in the workday could be recovered by moving labor from the hottest hours of the day. However, we show that this particular workshift adaptation potential is lost at a rate of about 2% per degree of global warming as early morning heat exposure rises to unsafe levels for continuous work, with worker productivity losses accelerating under higher warming levels. These findings emphasize the importance of finding alternative adaptation mechanisms to keep workers safe, as well as the importance of limiting global warming.

VL  - 61

SP  - 95-108
AB  - Five provenance tests with twenty-six European silver fir autoch-thonous populations were used in order to assess the response of populations to climate change. Height growth and diameter at breast height of trees at age 31 years were considered as response variables and eight climate variables as predictors. Climatic variables for the trial sites and for origin location of provenances were calculated from 1961 to 2010. The experiments revealed a large genetic variability within species level and a plastic response to climate change, which certainly has a genetic basis. The transfer to warmer climate has resulted in an increase of the provenances growth, in the trial sites situated on the lower vegetation layer. But growth is significantly influenced by mean annual temperature and annual precipitation of planting site and also by the differences in mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, monthly mean temperature in July and July precipitation between provenance site and test site. These are the climatic factors which should be associated with risk in case of the transfer of forest reproductive materials. The provenance origin should be especially considered if the species will be planted outside of its current climate optimum. The best provenances in terms of total height and diameter at 1.30 m came from origin climate close to site climate, small transfer distances. Based on growth response functions and RCP4.5 scenario, we could project the shifts in species distribution for 2050s and 2100s and identify vulnerable populations. © 2018, Editura Silvica.

AB  - Living across Africa and the Caribbean, this widely dispersed primate population must adapt to different environmental challenges. How do members of the genus Chlorocebus live in desert-like conditions and in areas with freezing temperatures and snow in winter? This book examines the ways these primates adapt genetically, hormonally, physically and behaviourally to their changing landscapes. It features summary chapters for major topics such as behavioural ecology, life history, taxonomy, genetics and ethnoprimatology. Shorter essays supplement the work, with experts detailing their particular research on these primates. The combination of scholarship provides both a comprehensive view of this adaptable genus while enabling the reader to gain depth in specific topics. Developed from a symposium, this book combines decades of experience working with savanna monkeys into a tangible resource, for students and researchers in primatology as well as evolutionary and behavioural studies. © Trudy R.

TI  - Effect of low temperatures on the reproduction of summer and perennial rotifers from temperate regions: ecological and life cycle implications
VL  - 54
IS  - 3
SP  - 711-719
AB  - Summer and perennial planktonic rotifers from temperate regions can vary greatly in their ability to reproduce at low temperatures. The population growth rate (r day−1) of a Patagonian Keratella tropica was 0.025 at 3.9 °C and gradually increased to 0.083 at 9.3 °C. The ability of this rotifer to survive and reproduce at low winter temperatures suggests that populations in permanent waters with cold winters may have life cycles with little or no commitment to sexually produced diapausing eggs. In contrast, three Brachionus taxa from two localities in southeastern Australia reproduced poorly at low temperatures. At 3.9 °C, all females died before reproducing. At 6.1 °C, only a single amictic female of the Darling Brachionus (B. calyciflorus species complex) from Lake Littra survived to produce a few offspring. At 9.3 °C, amictic females of the Darling Brachionus from both Lake Littra and a billabong produced many more offspring (7–9 offspring female−1) than those of the Lake Littra B. calyciflorus and the billabong B. rubens (1–2 offspring female−1). At 14.9 °C, amictic females of the latter two taxa, and the Darling Brachionus from Lake Littra, produced many (14–17) offspring female−1. Seasonal changes in temperature occurring in natural populations of these Brachionus taxa should have important ecological and evolutionary implications. Low temperatures likely favor the occurrence and reproduction of the Darling taxon. The inability of active individuals to survive and reproduce at low winter temperatures may be a factor favoring selection for sexual reproduction and production of resting eggs in both permanent and temporary water bodies. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Individuals exhibit consistent differences in their metabolic rates across changing thermal conditions
VL  - 217
SP  - 1-6
AB  - Metabolic rate has been linked to growth, reproduction, and survival at the individual level and is thought to have far reaching consequences for the ecology and evolution of organisms. However, metabolic rates must be consistent (i.e. repeatable) over at least some portion of the lifetime in order to predict their longer-term effects on population dynamics and how they will respond to selection. Previous studies demonstrate that metabolic rates are repeatable under constant conditions but potentially less so in more variable environments. We measured the standard (= minimum) metabolic rate, maximum metabolic rate, and aerobic scope (= interval between standard and maximum rates) in juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta) after 5 weeks acclimation to each of three consecutive test temperatures (10, 13, and then 16 °C) that simulated the warming conditions experienced throughout their first summer of growth. We found that metabolic rates are repeatable over a period of months under changing thermal conditions: individual trout exhibited consistent differences in all three metabolic traits across increasing temperatures. Initial among-individual differences in metabolism are thus likely to have significant consequences for fitness-related traits over key periods of their life history. © 2017 The Authors

TI  - Immediate response mechanisms of Gram-negative solvent-tolerant bacteria to cope with environmental stress: cis-trans isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids and outer membrane vesicle secretion
VL  - 102
IS  - 6
SP  - 2583-2593
AB  - Bacteria have evolved an array of adaptive mechanisms enabling them to survive and grow in the presence of different environmental stresses. These mechanisms include either modifications of the membrane or changes in the overall energy status, cell morphology, and cell surface properties. Long-term adaptations are dependent on transcriptional regulation, the induction of anabolic pathways, and cell growth. However, to survive sudden environmental changes, bacterial short-term responses are essential to keep the cells alive after the occurrence of an environmental stress factor such as heat shock or the presence of toxic organic solvents. Thus far, two main short-term responses are known. On the one hand, a fast isomerization of cis into trans unsaturated fatty leads to a quick rigidification of the cell membrane, a mechanism known in some genera of Gram-negative bacteria. On the other hand, a fast, effective, and ubiquitously present countermeasure is the release of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from the cell surface leading to a rapid increase in cell surface hydrophobicity and finally to the formation of cell aggregates and biofilms. These immediate response mechanisms just allow the bacteria to stay physiologically active and to employ long-term responses to assure viability upon changing environmental conditions. Here, we provide insight into the two aforementioned rapid adaptive mechanisms affecting ultimately the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria. © 2018, The Author(s).

VL  - 49
IS  - 9
SP  - 1618-1628
AB  - Aim: Body size is a key trait linked to other life history traits and influences several individual-, community- and ecosystem-level characteristics, processes, functions and services. Ecological and evolutionary body size responses at the intra- and inter-specific level to thermal geographic gradients (e.g. latitudinal or altitudinal ones) are widely studied. Whether this temperature-size relationship remains true for community-wide body size is still largely unknown. Location: Northern temperate region. Taxon: Ground beetles (Carabidae). Methods: We assessed the temperature-size relationships using data from 11 northern temperate locations, spanning 25 latitudinal degrees. Furthermore, we quantified the effects of potential competing factors, such as body size and habitat preference of carabid assemblages and sub-assemblages along urbanisation gradients, as well as the urban heat island (UHI) effect on this relationship. Results: We found significant negative relationship between the community-wide mean body size and the geographical latitude (converse Bergmann cline) for the whole ground beetle assemblage and the sub-assemblages of large-bodied species. This relationship was stronger in the urban localities than in rural ones. For the sub-assemblages of small-sized species, the relationship was not significant. We found significant negative relationship between the community-wide mean body size and the latitude for the sub-assemblages of both the non-forest and the forest species, and these became stronger in the urban habitats. Main Conclusions: Our results highlight the leading role of the individual body size and the UHI effect in determining the community-wide body size–latitude relationship in ground beetles. © 2022 The Authors.

VL  - 62
IS  - 1
SP  - 135-150
AB  - Exceptional fossils can preserve diagenetically-altered biomolecules. Understanding the pathways that lead to such preservation is vital to utilizing fossil information in evolutionary and palaeoecological studies. Experimental taphonomy explores the stability of tissues during microbial/autolytic decay or their molecular stability through maturation under high pressure and temperature. Maturation experiments often take place inside sealed containers, preventing the loss of labile, mobile or volatile molecules. However, wrapping tissues inside aluminium foil, for example, can create too open a system, leading to loss of both labile and recalcitrant materials. We present a novel experimental procedure for maturing tissues under elevated pressure/temperature inside compacted sediment. In this procedure, porous sediment allows maturation breakdown products to escape into the sediment and maturation chamber, while recalcitrant, immobile components are contained, more closely mimicking the natural conditions of fossilization. To test the efficacy of this procedure in simulating fossil diagenesis, we investigate the differential survival of melanosomes relative to proteinaceous tissues through maturation of fresh lizard body parts and feathers. Macro- and ultrastructures are then compared to fossils. Similar to many carbonaceous exceptional fossils, the resulting organic components are thin, dark films composed mainly of exposed melanosomes resting on the sediment in association with darkened bones. Keratinous, muscle, collagenous and adipose tissues appear to be lost. Such results are consistent with predictions derived from non-sediment-encased maturation experiments and our understanding of biomolecular stability. These experiments also suggest that organic preservation is largely driven by the original molecular composition of the tissue and the diagenetic stability of those molecules, rather than the tissue's decay resistance alone; this should be experimentally explored in the future. © The Palaeontological Association

TI  - Adaptation of Mediterranean forest species to climate: Lessons from common garden experiments
VL  - 110

SP  - 1022-1042
AB  - Mediterranean ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots located between temperate mesic climates and semi-deserts and deserts. Mediterranean climates are characterized by a drought season but its length and severity can be highly variable across regions. In this review, we explored population genetic variation in functional traits and fitness in Mediterranean oak and pine species. We tested the hypothesis that increased drought tolerance has evolved as an adaptation to xeric and warm areas of the Mediterranean climate while increased competitive abilities have been favoured in more mesic regions, following a productivity-persistence trade-off within species. We first reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of studies on Pinus sp. and Quercus sp. from Mediterranean climates, and then analysed a set of unpublished data from Spanish common garden experiments of species from the Mediterranean Basin, searching for evidence of trait genetic variation among populations, local adaptation and trait–environment associations. The meta-analysis showed that 82.9% (95% CI 75.7–89.4) of traits per study showed significant population genetic differentiation and that 52.5% (35.6–69.2) of traits in studies with two or more Mediterranean environments exhibited population-by-environment interaction. Population differences in traits related to drought tolerance, cold hardiness and fitness were usually correlated with provenance precipitation and temperature gradients, suggesting that adaptation to different climatic regimes is an important process driving intraspecific genetic divergence. Within the Spanish trial network, however, predicted fitness functions based on climatic transfer distance failed to reveal significantly higher fitness of populations at experimental sites with climates closer to their provenances’ ones. Neither the literature review nor the new analyses of the Spanish trial network provided evidence of a negative association between growth- and persistence-related traits at the intraspecific level. Synthesis. Population genetic differentiation in functional traits and fitness is common in Mediterranean species, driven, at least in part, by the adaptation to contrasting temperature and precipitation regimes. Because of experimental constraints or biological reality, our study failed to detect a trade-off between resource-use strategies within species, calling for future studies to investigate further whether intraspecific evolution of stress tolerance occurs at the expense of growth potential in Mediterranean environments or not. © 2021 British Ecological Society.

VL  - 41
IS  - 6
SP  - 3441-3447
AB  - Africanized honey bee populations (Apis mellifera L.) have been decreasing mainly due to the intense use of synthetic insecticides associated with pollution and climate change. To minimize these impacts on the environment and bee populations, the use of biological control agents has been intensified. These products are generally safer for non-target insects, such as bees, which are important pollinating insects. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of entomopathogenic nematodes on the longevity of the Africanized honey bee A. mellifera workers. Seven treatments were used: Heterorhabditis amazonensis, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, Heterorhabditis indica, Steinernema carpocapsae, Steinernema feltiae, and Steinernema rarum, at a concentration of 40 infective juveniles per cm2 (IJs/cm2) and a control in which autoclaved distilled water was used. Two bioassays were performed: 1) spraying nematodes on the workers and 2) spraying nematodes on glass plates, in which the bees remained for two hours. Each treatment consisted of five replicates with 20 bees each. Bees were kept in cages of PVC (20 × 10 cm) covered with a voile fabric and provided pieces of cotton soaked in water and Candy paste. The cages were kept in a climatized room (27 ± 2 °C temperature, 60 ± 10% relative humidity, and 12 h photophase) and the mortality was evaluated from 12 to 240 hours. In bioassay 1, the three treatments with nematodes of the genus Steinernema reduced the longevity of the workers (103.9, 96.3, and 99.6 h) when compared to treatments with Heterorhabditis (149.7, 126.8, and 134.7 h), of which, only H. amazonensis (149.7 h) did not differ from the control (166.0 h). In bioassay 2, all treatments reduced the longevity of honey bees (155.4 to 93.9 h) in relation to the control (176.1 h). Entomopathogenic nematodes, especially Heterorhabditis, need to be tested using other methodologies and for different durations of exposure and application because in the laboratory, they were less selective to A. mellifera. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Londrina.

TI  - Highly efficient temperature inducible crispr-cas9 gene targeting in drosophila suzukii
VL  - 22
IS  - 13
AB  - The spotted-wing Drosophila (Drosophila suzukii Matsumura) is native to eastern Asia, but has become a global threat to fruit production. In recent years, CRISPR/Cas9 targeting was established in this species allowing for functional genomic and genetic control studies. Here, we report the generation and characterization of Cas9-expressing strains of D. suzukii. Five independent transgenic lines were generated using a piggyBac construct containing the EGFP fluorescent marker gene and the Cas9 gene under the control of the D. melanogaster heat shock protein 70 promoter and 3’UTR. Heat-shock (HS) treated embryos were analyzed by reverse transcriptase PCR, revealing strong heat inducibility of the transgenic Cas9 expression. By injecting gRNA targeting EGFP into one selected line, 50.0% of G0 flies showed mosaic loss-of-fluorescence phenotype, and 45.5% of G0 flies produced G1 mutants without HS. Such somatic and germline mutagenesis rates were increased to 95.4% and 85.7%, respectively, by applying a HS. Parental flies receiving HS resulted in high inheritance of the mutation (92%) in their progeny. Additionally, targeting the endogenous gene yellow led to the lack of pigmentation and male lethality. We discuss the potential use of these efficient and temperature-dependent Cas9-expressing strains for the genetic studies in D. suzukii. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Comparing DNA yield from fish scales following different extraction protocols
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - Studies on genetic diversity, adaptive potential and fitness of species have become a major tool in conservation biology. These studies require biological material containing a reliable source of DNA which can be extracted and analysed. Recently, non-invasive sampling has become the preferred sampling method of such biological material; particularly when studying endangered species. Elasmoid scales from teleost fish are an example of non-invasive samples from which DNA can successfully be extracted. This study compared different extraction protocols to find an optimal method for extracting DNA from teleost fish scales. This was done with the intent to use the protocol that yielded the highest quantity of DNA on dried, archived scales. The protocols tested in this study included (1) phenol/chloroform with a TNES-urea digestion buffer, (2) phenol/chloroform with an amniocyte digestion buffer and (3) Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit with variations in incubation times and temperatures of each protocol. While the phenol/chloroform with TNES-urea digestion buffer yielded significantly higher concentrations of DNA compared to the other protocols, all protocols followed in this study yielded sufficient quantities of DNA for further downstream applications. Therefore, while there are multiple viable options when selecting a DNA extraction protocol, each research project’s individual needs, requirements and resources need to be carefully considered in order to choose the most effective protocol. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Transcriptional flexibility during thermal challenge corresponds with expanded thermal tolerance in an invasive compared to native fish
VL  - 14
IS  - 4
SP  - 931-949
AB  - Capacity to cope with warming temperatures is a key determining factor of species' persistence under global climate change. Many successful invasive species have heightened thermal tolerance relative to their native counterparts, which may provide competitive advantages for habitat utilization and resource acquisition under warming scenarios, ultimately contributing to radically altered community composition. Enhanced transcriptional plasticity may be an important factor conferring superior abilities to cope with environmental stress, but the molecular mechanisms driving key differences of organismal traits in invasive versus native species are not well known. Although it is predicted that established invaders will evolve canalized phenotypes well-adapted to new environments, it is not clear whether the same expectations are true for invaders of variable thermal environments or under climate warming scenarios where abilities to cope with fluctuating and increasing temperatures may provide fitness advantages. Here, we compare a highly successful invasive fish and a sympatric endangered native fish living in a dynamic estuarine environment that is projected to warm under climate change. We linked organismal physiological limits with global transcriptional responses at multiple common relative and absolute temperature thresholds and determined that heightened thermal tolerance of invasive Inland Silversides (Menidia beryllina) is associated with transcriptional changes that are greater both in the number of genes and the magnitude of response relative to native Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). Modulated genes contributed to the enrichment of biological processes that differed between species and generally increased with temperature. These results are in concordance with the hypothesis that transcriptional plasticity may play a key role in determining population persistence, species interactions, and shaping community assemblages under climate change. Future studies encompassing a wider range of species and taxa are needed to determine whether this is a general pattern found between native and invasive species more broadly. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Mitochondrial volume density and evidence for its role in adaptive divergence in response to thermal tolerance in threespine stickleback
VL  - 191
IS  - 4
SP  - 657-668
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is predicted to permit persistence in new environments, and may subsequently evolve to enhance fitness. Colonizing environments with lower winter temperatures can lead to the evolution of lower critical thermal minima; the corresponding physiological traits associated with temperature tolerance are predicted to involve mitochondrial function. Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) have colonized freshwater lakes along the Pacific Northwest. These freshwater populations are known to exhibit cold-induced increases in mitochondrial volume density in pectoral muscle, but whether such plasticity evolved before or after colonization is uncertain. Here, we measure critical thermal minima (CTmin) in one marine and one freshwater population of threespine stickleback, and mitochondrial volume density in pectoral and cardiac tissue of both populations acclimated to different temperature treatments (6.2, 14.5 and 20.6 ℃). Mitochondrial volume density increased with cold acclimation in pectoral muscle; cardiac muscle was non-plastic but had elevated mitochondrial volume densities compared to pectoral muscle across all temperature treatments. There were no differences in the levels of plasticity between marine and freshwater stickleback, but neither were there differences in CTmin. Importantly, marine stickleback exhibited plasticity under low-salinity conditions, suggesting that marine stickleback had at least one necessary phenotype for persistence in freshwater environments before colonization occurred. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Development of a nondiapausing strain of northern corn rootworm with rearing techniques for both diapausing and nondiapausing strains
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - The northern corn rootworm, Diabrotica barberi Smith & Lawrence, has a univoltine life cycle that typically produces one generation a year. When rearing the northern corn rootworm in the laboratory, in order to break diapause, it is necessary to expose eggs to a five month cold period before raising the temperature. By selective breeding of the small fraction of eggs that hatched without cold within 19–32 days post oviposition, we were able to develop a non-diapausing colony of the northern corn rootworm within five generations of selection. Through selection, the percentages of adult emergence from egg hatch without exposure to cold treatment significantly increased from 0.52% ± 0.07 at generation zero to 29.0% ± 2.47 at generation eight. During this process, we developed an improved method for laboratory rearing of both the newly developed non-diapausing strain as well as the diapausing strain. The development of the non-diapausing colony along with the improvements to the rearing system will allow researchers to produce up to six generations of the northern corn rootworm per year, which would facilitate research and advance our knowledge of this pest at an accelerated rate. © 2021, The Author(s).

VL  - 30

AB  - Aim: Climatic variation has long been regarded as a primary source of morphological variation. However, there is mixed support for the adherence of reptiles to ecogeographical hypotheses, such as Bergmann’s rule (body size decreases with temperature) and Allen’s rule (limb length increases with temperature). We quantified body and limb morphology among the diverse Australian gecko fauna (4 families, 30 genera, 226 of the 231 described species) to investigate environmental correlates of morphological variation in this radiation. Location: Australia. Major taxa studied: Geckos (Squamata: Gekkota; the families Gekkonidae, Carphodactylidae, Diplodactylidae and Pygopodidae). Methods: We measured 20 external features of ethanol-preserved museum specimens. We investigated whether principal component axes of morphology were correlated with three key environmental variables, and the microhabitat occupied by each species. Results: Morphology varied greatly among Australian gecko families and genera, although there was a strong phylogenetic signal in morphology. After accounting for phylogeny, morphology was correlated with a species’ microhabitat use. Saxicolous species and species with variable microhabitat requirements (i.e., generalists) had larger body dimensions than terrestrial species. Saxicolous species also had longer proportional forelimbs and hindlimbs than terrestrial species. Main conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of phylogeny and microhabitat use in shaping the morphology of Australian geckos. We find little evidence that Australian geckos adhere to Bergmann’s rule or Allen’s rule, suggesting that these ecogeographical hypotheses provide limited insight into the adaptive potential of lizard species to altered environmental conditions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Fish facing global change: are early stages the lifeline?
VL  - 147
SP  - 159-178
AB  - The role of phenotypic plasticity in the acclimation and adaptive potential of an organism to global change is not currently accounted for in prediction models. The high plasticity of marine fishes is mainly attributed to their early stages, during which morphological, structural and behavioural functions are particularly sensitive to environmental constraints. This developmental plasticity can determine later physiological performances and fitness, and may further affect population dynamics and ecosystem functioning. This review asks the essential question of what role early stages play in the ability of fish to later cope with the effects of global change, considering three key environmental factors (temperature, hypoxia and acidification). After having identified the carry-over effects of early exposure reported in the literature, we propose areas that we believe warrant the most urgent attention for further research to better understand the role of developmental plasticity in the responses of marine organisms to global change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Evolution of antibiotic resistance impacts optimal temperature and growth rate in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis
VL  - 133
IS  - 4
SP  - 2655-2667
AB  - Aims: Bacterial response to temperature changes can influence their pathogenicity to plants and humans. Changes in temperature can affect cellular and physiological responses in bacteria that can in turn affect the evolution and prevalence of antibiotic-resistance genes. Yet, how antibiotic-resistance genes influence microbial temperature response is poorly understood. Methods and Results: We examined growth rates and physiological responses to temperature in two species—E. coli and Staph. epidermidis—after evolved resistance to 13 antibiotics. We found that evolved resistance results in species-, strain- and antibiotic-specific shifts in optimal temperature. When E. coli evolves resistance to nucleic acid and cell wall inhibitors, their optimal growth temperature decreases, and when Staph. epidermidis and E. coli evolve resistance to protein synthesis and their optimal temperature increases. Intriguingly, when Staph. epidermidis evolves resistance to Teicoplanin, fitness also increases in drug-free environments, independent of temperature response. Conclusion: Our results highlight how the complexity of antibiotic resistance is amplified when considering physiological responses to temperature. Significance: Bacteria continuously respond to changing temperatures—whether through increased body temperature during fever, climate change or other factors. It is crucial to understand the interactions between antibiotic resistance and temperature. © 2022 Society for Applied Microbiology.

TI  - Thermoregulation of liolaemus chacoensis lizard (Squamata: Liolaemidae) during its repro­ductive cycle, in the western Chaco, Argentina
VL  - 67

SP  - 1505-1519
AB  - Regulation of body temperature in lizards plays a key role in the survival of species. Their physiological condition, in reference to their dependence on the ambient temperature makes them an excellent study model. Also, changes in the reproductive cycle cause changes in thermophysiological parameters. This study is the first to address the relationship of thermoregulation with reproductive activity and sex, for a species of Liolaemus from the Chaco ecoregion. The aim of this work was to determine how the reproductive, recruitment and post-reproductive periods influences, as well as the effect of sex and snout-vent length on the thermoregulation of Liolaemus chacoensis. Individuals were captured by hand in the Southern sector of Valle Fertil, San Juan province, Argentina. A total of 44 individuals were captured during the months of November 2014, February 2015 and March 2015. Body (Tb), substrate (Ts) and air (Ta) temperatures were recorded. Also, biophysical models were used to record operative temperatures. Later selected temperatures (Tsel) were evaluated at the laboratory. Finally, thermoregulatory efficiency index was calculated. Results indicated that L. chacoensis Tb was positively related to Ta, presenting a heliothermic behavior that was maintained during periods and sex. Also, Tb was higher in reproductive and recruitment periods than in post-reproductive period. In particular, only sex had an effect on Tsel, however for the interquartile range of Tsel both the period of reproductive cycle and sex had an effect. The thermoregulatory efficiency index indicated that L. chacoensis is an absolute thermoconformist. However, in the reproductive period both males and females change towards active thermoregulation. These results show that thermophysiological parameters vary in different periods of reproductive cycle and the active microsite selection would be a mechanism in maintenance of body temperature of this species. © 2019, Universidad de Costa Rica.

VL  - 37

SP  - 1736-1745
AB  - An abnormally high temperature produces a stress response in turbot causing large economic losses in the turbot aquaculture industry of China. A genetic improvement of the upper thermal tolerance (UTT) of turbot could allow cultured fish to adapt. A genetic evaluation of UTT is required for determining the practicability of including this trait into a breeding program. In this study, data were recorded from a temperature tolerance test conducted on 3 200 individual turbots from 32 full-sib groups. A cross-sectional linear model and a cross-sectional threshold probit model were used to analyze the test-period survival and a cross-sectional threshold logit model was used to analyze the test-day survival. In addition, phenotypic and genetic correlations between body weight and survival data were estimated. The estimated heritability values obtained from the cross-sectional linear model (CSL), the cross-sectional threshold (probit) model (THRp), and the cross-sectional threshold (logit) model (THRl) were 0.247 9±0.108 3, 0.288 3±0.161 2, and 0.106 9±0.045 2, respectively. The correlation coefficients among the full-sib family estimated breeding values (EBVs) obtained from the three models were greater than 0.998 6 and all models produced an almost identical family ranking. The accuracies of selection obtained with the CSL, THRp, and THRl model were 0.773 8, 0.775 4, and 0.784 4, respectively, the greatest from the THRl model. The genetic correlations between body weight and survival data EBVs from the CSL, THRp, and THRl models were 0.020 1, −6.201 1× 10−4, and −3.115 4×10−4, respectively, and the phenotypic correlations between the two traits were −0.837 1 and −0.667 1, respectively. The findings of this study provide background information to determine the best strategy of selection for the genetic improvement of UTT in turbot. © 2019, Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Climate change and influencing factors in the past 50 years; Thornthwaite Memorial model was used to study the temporal and spatial characteristics of agricultural climate productivity, and SPSS software was used to analyze the corresponding relationship between agricultural climate production potential in the study area and precipitation and temperature. The results of the study show that: In the past 50 years, the temperature in the coastal areas of Jiangsu Province has shown an upward trend, and the average temperature rising tendency rate is 0.31°C•10a−1 (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Among them, the uptrend of Chongchuan District in Nantong is the most obvious, followed by Yan and Sheyang. The upward trend is relatively minimal. The regional variation of precipitation in this area is more obvious. Precipitation in Chongchuan District fluctuates, and the volatility of the spit-yang declines, while clams show a slight upward trend. The characteristics of temporal and spatial evolution of climate potential are consistent with the trend of precipitation. Temperature and precipitation have a significant impact on agricultural climate potential. However, precipitation is the main influencing factor. “Cold and cool” climate is favorable for crop growth, and “warm dry” climate Detrimental to crop growth. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - Different transcriptomic responses to thermal stress in heat-tolerant and heat-sensitive pacific abalones indicated by cardiac performance
VL  - 10
AB  - The Pacific abalone Haliotis discus hannai is one of the most economically important mollusks in China. Even though it has been farmed in southern China for almost 20 years, summer mortality remains the most challengeable problem for Pacific abalone aquaculture recently. Here, we determined the different heat tolerance ability for five selective lines of H. discus hannai by measuring the cardiac performance and Arrhenius breakpoint temperature (ABT). The Red line (RL) and Yangxia line (YL) were determined as the most heat-sensitive and most heat-tolerant line, respectively. Heart rates for RL were significantly lower than those of the YL at the same temperature (p < 0.05). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were enriched in several pathways including cardiac muscle contraction, glutathione metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, were identified between RL and YL at control temperature (20°C) and heat stress temperature (28.5°C, the ABT of the RL) by RNA-seq method. In the RL, 3370 DEGs were identified between the control and the heat-stress temperature, while only 1351 DEGs were identified in YL between these two temperature tests. Most of these DEGs were enriched in the pathways such as protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, nucleotide binding and oligomerization domain (NOD) like receptor signaling, and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. Notably, the most heat-tolerant line YL used an effective heat-protection strategy based on moderate transcriptional changes and regulation on the expression of key genes. © 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

VL  - 247
AB  - This work aims to examine the additive manufacturing process, mechanical properties and electrical properties of continuous glass fiber-reinforced PEEK composites (CGFRPCs). A dual-stage heating nozzle with a preheating function is designed to promote the melt of filaments and then enhance the mechanical properties of finished specimens because of the low thermal conductivity of continuous glass fiber composites. The influence of traction speed on the morphology and mechanical properties of the composite filaments in preparation is first examined to obtain high-strength composite filaments. Additionally, the influence of preheating temperature on the heating effect of the filament and the evolution of the temperature field of the filament during the heating process are analyzed via thermal imaging and finite element approaches. Based on the printing device with a dual-stage heating nozzle, the cuboid-shaped tensile, flexural, interlaminar shear, and impact specimens with zero raster angles are also prepared and tested, and the influences of preheating temperature, printing speed, filament traction speed, hatch spacing, and fiber content on their strengths are discussed. Finally, the ring and cuboid-shaped samples are printed with parameters having better strength, and their electrical properties at various temperatures and frequency bands are tested by the probe, airline, and waveguide methods. The obtained results reveal that a lower traction speed is beneficial to improving the fiber dispersion in filaments, and the roundness and strength of the filaments. Preheating is also helpful to enhance the tensile and flexural strengths of the composite specimens, and the maximum strengths are obtained at a preheating temperature of 405 °C and printing speed of 1.5 mm/s, with an increase of 3.5% and 25.84%, respectively, compared with the no-preheated case. By process optimization, the tensile, flexural, interlaminar shear, and impact strengths of the specimens in order reach 524.33 MPa, 598.57 MPa, 46.28 MPa, and 173.91 kJ/m2. © 2022

SP  - 778-789
AB  - In this study, based on remote sensing and meteorological data, the evolution pattern and its potential driving factors of Tibetan grassland NPP (Spatiotemporal dynamics, Stability and continuity) were analyzed by u-sing the Net primary productivity (NPP) combined with model simulation and field observations in this study. The results showed that the annual mean NPP of grassland in Tibet was 136. 46 gC · m-2· a-2, and it showed a significant increasing trend with the change rate of 1. 57 gC · m-2· a-1during the study period. Grassland NPP showed a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest. In terms of future changes, the grassland NPP in Nyingchi, Nagqu and other places will consistently increase or decrease, while the junction of Xigaze, Ali, and Nagqu show an inconsistent tendency. The NPP distribution of different grassland types was also quite different, the alpine and subal-pine meadows have the highest NPP value, while plain grasslands were the lowest. Grassland NPP was positively correlated with temperature, but not significantly correlated with precipitation, indicating that temperature was the limiting climate factor for grassland NPP in the region. The implementation of policies for human activities, such as rotation grazing in areas, fences, and enclosures has played an important role in promoting the increase of grassland NPP in Tibet. © 2022 Acta Agrestia Sinica.

TI  - Multi-physics and multi-scale meshless simulation system for direct-chill casting of aluminium alloys
VL  - 65
IS  - 11
SP  - 658-670
AB  - This paper represents an overview of the elements of the user-friendly simulation system, developed for computational analysis and optimization of the quality and productivity of the electromagnetically direct-chill cast semi-products from aluminium alloys. The system also allows the computational estimation of the design changes of the casting equipment. To achieve this goal, the electromagnetic and the thermofluid process parameters are coupled to the evolution of Lorentz force, temperature, velocity, concentration, strain and stress fields as well as microstructure evolution. This forms a multi-physics and multi-scale problem of great complexity, which has not been demonstrated before. The macroscopic fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, and electromagnetic solution framework is based on local strong-form meshless formulation, involving the radial basis functions and monomials as trial functions, and local collocation or weighted least squares approximation. It is coupled to the micro-scale by incorporating the point automata solution concept. The entire macro-micro solution concept does not require meshing and space integration. The solution procedure can be easily and efficiently automatically adapted in node redistribution and/or refinement sense, which is of utmost importance when coping with fields exhibiting sharp gradients, which occur in the phase-change problems. The simulation system is coded from scratch in modern Fortran. The elements of the experimental validation of the system and the demonstration of its use for round billet casting in IMPOL Aluminium Industry are shown. © 2019 Mechanical Engineering.

TI  - A nocturnally foraging gecko of the high-latitude alpine zone: Extreme tolerance of cold nights, with cryptic basking by day
VL  - 99
AB  - Lizards that inhabit high-latitude alpine zones are exposed to extreme temperatures and long winters and most are diurnal heliotherms. Yet some poorly known nocturnal species exist in such locations, including several viviparous geckos from New Zealand. We studied the orange-spotted gecko (Mokopirirakau ‘Roy's Peak’), a cryptic, nocturnal and viviparous lizard known only from the alpine zone (1150–1800 m a.s.l.) in the South Island (~44°S). Our field study investigated (1) the influence of female reproductive condition and sex on daytime body temperatures, including relationships with microhabitat rock temperatures, (2) the influence of temperature and other weather conditions on gecko emergence by night and day, and (3) the thermal microclimates available year-round to orange-spotted geckos. Building a better understanding of these lizards aids in species conservation efforts, for example in developing monitoring programmes, and provides insights into the evolution of thermal mechanisms in cold environments. Reproductive females maintained higher daytime body temperatures than non-reproductive females and males, suggesting pregnancy-related thermophily. On summer days, all reproductive groups reached similar body temperatures to New Zealand geckos from lower elevations, suggesting similar thermal preferences. Using trail cameras, we obtained evidence of geckos openly basking during the day (previously undocumented for this species) when temperatures of exposed lizard models (=Texp) were 3.2–39.3 °C. We also observed emergence at night at low Texp (-0.8–14.6 °C), when some Tbs were probably 0–6 °C. Diurnal activity increased as Texp rose to peak at ~30 °C before dropping again at higher temperatures, whereas nocturnal activity unexpectedly decreased with increasing Texp. Our study provides evidence of diurnal activity in a ‘nocturnal’ gecko that may be essential to squamate viviparity at high-latitude, high-elevation sites. It also suggests remarkable capacity for locomotor activity at extremely low Tb. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Dynamic membrane bioreactor (DMBR) for the treatment of landfill leachate; bioreactor's performance and metagenomic insights into microbial community evolution
VL  - 243
SP  - 326-335
AB  - The use of dynamic membranes as a low-cost alternative for conventional membrane for the treatment of landfill leachate (LFL) was investigated in this study. For this purpose a lab-scale, submerged pre-anoxic and post-aerobic bioreactor configuration was used with nylon mesh as dynamic membrane support. The study was conducted at ambient temperature and LFL was fed to the bioreactor in gradually increasing concentration mixed with tap water (from 20% to 100%). The results of this study demonstrated that lower mesh pore size of 52 μm achieved better results in terms of solid-liquid separation performance (turbidity &lt;10 NTU) of the formed dynamic membrane layer as compared to 200 and 85 μm meshes while treating LFL. Consistently high NH4+-N conversion efficiency of more than 98% was achieved under all nitrogen loading conditions, showing effectiveness of the formed dynamic membrane in retaining slow growing nitrifying species. Total nitrogen removal reached more than 90% however, the denitrification activity showed a fluctuating profile and found to be inhibited by elevated concentrations of free nitrous acid and NO2−-N at low pH values inside the anoxic bioreactor. A detailed metagenomic analysis allowed a taxonomic investigation over time and revealed the potential biochemical pathways involved in NH4+-N conversion. This study led to the identification of a dynamic system in which nitrite concentration is determined by the contribution of NH4+ oxidizers (Nitrosomonas), and by a competition between nitrite oxidizers (Nitrospira and Nitrobacter) and reducers (Thauera). The study highlights the successful application of low-cost dynamic membranes as an alternative of conventional membranes for treating landfill leachate and provides a comprehensive overview of the “leachate microbiome” its evolution along the experiment and its functional capabilities using advanced metagenomic tools. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - How morphology and thermal ecology relates to diurnal microhabitat use and selection across seasons in two habitats of the nocturnal Tarentola delalandii from Tenerife
VL  - 40
IS  - 4
SP  - 487-498
AB  - Many selective pressures modulate microhabitat choice of ectotherms, such as temperature, humidity and habitat heterogeneity, and these vary in space and time. Here we analysed: 1) microhabitat selection comparing characteristics of stones (and their surroundings) under which geckos (Tarentola delalandii, mainly nocturnal) were found during the day with that of stones selected randomly; 2) relationship of a measure of body size to microhabitat characteristics (stone and herb covers, etc., and temperature/humidity) and cloacal temperature of males, females and juveniles from two contrasting habitats of Tenerife (northern and southern localities) and in two periods of the year (Spring-Summer and Autumn-Winter). In comparison with randomly selected stones, geckos significantly selected stones with lower temperature in the Spring-Summer and microhabitats with high stone cover. Gecko size was significantly larger in the Northern than in the Southern locality, in spring-summer than in autumn-winter and in males than in females. In both populations and time periods, the largest body sizes were significantly associated with higher environmental and shelter temperatures and with low values of humidity and stone cover. Cloacal and shelter temperatures were positively and significantly related; at higher values of the latter, juveniles attained significantly higher temperatures than adult males but lower than that of females. Larger body size was associated with high shrub and leaf litter covers and high values of shelter dimensions. Therefore, we suggest that in relation to their body sizes, geckos seem to select their shelters considering specific microhabitat characteristics surrounding them that may provide thermoregulatory and/or antipredator profits.

TI  - Interspecific differences, plastic, and evolutionary responses to a heat wave in three co-occurring Daphnia species
VL  - 66
IS  - 4
SP  - 1201-1220
AB  - Many studies document genetic and phenotypic trait changes of species in response to climate change, or document how evolution of individual species can impact population abundances and community composition. An integration of population and community-level responses requires, however, a multiple species approach. Here we quantify among- and within-species differences in thermal tolerance and life-history traits in three co-occurring Daphnia species upon exposure to a naturally occurring heat wave. Populations of randomly isolated clones of Daphnia magna, Daphnia pulicaria, and Daphnia galeata from the same pond were exposed to a natural heat wave in outdoor mesocosms. We subsequently conducted a common garden experiment in the laboratory using clonal lineages isolated at the end of the mesocosm selection experiment, at two rearing temperatures, measuring thermal tolerance and life-history traits. We find pronounced plasticity responses to higher rearing thermal regime in each study species. We observe only few significant microevolutionary responses involving evolution of plasticity in D. pulicaria. Yet in terms of effect size, evolutionary trait change within species contributes more than 25% to total trait change in response to the heat wave for a majority of the trait × species combinations. The relative importance of intraspecific to interspecific variation varies widely among traits. Our results show that the relative importance of interspecific variation, phenotypic plasticity, and evolutionary trait change differs strongly depending on the set of species and traits studied. Taking into account this variation at different levels of biological organization is important to predict community-wide responses to global change. © 2020 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography

TI  - Sensitivities to Chill Durations and No-Chill Temperatures Regulating Eclosion Responses Differ Between Rhagoletis zephyria (Diptera: Tephritidae) and its Braconid Parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)
VL  - 51
IS  - 2
SP  - 440-450
AB  - Seasonal temperatures select for eclosion timing of temperate insects and their parasitoids. In western North America, the fruit fly Rhagoletis zephyria Snow (Diptera: Tephritidae) is parasitized by the hymenopterous wasps Utetes lectoides (Gahan), an egg parasite, and Opius downesi Gahan, a larval parasite (both Braconidae). Eclosion of wasps should be timed with the presence of susceptible fly stages, but reports indicate U. lectoides ecloses in the absence of flies under no-chill conditions. Based on this, we tested the hypotheses that chill durations and no-chill temperatures both differentially regulate eclosion times of R. zephyria and its parasitic wasps. When fly puparia were chilled at ~3°C for 130-180 d, U. lectoides and O. downesi always eclosed on average later than flies. However, after 180-d chill, flies eclosed on average earlier than after 130- and 150-d chill, whereas eclosion times of U. lectoides and O. downesi were less or not affected by chill duration. When fly puparia were exposed to 20-22°C (no chill), U. lectoides eclosed before flies, with 88.9% of U. lectoides versus only 0.61% of flies eclosing. Taken together, findings show that eclosion times of flies are more sensitive to changes in chill duration than those of wasps. Flies are less sensitive than wasps to no-chill in that most flies do not respond by eclosing after no-chill while most wasps do. Our results suggest that shorter winters and longer summers due to climate change could cause mismatches in eclosion times of flies and wasps, with potentially significant evolutionary consequences. © 2022 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2022.

AB  - A numerical model is established to investigate the effects of the influencing factors such as design parameters and operating conditions on the performance and behavior of the engagement process of the wet clutch based on the Navier–Stokes equations, contact mechanics, and heat transfer theory. A finite element contact model called KE contact model is used to analyze the rough contact during engagement process and thermal effect on the viscosity is considered based on heat transfer theory. The integration of the grooving into the simulation and the method of coupled finite element by domain decomposition of groove and ungrooved areas are put forward to facilitate the analysis. The experimental results agree well with the numerical model which takes the normal pressure, the temperature of ATF, relative revolution speed, the permeability and the groove geometry into account. The results of numerical simulation and the experiment indicate that the applied pressure not only affects the engagement time, but also has influence on the value of the engagement torque. Besides, the engagement time is roughly proportional to the relative revolution speed. The influencing factors such as the temperature of ATF, the permeability, grooves, the torque judders and effects of PID control parameters are also discussed in the paper. The performance and behavior of the engagement of the wet clutch were studied by two methods of numerical calculation and experimental research, which make the working process of the wet clutch more detailed. © IMechE 2019.

TI  - Modeling effects of ecological factors on evolution of polygenic pesticide resistance
VL  - 456
SP  - 224-232
AB  - Widespread use of pesticides has resulted in the evolution of resistance in many insect pests worldwide limiting their use in pest control. Effective pest and resistance management practices require understanding of the genetics of resistance and of the life history of the pest. Most models for pesticide resistance assume that resistance is monogenic, conferred by a single gene. However, resistance could evolve as a polygenic quantitative trait resulting from the action of several genes, especially when pesticide dose is low. Further, fitness of the pest could be density-dependent and might depend upon abiotic factors such as temperature. It is not known how these factors affect the evolution of polygenic resistance or pest population dynamics when resistance evolves. We use the western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, as a case study and use data on density-dependent survival, heritability and survival rates on the transgenic Cry3Bb1 toxin and corresponding LC50 values, to model polygenic resistance to Cry3Bb1. We found that LC50 increased rapidly even at doses that produced a mortality of less than 99.9%. However, survival reached 100% only when mortality was as high as 99.9%. Fast response to high selection pressure produced cyclical larval densities while lower selection pressures produced equilibrium densities. Interestingly we found that a relatively low density observed in a population may not be evidence for a low survival to the pesticide. As a consequence we found that larger refuges might not necessarily help in reducing pest densities especially when pesticide mortality is low. This effect, arising from the tradeoff between response to selection and density dependence, calls for careful assessment of the evolution of resistance based on change in survival as well as on pest densities. When selection pressure is low a lower initial density resulted in a larger response to selection. Finally, we showed that populations with shorter developmental times developed resistance faster initially irrespective of selection pressure. However, when selection pressure is low survival eventually became higher in populations with longer developmental times. Since developmental time depends on degree days spatio-temporal variation in temperature could be an important factor in polygenic resistance evolution. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A clinal polymorphism in the insulin signaling transcription factor foxo contributes to life-history adaptation in Drosophila*
VL  - 73
IS  - 9
SP  - 1774-1792
AB  - A fundamental aim of adaptation genomics is to identify polymorphisms that underpin variation in fitness traits. In Drosophila melanogaster, latitudinal life-history clines exist on multiple continents and make an excellent system for dissecting the genetics of adaptation. We have previously identified numerous clinal single-nucleotide polymorphism in insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS), a pathway known from mutant studies to affect life history. However, the effects of natural variants in this pathway remain poorly understood. Here we investigate how two clinal alternative alleles at foxo, a transcriptional effector of IIS, affect fitness components (viability, size, starvation resistance, fat content). We assessed this polymorphism from the North American cline by reconstituting outbred populations, fixed for either the low- or high-latitude allele, from inbred DGRP lines. Because diet and temperature modulate IIS, we phenotyped alleles across two temperatures (18°C, 25°C) and two diets differing in sugar source and content. Consistent with clinal expectations, the high-latitude allele conferred larger body size and reduced wing loading. Alleles also differed in starvation resistance and expression of insulin-like receptor, a transcriptional target of FOXO. Allelic reaction norms were mostly parallel, with few GxE interactions. Together, our results suggest that variation in IIS makes a major contribution to clinal life-history adaptation. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Growth and Recruitment of Nonnative Smallmouth Bass along the Upstream Edge of Its Riverine Distribution
VL  - 93
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-15
AB  - Nonnative species have been widely introduced, and once established, often exhibit secondary spread to new areas. For instance, after its initial introduction in the John Day River, Oregon, smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) has expanded upstream into headwater habitats. Recruitment is a key component of successful range expansion and has been highlighted as a potential bottleneck to continued expansion by smallmouth bass. We explored growth, body lengths, and survival of young-of-The-year (YOY) smallmouth bass in the North Fork John Day River to better understand the recruitment dynamics near its invasion boundary. In 2014-2015, we collected YOY across the upstream 63 km of smallmouth bass distribution at the end of the first growth season and after a winter starvation period. We found that growth, body length, and survival showed varied correspondence with patterns in water temperature. Specifically, body lengths matched temperature predictions in upstream sites (after accounting for spawning delays) where smallmouth bass density is low. By contrast, individuals achieved smaller than predicted body lengths in downstream sites where density is relatively high. Model selection revealed that temperature and age ≥ 1 density were the most important predictors of body length. Additionally, individuals predicted to be too small to survive a winter starvation period were present. Our findings reveal nuanced recruitment dynamics at the invasion boundary, where departures from temperature-based predictions point to multiple mechanisms affecting growth and survival. Understanding mechanisms operating at invasion boundaries may help develop management strategies to prevent future spread of smallmouth bass into headwater salmon habitat. © 2019 by the Northwest Scientific Association.

TI  - Staphylococcus aureus biofilm: Morphology, genetics, pathogenesis and treatment strategies
VL  - 18
IS  - 14
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a nosocomial bacterium causing different infectious diseases, rang-ing from skin and soft tissue infections to more serious and life-threatening infections such as sep-ticaemia. S. aureus forms a complex structure of extracellular polymeric biofilm that provides a fully secured and functional environment for the formation of microcolonies, their sustenance and recol-onization of sessile cells after its dispersal. Staphylococcus aureus biofilm protects the cells against hostile conditions, i.e., changes in temperature, limitations or deprivation of nutrients and dehydra-tion, and, more importantly, protects the cells against antibacterial drugs. Drugs are increasingly becoming partially or fully inactive against S. aureus as they are either less penetrable or totally impenetrable due to the presence of biofilms surrounding the bacterial cells. Other factors, such as evasion of innate host immune system, genome plasticity and adaptability through gene evolution and exchange of genetic material, also contribute to the ineffectiveness of antibacterial drugs. This increasing tolerance to antibiotics has contributed to the emergence and rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a serious problem that has resulted in increased morbidity and mortality of human and animal populations globally, in addition to causing huge financial losses to the global economy. The purpose of this review is to highlight different aspects of S. aureus biofilm formation and its overall architecture, individual biofilm constituents, clinical implications and role in pathogenesis and drug resistance. The review also discusses different techniques used in the qualitative and quantitative investigation of S. aureus biofilm and various strategies that can be employed to inhibit and eradicate S. aureus biofilm. © 2021 by the authors.

VL  - 281
SP  - 53-67
AB  - The biological changes caused by autotriploidy are poorly studied in animals. To investigate this issue in depth, we compared genetics, morphology, life history, ecology and behaviour of the triploid marbled crayfish and its diploid parent, slough crayfish Procambarus fallax. We performed a meta-analysis of our data and literature data. Our COI based molecular tree, consisting of 27 species of Cambaridae, confirmed the close taxonomic relationship between marbled crayfish and P. fallax. Comparison of both crayfish revealed similarities in mitochondrial gene sequences, morphological characters, colouration, body proportions and behaviours. Considerable differences were recorded with respect to chromosome number in somatic cells, haploid genome size, DNA methylation level, body size, fecundity, longevity, population size structure, invasiveness, and the range of inhabited biomes. These differences have dimensions that are otherwise only observed between species supporting earlier proposed raising of marbled crayfish from P. fallax forma virginalis to a new species named Procambarus virginalis. Particularly noteworthy is the enhancement of the fitness traits that probably resulted from evolutionary changes in gene expression. These alterations and the transition from sexual reproduction to parthenogenesis are likely responsible for the increased invasiveness of marbled crayfish in tropical to cold-temperate biomes.

VL  - 45

SP  - 363-371
AB  - Through basic studies of various resins, the most suitable resin was selected to improve the reflectivity and productivity in making white opaque polyethylene terephthalate film. Accordingly, oriented films were investigated through conventional blending experiments based on selected resin. First, the results showed that cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) and polyolefin elastomer (POE) were better than other materials (e.g., polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polylactic acid (PLA), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF)) in improving properties through optical, thermal, and surface investigations. To observe the compatibilizing effect, high density polyethylene grafted maleic anhydride (HDPE-g-MAH) blended with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and each selected resin as a compatibilizer. For the compatibilizing effect to reduce the size of the dispersed phase, 5 phr of HDPE-g-MAH was found as the most effective contents through mechanical and morphological studies. COC and POE were blended with PET at a ratio of 70:30, and the process of stretching was performed to identify the shape of the void that contributes to the improvement of the reflectance. Although POE showed better compatibilizing effect than COC through morphological, it was inferior to COC in the reflectance. Because POE was melted at PET film's stretching temperature, the void contributing reflectance was not formed. © 2021 The Polymer Society of Korea. All rights reserved.

SP  - 273-281
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the resistance to vibriosis, growth, survival and tolerance to stress of the selected prawn, second generation, compared to a non-selected control. The first generation of selected giant freshwater prawn, which has 10.4% higher of resistance, was used to attain disease resistant freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) generation through challenge test-based selection. Resistance test was conducted by infecting the prawn (mean body weight of 10.29 ± 1.40 g) with pathogenic Vibrio harveyi (5 × 105 cfu prawn−1). The growth and survival of the prawn were evaluated by rearing the two populations of prawn in both nursery and grow-out phases. Stress tolerance test was done by evaluating the viability of postlarvae exposed to environmental stressors, i.e. temperature, salinity, NH3 and formaldehide. Post-challenge survival of the selected prawn (55.0 ± 5.0%) was about 46% higher than that of the control (37.5 ± 7.5%). The survival of the selected prawn in nursery culture (77.16 ± 0.841%) was significantly higher (p &lt;.05) than that of the control (51.31 ± 2.938%), while the survival in grow-out culture was similar (p &gt;.05). The growth of selected prawn (4.99 ± 0.03% day−1) was significantly higher than that of the control (4.81 ± 0.05% day−1). There was no difference between treatments on the tolerance level against the tested environmental stressor. Overall data suggested that the selected prawn showed better performance in growth and resistance against vibriosis. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Intraspecific differences in the transcriptional stress response of two populations of Sydney rock oyster increase with rising temperatures
VL  - 589
SP  - 115-127
AB  - The vulnerability of sessile organisms to warming temperatures may depend on their capacity to adaptively alter their expression of genes associated with stress mitigation. We compared the transcriptional profile of 2 populations of Sydney rock oysters Saccostrea glomerata (one that had been selectively bred over 7 generations for fast growth and disease resistance and one wild type that had not been subjected to selection) following exposure to an artificial temperature gradient in the field. Oysters were attached to white, grey or black stone pavers that experienced mean maximum substrate temperatures of approximately 34, 37 and 40°C, respectively, at low tide. Across all pavers, selectively bred oysters suffered 12% higher mortality than wild-type oysters, although this difference was not significant. Expression profiles did not differ between oyster populations on the coolest (white) pavers. However, divergent transcriptional profiles of genes associated with the key intracellular stress mechanisms of antioxidant defence, heat shock response, energy metabolism and the cytoskeleton were detected in oysters on the hottest (black) pavers. Expression of these genes was upregulated at high temperatures by the selectively bred oysters but displayed little change, or was suppressed at high temperature among the non-selected wild-type oysters. One potential explanation is that the selectively bred oysters have traded off rapid growth for a lower thermal maximum. Complementary physiological and ecological studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. © Inter-Research 2018.

VL  - 28

AB  - Widespread species that exhibit both high gene flow and the capacity to occupy heterogeneous environments make excellent models for examining local selection processes along environmental gradients. Here we evaluate the influence of temperature and landscape variables on genetic connectivity and signatures of local adaptation in Phaulacridium vittatum, a widespread agricultural pest grasshopper, endemic to Australia. With sampling across a 900-km latitudinal gradient, we genotyped 185 P. vittatum from 19 sites at 11,408 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using ddRAD sequencing. Despite high gene flow across sites (pairwise FST = 0.0003–0.08), landscape genetic resistance modelling identified a positive nonlinear effect of mean annual temperature on genetic connectivity. Urban areas and water bodies had a greater influence on genetic distance among sites than pasture, agricultural areas and forest. Together, FST outlier tests and environmental association analysis (EAA) detected 242 unique SNPs under putative selection, with the highest numbers associated with latitude, mean annual temperature and body size. A combination of landscape genetic connectivity analysis together with EAA identified mean annual temperature as a key driver of both neutral gene flow and environmental selection processes. Gene annotation of putatively adaptive SNPs matched with gene functions for olfaction, metabolic detoxification and ultraviolet light shielding. Our results imply that this widespread agricultural pest has the potential to spread and adapt under shifting temperature regimes and land cover change. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Early ontogeny and sequence heterochronies in Leiuperinae frogs (Anura: Leptodactylidae)
VL  - 14
IS  - 6
AB  - The study of early development in Neotropical Leiuperinae frogs (Anura, Leptodactylidae) has been addressed by several works in recent times. However, a comparative developmental approach under a phylogenetic context was not available. Herein we analyzed the morphological and ontogenetic diversity of embryos belonging to 22 species of the three largest genera in Leiuperinae. We find that in most cases, variations fit with the phylogeny at the inter- and intrageneric levels. Embryo kyphosis and whitish color are synapomorphies for the clade grouping Physalaemus and Engystomops. The presence of a third lower tooth row on the oral disc is plesiomorphic for Leiuperinae, only changing in derived clades. The configurations and developmental trajectories of the lower lip are exceptionally diverse. The developmental sequences optimized on the phylogenetic tree recover an early differentiated first lower tooth row a synapomorphy of Pseudopaludicola and Physalaemus, and an early differentiated second row as synapomorphy of Pleurodema. On the other hand, few features are highly conserved in the subfamily, such as the adhesive glands universally present in a type-C configuration. Our results also suggest that the morphology and ontogeny of embryos is in some cases associated to the environment where they develop. A large body size, poorly developed transient respiratory structures, large yolk provision and delayed development of the digestive tract occur convergently in embryos inhabiting cold, oxygenated environments. Embryos that develop in warmer water bodies in xeric environments show more complex and persistent transient respiratory structures and an early onset of hind limbs development. Our survey highlights that morphology and early development of anurans can be a valuable source of information for phylogenetic studies, and provide fundamental bases to explore and discuss how evolutionary changes can be shaped by environmental conditions. © 2019 Grosso et al.

VL  - 29

AB  - Climate change may be disastrous for egg-laying species in which nest temperatures determine offspring sex. However, Ye, Ma, et al. find that impact may be reduced by the ability of embryos to thermoregulate: that is, to move within the egg to select specific thermal regimes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd Sessile organisms with thermally sensitive developmental trajectories are at high risk from climate change. For example, oviparous reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) may experience strong (potentially disastrous) shifts in offspring sex ratio if reproducing females are unable to predict incubation conditions at the time of oviposition. How then have TSD reptile taxa persisted over previous periods of extreme climatic conditions? An ability of embryos to move within the egg to select optimal thermal regimes could buffer ambient extremes, but the feasibility of behavioral thermoregulation by embryos has come under strong challenge. To test this idea, we measured thermal gradients within eggs in semi-natural nests of a freshwater turtle species with TSD, manipulated embryonic thermoregulatory ability, and modeled the effects of embryonic thermoregulation on offspring sex ratios. Behavioral thermoregulation by embryos accelerated development and influenced offspring sex ratio, expanding the range of ambient conditions under which nests produce equal numbers of male and female offspring. Model projections suggest that sex ratio shifts induced by global warming will be buffered by the ability of embryos to influence their sexual destiny via behavioral thermoregulation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 134
SP  - 76-84
AB  - Climate change is threating species’ persistence worldwide. To predict species responses to climate change we need information not just on their environmental tolerance but also on its adaptive potential. We tested how the foundation species of rocky littoral habitats, Fucus vesiculosus, responds to combined hyposalinity and warming projected to the Baltic Sea by 2070–2099. We quantified responses of replicated populations originating from the entrance, central, and marginal Baltic regions. Using replicated individuals, we tested for the presence of within-population tolerance variation. Future conditions hampered growth and survival of the central and marginal populations whereas the entrance populations fared well. Further, both the among- and within-population variation in responses to climate change indicated existence of genetic variation in tolerance. Such standing genetic variation provides the raw material necessary for adaptation to a changing environment, which may eventually ensure the persistence of the species in the inner Baltic Sea. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - A Comparison of Different Tournament Weigh-In Formats on the Short-Term Postrelease Behavior of Black Bass Assessed with Biologgers
VL  - 42
IS  - 2
SP  - 250-259
AB  - Black bass Micropterus spp. live-release tournaments are a popular activity in North America. Efforts continue to further increase survival and enhance welfare of fish released from competitive angling events. Recently, some tournaments have adopted a new weigh-in format in which black bass are weighed immediately (hanging from a scale in air) and released at the capture location. More conventional tournaments involve retaining black bass in a live well and delivering them to a central location to be weighed (wet or dry weigh-in). We used biologgers that measured swimming activity, depth selection, and water temperature selection to examine how different weigh-in formats alter postrelease behavior of Smallmouth Bass M. dolomieu and Largemouth Bass M. salmoides. All fish showed a significant decrease in swimming activity as time progressed during the 10-min monitoring period, regardless of the weigh-in format. Swimming activity remained elevated (i.e., hyperactivity) for a longer period of time for black bass that were retained in live wells compared to those that were subjected to the catch, weigh, and release weigh-in format and the control (fish that were caught and immediately released without air exposure). Swimming activity of black bass tended to decrease as they achieved greater depths with cooler water temperatures. For both species, the water temperature selected postrelease was influenced by the weigh-in format. Black bass that were dry weighed and wet weighed spent more time in warmer water temperatures than fish in the control group or fish that were caught, weighed, and released. This study suggests that to reduce behavioral alterations associated with wet or dry weigh-ins, tournament organizations need to carefully select the weigh-in location, allowing easy access to refuge (i.e., habitat complexity similar to that of the capture location) having the cooler water temperatures commonly associated with deeper water. These results also suggest that catch, weigh, and release formats could be beneficial for black bass during periods of the year with elevated water temperature. © 2022 American Fisheries Society.

TI  - Latitudinal and altitudinal variation in ecologically important traits in a widespread butterfly
VL  - 128
IS  - 3
SP  - 742-755
AB  - Understanding how organisms adapt to complex environments lies at the very heart of evolutionary biology and ecology, and is of particular concern in the current era of anthropogenic global change. Variation in ecologically important traits associated with environmental gradients is considered to be strong evidence for adaptive responses. Here, we study phenotypic variation along a latitudinal and an altitudinal cline in 968 field-collected males of the widespread European butterfly Pieris napi. In contrast to our expectations, body size decreased with increasing latitude and altitude, suggesting that warmer rather than cooler conditions may be more beneficial for individual development in this species. Higher altitudes but not latitudes seemed to be associated with increased flight performance, suggesting stronger challenges for flight activity in high-altitude environments (e.g. due to strong wind). Moreover, wing melanization increased while yellow reflectance decreased towards colder environments in both clines. Thus, increased melanization under thermally challenging conditions seems to compromise investment into a sexually selected trait, resulting in a trade-off. Our study, although exclusively based on field-collected males, revealed indications of adaptive patterns along geographical clines. It documents the usefulness of field-collected specimens, and the strength of comparing latitudinal and altitudinal clines to identify traits being potentially under thermal selection. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

TI  - Physiological, developmental, and behavioral plasticity in response to thermal acclimation
VL  - 97
AB  - Organisms with complex ecologies and life-cycle processes may shift physiologically (acclimation in tolerance), developmentally, and/or behaviorally (thermoregulation) in response to changes in climate. As such, climate change may trigger multiple, interacting phenotypic responses, which underscores the nuances of characterizing a species capacity to adapt and respond to climate change. In this study, we use a model frog species, Bufo gargarizans, to examine how three phenotypes, thermal tolerance limits (critical thermal minimum, CTmin and critical thermal maximum, CTmax), ontogeny, and behavioral preferences in temperature (Tpref) respond to different levels of thermal exposure (i.e., acclimation ranging from 10 °C to 30 °C). Acclimation temperature had little effect on Tpref of tadpoles, yet behaviorally they showed strong signs of thermal selection towards an optimum. Both CTmin and CTmax increased with acclimation temperature with an approximate 10% increase in tolerance limits per 1 °C increase in exposure. Development and body size both responded to acclimation temperature, both of which also influenced lower but not upper thermal limits. Our study highlights the idiosyncrasies of estimating climate vulnerability, where multiple phenotypes can respond to shifts in temperature—a complexity that is especially apparent in species with complex life-cycles. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Rapid sex-specific adaptation to high temperature in drosophila
VL  - 9
AB  - The pervasive occurrence of sexual dimorphism demonstrates different adaptive strategies of males and females. While different reproductive strategies of the two sexes are well-characterized, very little is known about differential functional requirements of males and females in their natural habitats. Here, we study the impact environmental change on the selection response in both sexes. Exposing replicated Drosophila populations to a novel temperature regime, we demonstrate sex-specific changes in gene expression, metabolic and behavioural phenotypes in less than 100 generations. This indicates not only different functional requirements of both sexes in the new environment but also rapid sex-specific adaptation. Supported by computer simulations we propose that altered sex-biased gene regulation from standing genetic variation, rather than new mutations, is the driver of rapid sex-specific adaptation. Our discovery of environmentally driven divergent functional requirements of males and females has important implications-possibly even for gender aware medical treatments. © Hsu et al.

VL  - 20
IS  - 2
AB  - Temperature affects almost all aspects of the fish life. To cope with low temperature, fish have evolved the ability of cold acclimation for survival. However, intracellular signaling events underlying cold acclimation in fish remain largely unknown. Here, the formation of cold acclimation in zebrafish embryonic fibroblasts (ZF4) is monitored and the phosphorylation events during the process are investigated through a large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomic approach. In total, 11 474 phosphorylation sites are identified on 4066 proteins and quantified 5772 phosphosites on 2519 proteins. Serine, threonine, and tyrosine (Ser/Thr/Tyr) phosphorylation accounted for 85.5%, 13.3%, and 1.2% of total phosphosites, respectively. Among all phosphosites, 702 phosphosites on 510 proteins show differential regulation during cold acclimation of ZF4 cells. These phosphosites are divided into six clusters according to their dynamic changes during cold exposure. Kinase–substrate prediction reveals that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) among the kinase groups is predominantly responsible for phosphorylation of these phosphosites. The differentially regulated phosphoproteins are functionally associated with various cellular processes such as regulation of actin cytoskeleton and MAPK signaling pathway. These data enrich the database of protein phosphorylation sites in zebrafish and provide key clues for the elucidation of intracellular signaling networks during cold acclimation of fish. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

TI  - Selective sweeps and polygenic adaptation drive local adaptation along moisture and temperature gradients in natural populations of coast redwood and giant sequoia
VL  - 12
IS  - 11
AB  - Dissecting the genomic basis of local adaptation is a major goal in evolutionary biology and conservation science. Rapid changes in the climate pose significant challenges to the survival of natural populations, and the genomic basis of long-generation plant species is still poorly understood. Here, we investigated genome-wide climate adaptation in giant sequoia and coast redwood, two iconic and ecologically important tree species. We used a combination of univariate and multivariate genotype–environment association methods and a selective sweep analysis using non-overlapping sliding windows. We identified genomic regions of potential adaptive importance, showing strong associations to moisture variables and mean annual temperature. Our results found a complex architecture of climate adaptation in the species, with genomic regions showing signatures of selective sweeps, polygenic adaptation, or a combination of both, suggesting recent or ongoing climate adaptation along moisture and temperature gradients in giant sequoia and coast redwood. The results of this study provide a first step toward identifying genomic regions of adaptive significance in the species and will provide information to guide management and conservation strategies that seek to maximize adaptive potential in the face of climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Optimal extraction of Ocimum basilicum essential oil by association of ultrasound and hydrodistillation and its potential as a biopesticide against a major stored grains pest
VL  - 25
IS  - 12
AB  - The essential oil of basil (Ocimum basilicum) has significant biological activity against insect pests and can be extracted through various techniques. This work aimed to optimize and validate the extraction process of the essential oil of O. basilicum submitted to different drying temperatures of the leaves and extracted by the combination of a Clevenger method and ultrasound. The biological activity of the extracted oil under different conditions was evaluated for potential control of Sitophilus zeamais. The extraction method was optimized according to the sonication time by ultrasound (0, 8, 19, 31 and 38 min) and hydrodistillation (20, 30, 45, 60 and 70 min) and drying temperature (20, 30, 45, 60 and 70 °C). The bioactivity of the essential oil was assessed against adults of S. zeamais and the effects of each variable and its interactions on the mortality of the insects were evaluated. The best yield of essential oil was obtained with the longest sonication and hydrodistillation times and the lowest drying temperature of leaves. Higher toxicity of the essential oil against S. zeamais was obtained by the use of ultrasound for its extraction. The identification and the relative percentage of the compounds of the essential oil were performed with a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass selective detector. The performance of the method was assessed by studying selectivity, linearity, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), precision and accuracy. The LOD and LOQ values for linalool were 2.19 and 6.62 μg mL-1 and for estragole 2.001 and 6.063 μg mL-1, respectively. The coefficients of determination (R2) were &gt;0.99. The average recoveries ranged between 71 and 106%, with coefficient of variation ≤6.4%. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Life-history trade-offs and limitations associated with phenotypic adaptation under future ocean warming and elevated salinity
VL  - 374
IS  - 1768
AB  - Little is known about the life-history trade-offs and limitations, and the physiological mechanisms that are associated with phenotypic adaptation to future ocean conditions. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the within-and trans-generation life-history responses and aerobic capacity of a marine polychaete, Ophryotrocha labronica, to elevated temperature and elevated temperature combined with elevated salinity for its entire lifespan. In addition, transplants between treatments were carried out at both the egg mass and juvenile stage to identify the potential influence of developmental effects. Within-generation, life-history trade-offs caused by the timing of transplant were only detected under elevated temperature combined with elevated salinity conditions. Polychaetes transplanted at the egg mass stage grew slower and had lower activities of energy metabolism enzymes but reached a larger maximum body size and lived longer when compared with those transplanted as juveniles. Trans-generation exposure to both elevated temperature and elevated temperature and salinity conditions restored 20 and 21% of lifespan fecundity, respectively. Trans-generation exposure to elevated temperature conditions also resulted in a trade-off between juvenile growth rates and lifespan fecundity, with slower growers showing greater fecundity. Overall, our results suggest that future ocean conditions may select for slower growers. Furthermore, our results indicate that life-history trade-offs and limitations will be more prevalent with the shift of multiple global change drivers, and thus there will be greater constraints on adaptive potential. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of plasticity in phenotypic adaptation to rapid environmental change'.

VL  - 87
AB  - Preferential temperature as a physiological feature is crucial for spiders, since it determines the selection of key habitats for their survival and reproduction. In this work, we study the daily and geographical variation of the preferential temperature of the spider Sicarius thomisoides subjected to different degrees of daily thermal oscillation in their habitats. Preferred temperatures differ between coastal and inland populations, but in both cases, there is a marked bimodality in the daily pattern of temperature preference, with two peaks per day that would be given by the changes in the hours of activity. These nocturnal spiders select higher temperatures in the evening (active period) and select lower temperatures during late morning (resting period). In laboratory, spiders have preferred temperatures that differ from those found in their habitats, so they must tolerate or compensate non-preferred temperatures by active thermoregulation in natural conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 188
IS  - 2
SP  - 271-282
AB  - For ectotherms, temperature modifies the rate of physiological function across a temperature tolerance window depending on thermal history, ontogeny, and evolutionary history. Some adult Antarctic fishes, with comparatively narrow thermal windows, exhibit thermal plasticity in standard metabolic rate; however, little is known about the shape or breadth of thermal performance curves of earlier life stages of Antarctic fishes. We tested the effects of acute warming (− 1 to 8 °C) and temperature acclimation (2 weeks at − 1, 2, 4 °C) on survival and standard metabolic rate in early embryos of the dragonfish Gymnodraco acuticeps from McMurdo Sound, Ross Island, Antarctica. Contrary to predictions, embryos acclimated to warmer temperatures did not experience greater mortality and nearly all embryos survived acute warming to 8 °C. Metabolic performance curve height and shape were both significantly altered after 2 weeks of development at − 1 °C, with further increase in curve height, but not alteration of shape, with warm temperature acclimation. Overall metabolic rate temperature sensitivity (Q10) from − 1 to 8 °C varied from 2.6 to 3.6, with the greatest thermal sensitivity exhibited by embryos at earlier developmental stages. Interclutch variation in metabolic rates, mass, and development of simultaneously collected embryos was also documented. Taken together, metabolic performance curves provide insight into the costs of early development under warming temperatures, with the potential for thermal sensitivity to be modified by dragonfish phenology and magnitude of seasonal changes in temperature. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

TI  - Evaluation of some non-invasive approaches for the detection of red palm weevil infestation
VL  - 27
IS  - 1
SP  - 401-406
AB  - Red palm weevil (RPW) causes severe damage to date palm trees, leading to the death of trees if not detected and treated in time. A major obstacle in RPW control is the difficulty in identifying an early stage infestation In the present study, we measured the efficacy of some non-invasive optical devices including cameras (digital camera and thermal camera), TreeRadarUnit (TM) (TRU) (Radar 2000, Radar 900), resistograph, magnetic DNA biosensor, and Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to detect RPW infestation in date palm trees under field conditions at Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Date palm trees used in these experiments were selected based on visual observations. After inspection of date palm trees with different devices to detect RPW infestation, each tree was taken down and dissected in detail to validate the accuracy of each device. Results indicated that the visual RPW detection approach presented the highest accuracy (87%) followed by Radar 2000 (77%), Radar 900 (73%), resistograph (73%), thermal camera (61%), and digital camera (52%). Moreover, different stages of RPW placed in plastic cups were fastened onto the healthy date palm trunks to judge RPW presence, the magnetic DNA biosensor correctly detected RPW eggs 75% of the time, followed by detection of larvae (64%) and the control (empty cup) (54%). In another experiment where determinations were made in an open area, the efficiency of the DNA biosensor for detecting adults was 100%, followed by 83%, 63%, 60%, and 39% for pupae, larvae, eggs, and control, respectively. Absorption spectra generated through NIRS for infested, wounded, and control samples of date palm tissue showed a remarkable variation in the gradient of the corresponding peaks between 1850 nm and 1950 nm. Based on the detection efficiency of the tested devices, the resistograph and NIRS have the best potential to detect RPW infestation in date palm trees. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Chromosomal inversions promote genomic islands of concerted evolution of Hsp70 genes in the Drosophila subobscura species subgroup
VL  - 28
IS  - 6
SP  - 1316-1332
AB  - Heat-shock (HS) assays to understand the connection between standing inversion variation and evolutionary response to climate change in Drosophila subobscura found that “warm-climate” inversion O 3+4 exhibits non-HS levels of Hsp70 protein like those of “cold-climate” O ST after HS induction. This was unexpected, as overexpression of Hsp70 can incur multiple fitness costs. To understand the genetic basis of this finding, we have determined the genomic sequence organization of the Hsp70 family in four different inversions, including O ST , O 3+4 , O 3+4+8 and O 3+4+16 , using as outgroups the remainder of the subobscura species subgroup, namely Drosophila madeirensis and Drosophila guanche. We found (i) in all the assayed lines, the Hsp70 family resides in cytological locus 94A and consists of only two genes, each with four HS elements (HSEs) and three GAGA sites on its promoter. Yet, in O ST , the family is comparatively more compact; (ii) the two Hsp70 copies evolve in concert through gene conversion, except in D. guanche; (iii) within D. subobscura, the rate of concerted evolution is strongly structured by inversion, being higher in O ST than in O 3+4 ; and (iv) in D. guanche, the two copies accumulated multiple differences, including a newly evolved “gap-type” HSE2. The absence of concerted evolution in this species may be related to a long-gone-unnoticed observation that it lacks Hsp70 HS response, perhaps because it has evolved within a narrow thermal range in an oceanic island. Our results point to a previously unrealized link between inversions and concerted evolution, with potentially major implications for understanding genome evolution. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Monitoring of adaptive potential by functional loads and feeding regime of sturgeon juveniles
VL  - 175
AB  - The article presents the results of research on the physiological and biochemical state of sturgeon juveniles using various functional loads at the early stages of post-embryonic development of sturgeon raised on an experimental diet in the presence of live food. The article analyzes the effectiveness of the application of functional load methods and feeding regimen to establish the physiological status of released juveniles to replenish natural populations. The article provides information about the stability of young sturgeon fish during the period of release from sturgeon hatcheries to replenish the natural population, further entry from fresh to sea water, and placement in places of natural feeding. The temperature and salinity of water for hydrobionts is a factor that has an integral effect on the activity of functionally important systems of the body at all stages of the life cycle. Juveniles obtained from artificial generations and grown in a combined way on various feeds retain high plasticity, adequate nutrition forms an osmoregulatory function and resistance to temperature conditions of the environment. It is proved experimentally that the feeding regime is an important factor affecting the fish-breeding and biological and physiological and biochemical parameters of young Russian sturgeon, stellate sturgeon and bester. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.

TI  - Thermobiological effects of temperature-induced color variations in Aglais urticae (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae)
VL  - 12
IS  - 6
AB  - Coloration of animals is important for camouflage, for social behavior, or for physiological fitness. This study investigates the color variation in adults of Aglais urticae obtained on subjecting some pre-imaginal stages to different temperature conditions and their thermobiological consequences. To investigate the evolutionary–ecological interactions of temperature and pigmentation in butterflies, caterpillars, and pupae of the small tortoiseshell, Aglais urticae (Lepidoptera, Nymphalidae), larvae from Central Europe and Scandinavia were reared at temperatures between 7 and 34°C in the laboratory or in the field. After emergence, the intensity of pigmentation of the imagines and their increase in body temperature under defined full-spectrum light irradiation were quantified by image analysis and thermal imaging. At constant conditions, ambient rearing temperature and pigmentation intensity of imagines were negatively and linearly correlated in Central European butterflies, regardless of whether the pupal stage alone or, additionally, the last period of the larval stage was exposed to these conditions: low temperatures induced darker coloration and high temperatures led to lighter individuals. A thermal pulse of a few days alone at the beginning of pupal dormancy led to a similar, albeit weakened, effect. Caterpillars of the Scandinavian subspecies A. urticae polaris, whose pupal dormancy took place under Central European field conditions, developed into strongly pigmented imagines. The thermobiological relevance of more intense pigmentation was shown by significantly higher absorption of light, and thus stronger increased body temperature after 5 min of defined illumination, but this difference ceased after 15 min. Our results show that phenotypic plasticity in wing coloration is adaptive since temperature-induced developmental changes provide thermobiological benefit in adult butterflies. We propose that, in subpolar latitudes, darker coloration likely has a selection advantage favoring individuals with reaction norms gradually shifted to stronger pigmented phenotypes, possibly leading to the establishment of a pigmentation cline. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Narrow thermal tolerance and low dispersal drive higher speciation in tropical mountains
VL  - 115
IS  - 49
SP  - 12471-12476
AB  - Species richness is greatest in the tropics, and much of this diversity is concentrated in mountains. Janzen proposed that reduced seasonal temperature variation selects for narrower thermal tolerances and limited dispersal along tropical elevation gradients [Janzen DH (1967) Am Nat 101:233–249]. These locally adapted traits should, in turn, promote reproductive isolation and higher speciation rates in tropical mountains compared with temperate ones. Here, we show that tropical and temperate montane stream insects have diverged in thermal tolerance and dispersal capacity, two key traits that are drivers of isolation in montane populations. Tropical species in each of three insect clades have markedly narrower thermal tolerances and lower dispersal than temperate species, resulting in significantly greater population divergence, higher cryptic diversity, higher tropical speciation rates, and greater accumulation of species over time. Our study also indicates that tropical montane species, with narrower thermal tolerance and reduced dispersal ability, will be especially vulnerable to rapid climate change. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Increasing temperatures over an 18-year period shortens growing season length in a beech (Fagus sylvatica L.)-dominated forest
VL  - 76
IS  - 3
AB  - Key message: Using long-term measurements in a mature beech (Fagus sylvatica L.)-dominated forest located in east Belgium, this paper showed that spring and autumn temperature increases during the last two decades led to an earlier end and a shortening of the growing season. These phenological shifts impact negatively but not significantly the forest annual net ecosystem productivity. Context: The mechanisms controlling temperate forest phenology are not fully understood nor are the impacts of climate change and the consequences for forest productivity. Aims: The aim of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of how temperate forest phenology and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) interplay and respond to temperature and its evolution. Methods: Indicators of leaf phenology and productivity dynamics at the start and the end of the growing season, as well as combinations of these indicators (length of the growing season), were derived from a long-term (1997–2014) dataset of eddy covariance and light transmission measurements taken over a mature beech-dominated temperate forest. Results: The start and the end of the growing season were correlated to spring (and autumn, for the end) temperatures. Despite no trends in annual average temperatures being detected during the observation period, April and November temperatures significantly increased. As a result, an earlier but slower start and an earlier end, inducing a shorter length of the growing season, were observed over the studied period. The first shift positively impacts the mixed forest NEP but is mainly related to the presence of conifers in the subplot. The earlier end of the growing season, more related to beech phenology, negatively impacts the forest NEP. Overall, these two effects partially compensate each other, leading to a non-significant impact on NEP. Conclusion: Increasing temperatures over the 18-year studied period shortened the growing season length, without affecting significantly the mixed forest NEP. However, as beeches are only affected by the earlier end of the growing season, this suggests a phenologically driven beech productivity reduction in the forest. © 2019, INRA and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Experimental evidence of gradual size-dependent shifts in body size and growth of fish in response to warming
VL  - 25
IS  - 7
SP  - 2285-2295
AB  - A challenge facing ecologists trying to predict responses to climate change is the few recent analogous conditions to use for comparison. For example, negative relationships between ectotherm body size and temperature are common both across natural thermal gradients and in small-scale experiments. However, it is unknown if short-term body size responses are representative of long-term responses. Moreover, to understand population responses to warming, we must recognize that individual responses to temperature may vary over ontogeny. To enable predictions of how climate warming may affect natural populations, we therefore ask how body size and growth may shift in response to increased temperature over life history, and whether short- and long-term growth responses differ. We addressed these questions using a unique setup with multidecadal artificial heating of an enclosed coastal bay in the Baltic Sea and an adjacent reference area (both with unexploited populations), using before-after control-impact paired time-series analyses. We assembled individual growth trajectories of ~13,000 unique individuals of Eurasian perch and found that body growth increased substantially after warming, but the extent depended on body size: Only among small-bodied perch did growth increase with temperature. Moreover, the strength of this response gradually increased over the 24 year warming period. Our study offers a unique example of how warming can affect fish populations over multiple generations, resulting in gradual changes in body growth, varying as organisms develop. Although increased juvenile growth rates are in line with predictions of the temperature–size rule, the fact that a larger body size at age was maintained over life history contrasts to that same rule. Because the artificially heated area is a contemporary system mimicking a warmer sea, our findings can aid predictions of fish responses to further warming, taking into account that growth responses may vary both over an individual's life history and over time. © 2019 The Authors.

AB  - With the increase of world population, the availability of food to all inhabitants on globe is one of the significant challenges. These challenges need to be addressed by adopting innovative options to improve the soil capacity and the safety of environmental resources. The availability of real-time vital parameters related to farming such as moisture, temperature, weather, crops diseases and water management as well as predictive actions against the changes in parameters can provide great help to deal with these challenges. Internet of Things (IoT) is an evolving technology, has great potential to play and prevail its miraculous role in almost every field. IoT is a network of things that are capable of self-configuring network. The development of intelligent IoT based Smart farming is day by day getting its space in developed countries. It facilitates towards precision agriculture and turning the face of agriculture production. Subsequently, it is reducing spoilage of resources such as water, fertilizers, operating cost. The availability and development of cost effective smart miniaturized sensors, processors and communication technologies has made IoT based smart farming feasible. This paper aims to review most recent papers from year 2015 to 2020 in IoT based farming domain. The recent work is highlighted in terms of their scope, methodology and summarised in a table followed by discussion and analysis. The intention is to provide a platform for the future researchers to get a start towards a system with a single standard expert and complete autonomous assistive system. © 2020 by the author(s).

TI  - Heating, identification, and determination of pesticides residues in black bean samples
VL  - 80
SP  - 337-342
AB  - The advantages associated with pesticide application in increasing agricultural productivity must be weighed against the possible danger to health and the environment. Above all, the application of these agents must be in accordance with good agricultural practice. The presence of pesticide residues above acceptable daily intake values and maximum residue limits is of concern from a food safety point of view. The removal of food residues by processing may be affected by the nature of the food, type of active ingredient and specificity of the processing applied. Chronic organophosphate contamination can affect the renal, reproductive, respiratory and nervous systems. The present work aimed to identify and determine the residues of ten organophosphates (chlorpyrifos, etione, malathion, methamidophos, parathion-methyl, phenthoate, phorate, pirimiphos-methyl, terbuphos, pyrazophos, and triazophos) added to common bean samples (Phaseolus vulgaris) and to observe the effect of heat treatment on these analytes. The QuEChERS method (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Robust and Safe) was used for the extraction of multiple waste before and after heating. Gas chromatography coupled to the thermionic flame detector (FTD) was used to identify and determine the analytes. Moreover, in this study, the methodology was also validated by determining the ten organophosphates previously mentioned, and metamidophos by studies of selectivity, linearity, intermediate precision, detection limit, quantification limit and precision study by addition and recovery. According to the results obtained in the work, it was possible to notice that, under the conditions in which the experiments were conducted, the organophosphates were thermosensitive. The temperature and cooking time used were lower than traditional beans dishes. The method was selective for all analytes, as there was no interference greater than 30% of the quantification limit. The limits of detection were between 1.60 and 52.96 ng.kg-1 and the limits of quantification were between 3.30 and 176.0 ng.kg-1. Regarding intermediate precision, the differences in area values were ≤ 15 % at different concentrations except for phorate. The correlation coefficients (r) of the linearity curves were greater than 0.99 for all active ingredients within the applied working range. The recovery percentage was between 70 and 120 %, except phorate. Thus, the methodology was satisfactory for the identification and determination of nine of the eleven organophosphates analyzed in beans. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.

VL  - 35

AB  - Background and objective: Hypothermia is a common problem especially in preterm neonates and has been associated with increased neonatal mortality and morbidities. The objective of our study was to look into the distribution of admission temperature among VLBW neonates getting admitted to the NICU, association of admission temperatures to selected neonatal morbidities/mortality, and to evaluate for modifiable factors contributing to hypothermia. Methods: Infants with birth weight between 500 and 1499 g and gestation ≥ 25 weeks without major congenital malformations delivered between October 2017 and March 2020 who were admitted directly from the delivery room to the NICU were included in the study. Data were collected prospectively on perinatal/birth characteristics to look for their association with admission hypothermia, and to look into the association of admission temperature with selected neonatal morbidities/mortality. Results: There were a total of 538 neonates with the mean birth weight of 1206 ± 271 g included in the study. Mean admission temperature was 35.8 ± 1.3 °C. Low delivery room temperature was the most important contributor to admission hypothermia. Also, 3.3% of neonates were hyperthermic at admission to NICU, all of them having been delivered to mothers with intrapartum pyrexia. On adjusted analysis, we found that low admission temperature significantly increased therisk of adverse composite neonatal outcomes with admission temperature < 34.5 °C having 42% increased risk of the adverse outcome when compared to normothermic neonates. Conclusion: Admission hypothermia remains a common problem in preterm neonates which is significantly associated with adverse neonatal outcome. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - An experimental study on the thermal and energy performance of self-sustaining green roofs under severe drought conditions in summer
VL  - 261
AB  - Self-sustaining green roofs can considerably reduce the building cooling demand in summer. In recent decades, extreme weather events including heatwaves and drought have increased, while there is a lack of knowledge of the dynamic thermal performance of green roofs during a severe drought. The present study is based on in-situ measurements of a room with a self-sustaining green roof and a reference room with a bare roof. The temporal evolution of the thermal performance of the green roof during a severe drought is investigated. Long-term observations for several years showed that Sedum lineare on the green roof survived in summers, except for a period during the severe drought. Although extreme drought weather led to extensive mortality, plants revived in the next year. The status of the green roof during the drought period could be divided into three phases: (I) normal, (II) substrates dried, and (III) plants withered and substrate dried. The respective contributions of live plants and substrates are quantified based on the results from these phases. In phase I, the average heat transfer into the indoor space through the green roof was 81% less than that of the reference bare roof. In phase II, the plants and the substrate dried out gradually, and the average heat transfer through the green roof was 69% less. In phase III, the dry substrate without live plants acts as a normal thermal insulation layer, and the average heat transfer through the green roof was still 40% less than that of the reference bare roof. In those three phases, the equivalent overall heat transfer coefficient of the green roof was 0.26, 0.49, and 0.88 W/(m2K), respectively. It suggests that the use of drought-tolerant plant species and substrate with a low thermal conductivity could improve the thermal performance of green roofs during a severe drought.

VL  - 126
IS  - 6
AB  - The hardness of zirconium oxide-based ceramic nanocomposites was correlated with the laser spectroscopic studies by analyzing the samples through nanosecond and femtosecond laser to see the viability of this technique as a fast and in situ for assessment of mechanical properties in nuclear industry. Zirconia incorporated with different vol% of multiwall carbon nanotubes were processed by the high frequency induction heated sintering. The composites were characterized by the nanosecond laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) with optimized delay time of 1, 2, and 3 µs and 200 and 300 mJ energies generated by laser Nd:YAG (λ = 1064 nm). The plasma temperature resulted by the ablation of different samples was estimated through intensity of selected zirconium lines using the Boltzmann plot method. The samples were mechanically characterized by the Vickers hardness test. The estimated plasma temperature and the ratio of Zr(II) with different intensities of Zr(I) emission lines show rather weak dependency and increase with surface hardness. The samples were scrutinized by the femtosecond laser micromachining through variation in depth and surface morphology of machined areas. It is found that deeper circular groove and enhanced erosion of disk shape by femtosecond laser machining are achieved for less hard materials and are in agreement with the LIBS analysis. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Impact of heat stress on the fitness outcomes of symbiotic infection in aphids: a meta-analysis
VL  - 289
IS  - 1971
AB  - Beneficial microorganisms shape the evolutionary trajectories of their hosts, facilitating or constraining the colonization of new ecological niches. One convincing example entails the responses of insect-microbe associations to rising temperatures. Indeed, insect resilience to stressful high temperatures depends on the genetic identity of the obligate symbiont and the presence of heat-protective facultative symbionts. As extensively studied organisms, aphids and their endosymbiotic bacteria represent valuable models to address eco-evolutionary questions about the thermal ecology of insect-microbe partnerships, with broad relevance to various biological systems and insect models. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the context-dependent impacts of symbionts on host phenotype in benign or stressful heat conditions, across fitness traits, types of heat stress and symbiont species. We found that warming lowered the benefits (resistance to parasitoids) and costs (development, fecundity) of infection by facultative symbionts, which was overall mostly beneficial to the hosts under short-term heat stress (heat shock) rather than extended warming. Heat-tolerant genotypes of the obligate symbiont Buchnera aphidicola and some facultative symbionts (Rickettsia sp., Serratia symbiotica) improved or maintained aphid fitness under heat stress. We discuss the implications of these findings for the general understanding of the cost-benefit balance of insect-microbe associations across multiple traits and their eco-evolutionary dynamics faced with climate change. © 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Of telomeres and temperature: Measuring thermal effects on telomeres in ectothermic animals
AB  - Ectotherms are classic models for understanding life-history tradeoffs, including the reproduction–somatic maintenance tradeoffs that may be reflected in telomere length and their dynamics. Importantly, life-history traits of ectotherms are tightly linked to their thermal environment, with diverse or synergistic mechanistic explanations underpinning the variation. Telomere dynamics potentially provide a mechanistic link that can be used to monitor thermal effects on individuals in response to climatic perturbations. Growth rate, age and developmental stage are all affected by temperature, which interacts with telomere dynamics in complex and intriguing ways. The physiological processes underpinning telomere dynamics can be visualized and understood using thermal performance curves (TPCs). TPCs reflect the evolutionary history and the thermal environment during an individual's ontogeny. Telomere maintenance should be enhanced at or near the thermal performance optimum of a species, population and individual. The thermal sensitivity of telomere dynamics should reflect the interacting TPCs of the processes underlying them. The key processes directly underpinning telomere dynamics are mitochondrial function (reactive oxygen production), antioxidant activity, telomerase activity and telomere endcap protein status. We argue that identifying TPCs for these processes will significantly help design robust, repeatable experiments and field studies of telomere dynamics in ectotherms. Conceptually, TPCs are a valuable framework to predict and interpret taxon- and population-specific telomere dynamics across thermal regimes. The literature of thermal effects on telomeres in ectotherms is sparse and mostly limited to vertebrates, but our conclusions and recommendations are relevant across ectothermic animals. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Developmental plasticity in reptiles: Insights from temperature-dependent gene expression in wall lizard embryos
VL  - 329
IS  - 6
SP  - 351-361
AB  - Many features of the development of reptiles are affected by temperature, but very little is known about how incubation temperature affects gene expression. Here, we provide a detailed case study of gene expression profiles in common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) embryos developing at stressfully low (15°C) versus benign (24°C) temperature. For maximum comparability between the two temperature regimes, we selected a precise developmental stage early in embryogenesis defined by the number of somites. We used a split-clutch design and lizards from four different populations to evaluate the robustness of temperature-responsive gene expression profiles. Embryos incubated at stressfully low incubation temperature expressed on average 20% less total RNA than those incubated at benign temperatures, presumably reflecting lower rates of transcription at cool temperature. After normalizing for differences in total amounts of input RNA, we find that approximately 50% of all transcripts show significant expression differences between the two incubation temperatures. Transcripts with the most extreme changes in expression profiles are associated with transcriptional and translational regulation and chromatin remodeling, suggesting possible epigenetic mechanisms underlying acclimation of early embryos to cool temperature. We discuss our findings in light of current advances in the use of transcriptomic data to study how individuals acclimatize and populations adapt to thermal stress. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

VL  - 24
IS  - 3
SP  - 459-476
AB  - The classical DICE model is a widely accepted integrated assessment model for the joint modeling of economic and climate systems, where all model state variables evolve over time deterministically. We reformulate and solve the DICE model as an optimal control dynamic programming problem with six state variables (related to the carbon concentration, temperature, and economic capital) evolving over time deterministically and affected by two controls (carbon emission mitigation rate and consumption). We then extend the model by adding a discrete stochastic shock variable to model the economy in the stressed and normal regimes as a jump process caused by events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These shocks reduce the world gross output leading to a reduction in both the world net output and carbon emission. The extended model is solved under several scenarios as an optimal stochastic control problem, assuming that the shock events occur randomly on average once every 100 years and last for 5 years. The results show that, if the world gross output recovers in full after each event, the impact of the COVID-19 events on the temperature and carbon concentration will be immaterial even in the case of a conservative 10% drop in the annual gross output over a 5-year period. The impact becomes noticeable, although still extremely small (long-term temperature drops by 0. 1 ∘C), in a presence of persistent shocks of a 5% output drop propagating to the subsequent time periods through the recursively reduced productivity. If the deterministic DICE model policy is applied in a presence of stochastic shocks (i.e., when this policy is suboptimal), then the drop in temperature is larger (approximately 0. 25 ∘C), that is, the lower economic activities owing to shocks imply that more ambitious mitigation targets are now feasible at lower costs. © 2021, Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies.

VL  - 9
AB  - Populations are permanently evolving and their evolution will influence their survival and reproduction, which will then alter demographic parameters. Several phenotypic, life history and environmental variables are known to be related to fitness measures. The goal of this article was to look into the possible types of those relationships in insects of the subfamily Triatominae, vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. After an exhaustive literature review of 7,207 records of publications referring exclusively to all possible features of the triatomines, using 15 keywords those records were reduced to 2,968 publications, that were analyzed individually; after deleting those publications that did not have the data in quantitative form as needed for the objective of this article, I found that 171 papers were adequate for the present analysis. From them I compiled a dataset of 11 variables and 90 cases from 36 triatomine species. Those variables included four environmental, two life cycle, and four morphological variables, and one demographic parameter: a fitness measure (the population intrinsic rate of natural increase, r0), used as dependent variable. However, the relationship between T. cruzi and its vector host was not included in this analysis despite triatomine-T. cruzi interactions constitute an important factor in the evolution of triatomine’s life history. I resorted to the Random Forest method as a machine learning approach for the analysis of this dataset, and found that –in addition to the triatomine species themselves– only the two life cycle variables (mean development time from egg to adult, and mean fecundity, expressed as the average number of female eggs laid per female per day) were statistically significant in determining fitness (r0). The machine learning approach used in the analysis provided a similar but deeper insight into these relationships than classical regression. Except for an analysis on senescence, this is the first study in triatomines addressing these questions. These results will be useful for other theoretical optimization approaches (frequency-dependence, density-dependence, evolutionary game theory, and adaptive dynamics), thus contributing to the theoretical framework for interpreting the succession of stages in insect adaptations, a framework yet to be constructed. © Copyright © 2021 Rabinovich.

TI  - Investigation of lamb fat quality attributes during deodorization
VL  - 16
IS  - 10
AB  - Edible lamb fat is an illustrious frying fat due to its good flavor and stability to oxidation. Fat deodorization is a vacuum-steam distillation process that is accomplished for removing the unwanted components such as free fatty acids and volatile compounds. The present work has studied the kinetics of lamb fat deodorization under different temperatures in a batch deodorization system. Variations of acid value (AV), peroxide value, p-Anisidine value, TOTOX value and total color difference were measured during the deodorization process. The Logarithmic, Wang and Singh, Hénon et al., and linear models were fitted with obtained data using nonlinear regression method. Results indicated that the Logarithmic and Henon et al. models gave the best fitness respectively with AV and p-Anisidine value, based on the statistical criteria of correlation coefficient (R2), reduced chi-square (χ2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Furthermore, the linear model was selected as the best model to describe the variations of TOTOX value and peroxide value during the deodorization process. © 2020 De Gruyter. All rights reserved.

VL  - 78
SP  - 730-740
AB  - This work evaluates several co-composting scenarios based on the use of Arundo donax biomass (AD) as bulking agent for the co-composting of sewage sludge (MS) and agri-food sludge (AS), to manage these organic wastes and to produce balanced organic fertilizers by optimizing the process. For this, six piles were prepared in commercial composting conditions, using AD in a range of 40%–80% (on a dry weight basis). Physico-chemical and chemical parameters and the thermal behaviour were evaluated during the process, as were the physical and chemical parameters of the final composts. The proportion of AD in the mixtures has a significant effect on the development of the thermophilic stage of composting, showing the piles with higher proportion of AD a quicker organic matter degradation. In addition, the evolution of the thermal indices R1 and R2 was different depending on the origin of the sludge used, indicating an increase in the relative concentration of more recalcitrant materials in the piles prepared with AS. The estimation of the global warming potential showed that the use of higher proportion of AD in the composting mixture may be a strategy to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases during the composting process. Moreover, the end-products obtained had an additional marketable value, with a balanced nutrient content and a good degree of maturity, which indicates the viability of the composting process as a method for the stabilization of these organic wastes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Effects of environmental temperature on the growth performance of a tropical Oreochromis esculentus (Graham, 1928). Implications for the species conservation
VL  - 60

SP  - 581-590
AB  - Climate variability and change are currently recognised global challenges. However, the impacts of rising temperatures may be greatest on tropical freshwater fish, which already exist in warm environments and may be living close to their critical thermal maximum. However, there is limited species-specific information on tropical species’ adaptive capacity to increased temperature. This study examined various growth attributes in juvenile populations (farmed, L. Kacheera and L. Nabisojjo) of a critically endangered tropical Oreochromis esculentus to determine its adaptive potential. Fish were acclimated at 25, 28, 31 and 34°C for 28 days. Overall, survival rates were high. Growth coefficient b was not significantly different from three (b = 3) in all treatments, implying isometric growth. The specific growth rates (SGRs), body condition K, and hepato-somatic indices (his) declined as the acclimation temperatures increased. Although SGR showed significant variations only among populations, the highest in L. Nabisojjo, K and HSI showed significant variations among treatments. Overall, the growth attributes declined at higher acclimation temperatures, but remained within acceptable ranges, implying that the species may attain normal growth at elevated temperatures experienced in outdoor aquaculture systems, despite its warm environmental background. Hence, we recommend selective breeding for temperature resilience and species introduction into aquaculture using broodstock from L. Nabisojjo. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Food quality mediates responses of Daphnia magna life history traits and heat tolerance to elevated temperature
VL  - 67
IS  - 9
SP  - 1521-1531
AB  - Surface waters are warming due to climate change, potentially pushing aquatic organisms closer to their thermal tolerance limits. However, cyanobacterial blooms are expected to occur more often with rising temperature, increasing the likelihood of poor-quality food available for herbivorous zooplankton. Zooplankton can adapt locally by genetic differentiation or via adaptive phenotypic plasticity to increasing temperatures, but there is limited knowledge on how these processes may be affected by food quality limitation imposed by cyanobacteria. To test the effects of cyanobacteria-mediated food quality on local temperature adaptation, we measured juvenile somatic growth and reproduction of five Daphnia magna clones from different latitudinal origin grown on three food qualities at 20, 24, and 28°C. Additionally we estimated short-term heat tolerance, measured as knockout time (time to immobility) at lethally high temperature, of two clones acclimated to the three temperatures and two food quality levels to test for the effects of food quality on adaptive plastic responses. As expected, clones from lower latitudes showed on average better somatic growth and reproduction than clones from higher latitudes at higher temperatures. However, the difference in somatic growth diminished with increasing cyanobacteria abundance in the diet, suggesting constraints on local genetic adaptation under predicted decreases in food quality. As expected, short-term heat tolerance of the clones generally increased with increasing acclimation temperature. However, heat tolerance of animals acclimated to the highest temperature was larger when grown at medium than at good food quality, whereas the opposite response was observed for animals acclimated to the lowest temperature. This suggests a better adaptive phenotypic response of animals to elevated temperatures under higher cyanobacteria abundance, and thus shows an opposite pattern to the results for somatic growth. Overall, we demonstrate that food quality limitation can mediate responses of D. magna life history traits and heat tolerance to increasing temperatures, and that the effects differ depending on the time scale studied, that is, mid-term (somatic growth) versus short-term (tolerance to acute heat stress). These aspects will need further attention to accurately predict of how organisms will cope with future global warming by local adaptation and adaptive phenotypic plasticity. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Seed origin drives differences in survival and growth traits of cork oak (Quercus suber L.) populations
VL  - 448
SP  - 267-277
AB  - Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) has a high ecological and social value and supplies raw materials for the cork industry, a relevant contributor to the economies of Mediterranean countries. Understanding the adaptation potential of cork oak populations to cope with different environmental conditions is a key issue of forest management, particularly for selecting the most adapted genetic material for (re)forestation and assuring the long-term sustainability of the cork industry. Intraspecific variation in fitness surrogate traits (survival, height and stem diameter) was investigated in thirty-five cork oak populations sampled from the entire range of the natural distribution of the species. The study was conducted in two provenance field trials, established in Portugal under different edaphoclimatic conditions. Each trial was surveyed at four tree ages (two ages, 11 and 14 years, were sampled simultaneously in both trials). The trial located at a lower altitude, which had higher mean winter and annual temperatures, exhibited higher growth and survival rates. In both trials, significant genetic variation among cork oak populations was observed for the analyzed traits and evaluated ages. Moroccan populations displayed a higher probability of survival and higher growth rates, while local populations exhibited an intermediate performance. Low to moderate correlations were found between the analyzed traits and the environmental variables of seed origin, suggesting that factors other than climate are likely to be relevant for cork oak adaptation. Moderate to high values of population mean-basis broad-sense heritability (H2 ≥ 0.44) and high genetic correlations between traits (0.88–0.95) were found for growth traits. This information is crucial for the establishment of a breeding program for the species. With this study, we have improved the knowledge regarding how cork oak performs for fitness surrogate traits in different environments. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 78

AB  - • Key message: Understanding the adaptive mechanisms of forest species is vital to ensure their survival in a climate change scenario. This study aimed at uncovering the relationship between genetic variability and environmental variables in naturalCastanea sativapopulations, unveiling how different climate scenarios drove local adaption processes using a landscape genomics approach. Our findings provide useful data for future management of this species. • Context: Temperate forest species, such as chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.), are currently threatened by increasing temperature together with disruption and reduction of precipitation due to climate change. In this context, understanding the adaptation processes of species will help to manage and ensure the conservation of forests. • Aims: We studied the relationship between genetic variability and climate variables in natural populations of C. sativa using a landscape genomics approach aimed to identify local adaption processes. • Methods: Using five genomic SSRs and eight functional EST-SSRs markers, 268 individuals belonging to ten different natural European chestnut populations distributed in contrasting climatic sites were genotyped. In addition, associations between allelic variation and climatic variables (environmental association analyses approach) were performed using Samβada and LFMM. • Results: Results highlighted a strong inter-relationship between climate variables and evolutionary processes resulting in adaptive variation. STRUCTURE analysis based on functional markers split the populations in three separate gene pools (K = 3), mostly in agreement with the different climatic conditions existing in the studied areas. Divergent spatial patterns of genetic variation between rainy and arid areas were found. We detected a total of 202 associations with climate among 22 different alleles, 9% of which related with the outlier locus FIR059, known to be implicated in regulatory mechanisms during water stress adaptation processes. • Conclusion: Landscape genomics analyses revealed a pattern of adaptive variation, where specific climatic variables influenced the frequencies distribution and fixation of several alleles, resulting in local adaptation processes of the populations in the investigated areas. Our findings underline the close inter-relationship existing between climate and genetic variability and indicate how this approach could provide valuable information for the management of forest species in a rapidly changing environment. © 2021, INRAE and Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Complete indehiscence of anthers accompanied with exerted stigmas outside the hull could be useful in hybrid rice breeding if the genetics and possible environmental effects are well understood. Studies were undertaken to identify the sources, confirm the mode of inheritance, and examine the possible environmental effects and potential application of anther indehiscence with exerted stigmas in hybrid rice breeding. Direct and reciprocal crosses were made between Jasmine 85, selected interspecific and intersubspecific lines and two wide compatibility varieties. The resulting F1 progenies were evaluated for their expression of anther indehiscence and exerted stigmas. Expression of anther indehiscence with exerted stigmas by both direct and reciprocal crosses suggested no effect of cytoplasmic factors on the expression of the trait. Segregation analysis supported the 7:1 (indehiscence:dehiscence) mode of inheritance. Temperature and relative humidity could not modulate the fertility/sterility status of anther indehiscent plants. Utilization of anther indehiscence with exerted stigmas in hybrid rice breeding was hindered by trait fixation and propagation. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Gelatin extraction optimization from skin of sub adult and adult pangasius hypophthalmus
VL  - 9
IS  - 2
SP  - 542-549
AB  - Fish skin is the potential gelatin source since the increase of the demand for the halal food due to the religious consideration. The yield of gelatin obtained from connective tissue of animal skin greatly affected by the extraction process and age of the animals that used as raw material. Research about the potential of the Pangasius hypophthalmus (striped catfish) skin as halal gelatin source have been developing. However, there was no information about the correlation between the length of striped catfish that representing age with the gelatin content. Here we optimize the gelatin extraction method from striped catfish skin with different length body size (sub adult and adult size) using statistical analysis of Placket Burman Design. We performed preliminary study to determine the variables used in the main study. We used 9 variables in the extraction process and analyzed the p-value of each variable. According to this analysis, three variables with the lowest p-values were selected: temperature (p=0.000); soaking time in alkali solution (p=0.055) and soaking time in acid solution (p=0.244). Range value of selected variables were determined according to the related previous studies. Results from our study showed that the maximum yield of sub adult and adult were obtained when we used 70 degrees C as temperature of extraction, i.e. 37.42% and 30.31%, respectively. In general, sub adult striped catfish have higher yield than the adult one at the temperature of 40 and 70 degrees C. However, the gelatin yielded from extraction process temperature of >= 70 degrees C exhibited dark pigmentation, while the gelatin that obtained with temperature treatment of <= 55 degrees C showed less pigmentation. The gelatin yielded from sub adult striped catfish showed more pigmentation than the adult one. We suggested for process of extraction both size of striped catfish should be at 55 degrees C, since it showed higher yield extraction with less pigmentation.

TI  - Physiology of crapemyrtle bark scale, Acanthococcus lagerstroemiae (Kuwana), associated with seasonally altered cold tolerance
VL  - 112
SP  - 1-8
AB  - Temperature is one of the most important abiotic factors influencing the adaptation and diversification of insects. Diverse and complex physiological mechanisms have evolved to help insects adapt to seasonal changes in temperature and prevent cold injury. Although the mechanisms of seasonal adaptation to low temperatures have been studied for insects in different taxa, none of these mechanisms have been investigated in scale insects in the superfamily Coccoidea. The crapemyrtle bark scale, Acanthococcus lagerstroemiae (Kuwana) (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae), is a newly introduced scale pest of crapemyrtles, Lagerstroemia spp. (Myrtales: Lythraceae). Our previous study concerning the cold tolerance of this pest suggested that, from summer to winter, A. lagerstroemiae seasonally adapted to lower temperature with a 5 °C reduction of supercooling points. In addition, time required to achieve the same levels of mortality at lower temperatures also increased. In this study, we used A. lagerstroemiae as a model system to investigate the physiological mechanisms correlated with changes in cold tolerance in scale insects, by measuring water content, lipid content and fatty acid composition, and cryoprotective polyols and sugars every other month. Results suggested that water content was lower in winter and early spring than in summer and early fall (40.8% vs. 63.3%). The proportions of the fatty acids in PL were similar over seasons, but in TAG, shorter chain fatty acids (from C6:0 to C10:0) increased in winter as longer chain fatty acids (from C14:0 to C18:0) decreased. Among all measured polyols and sugars, including glycerol, D-mannitol, myo-inositol, and D-trehalose, the levels of D-mannitol were the highest in January 2016, which were 19-times of those in March 2016 and 4.5-times of those in September 2016. Results from this study provide a better understanding on how A. lagerstroemiae overwinters, which may give insights into the overwintering strategies of other scale insects. © 2018

TI  - Evolution of superclusters in the cosmic web
VL  - 623
AB  - Aims. We investigate how properties of the ensemble of superclusters in the cosmic web evolve with time. Methods. We performed numerical simulations of the evolution of the cosmic web using the Λ cold dark matter model in box sizes L0 = 1024, 512, 256 h-1 Mpc. We found supercluster ensembles of models for four evolutionary stages, corresponding to the present epoch z = 0, and to redshifts z = 1, z = 3, and z = 10. We calculated fitness diameters of superclusters defined from volumes of superclusters divided by filling factors of over-density regions. Geometrical and fitness diameters of largest superclusters, and the number of superclusters as functions of the threshold density were used as percolation functions to describe geometrical properties of the ensemble of superclusters in the cosmic web. We calculated the distributions of geometrical and fitness diameters and luminosities of superclusters, and followed the time evolution of percolation functions and supercluster distributions. We compared percolation functions and supercluster distributions of models and samples of galaxies of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Results. Our analysis shows that fitness diameters of superclusters have a minimum at a certain threshold density. Fitness diameters around minima almost do not change with time in co-moving coordinates. Numbers of superclusters have maxima which are approximately constant for all evolutionary epochs. The geometrical diameters of superclusters decrease during the evolution of the cosmic web, and the luminosities of superclusters increase during this evolution. Conclusions. Our study suggests that evolutionary changes occur inside supercluster cells of dynamical influence. The stability of fitness diameters and numbers of superclusters during the evolution is an important property of the cosmic web. © 2019 ESO.

TI  - Temperature gradient affects differentiation of gene expression and SNP allele frequencies in the dominant lake Baikal zooplankton species
VL  - 27
IS  - 11
SP  - 2544-2559
AB  - Local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity are main mechanisms of organisms’ resilience in changing environments. Both are affected by gene flow and are expected to be weak in zooplankton populations inhabiting large continuous water bodies and strongly affected by currents. Lake Baikal, the deepest and one of the coldest lakes on Earth, experienced epilimnion temperature increase during the last 100 years, exposing Baikal’s zooplankton to novel selective pressures. We obtained a partial transcriptome of Epischura baikalensis (Copepoda: Calanoida), the dominant component of Baikal’s zooplankton, and estimated SNP allele frequencies and transcript abundances in samples from regions of Baikal that differ in multiyear average surface temperatures. The strongest signal in both SNP and transcript abundance differentiation is the SW-NE gradient along the 600+ km long axis of the lake, suggesting isolation by distance. SNP differentiation is stronger for nonsynonymous than synonymous SNPs and is paralleled by differential survival during a laboratory exposure to increased temperature, indicating directional selection operating on the temperature gradient. Transcript abundance, generally collinear with the SNP differentiation, shows samples from the warmest, less deep location clustering together with the southernmost samples. Differential expression is more frequent among transcripts orthologous to candidate thermal response genes previously identified in model arthropods, including genes encoding cytoskeleton proteins, heat-shock proteins, proteases, enzymes of central energy metabolism, lipid and antioxidant pathways. We conclude that the pivotal endemic zooplankton species in Lake Baikal exists under temperature-mediated selection and possesses both genetic variation and plasticity to respond to novel temperature-related environmental pressures. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

VL  - 29
IS  - 1
SP  - 87-101
AB  - Aim: It is still debated whether allometry, the relationship between body size and body parts, entails merely an evolutionary constraint or can itself evolve. Recently, a hypothesis has been proposed that states that static allometry (allometry measured across individuals at the same developmental stage) can evolve from differences in the developmental pathways between pairs of traits under different nutritional environments. A macroecological prediction stemming from this hypothesis is that allometric coefficients (scaling and allometric factors) should covary with ecosystem productivity. Here, we tested this prediction using a worldwide database of mass–length allometric equations. Location: Worldwide, data distributed across the entire globe. Time period: 1967–2017. Major taxa studied: Soil arthropods. Methods: We fitted general linear models with the allometric coefficients (the scaling a and allometric b factors) as the dependent variables. The target independent variable was the normalized difference vegetation index, as a proxy of ecosystem productivity. Longitude, absolute latitude and altitude, as well as mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation were included as both covariates and additional variables of interest. We also included body bauplan (obtained from geometric morphometrics), taxonomic affiliation (a proxy of phylogenetic relationships) and the reciprocal allometric coefficient as covariates in the model. Results: We found a strong negative association between both allometric factors and the productivity of the ecosystems, and the effect for the allometric factor b was stronger at lower trophic levels. We also detected strikingly similar effects of geographic and climatic predictors on both allometric factors, suggesting the occurrence of similar selective regimes. Main conclusions: The fact that productivity, geography and climate affect the value of mass–length allometric coefficients has important consequences not only to understand the evolution of allometries, but also for how energy is processed in soil ecosystems across the globe. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Shortest Path Selection Algorithm for Cold Chain Logistics Transportation Based on Improved Artificial Bee Colony
VL  - 2021
AB  - Aiming at the problems of low shortest path selection accuracy, longer response time, and poor selection effect in current cold chain logistics transportation methods, a cold chain logistics transportation shortest path selection algorithm based on improved artificial bee colony is proposed. The improved algorithm is used to initialize the food source, reevaluate the fitness value of the food source, generate a new food source, optimize the objective function and food source evaluation strategy, and get an improved artificial bee colony algorithm. Based on the improved artificial bee colony algorithm, the group adaptive mechanism of particle swarm algorithm is introduced to initialize the position and velocity of each particle randomly. Dynamic detection factor and octree algorithm are adopted to dynamically update the path of modeling environment information. According to the information sharing mechanism between individual particles, the group adaptive behavior control is performed. After the maximum number of cycles, the path planning is completed, the shortest path is output, and the shortest path selection of cold chain logistics transportation is realized. The experimental results show that the shortest path selection effect of the cold chain logistics transportation of the proposed algorithm is better, which can effectively improve the shortest path selection accuracy and reduce the shortest path selection time. © 2021 Zhihuan Liu.

TI  - Temperature as a modulator of sexual selection
VL  - 95
IS  - 6
SP  - 1607-1629
AB  - A central question in ecology and evolution is to understand why sexual selection varies so much in strength across taxa; it has long been known that ecological factors are crucial to this. Temperature is a particularly salient abiotic ecological factor that modulates a wide range of physiological, morphological and behavioural traits, impacting individuals and populations at a global taxonomic scale. Furthermore, temperature exhibits substantial temporal variation (e.g. daily, seasonally and inter-seasonally), and hence for most species in the wild sexual selection will regularly unfold in a dynamic thermal environment. Unfortunately, studies have so far almost completely neglected the role of temperature as a modulator of sexual selection. Here, we outline the main pathways through which temperature can affect the intensity and form (i.e. mechanisms) of sexual selection, via: (i) direct effects on secondary sexual traits and preferences (i.e. trait variance, opportunity for selection and trait–fitness covariance), and (ii) indirect effects on key mating parameters, sex-specific reproductive costs/benefits, trade-offs, demography and correlated abiotic factors. Building upon this framework, we show that, by focusing exclusively on the first-order effects that environmental temperature has on traits linked with individual fitness and population viability, current global warming studies may be ignoring eco-evolutionary feedbacks mediated by sexual selection. Finally, we tested the general prediction that temperature modulates sexual selection by conducting a meta-analysis of available studies experimentally manipulating temperature and reporting effects on the variance of male/female reproductive success and/or traits under sexual selection. Our results show a clear association between temperature and sexual selection measures in both sexes. In short, we suggest that studying the feedback between temperature and sexual selection processes may be vital to developing a better understanding of variation in the strength of sexual selection in nature, and its consequences for population viability in response to environmental change (e.g. global warming). © 2020 Cambridge Philosophical Society

TI  - Genomic adaptations to chemosymbiosis in the deep-sea seep-dwelling tubeworm Lamellibrachia luymesi
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Symbiotic relationships between microbes and their hosts are widespread and diverse, often providing protection or nutrients, and may be either obligate or facultative. However, the genetic mechanisms allowing organisms to maintain host-symbiont associations at the molecular level are still mostly unknown, and in the case of bacterial-animal associations, most genetic studies have focused on adaptations and mechanisms of the bacterial partner. The gutless tubeworms (Siboglinidae, Annelida) are obligate hosts of chemoautotrophic endosymbionts (except for Osedax which houses heterotrophic Oceanospirillales), which rely on the sulfide-oxidizing symbionts for nutrition and growth. Whereas several siboglinid endosymbiont genomes have been characterized, genomes of hosts and their adaptations to this symbiosis remain unexplored. Results: Here, we present and characterize adaptations of the cold seep-dwelling tubeworm Lamellibrachia luymesi, one of the longest-lived solitary invertebrates. We sequenced the worm's ∼ 688-Mb haploid genome with an overall completeness of ∼ 95% and discovered that L. luymesi lacks many genes essential in amino acid biosynthesis, obligating them to products provided by symbionts. Interestingly, the host is known to carry hydrogen sulfide to thiotrophic endosymbionts using hemoglobin. We also found an expansion of hemoglobin B1 genes, many of which possess a free cysteine residue which is hypothesized to function in sulfide binding. Contrary to previous analyses, the sulfide binding mediated by zinc ions is not conserved across tubeworms. Thus, the sulfide-binding mechanisms in sibgolinids need to be further explored, and B1 globins might play a more important role than previously thought. Our comparative analyses also suggest the Toll-like receptor pathway may be essential for tolerance/sensitivity to symbionts and pathogens. Several genes related to the worm's unique life history which are known to play important roles in apoptosis, cell proliferation, and aging were also identified. Last, molecular clock analyses based on phylogenomic data suggest modern siboglinid diversity originated in 267 mya (± 70 my) support previous hypotheses indicating a Late Mesozoic or Cenozoic origins of approximately 50-126 mya for vestimentiferans. Conclusions: Here, we elucidate several specific adaptations along various molecular pathways that link phenome to genome to improve understanding of holobiont evolution. Our findings of adaptation in genomic mechanisms to reducing environments likely extend to other chemosynthetic symbiotic systems. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Use of accelerometer technology for individual tracking of activity patterns, metabolic rates and welfare in farmed gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) facing a wide range of stressors
VL  - 539
AB  - The biosensor technology has the potential to revolutionize the aquaculture industry, but the selection of tagging method, operational mode (stand-alone vs. wireless systems) and telemetry technology ultimately depends on life species, life stage and research question. In particular, AEFishBIT is a small and stand-alone device composed of a tri-axial accelerometer, a microprocessor, a battery and a RFID tag that was designed to be externally attached to the operculum. This unique location serves to provide simultaneous measurements of activity patterns (signals of x- and y-axes) and respiratory frequency (z-axis signal) processed by on-board algorithms. The validity of measurements was initially proved in exercised fish in a swim tunnel respirometer, and its use as a reliable tool for the individual monitoring of whole-organism traits in free-swimming gilthead sea bream was tested herein in fish facing a wide range of biotic and abiotic stressors. The impact of the tagging method, based on the use of monel piercing fish tags with a flexible heat shrink polyethylene ring, was also evaluated and no signs of growth impairment, operculum damage or gill lamellae haemorrhage were found 10 days post-tagging. The autonomy of the device was 6 h of continuous recording with re-programmable lag times and recording schedules of 2 min windows at regular intervals along the experimental period (2–8 days). Such procedure underlined a negative linear correlation between fasting weight loss and operculum breaths, becoming respiratory frequency a reliable indicator of basal metabolic rates. Biosensing signals also highlighted the more continuous physical activity and increased respiratory rates of young fish when comparisons were made between one- and three-year old fish. Also, AEFishBIT measurements evidenced a generalized increase of respiratory frequency during severe hypoxia (2–3 ppm), but the individuals classified as proactive fish also shared an increased physical activity for supporting escape reactions in a milieu with low oxygen availability. Likewise, we also observed an overall increase of physical activity with the decrease of tank space availability, which can contribute to establish stricter criteria of welfare in farmed fish. Finally, the reduction of respiratory frequency was a consistent diagnostic marker of the progression of parasitic enteritis in experimentally infected fish with the myxozoan Enteromyxum leei. Altogether, this work constitutes the proof of concept of the use of biosensor technology as a reliable tool for an individual whole-organism behavioural profiling of farmed fish at laboratory scale, contributing to improve animal welfare and productivity of aquaculture industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis of microbial community compositions and cold-responsive stress genes in selected antarctic lacustrine and soil ecosystems
VL  - 8
IS  - 3
AB  - This study describes microbial community compositions, and various cold-responsive stress genes, encompassing cold-induced proteins (CIPs) and cold-associated general stress-responsive proteins (CASPs) in selected Antarctic lake water, sediment, and soil metagenomes. Overall, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the major taxa in all metagenomes. Prochlorococcus and Thiomicrospira were highly abundant in waters, while Myxococcus, Anaeromyxobacter, Haliangium, and Gloeobacter were dominant in the soil and lake sediment metagenomes. Among CIPs, genes necessary for DNA replication, translation initiation, and transcription termination were highly abundant in all metagenomes. However, genes for fatty acid desaturase (FAD) and trehalose synthase (TS) were common in the soil and lake sediment metagenomes. Interestingly, the Lake Untersee water and sediment metagenome samples contained histone-like nucleoid structuring protein (H-NS) and all genes for CIPs. As for the CASPs, high abundances of a wide range of genes for cryo- and osmo-protectants (glutamate, glycine, choline, and betaine) were identified in all metagenomes. However, genes for exopolysaccharide biosynthesis were dominant in Lake Untersee water, sediment, and other soil metagenomes. The results from this study indicate that although diverse microbial communities are present in various metagenomes, they share common cold-responsive stress genes necessary for their survival and sustenance in the extreme Antarctic conditions. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Effects of temperature on macronutrient selection, metabolic and swimming performance of the Indo-Pacific Damselfish (Abudefduf vaigiensis)
VL  - 165
IS  - 11
AB  - Temperature fluctuations have caused considerable biological and ecological impacts on marine organisms and their communities. For example, increased temperatures in sub-tropical environments have led to the influx of tropical “vagrant” marine species into cooler temperate waters in a phenomenon called ‘tropicalisation’. Here we combine metabolic performance metrics, feeding manipulations and nutritional geometry models to examine the influence of temperature on macronutrient selection (energy amounts of protein, lipid and carbohydrates) in the Indo-Pacific damselfish Abudefduf vaigiensis and explore the role of temperature and macronutrient intake on individual performance (active and routine metabolic rate, and burst swim speed). Indo-pacific damselfish fed non-randomly from presented food blocks, showing selection for their macronutrient intake. In our high-temperature treatment we observed a significant increase in the intake of protein and lipid, but not carbohydrate. The fish in our low-temperature treatment had a significantly higher active metabolic rate and burst swim speed compared to our high-temperature treatment. Our findings provide evidence that the vagrant Indo-Pacific Damselfish in Sydney are able to select specific macronutrients in their diets ameliorating the effects on performance when thermally stressed. This work also suggests some underlying level of acclimation to or selection for colder water temperatures in these relatively recently recruited fish. Further studies should benefit from the approach proposed here, to better understand the ecological and evolutionary drivers that influence the survival of tropical species in marginal thermal habitats. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Multi-Criteria Optimization of a Biomass-Based Hydrogen Production System Integrated With Organic Rankine Cycle
VL  - 8
AB  - Biomass-based gasification is an attractive and promising pathway for hydrogen production. In this work, a biomass-based hydrogen production system integrated with organic Rankine cycle was designed and investigated to predict the performance of hydrogen production yield and electricity generation under various operating conditions. The modified equilibrium model presented desirable results for the produced syngas compositions compared with the experimental data. Hydrogen yields from four types of biomass (wood chips, daily manure, sorghum, and grapevine pruning wastes) were compared under the same operating condition, with wood chips exhibiting the maximum hydrogen yield of 11.59 mol/kg. The effects of gasification temperature, equivalence ratio, and steam-to-biomass ratio on the hydrogen yield and electricity generation were investigated by using the response surface method. Furthermore, the system was optimized using a genetic algorithm based on the response surface model. A preferred optimal solution with a hydrogen yield of 39.31 mol/kg and an output power of 3,558.08 kW (0.99 kW h/kg) was selected by the linear programming technique for multidimensional analysis of the preference method. © Copyright © 2020 Zhang, Zhou, Jia, Feng and Dang.

TI  - Dynamic simulation and control of solar biomass gasification for hydrogen-rich syngas production during allothermal and hybrid solar/autothermal operation
VL  - 45
IS  - 48
SP  - 25827-25837
AB  - Solar biomass steam gasification using concentrated sunlight offers an efficient means of storing intermittent solar energy into renewable solar fuels while upgrading the carbonaceous feedstock. Such solar-driven (allothermal) processes have demonstrated the ability and the effectiveness for the production of high quality hydrogen-rich syngas, but they suffer from inherent barriers related to the variability of solar energy caused by cloud passages and shut off at night. The concept of hybrid solar/autothermal gasification appears promising to meet the requirement for stable and continuous operation under fluctuating or intermittent solar irradiation. To date, dynamic modelling to simulate coupled solar/combustion heating and steam gasification using real solar irradiation data has never been proposed and could be used to predict the annual performance of large-scale solar gasification plants. In this study, a dynamic mathematical model of a scaled-up solar gasification reactor was developed. The model was composed of a system of differential equations that were derived from unsteady mass and energy conservation equations. After an experimental validation step with the results from a lab-scale solar reactor, the dynamic model was applied at large scale to determine the reactor temperature and syngas production evolution during continuous day and night operation in both solar-only (allothermal) and hybrid solar/autothermal modes. Different reactants feeding management strategies were proposed and compared with the aim of achieving enhanced syngas productivity and optimized use of solar energy during solar-aided steam gasification. It was shown that the hybrid mode with partial oxy-combustion of the feedstock and dynamic feeding control results in the most stable process operation upon fluctuating solar power input, while ensuring continuous production of H-2 and CO at night and during cloudy periods.

TI  - Keystone predation: trait-based or driven by extrinsic processes? Assessment using a comparative-experimental approach
VL  - 91
IS  - 1
AB  - Keystone predation can be a determinant of community structure, including species diversity, but factors underlying “keystoneness” have been minimally explored. Using the system in which the original keystone, the sea star Pisaster ochraceus, was discovered, we focused on two potential (but overlapping) determinants of keystoneness: intrinsic traits or state variables of the species (e.g., size, density), and extrinsic environmental parameters (e.g., prey productivity) that may provide conditions favorable for keystone predator evolution. Using a comparative-experimental approach, with repeated field experiments at multiple sites across a variable coastal environment, we tested predation rates, or how quickly predators consumed prey, and predation effects, or community response to predator presence or absence. We tested five hypotheses: (H1) predation rates and effects will vary in space but not time; (H2) per population predation rates will vary primarily with individual traits and population variables; (HJHH3) per capita predation rates will vary only with individual traits; (H4) predation effects will vary with traits, variables, and external drivers; and (H5) as predicted by the keystone predation hypothesis, diversity will vary unimodally with predation pressure. As hypothesized, predation rates differed among sites but not over time (H1), and in caging exclusion experiments, predation effect varied with both intrinsic and extrinsic factors (H4). Unexpectedly, predation rates varied with both intrinsic and extrinsic (H2, per population), or only with extrinsic (H3, per capita) factors. Further, in large-plot exclusion experiments, predation effect was most closely associated with individual traits (contra H4). Finally, taxon diversity varied unimodally with proxies of predation pressure (sessile prey abundance) and was sensitive to extrinsic factors (mussel growth, temperature, and upwelling, H5). Hence, keystoneness depended on predator individual traits, predator population variables, and environmental parameters. However, temporal differences in caging experiments suggested that environmental characteristics underlying prey dynamics may be preeminent. Compared to prior experiments, predation was weaker with low prey input compared to periods with high prey input. Collectively, our results suggest that keystone predator evolution depends on the coalescence of species-specific characteristics, and environmental parameters favoring high prey productivity. Our approach may be a model for future studies exploring the generality of keystoneness. © 2020 by the Ecological Society of America

TI  - Ecotypic differentiation, hybridization and clonality facilitate the persistence of a cold-adapted sedge in European bogs
VL  - 128
IS  - 4
SP  - 909-925
AB  - Recent research has shown that many cold-adapted species survived the last glacial maximum (LGM) in northern refugia. Whether this evolutionary history has had consequences for their genetic diversity and adaptive potential remains unknown. We sampled 14 populations of Carex limosa, a sedge specialized to bog ecosystems, along a latitudinal gradient from its Scandinavian core to the southern lowland range-margin in Germany. Using microsatellite and experimental common-garden data, we evaluated the impacts of global climate change along this gradient and assessed the conservation status of the southern marginal populations. Microsatellite data revealed two highly distinct genetic groups and hybrid individuals. In our common-garden experiment, the two groups showed divergent responses to increased nitrogen/phosphorus (N/P) availability, suggesting ecotypic differentiation. Each group formed genetically uniform populations at both northern and southern sampling areas. Mixed populations occurred throughout our sampling area, an area that was entirely glaciated during the LGM. The fragmented distribution implies allopatric divergence at geographically separated refugia that putatively differed in N/P availability. Molecular data and an observed low hybrid fecundity indicate the importance of clonal reproduction for hybrid populations. At the southern range-margin, however, all populations showed effects of clonality, lowered fecundity and low competitiveness, suggesting abiotic and biotic constraints to population persistence. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

TI  - Adaptations to the mudflat: Insights from physiological and transcriptional responses to thermal stress in a burrowing bivalve Sinonovacula constricta
VL  - 710
AB  - Understanding physiological adaptations of organisms to temperature changes that characterize their habitat is the first step in predicting the putative effects of global climate change on population dynamics. Mudflats are an important part of the intertidal zone and experience extreme and fluctuating temperatures. Therein, species would be potentially susceptible to global warming. The present study explored physiological adaptations of burrowing species to life in an intertidal mudflat by analyzing the potential operative temperatures in the mudflat, and assessing cardiac performance and the transcriptional response to thermal stress by a typical burrowing bivalve, the razor clam Sinonovacula constrict(' in different thermal environments, mimicking conditions during low tides. Clams showed higher thermal sublethal limits in mud with overlying air than in mud with overlying water, indicating an adaptation to rapidly changing ambient temperatures and thermal environments during emersion. This sublethal limit was far above the maximum operative temperature in the actual habitat site and suggests a potential buffer zone to ensure survival under unexpected high temperatures, that could occur with global warming. In response to high temperature, S. constricta exhibited the common heat stress response by up-regulating expression of the Bcl2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) and heat shock proteins to cope with the adverse effects of high temperature on protein homeostasis. Increased expression of key genes, including molybdenum cofactor synthesis 3 (MOCS3), oligoribonuclease (REX2), and NF kappa appaB inhibitor alpha (NFIA) may further remit the effect of thermal stress during the emersion period and delay a situation where clams reach their thermal sublethal limit, thereby helping to endure high temperature during low tide. These results clearly illustrate significant adaptations of a burrowing bivalve to life in intertidal mudflats at both physiological and molecular levels and can provide insights into potential physiological or evolutionary responses that could aid survival of mudflat species in a changing global climate.

VL  - 14

SP  - 335-344
AB  - Most animal species have a complex life cycle (CLC) with metamorphosis. It is thus of interest to examine possible benefits of such life histories. The prevailing view is that CLC represents an adaptation for genetic decoupling of juvenile and adult traits, thereby allowing life stages to respond independently to different selective forces. Here I propose an additional potential advantage of CLCs that is, decreased variance in population growth rate due to habitat separation of life stages. Habitat separation of pre- and post-metamorphic stages means that the stages will experience different regimes of environmental variability. This is in contrast to species with simple life cycles (SLC) whose life stages often occupy one and the same habitat. The correlation in the fluctuations of the vital rates of life stages is therefore likely to be weaker in complex than in simple life cycles. By a theoretical framework using an analytical approach, I have (1) derived the relative advantage, in terms of long-run growth rate, of CLC over SLC phenotypes for a broad spectrum of life histories, and (2) explored which life histories that benefit most by a CLC, that is avoid correlation in vital rates between life stages. The direction and magnitude of gain depended on life history type and fluctuating vital rate. One implication of our study is that species with CLCs should, on average, be more robust to increased environmental variability caused by global warming than species with SLCs. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Broad thermal tolerance is negatively correlated with virulence in an opportunistic bacterial pathogen
VL  - 11
IS  - 9
SP  - 1700-1714
AB  - Predicting the effects of global increase in temperatures on disease virulence is challenging, especially for environmental opportunistic bacteria, because pathogen fitness may be differentially affected by temperature within and outside host environment. So far, there is very little empirical evidence on the connections between optimal temperature range and virulence in environmentally growing pathogens. Here, we explored whether the virulence of an environmentally growing opportunistic fish pathogen, Flavobacterium columnare, is malleable to evolutionary changes via correlated selection on thermal tolerance. To this end, we experimentally quantified the thermal performance curves (TPCs) for maximum biomass yield of 49 F. columnare isolates from eight different geographic locations in Finland over ten years (2003–2012). We also characterized virulence profiles of these strains in a zebra fish (Danio rerio) infection model. We show that virulence among the strains increased over the years, but thermal generalism, and in particular tolerance to higher temperatures, was negatively associated with virulence. Our data suggest that temperature has a strong effect on the pathogen genetic diversity and therefore presumably also on disease dynamics. However, the observed increase in frequency and severity of F. columnare epidemics over the last decade cannot be directly linked to bacterial evolution due to increased mean temperature, but is most likely associated with factors related to increased length of growing season, or other time-dependent change in environment. Our study demonstrates that complex interactions between the host, the pathogen and the environment influence disease virulence of an environmentally growing opportunistic pathogen. © 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Differences among six woody perennials native to Northern Europe in their level of genetic differentiation and adaptive potential at fine local scale
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
SP  - 2231-2239
AB  - The ability of perennial species to adapt their phenology to present and future temperature conditions is important for their ability to retain high fitness compared to other competing plant species, pests, and pathogens. Many transplanting studies with forest tree species have previously reported substantial genetic differentiation among populations within their native range. However, the question of “how local is local” is still highly debated in conservation biology because studies on genetic patterns of variation within and among populations at the local scale are limited and scattered. In this study, we compare the level of genetic differentiation among populations of six different perennial plant species based on their variation in spring flushing. We assess the level of additive genetic variation present within the local population. For all six species, we find significant differentiation among populations from sites with mean annual temperature ranging between 7.4°C and 8.4°C. The observed variation can only be partly explained by the climate at the site of origin. Most clear relationship between early flushing and higher average spring temperature is observed for the three wind-pollinated species in the study, while the relations are much less clear for the three insect-pollinated species. This supports that pollination system can influence the balance between genetic drift and natural selection and thereby influence the level of local adaptation in long-lived species. On the positive side, we find that the native populations of woody plant species have maintained high levels of additive genetic variation in spring phenology, although this also differs substantially among the six studied species. © 2018 The Authors.

VL  - 8

SP  - 200-221
AB  - Bergmann’s rule is one of the most vigorously debated ecogeographic patterns but has rarely been examined in Neotropical bats. Herein, I examined Bergmann’s rule in Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus lituratus along an elevation gradient of 2500 m at both inter- and intraspecific level. I measured 384 specimens from collections belonged to C. perspicillata (89 ♀, 102 ♂) and A. lituratus (89 ♀, 104 ♂). The size of C. perspicillata increased with increasing elevation and decreasing temperature, whereas A. lituratus showed the converse pattern. For both species, females did not differ between elevation categories, contrary to males that were larger above 1000 m in C. perspicillata, but smaller in A. lituratus. Conformity to Bergmann’s rule depends on bat size and sex. Despite C. perspicillata follows the pattern, the explanatory mechanisms still need to be understood. By contrast, A. lituratus follows the converse of Bergmann’s rule due to naked and highly vascularized wings that aid thermoregulation in warmer environments. Male size is more sensitive to changes in temperature for both species which may be partially explained by sexual selection. Elevation and temperature are not the only factors related to bat morphology and other mechanisms may explain size in bats. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Environmental temperature profoundly influences the body temperatures of reptiles, and hence the rates at which physiological processes occur. We review progress in understanding the thermal ecophysiology of New Zealand’s endemic, terrestrial reptiles (tuatara, geckos, and skinks), and in applying this knowledge to conservation. By understanding the constraints and opportunities that environmental temperature places on different life-history stages, including embryos in nests and those that develop within live-bearing females, we can plan better translocations, improve captive management, and make stronger predictions about risks from changes in climate. We encourage conservation physiologists to offer leadership in demonstrating the societal transformations necessary to sustain a liveable planet. © Oxford University Press 2021.

TI  - The Potential to Improve the Sustainability of Pelagic Fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic by Incorporating Individual Fish Behavior Into Acoustic Sampling
VL  - 7
AB  - With the increased uncertainty introduced through climate change and fishing pressure, having accurate estimates of fish biomass is essential for global ecosystem and economic health. Acoustic surveys are an efficient way to determine population size for pelagic species in the Northeast Atlantic (NEA), but acoustic population estimates still contain uncertainty and are difficult for some species. For example, Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) is one of the most valuable fisheries in the NEA and is not monitored acoustically, as mackerel lack the swim bladder that provides the strongest acoustic echo (target strength) at common assessment frequencies. For all pelagic species, and especially for mackerel, behavior is a source of variation in acoustic measurements and therefore in population estimates. Behavior is mediated by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors, such as the environment and the life history of the fish. In turn, behavior affects the density of the shoal and the tilt angle of the fish relative to the survey vessel, affecting their target strength, which affects the biomass estimate. Some fish may also undergo an anti-predator response to survey vessels, changing their behavior in response to the survey. Understanding these behaviors and incorporating them into acoustic stock assessment methods can improve the accuracy of population estimates. Individual-based models (IBM) of fish shoals provide a pathway for incorporating behavior into acoustic methods. IBMs have been used extensively to build theoretical models of fish shoals, but few have been successfully tested in lab or field conditions. As computational power and monitoring technology improve, modeling the collective behavior of pelagic fishes will be possible. Novel, interdisciplinary approaches to data collection and analysis will help translate theoretical IBMs to the fisheries science domain. Beyond acoustic stock assessments, this approach can be used to investigate knowledge gaps in the effects of fisheries-induced evolution and the potential for range shifts under climate change. Further work to synthesize existing models and incorporate field data will help determine how environmental, ecological, physiological, and anthropogenic factors, often affecting both behavior and acoustic surveying, are interconnected. Moving from theoretical models to practical applications will be a valuable tool in tackling the uncertainty that accompanies further fisheries exploitation and warming oceans. © Copyright © 2020 Wassermann and Johnson.

TI  - Can temperature modify the strength of density-dependent habitat selection in ectotherms? A test with red flour beetles
VL  - 304
IS  - 3
SP  - 159-168
AB  - Habitat selection is an important aspect of the ecology of animals and models predict that density dependence is a strong force shaping patterns of habitat selection. In ectotherms, however, density dependence of fitness tends to weaken as temperature deviates from the species’ optimal temperature (To). This may have important implications for density-dependent habitat selection because the underlying mechanism for density-dependent habitat selection is density dependence in fitness. We examine how temperature can modify the predictions from isodar theory and obtain temperature-dependent predictions for density-dependent habitat selection. We specifically predict that the isodar's intercept will be furthest from zero and the slope will be steepest at the optimal temperature. As temperature deviates from the optimal temperature, we predict that the intercept will approach zero and the slope will approach one. We then test these predictions with experiments on habitat selection based on food abundance by red flour beetles in the laboratory. We also confirm that fitness decreases as density increases and that density dependence weakens as temperature deviates from To. In agreement with our predictions, preference for habitats with more food weakened as density dependence weakened. Our results have implications for habitat selection by ectotherms because we demonstrate that variation in environmental temperature can weaken markedly the effect of density on both fitness and habitat selection. High density may entail no fitness costs for ectotherms that cannot maintain their optimal temperature. © 2017 The Zoological Society of London

VL  - 24

AB  - Carbon cycling by Antarctic microbial plankton is poorly understood but it plays a major role in CO2 sequestration in the Southern Ocean. We investigated the summer bacterioplankton community in the largely understudied Weddell Sea, applying Illumina amplicon sequencing, measurements of bacterial production and chemical analyses of organic matter. The results revealed that the patchy distribution of productive coastal polynyas and less productive, mostly ice-covered sites was the major driver of the spatial changes in the taxonomic composition and activity of bacterioplankton. Gradients in organic matter availability induced by phytoplankton blooms were reflected in the concentrations and composition of dissolved carbohydrates and proteins. Bacterial production at bloom stations was, on average, 2.7 times higher than at less productive sites. Abundant bloom-responsive lineages were predominately affiliated with ubiquitous marine taxa, including Polaribacter, Yoonia-Loktanella, Sulfitobacter, the SAR92 clade, and Ulvibacter, suggesting a widespread genetic potential for adaptation to sub-zero seawater temperatures. A co-occurrence network analysis showed that dominant taxa at stations with low phytoplankton productivity were highly connected, indicating beneficial interactions. Overall, our study demonstrates that heterotrophic bacterial communities along Weddell Sea ice shelves were primarily constrained by the availability of labile organic matter rather than low seawater temperature. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Much has been published on the effects of ocean acidification on plankton since the original Royal Society 2005 report. In addition to direct effects on primary production, it is clear that ocean acidification also has profound consequences for biogeochemistry. Furthermore, although ocean acidification can have direct effects of on grazers such as copepods, acidification induces changes in nutritional value of phytoplankton which can be passed on up the food chain. There has also been recognition of the complexity of the interactions between elevated CO2 and other environmental factors and this has seen an upsurge in climate change research involvingmultifactorial experiments. In particular, the interaction of ocean acidification with global warming resulting from the increasing greenhouse effect has been investigated. There has also been research on acidification and warming effects in inland water plankton. These, combined with novel experimental techniques and long termstudies of genetic adaptation, are providing better insights to plankton biology and communities in a future world. © The Author(s) 2021.

TI  - Step-patterned survivorship curves: Mortality and loss of equilibrium responses to high temperature and food restriction in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)
VL  - 15
IS  - 5
AB  - While survivorship curves typically exhibit smooth declines over time, step-patterned curves can occur with multiple stressors within a life stage. To explore this process, we examined the effects of heat (24°C) and food restriction on juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) in challenge experiments. We observed step-patterned survivorship curves determined by mortality and loss of equilibrium (LOE) endpoints. To examine the cause of heterogeneity in the stress responses from early to late mortality and LOE, we measured indices of energetic reserves. The step transition in the survivorship curves, the peak mortality rates, and start of when individuals reached a critical energetic threshold (14% dry mass; 4.0 kJ?g-1 energy) all occurred at around days 10-15 of the challenge. The coherence in these temporal patterns suggest heterogeneity in the cohort stress responses, in which an early subgroup died from heat stress and a late subgroup died from starvation. Thus, their endpoint sensitivities resulted in step-patterned survivorship curves. We discuss the implications of the study for understanding effects of multiple stressors on population heterogeneity and note the possible significance of stress response selection under climate change in which heat stress and food limitations occur in concert. © 2020 Gosselin, Anderson.

TI  - Coping strategies of farmers regarding the impact of climate change in Rice-Wheat zone of the Punjab, Pakistan
VL  - 56

SP  - 1038-1046
AB  - Pakistan is one of those countries which are victim of climate change and is already facing many problems like poverty and food insecurity leading to threats to agriculture expansion. Climate change is ahead of all these due to decreasing agriculture production prolonged water scarcity and declined income growth. Agriculture plays a big role in economy of Pakistan and climate change is matter of serious concern. The main objective of the present study was to find out the factors affecting the strategies of farmers regarding the impact of climate change in Punjab, Pakistan. Three districts from rice-wheat cropping zone (Narowal, Sialkot and Gujranwala) were selected randomly. A total sample of four hundred eight respondents was selected by systematic random sample technique. A well-structured interview schedule was used as research instrument for data collection. Collected data were analyzed statistically. In addition, descriptive and inferential statistics were applied for the data analysis. It was found that education level of the farmers was low in the study area. Most farmers had small land holdings and were used to self-cultivation. Mean area of wheat and rice was 7.31±6.06 and 6.25±5.60 acres, respectively. It was observed that long summer and short winter season and high temperature were the main perceptions of climate change in the study area. Industrial smoke, excessive felling of forests and human activities were also perceived as the factors leading to change in environment. A vast majority of the farmers observed that climate change had negative impact on crop production and annual income. It was also found that recommended varieties (2.58±0.72), applying more industrial pesticides (2.50±0.76) and practicing crop diversification (2.36±0.81), increased use of irrigation (2.19±0.89) and integrated farming system (0 2.15±0.91) were the major coping strategies for minimizing the effect of climate changes and these strategies had positive impact on crop productivity. Binary Logistic Model showed that increase in education, income, agricultural experience, contributes in to adoption of strategies to cope climate changes of farmers. It is recommended that farmers should use approved varieties, fertilizers and practice crop diversification. Investment on improved agricultural technology by government and other stakeholders are very necessary for agriculture to be able to cope with climate change. © 2019, University of Agriculture.

TI  - Analysis of the spatial and temporal distribution of process gases within municipal biowaste compost
VL  - 11
IS  - 8
AB  - Composting processes reduce the weight and volume of biowaste and produce products that can be used in agriculture (e.g., as fertilizer). Despite the benefits of composting, there are also problems such as odors and the emission of pollutants into the atmosphere. This research aimed to investigate the phenomenon of process gas (CO, CO2, NO, O2) evolution within a large-scale municipal composter. The effects of turning frequency and pile location (outdoor vs. indoors) on process gas and temperature spatial and temporal evolution were studied in six piles (37-81 tons of initial weight) over a six-month period. The biowaste consisted of green waste and municipal sewage sludge. The chemical composition and temperature of process gases within four cross sections with seven sampling locations were analyzed weekly for ~7-8 weeks (a total of 1375 cross sections). The aeration degree, temperature, CO, CO2, and NO concentration and their spatial and temporal distribution were analyzed. Final weight varied from 66% reduction to 7% weight gain. Only 8.2% of locations developed the desired chimney effect (utilizing natural buoyancy to facilitate passive aeration). Only 31.1% of locations reached thermophilic conditions (necessary to inactivate pathogens). Lower O2 levels corresponded with elevated CO2 concentrations. CO production increased in the initial composting phase. Winter piles were characterized by the lowest CO content. The most varied was the NO distribution in all conditions. The O2 concentration was lowest in the central part of the pile, and aeration conditions were good regardless of the technological regime used. Turning once a week was sufficient overall. Based on the results, the most favorable recommended procedure is turning twice a week for the first two weeks, followed by weekly turning for the next two weeks. After that, turning can be stopped unless additional removal of moisture is needed. In this case, weekly turning should continue until the process is completed. The size of the pile should follow the surface-to-volume ratio: &lt; 2.5 and &lt; 2 for cooler ambient conditions. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Beach ridge evolution during the Holocene Climatic Optimum at Río de la Plata estuary, Argentina: Former answers for future questions?
VL  - 638
SP  - 56-69
AB  - The Holocene shows rapid climatic changes associated with alternating intervals of glacier advances and retreats. The coastal regions, where beach ridges constitute common preserved landforms, are highly sensitive to register such changes and bring light into past littoral environments. Excellent marine Argentinean Holocene deposits associated with the last climate optimum are preserved at the Río de la Plata estuary (Argentina). In this beach ridge, fourteen detailed sedimentary logs were studied in order to generate an palaeoenvironmental model. The analysis of major hierarchy surfaces of the ridge was performed combined field work and Virtual-Outcrop analysis. The ridge presents internal clinoforms that subdivide it into eleven clinothems. The first two clinothems correspond to the development of a sand ridge as a response to the erosion and reworking of previous aeolian Late Pleistocene sediments. Subsequently, a bioclastic ridge was amalgamated with the sand ridge (clinothems III to XI). Simultaneously, in a landward position, a lagoon and washover deposits were developed. Finally, after the stabilization of the beach ridge the continuous sea level fall generated the actual coastal plain deposits. Six 14C ages were obtained at the base of selected clinothems, dated between 5,240 ± 110 cal BP and 3,900 ± 90 cal BP; meaning that in 1,340 years the beach prograded 290 m. Stable isotope analyses (δ13C and δ18O) allowed to infer that the temperature during the evolution of the ridge has two maximum values of 22.5 °C and a minimum of 18.5 °C. The salinity range between 32.53‰ and 33.16‰, showing short variability. The sudden change in the composition of the ridge, from sandy to carbonate sediments, may be interpreted as a combined result of an increase of carbonate productivity along with a decrease of siliciclastic supply at the coast. This stage would have been developed approximately around 5ka B.P., in coincidence with the Holocene Climatic Optimum (as recorded in Argentina) when propitious climatic conditions may have led to the proliferation of large communities of warm and warm temperate benthic organisms. We stress that, the strong activity of the Brazilian current during the Mid-Holocene thermal maximum enabled excellent conditions for the development of a carbonate warm beach similar to that occurring at tropical and subtropical areas nowadays. This study provides an example of the strong changes occurred in coastal environments as a result of climate change, particularly in the context of global warming episodes which characterized interglacial periods of the Late Quaternary in eastern South America. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA

TI  - The roles of phenotypic plasticity and adaptation in morphology and performance of an invasive species in a novel environment
VL  - 47
IS  - 1
SP  - 25-37
AB  - 1. Species introductions provide insights into how populations respond to new environments and selection pressures through rapid adaptation and adaptive phenotypic plasticity. However, maladaptive responses are increasingly recognised to also be common in nature. The spotted-wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii, has rapidly invaded divergent environments providing the opportunity to examine adaptive and maladaptive phenotypic and evolutionary responses to its introduced range. 2. We studied how population density in the field and wing size of individuals varied over an elevational gradient on Hawaii. We then conducted a reciprocal common garden experiment to evaluate how temperature influenced wing size and other correlates of fitness. We did this by reciprocally rearing D. suzukii collected from low and high elevations in temperatures representative of low and high elevation. 3. We observed a wing size increase with elevation. Additionally, flies were more abundant at higher elevation. In the reciprocal common garden experiment, flies emerged faster in the warm, low-elevation temperature and developed larger wings in the cool, high-elevation temperature. Emergence of flies from high- and low-elevation sites showed a pattern suggesting maladaptation to the temperature representing their home environment. 4. We suggest that opposing selection pressures, the high vagility of flies, and extreme plasticity in body size constrain adaptation to temperature along an elevational gradient. Although successful invasive species such as D. suzukii often exhibit local adaptation, this research demonstrates that invasive species can be successful even without such adaptation. © 2021 The Royal Entomological Society.

TI  - Behavioral constraints on local adaptation and counter-gradient variation: Implications for climate change
VL  - 10
IS  - 13
SP  - 6688-6701
AB  - Resource allocation to growth, reproduction, and body maintenance varies within species along latitudinal gradients. Two hypotheses explaining this variation are local adaptation and counter-gradient variation. The local adaptation hypothesis proposes that populations are adapted to local environmental conditions and are therefore less adapted to environmental conditions at other locations. The counter-gradient variation hypothesis proposes that one population out performs others across an environmental gradient because its source location has greater selective pressure than other locations. Our study had two goals. First, we tested the local adaptation and counter-gradient variation hypotheses by measuring effects of environmental temperature on phenotypic expression of reproductive traits in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus orbicollis Say, from three populations along a latitudinal gradient in a common garden experimental design. Second, we compared patterns of variation to evaluate whether traits covary or whether local adaptation of traits precludes adaptive responses by others. Across a latitudinal range, N. orbicollis exhibits variation in initiating reproduction and brood sizes. Consistent with local adaptation: (a) beetles were less likely to initiate breeding at extreme temperatures, especially when that temperature represents their source range; (b) once beetles initiate reproduction, source populations produce relatively larger broods at temperatures consistent with their local environment. Consistent with counter-gradient variation, lower latitude populations were more successful at producing offspring at lower temperatures. We found no evidence for adaptive variation in other adult or offspring performance traits. This suite of traits does not appear to coevolve along the latitudinal gradient. Rather, response to selection to breed within a narrow temperature range may preclude selection on other traits. Our study highlights that N. orbicollis uses temperature as an environmental cue to determine whether to initiate reproduction, providing insight into how behavior is modified to avoid costly reproductive attempts. Furthermore, our results suggest a temperature constraint that shapes reproductive behavior. © 2020 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Origin of postcollisional magmas and formation of porphyry Cu deposits in southern Tibet
VL  - 181
SP  - 122-143
AB  - The recent discovery of large porphyry copper deposits (PCDs) associated with Miocene (22-12 Ma) granitoid magmas in the eastern section of the Paleocene-Eocene Gangdese magmatic arc in the Himalaya-Tibetan orogenic belt raises new questions about the origin of water-rich (>= 4.5 wt.%), oxidized (Delta FMQ 1-3) magmas in continental collisional settings and their mineralization potential. We review the literature and compile available data on whole rock and isotope geochemistry for Cenozoic igneous rocks from Tibet, and add new zircon Ce4+/Ce3+ and Ti-in-zircon thermometry data to better understand variations in oxidation state and thermal evolution of these suites, which are key controls on Cu mineralization. Six distinct Cenozoic igneous suites are defined: Paleocene-Eocene syn-collisional Gangdese magmatic arc rocks (Delta FMQ = -1.2 to +0.8) (suite I), and five broadly contemporaneous Miocene suites. A distinct change in magmatism along the length of the belt occurs at around 88 degrees E in the Miocene suites: to the east, porphyry copper mineralization is associated with a moderately oxidized, high-Sr/Y granitoid suite (suite II, Delta FMQ = + 0.8 to + 2.9) with minor occurrences of transitional (hybrid) monzonitic (suite III) and trachytic rocks (suite IV; both with zircon Ce4+/Ce3+ > 50-100, Eu-N/Eu-N* = similar to 0.5, and Delta FMQ = +1 to + 2). To the west of 88 degrees E, trachytic volcanic rocks (suite V) are more voluminous but more reduced (zircon Ce4+/Ce3+ < 50, Delta FMQ < + 1), and are associated with sparse, poorly mineralized high-Sr/Y granitoids (suite VI) which are moderately oxidized (zircon Ce4+/Ce3+ = 20-100, Delta FMQ = + 1 to + 3). The Miocene high-Sr/Y granitoids have many compositional and isotopic similarities to the Paleocene-Eocene Gangdese arc rocks, and are interpreted to have been derived by melting of the hydrated arc root, with minor mantle input. In contrast, the highly evolved isotopic signatures of the Miocene trachytic rocks, combined with deep seismic profiles and a xenolith-derived geotherm, suggest their derivation from the underthrust Indian Proterozoic subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) or old fore-arc Tibetan SCLM during phlogopite breakdown at temperatures of similar to 1100 degrees C. Based on published geophysical data and tectonic reconstructions, we develop a model that explains the origin of the various Miocene magmatic suites, their spatial differences, and the origin of related PCDs. Following the early stages of continental collision (Eocene Oligocene), shallow underthrusting of the Indian continental lithosphere and subcretion of Tethyan sediments (including oxidized carbonates and possibly evaporites) under eclogite facies conditions promoted the release of aqueous fluids, which hydrated and oxidized the base of the overlying Tibetan plate. This metasomatism rendered the Tibetan lower crust fusible and fertile for metal remobilization. During the mid-Miocene, the Indian slab steepened in the eastern sector (east of similar to 88 degrees E). In this eastern belt, deeply derived trachytic magmas were trapped in melt zones at the base of the Tibetan crust, and variably mixed with the crustally-derived, high Sr/Y granitoid magmas. They may also have released water that contributed to fluid-fluxed melting of the lower crust, producing voluminous high-Sr/Y granitoid magmas, which were associated with significant PCD mineralization. Hybridization between the trachytic magmas and lower crustal partial melts is indicated by intermediate isotopic compositions, enriched Cr and Ni contents, and high Mg-# in some intermediate-to-felsic (56-70 wt. % SiO2) high-Sr/Y granitoids. Trapping of the trachytic melts in deep crustal melt zones explains the relatively small volumes of trachytic magmas erupted at surface in the east. In contrast, to the west of similar to 88 degrees E, subduction of the Indian plate has remained flat to the present day, preventing incursion of hot asthenosphere. Consequently, cooler conditions in the deep Tibetan lithosphere resulted in limited crustal melting and the production of only small volumes of high-Sr/Y granitic magmas. Trachytic melts ascending from the underthrust Indian or Tibetan plate were able to pass through the cooler lower crust and erupted in greater volume at surface, whereas only small volumes of high-Sr/Y granitoid magma were generated and are not associated with significant PCD mineralization.

VL  - 2019
AB  - Being an assembly of highly sophisticated protein machines, cells depend heavily on proteostatic modules functionality and on adequate supply of energetic molecules for maintaining proteome stability. Yet, our understanding of the adaptations induced by multigenerational proteotoxic stress is limited. We report here that multigenerational (>80 generations) proteotoxic stress in OregonR flies induced by constant exposure to developmentally nonlethal doses of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) (G80-BTZ flies) increased proteome instability and redox imbalance, reduced fecundity and body size, and caused neuromuscular defects; it also accelerated aging. G80-BTZ flies were mildly resistant to increased doses of BTZ and showed no age-related loss of proteasome activity; these adaptations correlated with sustained upregulation of proteostatic modules, which however occurred at the cost of minimal responses to increased BTZ doses and increased susceptibility to various types of additional proteotoxic stress, namely, autophagy inhibition or thermal stress. Multigenerational proteome instability and redox imbalance also caused metabolic reprogramming being evidenced by altered mitochondrial biogenesis and suppressed insulin/IGF-like signaling (IIS) in G80-BTZ flies. The toxic effects of multigenerational proteome instability could be partially mitigated by a low-protein diet that extended G80-BTZ flies' longevity. Overall, persistent proteotoxic stress triggers a highly conserved adaptive metabolic response mediated by the IIS pathway, which reallocates resources from growth and longevity to somatic preservation and stress tolerance. Yet, these trade-off adaptations occur at the cost of accelerated aging and/or reduced tolerance to additional stress, illustrating the limited buffering capacity of survival pathways. © 2019 Maria S.

TI  - Organic carbon accumulation at the northern Gondwana paleomargin (Tunisia) during the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event: Sedimentological and geochemical evidence
VL  - 586
AB  - During the early Toarcian (Early Jurassic; ~183 Ma) global environmental changes promoted the expansion of oxygen-deficient conditions across vast shelf areas around the globe. Ocean margin deoxygenation favored the preservation of organic matter in shelf sediments and is considered to reflect a Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE). Higher-level global drivers controlled temperature fluctuations, sea level evolution, oceanic circulation patterns, marine primary productivity, and stable carbon isotope excursions. Lower-level factors, controlled by individual basin bathymetry and paleogeography, operated on local to regional scale and here regulated organic matter accumulation. Accordingly, the T-OAE has been described as global event with a strong regional character. During the Toarcian, preferentially organic matter-lean sediments have been deposited at the northern Gondwana paleomargin. Enhanced connectivity to the Tethys Ocean and low marine primary productivity are considered to have been major factors preventing the formation of oxygen-deficient conditions and organic matter preservation. We here report on early Toarcian sediments from the Châabet El Attaris Section (Tunisia), located at the northern Gondwana paleomargin that episodically became enriched in organic matter. Bio- and chemostratigraphy both confirm that organic matter-rich sediments preferentially formed during the T-OAE but also predate the T-OAE. Sedimentological and micropaleontological characterization in concert with bulk, molecular and stable isotope geochemical investigations reveal that accumulation of marine organic matter occurred under anoxic, but not under euxinic, conditions. Limitation in the supply of reactive iron regulated organic matter sulfurization indicating that during most of the depositional history the levels of free H2S in bottom waters were rather low but limited to the sediment pore water. We conclude that the chemocline was either situated within the sediment or close to the sediment water interface. Spatiotemporally-restricted occurrence of organic matter enriched sediments and anoxic pore waters was promoted by restriction in water column ventilation in a local graben structure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sex-specific microhabitat use is associated with sex-biased thermal physiology in Anolis lizards
VL  - 224
IS  - 2
AB  - If fitness optima for a given trait differ between males and females in a population, sexual dimorphism may evolve. Sex-biased trait variation may affect patterns of habitat use, and if the microhabitats used by each sex have dissimilar microclimates, this can drive sex-specific selection on thermal physiology. Nevertheless, tests of differences between the sexes in thermal physiology are uncommon, and studies linking these differences to microhabitat use or behavior are even rarer. We examined microhabitat use and thermal physiology in two ectothermic congeners that are ecologically similar but differ in their degree of sexual size dimorphism. Brown anoles (Anolis sagrei) exhibit male-biased sexual size dimorphism and live in thermally heterogeneous habitats, whereas slender anoles (Anolis apletophallus) are sexually monomorphic in body size and live in thermally homogeneous habitats. We hypothesized that differences in habitat use between the sexes would drive sexual divergence in thermal physiology in brown anoles, but not slender anoles, because male and female brown anoles may be exposed to divergent microclimates. We found that male and female brown anoles, but not slender anoles, used perches with different thermal characteristics and were sexually dimorphic in thermal tolerance traits. However, field-active body temperatures and behavior in a laboratory thermal arena did not differ between females and males in either species. Our results suggest that sexual dimorphism in thermal physiology can arise from phenotypic plasticity or sex-specific selection on traits that are linked to thermal tolerance, rather than from direct effects of thermal environments experienced by males and females. © 2021.

TI  - Shelf-life dating of shelf-stable strawberry juice based on survival analysis of consumer acceptance information
VL  - 98
IS  - 9
SP  - 3437-3445
AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate shelf-life dating of food products is crucial for consumers and industries. Therefore, in this study we applied a science-based approach for shelf-life assessment, including accelerated shelf-life testing (ASLT), acceptability testing and the screening of analytical attributes for fast shelf-life predictions. Shelf-stable strawberry juice was selected as a case study. RESULTS: Ambient storage (20 °C) had no effect on the aroma-based acceptance of strawberry juice. The colour-based acceptability decreased during storage under ambient and accelerated (28-42 °C) conditions. The application of survival analysis showed that the colour-based shelf-life was reached in the early stages of storage (≤11 weeks) and that the shelf-life was shortened at higher temperatures. None of the selected attributes (a* and ΔE* value, anthocyanin and ascorbic acid content) is an ideal analytical marker for shelf-life predictions in the investigated temperature range (20–42 °C). Nevertheless, an overall analytical cut-off value over the whole temperature range can be selected. CONCLUSIONS: Colour changes of strawberry juice during storage are shelf-life limiting. Combining ASLT with acceptability testing allowed to gain faster insight into the change in colour-based acceptability and to perform shelf-life predictions relying on scientific data. An analytical marker is a convenient tool for shelf-life predictions in the context of ASLT. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry

TI  - Comparative Analysis on the Evolution of Seepage Parameters in Methane Hydrate Production under Depressurization of Clayey Silt Reservoir and Sandy Reservoir
VL  - 10
IS  - 5
AB  - Gas hydrates are likely to become an important strategic resource with commercial development prospects. It is therefore of great significance to realize the long-term and efficient production of methane hydrate reservoirs. Previous studies have shown that the lithological characteristics of hydrate reservoirs have a significant impact on reservoir productivity by influencing the evolution of seepage parameters in the process of hydrate production. The porosity (Φ) and initial hydrate saturation (SH) affect the amount of hydrate decomposition and pressure transfer, and also indirectly affect the reservoir temperature field. The permeability (k) directly affects the rate of pressure-drop transmission and methane gas discharge. Due to the differences in seepage parameters caused by different reservoir lithology, a sandy hydrate reservoir (SHR) in Japan and a clayey silt hydrate reservoir (CHR) in China were found to have different gas production rates and the spatial evolution characteristics of the temperature and pressure fields varied in gas hydrate production tests. Therefore, to ensure the long-term and efficient production of the CHR in China, two models were established for a comparative analysis based on a numerical simulation. The two models were depressurizing models of the CHR of the W11 drilling site in the Shenhu Sea area of the South China Sea and the SHR of the AT1 drilling site in the Eastern Nankai Trough of Japan. Both models considered the heterogeneity of seepage parameters, and the TOUGH+HYDARATE (T+H) code was used in subsequent calculations. Four key results were obtained: (a) The order of the significance levels of the lithological parameters on productivity was k > SH > Φ in the CHR and SH > k > Φ in the SHR. (b) The heat conduction and heat convection in the CHR were weaker than in the SHR, which made it difficult to recover the low-temperature area caused by hydrate decomposition. (c) The exploitation of a high k hydrate reservoir should be given priority when the other initial conditions were the same in both the CHR and SHR. (d) The exploitation of both the CHR and SHR should not only rely on the hydrate content or seepage capacity to determine the reservoir exploitation potential, but the combined effect of the two parameters should be fully considered. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Сontrolled breeding of the psychrophilic strain G-034 VIZR of Trichoderma asperellum for fast crop residues’ polymers utilization and soil enhancement
VL  - 23
IS  - 3
SP  - 328-336
AB  - Genus Trichoderma strains as the natural plant residues’ biodestructors, highly active antagonists of soil phytopathogens and phytoregulators with the widest range of optimum conditions for their development, are widely used in biologics development. Of particular importance in Russia’s northern regions, especially in winter crop cultivation, is the ability of a microorganism’s strain used in agro-technologies to maintain viability and target biological activity at low temperatures. In this connection, this work purpose is to select a psychrotolerant strain of T. asperellum for the rapid crop residues’ polymer utilization and soil enhancement at low temperature, as well as to evaluate its activity under laboratory and field conditions. In the work process, the following tasks were addressed: selecting psychrotolerant strains of T. asperellum with high cellulolytic activity; further controlled breeding of psychrophilic strains capable of rapid growth, active colonization of plant substrates and high sporulation at 4–8 °C; evaluating the target activity of the selected psychrophilic strain as a cellulolytic as well as antagonistic activity against cereal pathogens; obtaining laboratory samples of bioformulations by deep-surface cultivation on non-sterile peat and multirecycled wastes from the edible mushrooms production and assessing their efficacy in field small-plot trials. The methods for inoculum cultivation, sporulation capacity determination, modified wet chamber, estimating antagonistic activity and biologics’ quality, field small-plot trials management, quantitative estimates of biomass losses, cellulose and lignin content were used in the work. The active psychrophilic strain for the rapid crop residues’ polymer utilization and soil enhancement controlled breeding was selected during a four-step screening of 29 T. asperellum strains from All-Russian Research Institute of Plant Protection (VIZR) State Microorganisms’ Collection with high cellulolytic and antagonistic activities. In terms of linear growth rate, antagonistic and hyperparasitic activities at 4–8 °С, a high rate of wheat and maize stubble residues’ colonization, a perspective psychrophilic strain G-034 of T. asperellum was selected for developing the laboratory samples of biologics and for running field trials. In small-plot trials, the active maize crop residues’ decomposition under the T. asperellum G-034 influence was revealed, resulting in the complete loss of plant intact state in 12 months due to more than 80 % cellulose and 20 % lignin biodestruction. The maximum loss of maize crop residues biomass for 12 months was more than 70 %. The T. asperellum strain G-034 was active after field hibernation in an amount of ×104 cfu/g, resulting in a titer increase with seasonal temperature rising and the trophic base bioavailability growth. © 2019 Institute of Cytology and Genetics of Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Evolution of the minimum mortality temperature (1983–2018): Is Spain adapting to heat?
VL  - 784
AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze at the level of Spain's 52 provinces province level the temporal evolution of minimum mortality temperatures (MMT) from 1983 to 2018, in order to determine whether the increase in MMT would be sufficient to compensate for the increase in environmental temperatures in Spain for the period. It also aimed to analyze whether the rate of evolution of MMT would be sufficient, were it to remain constant, to compensate for the predicted increase in temperatures in an unfavorable (RCP 8.5) emissions scenario for the time horizon 2051–2100. The independent variable was made up of maximum daily temperature data (Tmax) for the summer months in the reference observatories of each province for the 1983–2018 period. The dependent variable was daily mortality rate due to natural causes (ICD 10: A00-R99). For each year and province, MMT was determined using a quadratic or cubic fit (p < 0.05). Based on the annual MMT values, a linear fit was carried out that allowed for determining the time evolution of MMT. These values were compared with the evolution of Tmax registered in each observatory during the 1983–2018 analyzed period and with the predicted values of Tmax obtained for an RCP8.5 scenario for the period 2051–2100. The rate of global variance in Tmax in the summer months in Spain during the 1983–2018 period was 0.41 °C/decade, while MMT across the whole country increased at a rate of 0.64 °C/decade. Variations in the provinces were heterogeneous. For the 2051–2100 time horizon, there was predicted increase in Tmax values of 0.66 °C/decade, with marked geographical differences. Although at the global level it is possible to speak of adaptation, the heterogeneities among the provinces suggest that the local level measures are needed in order to facilitate adaptation in those areas where it is not occurring. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Countergradient Variation in Reptiles: Thermal Sensitivity of Developmental and Metabolic Rates Across Locally Adapted Populations
VL  - 11
AB  - Environmental temperature is a key driver of variation in developmental physiological rates in reptiles. Cooler temperatures extend development time and can increase the amount of energy required to achieve hatching success, which can pose fitness consequences later in life. Yet, for locally-adapted populations, genetic variation can oppose environmental variation across ecological gradients, known as countergradient variation (CnGV). Biologists often seek to understand the presence of phenotypic variation, yet the absence of such variation across environmental gradients can also reveal insights into the mechanisms underlying local adaptation. While evidence for genetic variation opposing environmental variation in physiological rates has been summarized in other taxa, the generality of CnGV variation in reptiles is yet unknown. Here I present a summary of studies measuring development time and metabolic rates in locally-adapted populations across thermal clines for 15 species of reptiles across 8 families. CnGV in development time is found to be common, while no clear pattern emerges for the thermal sensitivity of metabolic rates across locally-adapted populations. CnGV in development time may be an adaptive response in order to decrease the costly development in cool climates, however, empirical work is needed to disentangle plastic from genetic responses, and to uncover potentially general mechanisms of local thermal adaptation in reptiles. © Copyright © 2020 Pettersen.

TI  - An approach to identify and select optimal temperature-sensitive measuring points for thermal error compensation modeling in CNC machines: A case study using cantilever beam
VL  - 45
SP  - 264-269
AB  - In the Present machine tool industry, CNC machine tools are capable of meeting the demands like high productivity, high precision and reliability. But, accuracy of the machine tools is greatly affected by three types of errors, 1) geometric error, 2) thermal error and 3) cutting force induced error. Among these errors thermal error contributes more than 70% of total error. Thermal error management on machine tool is done through two approaches; they are 1) Thermal error reduction approach and 2) Thermal error compensation approach. This work deals with only thermal error compensation approach. Identification of thermal sensitive region on machine tool is the most challenging task of thermal error compensation. Thermal imaging is an experimental method which is currently being used to identify thermal sensitive region on machine tool. But this method is associated with more time, human efforts and high cost. Hence, in this work, two numerical methods such as thermal error sensitive method and thermal modal analysis method were used identify the thermal sensitive region. Here, cantilever beam was considered as a case study to illustrate the selection of thermal sensitive points. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The factors that control the fertility (e.g. capacity to form an ore deposits) of a magmatic system are still a matter of debate, requiring more studies on the evolution of ore-related magmas. This study presents a detailed reconstruction of the magmatic system forming the Stiavnica volcano, the biggest mineralized center of the Western Carpathians (Central Slovakia). The Stiavnica volcano represents an interesting study object because the magmatic system was sulfide-saturated during its entire evolution, and porphyry systems with contrasting Cu/Au ratio are present in the same volcano. This situation allows to study the impact of magmatic sulfide saturation on the Cu/Au ratio of porphyry deposits. Pressure, temperature, and the compositional evolution of pre-, syn-, and post-mineralization magmas were reconstructed based on the chemical composition of phenocrysts and hosted silicate melt inclusions and sulfide inclusions. Dominantly andesitic magmas forming the volcanic and intrusive rocks of the volcano were sourced from an upper crustal (similar to 1 to similar to 3 kbar) reservoir in which most phenoaysts grew from a sulfide-saturated dacitic to rhyolitic melt. This upper crustal magmatic reservoir was active during >3 My, and most ore-deposits, including Cu-Au porphyries, formed during cooling periods where the residual melt reached fluid saturation. In contrast, the Au-only porphyry deposit formed alter shallow emplacement (<1 km) of a hot magma that was produced by mixing between a magma derived from a lower crustal (>8 kbar) reservoir and one from the upper crustal reservoir. Inclusions of monosulfide solid solution were found in phenoaysts crystallizing over a large range of temperature and pressure in ore-related and barren magmas suggesting that sulfide saturation doesn't play a critical role on the fertility of the magmatic system. Finally, this study reveals that composition of the magmatic sulfides does not play a direct role in the Cu/Au ratio of the formed porphyry deposits. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sceloporus (S. aenus and S. scalaris) are oviparous sibling lizard species inhabiting high mountain zones (>2700 m) in central México. Females of these species lay their eggs in soil mounds left by burrowing gophers (Pappogeomys). Numerous abiotic factors can affect site selection and subsequent development of the lizard embryos, but little is known of the relationship between the optimal physical and chemical variables of the surrounding soil that allow development and successful hatching of the eggs, especially in high-elevation environments. We hypothesized that soil parameters and temperature drive site selections by females seeking nest locations favorable to embryonic development. We recorded differences in the abiotic parameters of soil mounds between dry and rainy seasons, irrespective of whether the mounds contained eggs. Statistical analyses revealed that an environment of high relative humidity and stable temperatures necessary for mound selection as a nesting site were associated with intermediate moisture content, high organic matter content, high values of cation exchange capacity, and relatively high porosity of the soil substrate. Collectively, these values of abiotic soil traits prevent sudden changes in temperature and humidity at the nest depth, providing conditions that promote successful development and hatching. Understanding the relative importance of these abiotic factors in nest site selection by Sceloporus should contribute to an understanding of the adaptations of oviparous reptiles that reproduce in different environments. © 2019 by The Herpetologists' League, Inc.

TI  - High elevation insect communities face shifting ecological and evolutionary landscapes
VL  - 41
SP  - 1-6
AB  - Climate change is proceeding rapidly in high mountain regions worldwide. Rising temperatures will impact insect physiology and associated fitness and will shift populations in space and time, thereby altering community interactions and composition. Shifts in space are expected as insects move upslope to escape warming temperatures and shifts in time will occur with changes in phenology of resident high-elevation insects. Clearly, spatiotemporal shifts will not affect all species equally. Terrestrial insects may have more opportunities than aquatic insects to exploit microhabitats, potentially buffering them from warming. Such responses of insects to warming may also fuel evolutionary change, including hitchhiking of maladaptive alleles and genetic rescue. Together, these considerations suggest a striking restructuring of high-elevation insect communities that remains largely unstudied. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The Effects of High Altitude on Glucose Homeostasis, Metabolic Control, and Other Diabetes-Related Parameters: From Animal Studies to Real Life
VL  - 20
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-11
AB  - Exposure to high altitude activates several complex and adaptive mechanisms aiming to protect human homeostasis from extreme environmental conditions, such as hypoxia and low temperatures. Short-term exposure is followed by transient hyperglycemia, mainly triggered by the activation of the sympathetic system, whereas long-term exposure results in lower plasma glucose concentrations, mediated by improved insulin sensitivity and augmented peripheral glucose disposal. An inverse relationship between altitude, diabetes, and obesity has been well documented. This is the result of genetic and physiological adaptations principally to hypoxia that favorably affect glucose metabolism; however, the contribution of financial, dietary, and other life-style parameters may also be important. According to existing evidence, people with diabetes are capable of undertaking demanding physical challenges even at extreme altitudes. Still, a number of issues should be taken into account, including the increased physical activity leading to changes in insulin demands and resistance, the performance of measurement systems under extreme weather conditions and the potential deterioration of metabolic control during climbing expeditions. The aim of this review is to present available evidence in the field in a comprehensive way, beginning from the physiology of glucose homeostasis adaptation mechanisms to high altitudes and ending to what real life experience has taught us. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

VL  - 79

SP  - 587-600
AB  - Animals actively select the most suitable habitat in terms of fitness, much of which is mediated by temperature. We reconstructed population abundance, oxygen isotope and temperature chronologies for the Icelandic and the Northeast Arctic (NEA) cod (Gadus morhua) populations to determine if their temperature selectivity over the last 100 years was driven by rising water temperatures and (or) changes in abundance. Individual annual growth increments from immature and mature life history stages of cod collected in southern Iceland and the Lofoten area (Norway) were micromilled from adult otoliths and then assayed for stable oxygen isotopes (d18Ootolith). Linear mixed effect models were used to identify and quantify the density-dependent temperature exposure of both cod populations. The results indicated that Icelandic cod migrated into warmer waters with increasing abundance (p &lt; 0.05), whereas NEA cod moved into colder waters (p &lt; 0.001). Our results suggest that thermal preferences and density-dependent effects can be used to forecast potential redistribution scenarios of fish as oceans warm. © Canadian Science Publishing.

VL  - 21

SP  - 22414-22425
AB  - As 2D materials are aggressively penetrating the arena of conventional metal oxides-based gas sensors, tungsten disulfide (WS2) as a 'beyond graphene and beyond MoS2 layered material' is appearing with shining visibility owing to its exquisite electronic, surface, optical, physicochemical and thermal properties. Micromechanically exfoliated or homogeneously/heterogeneously synthesized mono/few-layer(s) of this transition metal di-chalcogenide (TMDCs), with excellent tunability of almost all the properties, have intrigued worldwide gas sensor researchers to demonstrate various device configurations using WS2 leading to ultrahigh sensitivity with ppb level detection capacity even at room temperature. This review article presents a holistic overview of the WS2 based gas sensors encompassing the impact(s) of the different device architectures (viz. planar, Schottky, heterojunctions, field-effect, and heterojunction bipolar transistors) on the gas sensing performance indices (like sensitivity, selectivity, response/recovery time, humidity effect and baseline drift). Starting with the brief overview of the sensing mechanism of WS2, followed by elaborate discussions on the unique features/advantages and bottlenecks of each of the innovative device architecture investigated, this review concludes by focusing the possible direction to circumvent the most common challenges (like slow and incomplete recovery, vulnerability to humidity and oxidation), that slacken the commercial viability of such devices. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

VL  - 34
AB  - Overfishing has changed the life histories of commercially harvested marine fishes worldwide. The Jamaican weakfish, Cynoscion jamaicensis, which has been caught by trawl fisheries off southern Brazil since the 1950s, was sampled in two periods (1977-80 and 2016-17) to study its life history and changes in growth and sexual maturation and assess its spawning potential ratio. The annual formation of one opaque band on the otoliths was validated, and the oldest sampled fish was a 9-year-old male. Growth patterns did not differ between sexes. The von Bertalanffy growth parameter L-infinity increased with time, and the growth curves were significantly different between periods. Fish of the same age classes were significantly larger, heavier and had higher allometric condition factors in the most recent period than those in the first period. Reproduction occurs seasonally from late spring to early autumn, and the length and age at first maturity decreased between periods. Based on the length distributions obtained in 2016-17, the spawning potential ratio was between 57 and 62%, suggesting a moderate decrease in the abundance of the species in the region. The changes in growth are likely due to density-dependent processes because of the intense fishing that decreased the abundance of the species and of its main competitors. The changes in maturation parameters are more difficult to explain since there are three possible drivers: density-dependent processes and increasing water temperatures for the changes in the age at first maturity and increasing water temperatures and genotypic responses to differential selection for the changes in the size at first maturity. Although C. jamaicensis can be considered a resilient species due to its life history characteristics, the intense biomass removal by fishing in southern Brazil has changed its population dynamics and reduced its spawning potential.

TI  - Transcriptional regulation underlying the temperature response of embryonic development rate in the winter moth
AB  - Climate change will strongly affect the developmental timing of insects, as their development rate depends largely on ambient temperature. However, we know little about the genetic mechanisms underlying the temperature sensitivity of embryonic development in insects. We investigated embryonic development rate in the winter moth (Operophtera brumata), a species with egg dormancy which has been under selection due to climate change. We used RNA sequencing to investigate which genes are involved in the regulation of winter moth embryonic development rate in response to temperature. Over the course of development, we sampled eggs before and after an experimental change in ambient temperature, including two early development weeks when the temperature sensitivity of eggs is low and two late development weeks when temperature sensitivity is high. We found temperature-responsive genes that responded in a similar way across development, as well as genes with a temperature response specific to a particular development week. Moreover, we identified genes whose temperature effect size changed around the switch in temperature sensitivity of development rate. Interesting candidate genes for regulating the temperature sensitivity of egg development rate included genes involved in histone modification, hormonal signalling, nervous system development and circadian clock genes. The diverse sets of temperature-responsive genes we found here indicate that there are many potential targets of selection to change the temperature sensitivity of embryonic development rate. Identifying for which of these genes there is genetic variation in wild insect populations will give insight into their adaptive potential in the face of climate change. © 2022 The Authors.

VL  - 169

AB  - Deployment of lethal food baits could become a control tactic for the invasive European fire ant (EFA), Myrmica rubra L. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), because foraging ants carry the lethal food to their nest and share it with their nest mates, ultimately causing the demise of nests. Our objective was to develop a food bait that elicits a strong foraging response from EFAs, has extended shelf life, and is cost-effective to produce. To develop a bait composition with ‘ant appeal’, we ran two separate field experiments testing pre-selected carbohydrate sources (oranges, apples, bananas) and protein/lipid sources [tuna, pollen, sunflower seeds, mealworms (Tenebrio molitor L., Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)]. Whereas foraging EFAs responded equally well to the three types of carbohydrates, they preferred mealworms to all other protein/lipid sources. In a follow-up laboratory experiment, the combination of apples and mealworms elicited a stronger foraging response from EFAs than either apples or mealworms alone. To help reduce bait ingredient costs, we tested house crickets, Acheta domesticus (L.) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), as a less expensive mealworm alternative and found crickets and mealworms comparably appealing. Addressing the shelf life of baits, we tested freeze-dried and heat-dried apple/cricket combinations. Rehydrated freeze-dried baits proved as appealing as fresh baits and superior to rehydrated heat-dried baits, suggesting that freeze-drying may retain essential nutrients and/or aroma constituents. Insecticide-laced baits had no off-putting effect on foraging responses of worker ants and caused significant mortality. As freeze-drying is expensive, further research should investigate the preservation of moist food baits or the development of dry baits that are hydrated prior to deployment. © 2021 The Netherlands Entomological Society

AB  - The European brown shrimp, Crangon crangon, is a highly valued commercial species in Europe. These shrimp fisheries are characterized by strong seasonal variations in average landings. Attempts to ‘catch and hold’ wild adults in land-based rearing systems have been proven to be very difficult, due to inadequate feed, slow growth and high mortality. In this study, we have optimized design and operation procedures of a small-scale static larval rearing system for the culture of C. crangon larvae. Focus was on optimizing larval survival via water temperature, feed selection, feeding regime and density. This is the first report that shows that C. crangon larvae can be reared at high densities of 300 larvae L-1 with high survival of 73.5 (± 5.4)% under laboratory conditions. In these systems, larvae can be fed exclusively Artemia nauplii according to a feeding regime which is adjusted based on major moulting events. Addition of microalgae may further increase survival by 10%. The information gathered during this research can be applied to further optimize larval development in either flow-through or recirculation systems. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

VL  - 31
IS  - 4
SP  - 765-775
AB  - Aim: Understanding variation in offspring energy expenditure is important because energy is critical for growth and development. Weather may exert proximate effects on offspring energy expenditure, but in altricial species these might be masked by parental care and huddling with siblings. Such effects are particularly important to understand given changing global weather patterns, yet studies of wild offspring in the presence of parental care are lacking. Offspring energy expenditure may also vary among species due to evolved responses to environmental selection pressures, requiring studies at both proximate and ultimate levels. Location: USA, South Africa, Malaysia. Time period: 2016–2019. Major taxa studied: Songbirds. Methods: We used the doubly-labelled water technique to estimate nestling daily energy expenditure of 54 songbird species across three continents. We used Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models to test proximate and evolutionary causes of variation in offspring energy expenditure while accounting for phylogeny and phylogenetic uncertainty. Results: Offspring energy expenditure increased with more rainfall and colder air temperatures, but decreased among offspring in broods with more siblings. Across species, nestling and adult mortality, but not growth rate, were positively associated with offspring energy use. Main conclusions: Weather had clear proximate effects on offspring energy expenditure and parents were either unable or unwilling to fully offset these effects. However, the decrease in offspring energy use when huddling with more siblings demonstrated a modulating effect of life history traits. For example, high nest predation rates favour reduced parental care and can force offspring to spend more energy coping with environmental conditions. Furthermore, reduced energy expenditure is thought to facilitate increased longevity, which is increasingly realized with lower extrinsic mortality rates, providing an explanation for the positive association between adult mortality and offspring energy expenditure. Ultimately, both proximate and evolutionary influences need to be considered to better understand causes of offspring energetics. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Genetic variation in the heat-stress survival of embryos is largely decoupled from adult thermotolerance in an intercontinental set of recombinant lines of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 102
AB  - In insects, thermal adaptation works on the genetic variation for thermotolerance of not only larvae and adults but also of the immobile stages of the life cycle including eggs. In contrast to adults and larvae, the genetic basis for thermal adaptation in embryos (eggs) remains to be tested in the model insect Drosophila melanogaster. Quantitative-trait loci (QTL) for heat-stress resistance in embryos could largely differ from previously identified QTL for larvae and adults. Here we used an intercontinental set of recombinant inbred lines (RIL), which were previously used to identify thermotolerance-QTLs in adults and larvae because of their high variation segregating for adult thermotolerance. Eggs appeared to be more heat resistant than larvae and adults from previous studies on these RIL, though different heat-shock assays were used in previous studies. We found that variation in thermotolerance in embryos can be, at least partially, genetically decoupled from thermotolerance in the adult insect. Some RIL that are heat resistant in the adult and larvae can be heat susceptible in embryos. Only one small-effect QTL out of five autosomal QTL co-localized between embryo and other ontogenetic stages. These results suggest that selection for thermal adaptation in adult flies and larvae is predicted to have only a small impact on embryo thermotolerance. In addition, heat-stress tolerance of insects can be measured across ontogenetic stages including embryos in order to better predict thermal adaptive limits of populations and species. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Evaluation of the thermal tolerances of different strains of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss by measuring the effective time required for loss of equilibrium at an approximate upper lethal temperature
VL  - 85
IS  - 5
SP  - 839-845
AB  - The thermal tolerance phenotypes of different strains of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss was investigated in this study. The time at which a fish, acclimated to 17 °C, was no longer able to maintain its equilibrium after reaching the test temperature of 28 °C was recorded as its effective time (ET) in the zone of thermal resistance and used as a parameter of its thermal tolerance. The ET was compared among two strains of rainbow trout, thermally selected and Nikko, and two types of their hybrid progenies (thermally selected male × normal female and thermally selected female × normal male), using 14–15 individuals of each group in tests. Individuals of the thermally selected strain with smaller bodies had a longer ET than those with lager bodies. Five groups of F2 juveniles produced from a full-sibling cross of F1 progenies (Nikko strain females × thermally selected strain males), each containing 40 or 41 individuals, had an ET of 39.3–46.4 min, which was not significantly correlated with body size. Although its ET was influenced by body size, the thermally selected strain showed good thermal tolerance at all body sizes. Moreover, the coefficient of variation of ET was 32–39%, suggesting there was a wide diversity of ET values. Because samples subjected to ET experiments can recover and survive, ET is a promising, convenient indicator to use when examining thermal tolerance phenotypes of large numbers of individuals, which can subsequently provide live individuals with inherited thermal tolerance for use in selective breeding. © 2019, Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

VL  - 191

AB  - Elevated plasma potassium levels (hyperkalemia), reduced plasma pH (acidosis), reduced blood oxygen content, and elevated temperatures are associated with species-specific rates of at-vessel and post-release mortality in elasmobranch fishes. The mechanism linking these physiological disturbances to mortality remains undetermined however, and we hypothesize that the proximate cause is reduced myocardial function. We measured changes in the functional properties of isolated ventricular myocardial strips from clearnose skate (Rostroraja eglanteria), smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis), and sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) when subjected to the following stressors (both in isolation and in combination): hyperkalemia (7.4 mM K+), acidosis (from 7.9 to 7.1), and reduced oxygen (to 31% O2 saturation) applied at temperatures 5 °C above and below holding temperatures. We selected these species based on phylogenetic distance, diverse routine activity levels, and their tolerance to capture and transport. Stressors had a few significant species-specific detrimental impacts on myocardial function (e.g., a 33–45% decrease in net force under acidosis + low O2). Net force production of myocardial strips from clearnose skate and smooth dogfish approximately doubled following exposure to isoproterenol, demonstrating that these species possess beta-adrenergic receptors and that their stimulation could provide a mechanism for preservation of cardiac function during stress. Our results suggest that disruption of physiological homeostasis associated with capture may fatally impair cardiac function in some elasmobranch species, although research with more severe stressors is needed. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - “Take It or Leave It”—Factors Regulating Competence Development and DNA Uptake in Campylobacter jejuni
VL  - 22
IS  - 18
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni has a large adaptive potential due to enormous genetic exchange. Factors regulating natural transformation in this food‐borne pathogen are largely unknown but of in-terest for the application of sustained reduction strategies in the food‐processing industry. Using a single cell DNA uptake assay, we visualized that recognition of methylated C. jejuni DNA was essential for the first step of DNA uptake into a DNase resistant state. Transformation rates using a resistance marker correlated with the fraction of competent bacteria, harboring one to maximally four locations of active DNA uptake, not necessarily being located at the cell pole. Competence de-veloped with rising pH between 6.5 and 7.5 under microaerobic conditions and was nearly insensi-tive towards growth temperatures between 32 °C and 42 °C, CO2 concentrations ranging from 0 to 50% and growth rates. However, competence development was abolished at pH 5 or under aerobic stress conditions, in which the bacteria ceased growth but fully survived. The DNA uptake machinery in competent bacteria shut down at slightly acidic pH and was reversibly switched on upon neutralization. It was dependent on the proton motive force and, in contrast to competence devel-opment, slightly enhanced under aerobic conditions. The results suggest that natural transformation in C. jejuni occurs in the neutral and microaerobic intestinal environment for enhanced genetic diversity and pre‐adaption before host switch. In addition, highly competent bacteria might be shed into the environment, still able to acquire genetic material for increased survival. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Objective: Numerous epidemiological studies have reported relevance of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases with short-term exposure to environmental temperature. In this study, we examined the hypothesis between temperature indices and hospital admission because of cardiovascular diseases. Methods: The daily number of CVDs was obtained from all hospitals of the Sabzevar city. A semi-parametric generalized additive model (GAM) following a quasi-Poisson distribution with distributed lag non-linear model (dlnm) was selected as a modeling framework for time-series analysis. Results: The overall CVD risk comparing the 1st percentile and the 99th percentile relative to the mean temperature (at lag 0) was 1.33 (95% CI, 1.11: 1.61), and 1.34 (95% CI, 1.10: 1.64), respectively. For all indicators, the extremely cold effects persisted for the initial 7 days. Conclusions: Our results suggest that extremely cold and extremely hot temperatures increase the relative risk of cardiovascular diseases. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Different responses between orange variant and cultured population of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas at early life stage to temperature-salinity combinations
VL  - 49
IS  - 6
SP  - 2233-2239
AB  - Although breeding of rare shell colour variants has drawn widespread attention from shellfish breeders, the potential disadvantages of their adaptive capacity have been ignored in practice. To explore the difference in adaptive capacity between orange shell variant (OSO) and commercially cultured population (CPO) of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas at early life stage, the development to D-larvae and larval survival and growth (just 23 and 30 degrees C for larval experiment) of them were compared under different temperature (16, 23 and 30 degrees C) and salinity (17, 25 and 33 psu) combinations. In this study, at 23 degrees C and 25 psu, for both OSO and CPO there was no difference in fertilization rates and survival (p > .05) (mean percentages of D-larvae after fertilized 40 hr >= 95.00%; mean larval survival rates on day 10 > 80.00%). However, the percentage of D-larvae of CPO at 40 hr was significantly (p < .05) higher than OSO at temperatures of 16 and 30 degrees C and 25-33 psu and 17 psu at 23 degrees C. Similarly, CPO has a better larval survival on day 10 and growth than OSO at salinities of 17 and 33 psu at 23 degrees C. Overall, our results indicate that OSO can have an equally good performance like CPO at early life stage under optimal condition (23 degrees C; 25 psu), but the potential disadvantages in adaptive capacity will be shown at suboptimal conditions. These findings can guide future hatchery breeding of OSO, and suggest the potential disadvantages in adaptive capacity in rare colour variants need more attention in further breeding.

TI  - Dendrophylliidae cold-water corals in a warm ocean: The effect of exposure duration on their physiological response
VL  - 193
AB  - Deep-sea reef ecosystems are hotspots of biodiversity but are particularly threatened by seawater warming, because the species that live there have evolved within a narrow thermal range. The degree to which cold-water corals (CWCs), the reef builders, can acclimate to changes in their thermal environment requires more investigation. Our study is one of the very first to assess the thermal performance of Dendrophylliidae CWCs on a 2-year basis. Colonies of Dendrophyllia cornigera and D. ramea, collected in the Mediterranean Sea, were exposed during 2 years to their natural mean temperatures (referred as control temperature, CT) or to temperatures being 4 degrees C (T+4) and 8 degrees C (T+8) higher. A 4 degrees C decrease in temperature (T-4) was also tested for D. ramea. Several physiological parameters, such as rates of growth, calcification, and respiration, as well as total organic carbon release were measured after 2 and 20 months of treatment. The results obtained show that Dendrophylliidae corals are able to survive a +4 degrees C over a two-year period, and even a +8 degrees C for D. ramea. The elevation in temperature induced a transient increase in all physiological parameters. However, after 20 months, parameters were significantly decreased compared to the first measurement. At the end of the experiment, growth rates were even significantly lower at T+4 and T+8 compared to the control temperature, suggesting that the coral lifespan is significantly reduced over the long term. Finally, we observed a positive relationship between respiration and calcification rates in these corals, suggesting that the calcification process is dependent on the inorganic carbon provided by respiration. Overall, this study shows that physiological processes in CWC species are slow and that long-term incubations are necessary to predict the impact of climate change on their survival capacities.

VL  - 744
AB  - The role of meteorological factors in the transmission of the COVID-19 still needs to be determined. In this study, the daily new cases of the eight severely affected regions in four countries of South America and their corresponding meteorological data (average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average wind speed, visibility, absolute humidity) were collected. Daily number of confirmed and incubative cases, as well as time-dependent reproductive number (R-t) was calculated to indicate the transmission of the diseases in the population. Spearman's correlation coefficients were assessed to show the correlation between meteorological factors and daily confirmed cases, daily incubative cases, as well as Rt. In particular, the results showed that there was a highly significant correlation between daily incubative cases and absolute humidity throughout the selected regions. Multiple linear regression model further confirmed the negative correlation between absolute humidity and incubative cases. The absolute humidity is predicted to show a decreasing trend in the coming months from the meteorological data of recent three years. Our results suggest the necessity of continuous controlling policy in these areas and some other complementary strategies to mitigate the contagious rate of the COVID-19. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Evolution and plasticity of thermal performance: An analysis of variation in thermal tolerance and fitness in 22 Drosophila species
VL  - 374
IS  - 1778
AB  - The thermal biology of ectotherms is often used to infer species' responses to changes in temperature. It is often proposed that temperate species are more cold-tolerant, less heat-tolerant, more plastic, have broader thermal performance curves (TPCs) and lower optimal temperatures when compared to tropical species. However, relatively little empirical work has provided support for this using large interspecific studies. In the present study, we measure thermal tolerance limits and thermal performance in 22 species of Drosophila that developed under common conditions. Specifically, we measure thermal tolerance (CTmin and CTmax) as well as the fitness components viability, developmental speed and fecundity at seven temperatures to construct TPCs for each of these species. For 10 of the species, we also measure thermal tolerance and thermal performance following developmental acclimation to three additional temperatures. Using these data, we test several fundamental hypotheses about the evolution and plasticity of heat and cold resistance and thermal performance. We find that cold tolerance (CTmin) varied between the species according to the environmental temperature in the habitat from which they originated. These data support the idea that the evolution of cold tolerance has allowed species to persist in colder environments. However, contrary to expectation, we find that optimal temperature (Topt) and the breadth of thermal performance (Tbreadth) are similar in temperate, widespread and tropical species and we also find that the plasticity of TPCs was constrained. We suggest that the temperature range for optimal thermal performance is either fixed or under selection by the more similar temperatures that prevail during growing seasons. As a consequence, we find that Topt and Tbreadth are of limited value for predicting past, present and future distributions of species.

TI  - Hydrophobicity-guided self-assembled particles of silver nanoclusters with aggregation-induced emission and their use in sensing and bioimaging
VL  - 6
IS  - 23
SP  - 3927-3933
AB  - Distinctive aggregation-induced emission (AIE) phenomenon of thiolate-protected silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) has been revealed; these AgNCs have shown great potential for exploitation and utilization, but their applications as a bright luminogen in the chemosensing and bioimaging areas are greatly limited by their ultralow brightness in an aqueous solution. Herein, we report facile fabrication of hydrophobicity-guided self-assembled particles of silver nanoclusters with aggregation-induced emission. A hydrophobic ligand, thiosalicylic acid, was adopted to prepare AgNCs via a one-step way, and thiosalicylic acid-capped AgNCs showed significant AIE behavior. This AIE property of AgNCs enables them to selectively respond to multiple external stimuli such as solvent polarity, pH and environmental temperature. The hydrophobic nature of thiosalicylic acid as capping ligands of AgNCs drives a self-assembly process of AgNCs in an aqueous solution that results in the formation of self-assembled particles of AgNCs with bright luminescence. Sensitive detection of mercuric ion based on the highly luminescent AgNC AIE particles was achieved in terms of a strong quenching effect of mercuric ion. Cellular viability and luminescence imaging performance of the AgNC AIE particles on living cells were also evaluated for the first time. This study demonstrates the fabrication of AIE particles of silver nanoclusters with bright luminescence guided by hydrophobic interaction and reveals excellent bioimaging performance of AIE particles in living cells. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Use of lumpfish for sea-lice control in salmon farming: challenges and opportunities
VL  - 10
IS  - 3
SP  - 683-702
AB  - Efficient sea-lice control remains one of the most important challenges for the salmon farming industry. The use of wrasse (Labridae) as cleaner fish offers an alternative to medicines for sea-lice control, but wrasse tend to become inactive in winter. Lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) continue to feed on sea-lice at low temperatures, and commercial production has escalated from thousands of fish in 2010 to well over 30 million juveniles deployed in 2016. However, production still relies on the capture of wild broodstock, which may not be sustainable. To meet global industry needs, lumpfish production needs to increase to reach c. 50 million fish annually and this can only come from aquaculture. We review current production methods and the use of lumpfish in sea cages and identify some of the main challenges and bottlenecks facing lumpfish intensification. Our gap analysis indicates that the areas in most need of research include better control of maturation for year-round production; formulation of appropriate diets; artificial selection of elite lines with desirable traits; and development of vaccines for certified, disease-free juvenile production. The welfare of farmed lumpfish also needs to be better quantified, and more information is needed on optimal densities and tank design. Finally, the risk of farmed lumpfish escaping from net pens needs to be critically assessed, and we argue that it might be beneficial to recover cleaner fish from salmon cages after the production cycle, perhaps using them as broodstock, for export to the Asian food markets or for the production of animal feeds. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Optimum veneer peeling temperatures for selected softwood species using big roller bars
VL  - 79
IS  - 1
SP  - 151-159
AB  - Driven by the need for productivity and recovery, rotary veneer peeling for softwood plywood manufacturing has changed from the use of a small 5/8-inch (15.88 mm) diameter roller bar to a big roller bar with diameter ranging from 2.50 to 3.75 inches (63.50 to 95.25 mm). This study focused on the effects of conditioning temperature on veneer quality using a big roller bar. A 4-ft (1.22 m) pilot plant rotary lathe consisting of a 3-inch (76.20 mm) diameter roller bar was used to peel a total of 130 logs. The peeling study was conducted on three commonly used conifers, namely, western white spruce, lodgepole pine and Douglas fir. The laboratory results indicated that increasing log temperature led to increase in veneer surface roughness and thickness variation, but decrease in lathe checks. The optimum log temperatures under the slow-speed laboratory peeling condition were 85–100°F (29–38 °C). Considering knife wear, lathe vibration and fast peeling speed, the optimum peeling temperatures for typical softwood plywood mills were found to be 85–95°F (29–35 °C) for spruce, 95–100°F (35–38 °C) for lodgepole pine, and 110–120°F (43–49 °C) for Douglas fir. These temperatures were significantly lower than 130°F (54 °C) previously suggested based on a small roller bar. The results of this study have been widely implemented by the Canadian softwood plywood industry with confirmed benefits of energy-saving and veneer quality improvement. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Genome-wide SNP analysis reveals an increase in adaptive genetic variation through selective breeding of coral
VL  - 29
IS  - 12
SP  - 2176-2188
AB  - Marine heat waves are increasing in magnitude, duration, and frequency as a result of climate change and are the principal global driver of mortality in reef-building corals. Resilience-based genetic management may increase coral heat tolerance, but it is unclear how temperature responses are regulated at the genome level and thus how corals may adapt to warming naturally or through selective breeding. Here we combine phenotypic, pedigree, and genomic marker data from colonies sourced from a warm reef on the Great Barrier Reef reproductively crossed with conspecific colonies from a cooler reef to produce combinations of warm purebreds and warm-cool hybrid larvae and juveniles. Interpopulation breeding created significantly greater genetic diversity across the coral genome compared to breeding between populations and maintained diversity in key regions associated with heat tolerance and fitness. High-density genome-wide scans of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified alleles significantly associated with larval families reared at 27.5 degrees C (87-2,224 loci), including loci putatively associated with proteins involved in responses to heat stress (cell membrane formation, metabolism, and immune responses). Underlying genetics of these families explained 43% of PCoA multilocus variation in survival, growth, and bleaching responses at 27.5 degrees C and 31 degrees C at the juvenile stage. Genetic marker contribution to total variation in fitness traits (narrow-sense heritability) was high for survival but not for growth and bleaching in juveniles, with heritability of these traits being higher at 31 degrees C relative to 27.5 degrees C. While based on only a limited number of crosses, the mechanistic understanding presented here demonstrates that allele frequencies are affected by one generation of selective breeding, key information for the assessments of genetic intervention feasibility and modelling of reef futures.

TI  - Contrasting patterns of local adaptation along climatic gradients between a sympatric parasitic and autotrophic tree species
VL  - 29
IS  - 16
SP  - 3022-3037
AB  - Sympatric tree species are subject to similar climatic drivers, posing a question as to whether they display comparable adaptive responses. However, no study has explicitly examined local adaptation of co-occurring parasitic and autotrophic plant species to the abiotic environment. Here we test the hypotheses that a generalist parasitic tree would display a weaker signal of selection and that genomic variation would associate with fewer climatic variables (particularly precipitation) but have similar spatial patterns to a sympatric autotrophic tree species. To test these hypotheses, we collected samples from 17 sites across the range of two tree species, the hemiparasite Nuytsia floribunda (n = 264) and sympatric autotroph Melaleuca rhaphiophylla (n = 272). We obtained 5,531 high-quality genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for M. rhaphiophylla and 6,727 SNPs for N. floribunda using DArTseq genome scan technology. Population differentiation and environmental association approaches were used to identify signals of selection. Generalized dissimilarly modelling was used to detect climatic and spatial patterns of local adaptation across climatic gradients. Overall, 322 SNPs were identified as putatively adaptive for the autotroph, while only 57 SNPs were identified for the parasitic species. We found genomic variation to associate with different sets of bioclimatic variables for each species, with precipitation relatively less important for the parasite. Spatial patterns of predicted adaptive variability were different and indicate that co-occurring species with disparate life history traits may not respond equally to selective pressures (i.e., temperature and precipitation). Together, these findings provide insight into local adaptation of sympatric parasitic and autotrophic tree species to abiotic environments. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Probiotics used in aquaculture are mostly from non-fish sources, as a result ineffective in eliciting the desired effects in aquatic animals. In this study, three Bacillus species were isolated from the digestive tract of freshwater fish Oreochromis niloticus and characterised based on their morphological, biochemical and evolutionary relationships. Their probiotic potentials were evaluated based on their ability to tolerate low pH, bile salt concentration, high temperatures, adhesion ability (auto-aggregation and hydrophobicity), haemolytic activity and antimicrobial activity including biosafety assay. Three Bacillus strains identified as Bacillus velezensis TPS3N (MK130897), Bacillus subtilis TPS4 (MK130899) and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens TPS17 (MK130898) were designated as TPS3N, TPS4 and TPS17, respectively. TPS3N and TPS17 were α-haemolytic, while TPS4 was γ-haemolytic. The three isolates had higher viability ability after exposure to higher temperatures (80 °C, 90 °C and 100 °C) and were resistant to low pH (1) and bile salt concentration (0.5%) as well as high cell surface hydrophobicity and auto-aggregation. The three isolates were compatible with one another and thus can be used in consortia. These strains were susceptible to gentamicin, cephalexin, ampicillin, ceftriaxone, kanamycin, amikacin, penicillin, cefoperazone, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin (except TPS4) and furazolidone (except TPS17). The antimicrobial assessment showed that among the three isolates, TPS3N and TPS17 exhibited good antimicrobial activity against the three fish pathogens (Streptococcus agalactiae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio harveyi), while TPS4 was effective against Streptococcus agalactiae only. The results of this work suggest that Bacillus strains TPS3N, TPS4 and TPS17 could be considered as potential probiotics in tilapia aquaculture. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Risk factors associated with viral nervous necrosis in hybrid groupers in Malaysia and the high similarity of its causative agent nervous necrosis virus to reassortant red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus/striped jack nervous necrosis virus strains
VL  - 12
IS  - 8
SP  - 1273-1284
AB  - Background and Aim: Viral nervous necrosis (VNN) is a serious disease of several marine fish species. VNN causes 100% mortality in the larval stages, while lower losses have been reported in juvenile and adult fish. This study aimed to detect the occurrence of VNN while identifying its associated risk factors and the genotypes of its causative agent in a hybrid grouper hatchery in Malaysia. Materials and Methods: A batch of newly hatched hybrid grouper fry (Epinephelus fuscoguttatus × Epinephelus lanceolatus) were followed from the larval stage to market size. Samples of the hybrid groupers, water, live feed, and artificial fish pellets were collected periodically from day 0 to 180 in the hybrid grouper hatchery. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nested PCR amplifications were carried out on VNN-related sequences. The phylogenetic tree including the sampled causative agent of VNN was inferred from the coat protein genes from all known Betanodavirus species using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA). Pearson’s correlation coefficient values were calculated to determine the strength of the correlation between the presence of VNN in hybrid grouper samples and its associated risk factors. Results: A total of 113 out of 146 pooled and individual samples, including hybrid grouper, water, and artificial fish pellet samples, demonstrated positive results in tests for the presence of VNN-associated viruses. The clinical signs of infection observed in the samples included darkened skin, deformation of the backbone, abdominal distension, skin lesions, and fin erosion. VNN was present throughout the life stages of the hybrid groupers, with the first detection occurring at day 10. VNN-associated risk factors included water temperature, dissolved oxygen content, salinity, ammonia level, fish size (adults more at risk than younger stages), and life stage (age). Detection of VNN-associated viruses in water samples demonstrated evidence of horizontal transmission of the disease. All the nucleotide sequences found in this study had high nucleotide identities of 88% to 100% to each other, striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV), and the reassortant strain red-spotted grouper NNV/SJNNV (RGNNV/SJNNV) isolate 430.2004 (GenBank accession number JN189932.1) (n=26). The phylogenetic analysis showed that quasispecies was present in each VNN-causing virus-positive sample, which differed based on the type of sample and life stage. Conclusion: This study was the first to confirm the existence of a reassortant strain (RGNNV/SJNNV) in hybrid groupers from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. However, the association between the mode of transmission and the risk factors of this virus needs to be investigated further to understand the evolution and potential new host species of the reassortant strain. © 2019 Veterinary World.

VL  - 54

SP  - 175-183
AB  - For Lasius japonicus Santschi (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), a common ant species in Japan, diapause induction is temperature dependent. To elucidate the geographic variation of its temperature dependence, new L. japonicus queens were collected immediately after nuptial flight from four sites at different latitudes: Kitami (44.1°N), Hakodate (41.8°N), Shizuku-ishi (39.7°N), and Okayama (34.7°N). The collected queens were reared for 100 days at four constant-temperature conditions (25 °C, 20 °C, 17.5 °C, and 15 °C) under a 12L:12D photoperiod. The queens began founding colonies immediately in all conditions. For all temperature conditions, daily change patterns of the average numbers of eggs, larvae, and pupae were similar among the Hakodate, Shizuku-ishi, and Okayama populations, but the development patterns of the Kitami colonies differed from those of the other three sites. Low temperatures strongly suppressed colony development of the Kitami population; development was weak even at moderate temperatures. For new queens of L. japonicus, solitary overwintering without rearing larvae is regarded as serving an important role in successful colony foundation under cool climate conditions. Results reported herein suggest that local temperatures exert important selective pressure on the timing of diapause induction and on colony development in northern populations. © 2019, The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology.

TI  - Within-population variability in coral heat tolerance indicates climate adaptation potential
VL  - 289
IS  - 1981
AB  - Coral reefs are facing unprecedented mass bleaching and mortality events due to marine heatwaves and climate change. To avoid extirpation, corals must adapt. Individual variation in heat tolerance and its heritability underpin the potential for coral adaptation. However, the magnitude of heat tolerance variability within coral populations is largely unresolved. We address this knowledge gap by exposing corals from a single reef to an experimental marine heatwave. We found that double the heat stress dosage was required to induce bleaching in the most-tolerant 10%, compared to the least-tolerant 10% of the population. By the end of the heat stress exposure, all of the least-tolerant corals were dead, whereas the most-tolerant remained alive. To contextualize the scale of this result over the coming century, we show that under an ambitious future emissions scenario, such differences in coral heat tolerance thresholds equate to up to 17 years delay until the onset of annual bleaching and mortality conditions. However, this delay is limited to only 10 years under a high emissions scenario. Our results show substantial variability in coral heat tolerance which suggests scope for natural or assisted evolution to limit the impacts of climate change in the short-term. For coral reefs to persist through the coming century, coral adaptation must keep pace with ocean warming, and ambitious emissions reductions must be realized. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Across-stage consequences of thermal stress have trait-specific effects and limited fitness costs in the harlequin ladybird, Harmonia axyridis
VL  - 34
IS  - 4
SP  - 555-572
AB  - The fitness consequences of thermal plasticity of functional traits of insects, and the life stages at which these responses manifest, remain a subject of much debate. Here, we examine whether a short-term exposure to cold, medium or warm fluctuating temperature regimes during development (larval or adult) affects adult performance, thermal tolerance and fitness of the globally invasive harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis. We found plastic responses of a metric of heat stress resistance—critical thermal maximum—and of preferred body temperature after adult temperature exposure, but not in other traits measured. By contrast, exposure of larval stages resulted in plasticity of adult walking performance (height and breadth of the curve) but not tolerance or preference. We found distinct fitness responses between larval and adult treatments, but a composite fitness index revealed negligible effects on reproductive output. These results suggest that the drivers underlying the plasticity of temperature tolerance and temperature selection are different to those shaping the plasticity of walking speed. By testing specific predictions based on current theory of developmental and reversible plasticity, this study contributes novel data to plastic responses of behaviour, stress resistance and fitness to temperature exposure across life stages and thus, provides insights to the broader evolutionary and ecological significance of these responses. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Two pathways for spermatogenesis in Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834) (Bivalvia: Unionidae)
VL  - 85
IS  - 3
SP  - 300-310
AB  - The Chinese pond mussel, Sinanodonta woodiana, an invasive species indigenous to Asia, naturally colonizes new locations as a glochidium that parasitizes fish. Human activity has facilitated a continental-scale spread of S. woodiana in Europe, where it is found in artificial reservoirs and has begun to invade natural habitats. This study aimed to investigate the reproductive activity of males in a female-biased population of S. woodiana that lives in a riverine channel linked to a power plant with a cooling water system in NW Poland. Cells formed during spermatogenesis and morphological changes in reproductive follicles (acini) were analysed over a 2-year period using light microscopy. Typical and atypical spermatogenic pathways were identified. The atypical spermatozoa were released from multinucleated cysts and had significantly shorter heads than typical spermatozoa. Spermatozoa formed in the typical way occurred consistently in all months over the study period, while the atypical spermatozoa were recorded occasionally in the first year of the study and more frequently in the second study. The highest proportion of males with spent gonads was found in late summer and early autumn. Our data show that mussels produce spermatozoa year-round, but that the levels of typical and atypical spermatogenesis varied. The two pathways of spermatogenesis in S. woodiana provide an important insight into potential mechanisms underlying the evolution of doubly uniparental inheritance of mitochondrial DNA, a phenomenon observed in S. woodiana. Additionally, a detailed understanding of the reproductive cycle of this non-native species can help to understand its reproductive potential and predict the likely direction of population change in a newly colonized area. The breeding population of S. woodiana studied by us inhabits a tributary of the Odra River, one of Poland's largest rivers, and thus poses a threat to the natural environment. Riverine habitats like our study site are local heat islands and the mussels reproducing in them over time may colonize natural waters and expand the range of their distribution. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Experimental work over borehole filling material to reinforce characterization and model validation of ground heat exchangers
VL  - 19
SP  - 109-114
AB  - Ground Heat Exchangers (GHE) are part of Ground Source Heat Pumps (GSHP), employed as a renewable source in air conditioning systems. Models implemented are quite in tune to the real behaviour, enabling reliable designs and optimization, once several thermal properties of the surrounding soil and borehole are known. Since some values of those properties are evaluated from experiments, other ones are selected and approached from data base, leading sometimes to poor reproductions, due to the lack of their specific knowledge. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the experimental evaluation of the filling material properties in a vertical GHE, to guarantee more reliable values to model its thermal behaviour: moisture content, density, and both thermal capacity and conductivity. Experiments must be easy and fast to perform, because their values must be known previous to the GSHP design. In addition, an identification process over a numerical model has been developed. In order to check its consistency, results have been compared with those determined experimentally. As well as a high model accuracy, it has been demonstrated the importance of the presented assays to be included in the previous experimental work to the design step of a GSHP system, providing a valuable borehole characterization. © 2021, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

AB  - Nanodispersed composites based on “glass–metal compounds” are widely used in microelectronics, in particular, as nanocomposite thick-film elements of multilevel hybrid integrated circuits. These composites are formed by annealing. The resulting pastes are a multiphase heterogeneous system consisting of functional material powders, glass bonds, and organic fertilizer. In the element annealing process, glass powders are melted and sintered into a glass matrix, in which the functional phase particles are fixed, forming current-carrying chains. The composite system formation is accompanied by complex physicochemical processes that, at the selected annealing temperature conditions, determine nanocomposites phase composition, microstructure, and electrophysical properties. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

TI  - Numerical modeling of radiation heat exchange in combustion chambers and heat exchangers of power installations
VL  - 209
AB  - The application of numerical modeling is considered to solve the problems of radiation heat exchange in structurally inhomogeneous two-phase media which are realized during the combustion of fuel in boiler units atmospheric emissions from air carriers when they move at supersonic speeds. The optically active ingredients of the gas phase of the combustion products have a sharp selection of spectral absorption lines (radiation) which causes a difference in the spectral transmission functions for selective radiation from the spectral transmission functions for non-selective radiation (gray body). In the presence of a dispersed phase of the combustion products acute selection is subjected to such a parameter of the radiation propagation medium as the probability of quantum survival. The number of spectral lines determining the spectral transmission functions increases with temperature and is determined by hundreds of thousands of lines at high temperatures. In this paper we consider a closed simulation of radiation heat transfer in combustion chambers when the temperature field in the combustion chambers is calculated first and then the flux of thermal radiation to the tube heat-receiving surfaces. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.

TI  - Phenotypic stress response does not influence the upper thermal tolerance of male Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
VL  - 101
AB  - Fish can be identified as either low responders (LR) or high responders (HR) based on post-stress cortisol levels and whether they exhibit a proactive or reactive stress coping style, respectively. In this study, male Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from 17 families reared at 9 degrees C were repeatedly exposed to an acute handling stress over a period of four months, with plasma cortisol levels measured at 1 h post-stress. Fish were identified as either LR or HR if the total Z-score calculated from their cortisol responses fell into the lower or upper quartile ranges, respectively; with intermediate responders (IR) classified as the remainder. Salmon characterized as LR, IR or HR were then subjected to an incremental thermal challenge, where temperature was raised at 0.2 degrees C day(-1) from their acclimation temperature (12 degrees C) to mimic natural sea-cage farming conditions during the summer in Newfoundland. Interestingly, feed intake remained high up to 22 degrees C, while previous studies have shown a decrease in salmon appetite after similar to 16-18 degrees C. After the first three mortalities were recorded at elevated temperature, a subset of LR and HR salmon were exposed to another acute handling stress event at 23.6 degrees C. Basal and post-stress measurements of plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate did not differ between stress response phenotypes at this temperature. In the end, the average incremental thermal maximum (ITMax) of LR and HR fish was not different (25.1 degrees C). In comparison, the critical thermal maximum (CTMax; temperature increased at 2 degrees C h(-1)) of the remaining IR fish that had been held at 12 degrees C was 28.5 degrees C. Collectively, these results: 1) show that this population of Atlantic salmon is very thermally tolerant, and further question the relevance of CTMax in assessing responses to real-world temperature changes; and 2) indicate that characterization of stress phenotype at 9 degrees C is not predictive of their stress response or survival at high temperatures. Therefore, selection of fish based on phenotypic stress response at low temperatures may not be beneficial to incorporate into Atlantic salmon breeding programs, especially if the goal is to improve growth performance and survival at high temperatures in sea-cages.

AB  - Understanding the genetic basis underpinning local adaptation is one of the fundamental issues in ecological and evolutionary biology. In this study, we investigated the genomic basis underlying local adaptation of the Chinese wingnut (Pterocarya stenoptera C. DC). Our population genomic analyses revealed nine spatial genetic clusters across the current distribution range of this species. Based on the assessment of genetic–environment association, we found that adaptive divergence of the P. stenoptera populations were mainly shaped by solar radiation during fruit development, temperature seasonality, annual temperature, precipitation, and air humidity. In particular, our genome-wide scanning identified a total of 801 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are highly correlated with diverse environmental factors. Further functional annotation of the SNPs identified some candidate genes that are involved into temperature, water, and light adaptation. Taken together, our results suggest that natural selection during local adaptation has contributed to the success of survival to diverse heterogenous environmental conditions. Our study provides important insights into the fundamental knowledge of the genetic basis underlying the local adaptation of non-model species. © 2020 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences

TI  - EVALUATION AND FORECASTING OF HOT DAYS IN THE ZAHEDAN CITY
VL  - 66
IS  - 1
SP  - 47-62
AB  - As the frequency of hot days increases, heat stresses in cities will increase and this will be one of the most important challenges of the coming decades. A large part of the vulnerability of the population in urban areas is caused by urban heat waves, which creates emer-gency conditions and mortality due to hot day in these areas. The Zahedan city with 660,575 people is the largest point population in the southeast of the Iran, and also faces with this chal-lenge. The purpose of this study is to investigate the hot day of the Zahedan and predict them for future periods. In this study, long-term statistics (1981-2020) of the Zahedan station were used and data were simulated with LARS-WG model. Then, the maximum temperature data were selected using the temperature threshold percentile method and after programming in Matlab environment, the Zahedan hot days were extracted for future periods. The findings of this study showed that hot days will reach 6000 days by 2099 and winter hot day will increase. Also, short heat waves have become more frequent and long-term heat waves will occur more than in previous periods, this event provides the conditions for creating thermal stresses and public health challenges for citizens. © 2022, Comenius University in Bratislava.

TI  - Sea urchins in a high CO2 world: Impacts of climate warming and ocean acidification across life history stages
VL  - 43
SP  - 281
AB  - Uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) is changing seawater chemistry (ocean acidification) causing a reduction in seawater pH and saturation state (Ω) of the CaCO3 minerals needed for calcification and increased organism hypercapnia (pCO2). Ocean acidification and global warming are having negative impacts on sea urchin larvae and adults. As sea urchins calcify in both these life stages, they have been used as a model group to investigate the impacts of climate change on marine species. In general, near-future acidification has a stunting effect on sea urchin growth as seen in smaller larval and adult skeletons, a change largely caused by energetic constraints and reduced Ω. These effects can be reduced by moderate warming and sufficient food supply. Variation in the response to acidification and/or warming within and between species indicates that there is capacity for phenotypic plasticity to adjust to changing climate. The presence of sea urchin populations at naturally acidified habitats indicates resilience to acidification and highlights species-specific and biological system adaptive strategies to life at low pH. We need to identify the sea urchin species that are resilient and their phenotypic plastic responses or genetic adaptations to climatic stressors to understand the echinoid fauna of the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impact of extrinsic incubation temperature on natural selection during Zika virus infection of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus
VL  - 17
IS  - 11
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) require replication across a wide range of temperatures to perpetuate. While vertebrate hosts tend to maintain temperatures of approximately 37 degrees C-40 degrees C, arthropods are subject to ambient temperatures which can have a daily fluctuation of > 10 degrees C. Temperatures impact vector competence, extrinsic incubation period, and mosquito survival unimodally, with optimal conditions occurring at some intermediate temperature. In addition, the mean and range of daily temperature fluctuations influence arbovirus perpetuation and vector competence. The impact of temperature on arbovirus genetic diversity during systemic mosquito infection, however, is poorly understood. Therefore, we determined how constant extrinsic incubation temperatures of 25 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 35 degrees C control Zika virus (ZIKV) vector competence and population dynamics within Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. We also examined fluctuating temperatures which better mimic field conditions in the tropics. We found that vector competence varied in a unimodal manner for constant temperatures peaking between 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C for both Aedes species. Transmission peaked at 10 days post-infection for Aedes aegypti and 14 days for Aedes albopictus. Conversely, fluctuating temperature decreased vector competence. Using RNA-seq to characterize ZIKV population structure, we identified that temperature alters the selective environment in unexpected ways. During mosquito infection, constant temperatures more often elicited positive selection whereas fluctuating temperatures led to strong purifying selection in both Aedes species. These findings demonstrate that temperature has multiple impacts on ZIKV biology, including major effects on the selective environment within mosquitoes.

VL  - 6
IS  - 2
SP  - 27-38
AB  - Low survival of newborn seahorses hindered studies on the early life stage. Many important aspects contributing to the survival of newborn seahorses remained unknown. More research on juvenile stage is necessary to optimize the culture protocols. Stocking density may or may not affect fish growth and behavior. Effect of stocking density on the growth and survival of seahorses in the early stages had received much less attention. Temperature is decisive in the early development of fish, with great impact on primary and secondary production and consequently on growth, survival and feeding of juveniles. It affects metabolism rate of organisms which can greatly impact the growth and survival of seahorse particularly at juveniles’ stage. Hence, effects of stocking density and temperature on the growth and survival of Hippocampus barbouri juveniles were studied. Three treatments of 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5 juv/L, respectively 6, 8, and 10 seahorse juveniles per tank, were tested for 12 weeks. Three temperature levels selected for this experiment were 25, 28 and 31°C for 4 weeks of experimental period. There was no significant different (p>0.05) on the growth of H. barbouri juveniles cultured under different stocking density. This may be due to the stocking densities employed in this study has not reached it maximum limit, hence no significance difference between treatments. Highest survival of 90% was recorded at highest stocking density of 10 juv/tank. Temperature between 25 and 28°C showed better growth of H. barbouri juveniles when compared to high temperature of 31°C. Survival of H. barbouri juveniles cultured under different temperature resulted in more than 80% for all treatments. These findings indicated that H. barbouri juveniles can withstand temperature between 25 and 31°C. To conclude, stocking density of 0.5 juv/L produced the best survival while at temperature between 25 and 28 °C produce better growth and survival of H. barbouri. © 2020, Green Wave Publishing of Canada.

TI  - Exposure to exogenous egg cortisol does not rescue juvenile Chinook salmon body size, condition, or survival from the effects of elevated water temperatures
VL  - 10
IS  - 5
SP  - 2466-2477
AB  - Climate change is leading to altered temperature regimes which are impacting aquatic life, particularly for ectothermic fish. The impacts of environmental stress can be translated across generations through maternally derived glucocorticoids, leading to altered offspring phenotypes. Although these maternal stress effects are often considered negative, recent studies suggest this maternal stress signal may prepare offspring for a similarly stressful environment (environmental match). We applied the environmental match hypothesis to examine whether a prenatal stress signal can dampen the effects of elevated water temperatures on body size, condition, and survival during early development in Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha from Lake Ontario, Canada. We exposed fertilized eggs to prenatal exogenous egg cortisol (1,000 ng/ml cortisol or 0 ng/ml control) and then reared these dosed groups at temperatures indicative of current (+0°C) and future (+3°C) temperature conditions. Offspring reared in elevated temperatures were smaller and had a lower survival at the hatchling developmental stage. Overall, we found that our exogenous cortisol dose did not dampen effects of elevated rearing temperatures (environmental match) on body size or early survival. Instead, our eyed stage survival indicates that our prenatal cortisol dose may be detrimental, as cortisol-dosed offspring raised in elevated temperatures had lower survival than cortisol-dosed and control reared in current temperatures. Our results suggest that a maternal stress signal may not be able to ameliorate the effects of thermal stress during early development. However, we highlight the importance of interpreting the fitness impacts of maternal stress within an environmentally relevant context. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - The manufacturing of lactobacillus microcapsules by freezing with egg yolk: The analysis of microstructure and the preservation effect against freezing and acid treatments
VL  - 6
AB  - Encapsulation is an effective strategy to prevent probiotics from environmental damages. The survivability of Lactobacillus is generally reduced under frozen or acid environments. In this study, an attempt was made to encapsulate Lactobacillus into the egg yolk aggregates formed upon freezing. Lactobacillus broth was mixed with liquid egg yolk and frozen at selected temperatures and time periods. After thawing, the number of surviving bacteria was determined. The results showed that freezing with the addition of egg yolk improved Lactobacillus survivability. It was confirmed that freezing increased the number of egg yolk aggregates, and those aggregates coated Lactobacillus after freezing. The encapsulated Lactobacillus was treated at pH 2.5 for 10 min, and the results showed that the encapsulation process increased the acid resistance of Lactobacillus. These results indicate that freezing-induced encapsulation with egg yolk could effectively protect Lactobacillus against freezing and acid treatment. This finding could be useful for the design and preservation of probiotics-based food products. © 2021 The Authors

TI  - Natural selection on plasticity of thermal traits in a highly seasonal environment
VL  - 11
IS  - 10
SP  - 2004-2013
AB  - For ectothermic species with broad geographical distributions, latitudinal/altitudinal variation in environmental temperatures (averages and extremes) is expected to shape the evolution of physiological tolerances and the acclimation capacity (i.e., degree of phenotypic plasticity) of natural populations. This can create geographical gradients of selection in which environments with greater thermal variability (e.g., seasonality) tend to favor individuals that maximize performance across a broader range of temperatures compared to more stable environments. Although thermal acclimation capacity plays a fundamental role in this context, it is unknown whether natural selection targets this trait in natural populations. Additionally, understanding whether and how selection acts on thermal physiological plasticity is also highly relevant to climate change and biological conservation. Here, we addressed such an important gap in our knowledge in the northernmost population of the four-eyed frog, Pleurodema thaul. We measured plastic responses of critical thermal limits for activity, behavioral thermal preference, and thermal sensitivity of metabolism to acclimation at 10 and 20°C. We monitored survival during three separate recapture efforts and used mark-recapture integrated into an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the relationship between survivals as a function of the plasticity of thermal traits. Overall, we found no evidence that thermal acclimation in this population is being targeted by directional selection, although there might be signals of selection on individual traits. According to the most supported models, survival increased in individuals with higher tolerance to cold when cold-acclimated, probably because daily low extremes are frequent during the cooler periods of the year. Furthermore, survival increased with body size. However, in both cases, the directional selection estimates were nonsignificant, and the constraints of our experimental design prevented us from evaluating more complex models (i.e., nonlinear selection). © 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Response to thermal environment in Tetranychus ludeni (Acari: Tetranychidae)
VL  - 26
IS  - 5
SP  - 942-953
AB  - Tetranychus ludeni Zacher is a spider mite that has invaded all continents except Antarctica and become an economically important pest around the world. Understanding the plasticity of its life history traits as a response to temperatures provides critical information for its risk analysis and management. Here we tested its response to temperatures ranging from 15 to 30°C over two generations. We found that there was no difference in the egg hatch rate and immature survival rate across temperatures in the first generation. However, the egg hatch rate was lower and immature survival rate was higher at 30°C in the second generation. The sex ratio (proportion of females) of resultant adults was consistent under all test temperatures in both generations except for 30°C in the second generation which was lower. Higher temperature accelerated development in both generations but the development at the lower temperatures was faster in the second generation. Adult body size in both generations generally decreased with the increase of temperature, with females being more likely than males to adjust body size in response to temperature changes they first experienced. Temperature-dependent body size was not translated into fecundity, but larger adults lived longer. The thermal threshold was lower and degree days (DD) were greater in the second generation than in the first generation. Our findings indicate that life history traits of T. ludeni are highly flexible and adaptive to dynamic thermal environment in successive generations. Furthermore, increasing temperature elevated the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) but shortened the generation time (T) and the time to double the population size (Dt). The net population growth rate (R0) was higher at 20 and 25°C as compared to lower and higher temperatures. © 2021 Systematic and Applied Acarology Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Insects are the most abundant and diverse group of animals on earth. Therefore, it is not surprising that they have evolved numerous, generally non-mutually exclusive, adaptations to permit survival at subzero temperatures. In general, these adaptations can be divided into those that prevent freezing of freeze susceptible species (freeze avoidance) and those that allow the insect to freeze and survive (freeze tolerance). Three types of ice-binding proteins (IBPs) are often involved in either freeze tolerance or avoidance, but they are not required for either, as numerous other adaptations are often employed either in concert with IBPs or in their absence: (1) Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) in freeze avoiding insects lower the freezing point of the hemolymph below the melting point, generating a difference between the two (thermal hysteresis) of generally 2-9 °C. AFPs (A) inhibit inoculative freezing initiated by surface ice across the cuticle and (B) promote supercooling by inhibiting ice nucleators. (2) Recrystallization inhibition proteins (RIPs), found in many freeze-tolerant species, produce a much smaller hemolymph thermal hysteresis, generally less than 1 °C, and function to prevent damaging recrystallization of ice. (3) Hemolymph ice-nucleating proteins (INPs), present in many freeze-tolerant insects, function to initiate ice nucleation in the extracellular fluid at high subzero temperatures, thereby inhibiting lethal intracellular freezing that can follow freezing after significant supercooling. Details of the physiology and biochemistry of these IBPs will be discussed, along with the roles of the other subzero adaptations. Also, potential AFP functions other than prevention of freezing will be mentioned. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

VL  - 8
IS  - 24
SP  - 12780-12789
AB  - Effects of seasonal or daily temperature variation on fitness and physiology of ectothermic organisms and their ways to cope with such variations have been widely studied. However, the way multivoltines organisms cope with temperature variations from one generation to the next is still not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the multivoltine midge Chironomus riparius Meigen (1803) responds mainly via acclimation as predicted by current theories or whether rapid genetic adaptation is involved. To investigate this issue, a common garden approach has been applied. A mix of larvae from five European populations was raised in the laboratory at three different pre-exposure temperatures (PET): 14, 20, and 26°C. After three and five generations, respectively, larvae were exposed to three treatment temperatures (TT): 14, 20, and 26°C. Mortality was monitored for the first 48 hr and after emergence. After three generations, significant mortality rate differences depended on an interaction of PET and TT. This finding supports the hypothesis that chironomids respond rapidly to climatic variation via adaptive mechanisms and to a lesser extent via phenotypic plasticity. The result of the experiment indicates that three generations were sufficient to adapt to warm temperature, decreasing the mortality rate, highlighting the potential for chironomids to rapidly respond to seasonally changing conditions. © 2018 The Authors.

TI  - Genome size evolution is associated with climate seasonality and glucosinolates, but not life history, soil nutrients or range size, across a clade of mustards
VL  - 127
IS  - 7
SP  - 887-902
AB  - Background and Aims: We investigate patterns of evolution of genome size across a morphologically and ecologically diverse clade of Brassicaceae, in relation to ecological and life history traits. While numerous hypotheses have been put forward regarding autecological and environmental factors that could favour small vs. large genomes, a challenge in understanding genome size evolution in plants is that many hypothesized selective agents are intercorrelated. Methods: We contribute genome size estimates for 47 species of Streptanthus Nutt. and close relatives, and take advantage of many data collections for this group to assemble data on climate, life history, soil affinity and composition, geographic range and plant secondary chemistry to identify simultaneous correlates of variation in genome size in an evolutionary framework. We assess models of evolution across clades and use phylogenetically informed analyses as well as model selection and information criteria approaches to identify variables that can best explain genome size variation in this clade. Key Results: We find differences in genome size and heterogeneity in its rate of evolution across subclades of Streptanthus and close relatives. We show that clade-wide genome size is positively associated with climate seasonality and glucosinolate compounds. Model selection and information criteria approaches identify a best model that includes temperature seasonality and fraction of aliphatic glucosinolates, suggesting a possible role for genome size in climatic adaptation or a role for biotic interactions in shaping the evolution of genome size. We find no evidence supporting hypotheses of life history, range size or soil nutrients as forces shaping genome size in this system. Conclusions: Our findings suggest climate seasonality and biotic interactions as potential forces shaping the evolution of genome size and highlight the importance of evaluating multiple factors in the context of phylogeny to understand the effect of possible selective agents on genome size. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

TI  - High speed machinability of the aerospace alloy AA7075 T6 under different cooling conditions
VL  - 1960
AB  - This paper describes the results of an experimental investigation aimed to st udy the machinability of AA7075 T6 (160 HV) for aerospace industry at high cutting speeds. The paper investigates the effects of different lubri-cooling strategies (cryogenic, M QL and dry) during high speed turning process on cutting forces, tool wear, chip morphology and cutting temperatures. The cutting speeds selected were 1000m/min, 1250m/min and 1500 m/min, while the feed rate values used were 0.1mm/rev and 0.3 mm/rev. The results of cryogenic and M QL application is compared with dry application. It was found that the cryogenic and M QL lubri-cooling techniques could represent a functional alternative to the common dry cutting application in order to implement a more effect ive high speed turning process. Higher cuttingparameters would be able to increase the productivity and reduce the production costs. The effects of the cutting parameters and on the variables object of study were investigated and the role of the different lubri-cooling conditions was assessed. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - Temperature and salinity and their interaction exert a major control on the life cycle of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), affecting reproduction, development, growth, and mortality. Quantifying specific temperature and salinity relationships on oyster growth and mortality has, however, proven difficult, with data suggesting potentially region-specific responses. Legacy and recent data from field tray studies from public oyster grounds in Barataria Bay (BA) and Breton Sound (BS) were used to estimate growth and mortality rates as a function of temperature and salinity. Previous studies conducted in BA and BS reported differences in growth and mortality between the basins. In the present study, environmental conditions were synchronized to compare growth and mortality between basins at similar combinations of temperature and salinity. Results indicate that when temperature and salinity are the same (synchronized), seasonal oyster growth and mortality rates still differ between BA and BS. Given the same salinity and temperature conditions, differences in growth and mortality rates between estuaries may persist because of differences in other environmental conditions (i.e., food quality and composition, hydrology, site history, and salinity variation) or localized genetic adaptations to environmental conditions. © 2019 Journal of Shellfish Research.

VL  - 39

SP  - 479-492
AB  - In alpine ecosystems, imbibed seeds are often exposed to temperatures as low as −35 °C, challenging their survival in the soil. Here, we show that seeds have mechanisms to survive cold climate prevalent in alpine ecosystems and have identified three such mechanisms from existing literature, including two forms of freezing avoidance (the presence of water impermeable seed coats, and the supercooling of seed tissues) and one form of freezing tolerance (by extracellular-freezing). Experimentally-derived published data on the lowest temperature recorded at which 50% of a seed sample survived (i.e., lethal temperature; LT50) was used to generate a dataset of 24 species across low altitude, boreal and alpine environments. We assumed that the ability of seeds to maintain viability at very low temperatures would increase in species associated with higher altitudes conferring a competitive advantage that would be lost under projected climate change. However, our results reveal to underpin that seeds from boreal species survive relatively better at lower temperatures than those of alpine species. Paradoxically, a warming climate could lead to alpine seed death due to extremes of cold at the soil surface resulting from snow cover loss, whilst the declining snow cover may facilitate boreal forest colonization above the current treeline. © 2020 The Author(s).

SP  - 101-107
AB  - This study deals with the effect of uncarbonized eggshell weight percentage on the tensile strength of AA 2014 composite manufactured by Electromagnetic stir casting technique. Response surface methodology (RSM) is used to design the experiment. The selected process parameters are preheat temperature, stirring current, stirring time, matrix pouring temperature, and reinforcement of uncarbonized eggshell weight percentage. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is employed to study the influence of selected process parameters. The maximum tensile strength of 287.194 MPa was achieved for reinforcement preheat temperature 537.87 °C, stirring current 12 A, stirring time 179.9 sec, matrix pouring temperature 726.8 °C, and reinforcement weight percentage of 12.46. At optimum level of process parameter confirmation tests are performed to validate the result. In confirmation test, tensile strength and hardness are investigated. It is observed that due to the reinforcement of uncarbonized eggshell in AA2014 aluminium alloy, tensile strength and hardness are improved by 55.24 % and 39.58 %. © 2019 Lavoisier.

TI  - Testing for freezing tolerance in perennial ryegrass
SP  - 231-236
AB  - Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is a highly valued species both for agriculture and amenity purposes. However, it lacks winter hardiness for cultivation at certain regions. As winter hardiness is a very complex trait which is affected both by numerous environmental conditions and genetic composition of a plant, freezing tolerance is an important component of winter hardiness. The freezing tolerance at the population scale might be determined at selected fixed-temperature points or by the LT50 evaluation. Here the LT50 value evaluation has a potential to reveal substantially more information about this trait, as it involves assessment of survival at a series of freezing temperatures. Herein we present a high-throughput freezing tolerance evaluation method for perennial ryegrass populations. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

TI  - Genomic Stock Structure of the Marine Teleost Tarakihi (Nemadactylus macropterus) Provides Evidence of Potential Fine-Scale Adaptation and a Temperature-Associated Cline Amid Panmixia
VL  - 10
AB  - Tarakihi (Nemadactylus macropterus) is an important fishery species with widespread distribution around New Zealand and off the southern coasts of Australia. However, little is known about whether the populations are locally adapted or genetically structured. To address this, we conducted whole-genome resequencing of 175 tarakihi from around New Zealand and Tasmania (Australia) to obtain a dataset of 7.5 million genome-wide and high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Variant filtering, FST-outlier analysis, and redundancy analysis (RDA) were used to evaluate population structure, adaptive structure, and locus-environment associations. A weak but significant level of neutral genetic differentiation was found between tarakihi from New Zealand and Tasmania (FST = 0.0054–0.0073, P ≤ 0.05), supporting the existence of at least two separate reproductive stocks. No clustering was detected among the New Zealand populations (ΦST &lt; 0.001, P = 0.77). Outlier-based, presumably adaptive variation suggests fine-scale adaptive structure between locations around central New Zealand off the east (Wairarapa, Cape Campbell, and Hawke’s Bay) and the west coast (Tasman Bay/Golden Bay and Upper West Coast of South Island). Allele frequencies from 55 loci were associated with at least one of six environmental variables, of which 47 correlated strongly with yearly mean water temperature. Although genes associated with these loci are linked to various functions, the most common functions were integral components of membrane and cilium assembly. Projection of the RDA indicates the existence of a latitudinal temperature cline. Our work provides the first genomic insights supporting panmixia of tarakihi in New Zealand and evidence of a genomic cline that appears to be driven by the temperature gradients, together providing crucial information to inform the stock assessment of this species, and to widen the insights of the ecological drivers of adaptive variation in a marine species.

AB  - The article is aimed at assessing the possible negative impact of microclimate factors on work wellbeing, health and work productivity of the employees of the selected operation. In this paper, the effect of microclimate conditions such as air humidity, air flow and air temperature on workers comfort perception were studied. The research was carried out on a sample of 5 workers out of a total of 15 employees in the production hall. The aim of the research was to determine the level of influence of selected thermal parameters on the physical and mental well-being of employees. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire designed to determine the level of perception of the impact of selected thermal parameters on the most vulnerable body parts. A mathematical model was used for a comprehensive assessment of the work environment's impact on employees. As the productivity of employees may also depend on employee satisfaction, research results can be used to improve the comfort of employees and to achieve better work performance. © 2019, Danube Adria Association for Automation and Manufacturing, DAAAM.

TI  - Effects of local factors on adaptation to heat in Spain (1983–2018)
VL  - 209
AB  - The European Union is currently immersed in policy development to address the effects of climate change around the world. Key plans and processes for facilitating adaptation to high temperatures and for reducing the adverse effects on health are among the most urgent measures. Therefore, it is necessary to understand those factors that influence adaptation. The aim of this study was to provide knowledge related to the social, climate and economic factors that are related to the evolution of minimum mortality temperatures (MMT) in Spain in the rural and urban contexts, during the 1983–2018 time period. For this purpose, local factors were studied regarding their relationship to levels of adaptation to heat. MMT is an indicator that allows for establishing a relationship to between mortality and temperature, and is a valid indicator to assess the capacity of adaptation to heat of a certain population. MMT is obtained through the maximum daily temperature and daily mortality of the study period. The evolution of MMT values for Spain was established in a previous paper. An ecological, longitudinal and retrospective study was carried out. Generalized linear models (GLM) were performed to identify the variables that appeared to be related to adaptation. The adaptation was calculated as the difference in variation in MMT based on the average increase in maximum daily temperatures. In terms of adaptation to heat, urban populations have adapted more than non-urban populations. Seventy-nine percent (n = 11) of urban provinces have adapted to heat, compared to twenty-one percent (n = 3) of rural provinces that have not adapted. In terms of urban zones, income level and habituation to heat (values over the 95th percentile) were variables shown to be related to adaptation. In contrast, among non-urban provinces, a greater number of housing rehabilitation licenses and a greater number of health professionals were variables associated with higher increases in MMT, and therefore, with adaptation. These results highlight the need to carry out studies that allow for identifying the local factors that are most relevant and influential in population adaptation. More studies carried out at a small scale are needed. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The purpose of the study is to determine the biotechnological potential of microorganism strains included in the composition of nutritional supplements Vetom 1.1, Vetom 2, Vetom 3.22 for the production of functional food products based on the in vitro study of their resistance to adverse factors of the human gastrointestinal tract. The results of studies that reproduce individual conditions of the gastrointestinal tract and food products, such as high acidity, concentrations of phenol challenging for bacteria, and the presence of bile, made it possible to establish a high survival rate of microorganism strains, the dynamics of their growth, and the number of viable cells when exposed to a high concentration of sucrose and in various temperature ranges, which suggests that they are promising, especially the B. subtilis strain VKPM B 10641 which has the highest adaptive potential. © 2022.

VL  - 25
IS  - 3
SP  - 409-417
AB  - Insecticide resistance is inevitable if an insecticide is widely used to control insect pests. Fortunately, the resistance-associated fitness costs often give chances to manage resistances. In most cases, the fitness cost in resistant insects is often evaluated under laboratory conditions for insect development, which limits its practical application in pest control in the field. In a laboratory population R9 with 253-fold resistance to chlorpyrifos after nine-generation selection with chlorpyrifos, the relative fitness was only 0.206 under laboratory conditions (25°C, humidity 70%–80% and 16 h light/8 h dark photoperiod), when compared to S9, a susceptible counterpart (resistance ratio = 2.25-fold) from the same origin as R9 but without any selection with insecticides. Temperatures varied the resistance-associated fitness costs, with enhanced costs at high temperatures and reduced costs at low temperatures, such as 0.174 at 32°C and 0.527 at 18°C. The copulation rate and fecundity were two key factors for the reduced costs at low temperatures. Another finding was that R9 individuals needed much more time to recover from heat shock than that of S9, but R9 and S9 individuals were similarly sensitive to cold shock. The low fitness cost at low temperatures would increase the overwintering population, which might further increase risks of rapid development and widespread distribution of chlorpyrifos resistance in Nilaparvata lugens. © 2016 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

VL  - 11
IS  - 10
AB  - Luminescent metal nanoclusters have attracted considerable research attention in recent years due to their unique properties and extensive usage in many fields. Three different synthetic routes were developed to in situ generate orange and red emitting copper nanoclusters embedded in monolithic eggshell membrane (Cu NCs@ESM) using different reducing reagents including N2H4˙H2O, NH2OH˙HCl and Vitamin C at room temperature for the first time. The routes are extremely facile, low-cost and versatile. The obtained Cu NCs@ESM nanocomposites exhibit excellent photostability and chemical stability, laying the foundation for various practical applications. Fluorescent surface patterning was demonstrated based on the proposed strategy easily. Significantly, the Cu NCs@ESM shows selective fluorescence quenching response to Hg2+ ions and good catalytic activity for methylene blue (MB) reduction degradation making it ideal as portable sensing strip and recyclable catalyst. The work provides a general strategy for the fabrication of other various monolithic nanomaterials with potential applications. © 2018 by the authors.

TI  - Perceptions of U.S. And Canadian maple syrup producers toward climate change, its impacts, and potential adaptation measures
VL  - 14
IS  - 4
AB  - The production of maple syrup is an important cultural and economic activity directly related to the climate of northeastern North America. As a result, there are signs that climate change could have negative impacts on maple syrup production in the next decades, particularly for regions located at the southern margins of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) range. The purpose of this survey study is to present the beliefs and opinions of maple syrup producers of Canada (N = 241) and the U.S. (N = 113) on climate change in general, its impacts on sugar maple health and maple syrup production, and potential adaptation measures. Using conditional inference classification trees, we examined how the socio-economic profile of respondents and the geographic location and size of respondents’ sugar bushes shaped the responses of survey participants. While a majority (75%) of respondents are confident that the average temperature on Earth is increasing, less than half (46%) believe that climate change will have negative impacts on maple syrup yield in the next 30 years. Political view was a significant predictor of these results, with respondents at the right right and center-right of the political spectrum being less likely to believe in climate change and less likely to anticipate negative effects of climate change on maple syrup production. In addition, 77% of the participants indicated an interest in adopting adaptation strategies if those could increase maple syrup production. This interest was greater for respondents using vacuum tubing for sap collection than other collection methods. However, for many respondents (particularly in Canada), lack of information was identified as a constraint limiting adaptation to climate change. © 2019 Legault et al.

VL  - 89
AB  - High-efficient disaggregation of palygorskite (PAL) crystal aggregates into individual nanorods is the key to exploiting its nanometer properties, which remains a challenge at present. The sonochemical cavitation effects have been successfully employed for the intensification of physical and chemical processing applications, but it still lacks the relevant study on the scale-up disaggregation of PAL crystal bundles. Here, the energy-efficient, scale-up ultrasonic process was developed to disaggregate PAL aggregates in batches, and the effects of ultrasonic treatment time, temperature, and power on physicochemical features of PAL were systematically investigated. The results showed that the single dispersed PAL nanorods could be continuously produced by sonicating 15 wt% of PAL suspension at 20 kHz, 2000 W and 30 °C for 5 min retaining the original nanorod length and layered-chain structure. It also greatly improved the dispersion of nanorod crystal, specific surface area and suspension stability of PAL. The ultrasonically disaggregated PAL has a higher pulping rate in water (14.96 m3/t) and saturated NaCl system (14.45 m3/t), which is significantly better than that of natural PAL in water (14.72 m3/t) and saturated NaCl solution (12.37 m3/t). It suggests that the disaggregated PAL exhibits excellent potential and adaptability as a viscosity enhancer for drilling fluid. Therefore, this work provides a feasible and efficient ultrasonic process for large-scale industrialized disaggregation of PAL crystal bundles, laying a foundation for the high-value utilization of natural PAL as one-dimensional nanomaterials. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - In order to improve the foaming properties of egg white protein products, using fresh egg white as raw material, this paper adopted heat treatment to assist the limited papain hydrolysis of egg white protein. Then, the effects of substrate concentration, enzyme dosage, enzyme hydrolysis time, enzymatic hydrolysis temperature and pH on the foaming properties and the degree of hydrolysis of egg white protein were analyzed. Based on single factor experiment, the foaming ability and foam stability were selected as response values. Response surface analysis and variance analysis were employed to optimize process parameters. The optimum enzymatic hydrolysis conditions were as follows : substrate concentration 3%, heat treatment temperature 90 °C, heat treatment time 10 min, enzyme dosage 3 500 u/g, enzyme hydrolysis time 2.5 h, enzymatic hydrolysis temperature 55 S and pH 7. Under these conditions, the foaming ability and foam stability of egg white protein were 1741.38% and 93.38%. Compared with common egg white protein, the foaming ability was increased by 112.97%, and the foam stability was increased by 93.27%. The results of rheological properties of foam were shown that the storage modulus G 'of the foam of modified protein is 1.5 times loiter ma/ mat of unmodified protein. © 2018 Editorial office of Journal of Food Science and Biotechnology.

TI  - Clade-dependent size response of conodonts to environmental changes during the late Smithian extinction
VL  - 195
SP  - 52-67
AB  - In contrast to the benthos whose taxonomic recovery was lagging way behind that of the nekton, highly diverse Smithian conodont and ammonoid faunas were profoundly decimated during the late Smithian, ca. 2 Myr after the Permian-Triassic boundary mass extinction. As body size reduction is a common evolutionary response to heavy environmental stress, we investigate how the size of the P1 elements of different conodont clades responded during the late Smithian crisis based on three sections from the northern Indian Margin. A major and world-wide positive carbon excursion is also a consistent signature of the late Smithian time interval. Where adequate ammonoid biochronological control is lacking (i.e., Kashmir), a new carbonate carbon isotope record provides an independent age proxy for correlations with southern Tibet and the Salt Range. Assuming a positive correlation between the size of P1 elements and body size, we confirm that segminate conodonts underwent a size decrease during the late Smithian. However, segminiplanate conodonts consistently displayed a substantial size increase during the same time interval, thus highlighting clade specific, diverging answers and precluding any simplistic generalization of size responses to the same stress event. Additionally, a moderate but consistent size increase during the early Spathian is documented for both clades, thus obscuring any simple general relation between temperature stress and size among conodonts. Comparison of size time series with the oxygen isotopic composition of conodonts (a proxy for sea-water temperature) suggests that only the size of segminate P1 elements may correlate positively with temperature. Although at a slower pace, the size of segminiplanate P1 elements continued to increase during the early Spathian, when temperature rose again after the late Smithian cooling event. Therefore, temperature alone cannot explain the size variations of segminiplanate conodonts. The late Smithian was also a time of increasing burial of organic matter on continental shelves, but lateral variations of this factor also obscure any relation with the documented size changes. Last but not least, the stratigraphically more comprehensive study in Nammal reveals a segminiplanate gap during the middle Smithian thermal high. The biogeographical expansion of this clade towards the low latitudes during the Griesbachian, the early Smithian, the late Smithian and the early Spathian apparently occurred during the coolest intervals of the Early Triassic, in agreement with their supposed cooler habitat. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Dynamics of solitary predation by Myxococcus xanthus on Escherichia coli observed at the single-cell level
VL  - 86
IS  - 3
AB  - The predatory behavior of Myxococcus xanthus has attracted extensive attention due to its unique social traits and inherent biological activities. In addition to group hunting, individual M. xanthus cells are able to kill and lyse prey cells; however, there is little understanding of the dynamics of solitary predation. In this study, by employing a bacterial tracking technique, we investigated M. xanthus predatory dynamics on Escherichia coli at the single-cell level. The killing and lysis of E. coli by a single M. xanthus cell was monitored in real time by microscopic observation, and the plasmolysis of prey cells was identified at a relatively early stage of solitary predation. After quantitative characterization of their solitary predatory behavior, M. xanthus cells were found to respond more dramatically to direct contact with live E. coli cells than heat-killed or UV-killed cells, showing slower predator motion and faster lysing of prey. Among the three contact-dependent killing modes classified according to the major subareas of M. xanthus cells in contact with prey, leading pole contact was observed most. After killing the prey, approximately 72% of M. xanthus cells were found to leave without thorough degradation of the lysed prey, and this postresidence behavior is described as a lysis-leave pattern, indicating that solitary predation has low efficiency in terms of prey-cell consumption. Our results provide a detailed description of the single-cell level dynamics of M. xanthus solitary predation from both prey and predator perspectives. Bacterial predation plays multiple essential roles in bacterial selection and mortality within microbial ecosystems. In addition to its ecological and evolutionary importance, many potential applications of bacterial predation have been proposed. The myxobacterium Myxococcus xanthus is a well-known predatory member of the soil microbial community. Its predation is commonly considered a collective behavior comparable to a wolf pack attack; however, individual M. xanthus cells are also able to competently lead to the lysis of a prey cell. Using a bacterial tracking technique, we are able to observe and analyze solitary predation by M. xanthus on Escherichia coli at the single-cell level and reveal the dynamics of both predator and prey during the process. The present study will not only provide a comprehensive understanding of M. xanthus solitary predation but also help to explain why M. xanthus often displays multicellular characteristic predatory behaviors in nature, while a single cell is capable of predation. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

VL  - 43

SP  - 9076-9083
AB  - The development of ultra-small platinum nanoparticles is very important for the sensitive detection of glucose in complex medium without protein interference. Zwitterionic dendrimer-encapsulated platinum nanoparticles (Ptn-G5MC NPs) have been developed and studied for the highly sensitive and selective colorimetric detection of glucose. Firstly, zwitterionic dendrimer (G5MC) was obtained by surface modification of generation 5 poly(amidoamine) dendrimer with maleic anhydride and cysteamine. The calculated average diameters of Pt nanoparticles (Pt NPs) for Ptn-G5MC (n = 55, 110, and 165) were 1.64 ± 0.22, 2.09 ± 0.24, and 2.98 ± 0.29 nm, respectively. Ptn-G5MC NPs not only had high stability in various pH solutions and fibrinogen solutions, but also showed no noticeable cytotoxicity against HUVEC cells and HeLa cells. In addition, Ptn-G5MC NPs catalyzed oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) with H2O2 to generate blue oxidized TMB (oxTMB), indicating their peroxidase-like property. This peroxidase-like reaction followed a typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Furthermore, this colorimetric reaction was used for glucose detection with high sensitivity and selectivity. The linear range of glucose concentration with absorbance at 652 nm was from 7 to 1380 μM, and the detection limit was 2.8 μM. More importantly, the relative activity of Ptn-G5MC NPs was not affected by proteins. These enhanced properties are attributed to the ultra-small size of Pt NPs and high stability of Pt55-G5MC NPs in complex medium. The glucose concentration in saliva as a real sample was found to be 0.18 mM. The proposed glucose sensor could have promising applications for glucose detection in biocatalysis and bioassays in the future. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.

TI  - Is summer growth reduction related to feeding guild? A test for a benthic juvenile flatfish sole (Solea solea) in a temperate coastal area, the western Wadden Sea
VL  - 235
AB  - Flatfish species are an important target for fisheries. During their juvenile stage they concentrate in coastal nursery areas. Food conditions in these areas are an important factor determining habitat quality and ultimate survival. Recently, growth reduction in summer has been observed in plaice, Pleuronectes platessa, feeding on both epibenthic and benthic prey. In the current study, we test the hypothesis that summer growth reduction is a consequence of a reduced availability of benthic prey by analysing summer growth in a fully benthic feeding flatfish, juvenile sole (Solea solea). Summer growth was studied for contrasting years with respect to preceding winter water temperature conditions to exclude possible irreversible non-genetic adaptations of growth to water temperature. Individual growth, estimated from otolith daily rings, was compared with predictions of maximum growth at the prevailing temperature. In line with expectations, 0-group sole showed strong summer growth reduction, supporting the notion that summer growth reduction is related to feeding modes. Summer growth reduction underlines the importance of a good definition of how and over what time period growth as indicator of habitat quality is estimated and compared. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Feature selection of converter steelmaking process based on the improved genetic algorithm
VL  - 40
IS  - 12
SP  - 185-195
AB  - Data feature selection of converter steelmaking process is the key step to realize the end point carbon content and temperature prediction. The high-dimensional data of production process are not conducive to the rapid and accurate prediction of the end point carbon temperature. To address this problem, an improved genetic algorithm is proposed to select the data feature of converter steelmaking process. Firstly, Pearson correlation coefficient is used to measure the important contribution of different features. Then, the objective function is formulated to reflect the correlation between process data feature and terminal carbon temperature. The maximum, minimum, average fitness and random individual fitness of the population are defined by the objective function. In this way, an adaptive crossover mutation probability mechanism is established. This method not only makes the population distribution more reasonable during the iteration optimization, but also improves the late convergence speed to prevent the algorithm from falling into local optimization. Through verification and comparison experiments of data feature selection in actual steel mills, results show that the average time of feature selection is 0.25 s, the accuracy of temperature error within ±5℃ in terminal prediction is 85.67%, and the accuracy of carbon content prediction error within ±0.01% is 80.67%. © 2019, Science Press.

TI  - Living on the edge: Lower thermal quality but greater survival probability at a high altitude mountain for the mesquite lizard (Sceloporus grammicus)
VL  - 94
AB  - A 20-month recapture analysis of 1001 individually marked mesquite lizards (Sceloporus grammicus) suggests that variation in thermal quality across three altitudes influences survival probability. Each additional unit of deviation from the temperature selected by these lizards in previous laboratory experiments (i.e. decreased thermal quality) meant an increase of roughly 1.01% in survival probability. Survival probabilities ranged from 0.80 to 0.90 at the lowest elevation site (2600 m), from 0.76 to 0.87 at the middle elevation site (3100 m) and from 0.90 to 0.94 at the highest elevation site (4150 m). These results suggest that in poor thermal quality environments mesquite lizards may employ thermoregulatory strategies (behavioral, physiological and/or morphological) to decrease their metabolic expenditure and their exposure to predators, maximizing survival. These findings highlight the relevance of thermal quality of the habitat in determining survival probability of ectotherms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The genetic basis and adult reproductive consequences of developmental thermal plasticity
VL  - 91
IS  - 6
SP  - 1119-1134
AB  - Increasing temperature and thermal variability generate profound selection on populations. Given the fast rate of environmental change, understanding the role of plasticity and genetic adaptation in response to increasing temperatures is critical. This may be especially true for thermal effects on reproductive traits in which thermal fertility limits at high temperatures may be lower than for survival traits. Consequences of changing environments during development on adult phenotypes may be particularly problematic for core traits such as reproduction that begin early in development. Here we examine the consequences of developmental thermal plasticity on subsequent adult reproductive traits and its genetic basis. We used a panel of Drosophila melanogaster (the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel; DGRP) in which male fertility performance was previously defined as either showing relatively little (status = ‘high’-performing lines) or substantial (‘low’-performing lines) decline when exposed to increasing developmental temperatures. We used a thermal reaction norm approach to quantify variation in the consequences of developmental thermal plasticity on multiple adult reproductive traits, including sex-specific responses, and to identify candidate genes underlying such variation. Developmental thermal stress impacted the means and thermal reaction norms of all reproductive traits except offspring sex ratio. Mating success declined as temperature increased with no difference between high and low lines, whereas increasing temperature resulted in declines for both male and female fertility and productivity but depended on line status. Fertility and offspring number were positively correlated within and between the sexes across lines, but males were more affected than females. We identified 933 SNPs with significant evolved genetic differentiation between high and low lines. In all, 54 of these lie within genomic windows of overall high differentiation, have significant effects of genotype on the male thermal reaction norm for productivity and are associated with 16 genes enriched for phenotypes affecting reproduction, stress responses and autophagy in Drosophila and other organisms. Our results illustrate considerable plasticity in male thermal limits on several reproductive traits following development at high temperature, and we identify differentiated loci with relevant phenotypic effects that may contribute to this population variation. While our work is on a single population, phenotypic results align with an increasing number of studies demonstrating the potential for stronger selection of thermal stress on reproductive traits, particularly in males. Such large fitness costs may have both short- and long-term consequences for the evolution of populations in response to a warming world. © 2022 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Evolution of reproductive traits have no apparent life-history associated cost in populations of Drosophila melanogaster selected for cold shock resistance
VL  - 21
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: In insect species like Drosophila melanogaster, evolution of increased resistance or evolution of particular traits under specific environmental conditions can lead to energy trade-offs with other crucial life-history traits. Adaptation to cold stress can, in principle, involve modification of reproductive traits and physiological responses. Reproductive traits carry a substantial cost; and therefore, the evolution of reproductive traits in response to cold stress could potentially lead to trade-offs with other life-history traits. We have successfully selected replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster for increased resistance to cold shock for over 33 generations. In these populations, the ability to recover from cold shock, mate, and lay fertile eggs 24 h post cold shock is under selection. These populations have evolved a suite of reproductive traits including increased egg viability, male mating ability, and siring ability post cold shock. These populations also show elevated mating rate both with and without cold shock. In the present study, we quantified a suite of life-history related traits in these populations to assess if evolution of cold shock resistance in these populations comes at a cost of other life-history traits. Results: To assess life-history cost, we measured egg viability, mating frequency, longevity, lifetime fecundity, adult mortality, larva to adult development time, larvae to adults survival, and body weight in the cold shock selected populations and their controls under two treatments (a) post cold chock and (b) without cold shock. Twenty-four hours post cold shock, the selected population had significantly higher egg viability and mating frequency compared to control populations indicating that they have higher cold shock resistance. Selected populations had significantly longer pre-adult development time compared to their control populations. Females from the selected populations had higher body weight compared to their control populations. However, we did not find any significant difference between the selected and control populations in longevity, lifetime fecundity, adult mortality, larvae to adults survival, and male body weight under the cold chock or no cold shock treatments. Conclusions: These findings suggest that cold shock selected populations have evolved higher mating frequency and egg viability. However, there is no apparent life-history associated cost with the evolution of egg viability and reproductive performances under the cold stress condition. © 2021, The Author(s).

VL  - 66
IS  - 7
SP  - 1329-1338
AB  - Climate change is one of the greatest challenges that wildlife is facing. Rapid shifts in climatic conditions may accelerate evolutionary changes in populations as a result of strong selective pressure. Most studies focus on the impact of climatic conditions on phenologies and annual cycles, whereas there are fewer reports of empirical support for climate-driven changes in the phenotypic variability of free-living populations. We investigated whether climatic variables explain the prevalence of colour polymorphism in a population of the grass snake (Natrix natrix) with two morphotypes, the melanistic and non-melanistic ones, in the period 1981–2013. We found that the prevalence of the black phenotype was negatively related to spring temperature and winter harshness, expressed as the number of snow days. According to the thermal melanism hypothesis, a high predation rate during warmer springs may override relaxed thermal benefits and vice versa, i.e. black individuals may perform better than typical ones when thermal conditions in spring are unfavourable. In turn, because they are smaller, melanistic individuals may be exposed to a higher risk of winter mortality, particularly during longer winters. We highlight the need for more studies on the effects of climatic conditions on temporal variation in melanism prevalence in other populations and species as well as in various geographic regions. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Society of Biometeorology.

TI  - Effects of water temperature on freshwater macroinvertebrates: a systematic review
AB  - Water temperature is one of the main abiotic factors affecting the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems and its alteration can have important effects on biological communities. Macroinvertebrates are excellent bio-indicators and have been used for decades to assess the status of aquatic ecosystems as a result of environmental stresses; however, their responses to temperature are poorly documented and have not been systematically evaluated. The aims of this review are: (i) to collate and summarize responses of freshwater macroinvertebrates to different temperature conditions, comparing the results of experimental and theoretical studies; (ii) to understand how the focus of research on the effects of temperature on macroinvertebrates has changed during the last 51 years; and (iii) to identify research gaps regarding temperature responses, ecosystem types, organism groups, spatiotemporal scales, and geographical regions to suggest possible research directions. We performed a comparative assessment of 223 publications that specifically consider freshwater macroinvertebrates and address the effects of temperature. Short-term studies performed in the laboratory and focusing on insects exposed to a range of temperatures dominated. Field studies were carried out mainly in Europe, at catchment scale and almost exclusively in rivers; they mainly investigated responses to water thermal regime at the community scale. The most frequent biological responses tested were growth rate, fecundity and the time and length of emergence, whereas ecological responses mainly involved composition, richness, and distribution. Thermal research on freshwater macroinvertebrates has undergone a shift since the 2000s when studies involving extended spatiotemporal scales and investigating the effects of global warming first appeared. In addition, recent studies have considered the effects of temperature at genetic and evolutionary scales. Our review revealed that the effects of temperature on macroinvertebrates are manifold with implications at different levels, from genes to communities. However, community-level physiological, phenological and fitness responses tested on individuals or populations should be studied in more detail given their macroecological effects are likely to be enhanced by climate warming. In addition, most field studies at regional scales have used air temperature as a proxy for water temperature; obtaining accurate water temperature data in future studies will be important to allow proper consideration of the spatial thermal heterogeneity of water bodies and any effects on macroinvertebrate distribution patterns. Finally, we found an uneven number of studies across different ecosystems and geographic areas, with lentic bodies and regions outside the West underrepresented. It will also be crucial to include macroinvertebrates of high-altitude and tropical areas in future work because these groups are most vulnerable to climate warming for multiple reasons. Further studies on temperature–macroinvertebrate relationships are needed to fill the current gaps and facilitate appropriate conservation strategies for freshwater ecosystems in an anthropogenic-driven era. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Conflicts of interests between males and females over reproduction is a universal feature of sexually reproducing organisms and has driven the evolution of intersexual mimicry, mating behaviours and reproductive polymorphisms. Here, we show how temperature drives pre-reproductive selection in a female colour polymorphic insect that is subject to strong sexual conflict. These species have three female colour morphs, one of which is a male mimic. This polymorphism is maintained by frequency-dependent sexual conflict caused by male mating harassment. The frequency of female morphs varies geographically, with higher frequency of the male mimic at higher latitudes. We show that differential temperature sensitivity of the female morphs and faster sexual maturation of the male mimic increases the frequency of this morph in the north. These results suggest that sexual conflict during the adult stage is shaped by abiotic factors and frequency-independent pre-reproductive selection that operate earlier during ontogeny of these female morphs. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS

TI  - Adjusting to climate: Acclimation, adaptation and developmental plasticity in physiological traits of a tropical rainforest lizard
VL  - 13
IS  - 4
SP  - 411-427
AB  - The impact of climate change may be felt most keenly by tropical ectotherms. In these taxa, it is argued, thermal specialization means a given shift in temperature will have a larger effect on fitness. For species with limited dispersal ability, the impact of climate change depends on the capacity for their climate-relevant traits to shift. Such shifts can occur through genetic adaptation, various forms of plasticity, or a combination of these processes. Here we assess the extent and causes of shifts in 7 physiological traits in a tropical lizard, the rainforest sunskink (Lampropholis coggeri). Two populations were sampled that differ from each other in both climate and physiological traits. We compared trait values in each animal soon after field collection versus following acclimation to laboratory conditions. We also compared trait values between populations in: (i) recently field-collected animals; (ii) the same animals following laboratory acclimation; and (iii) the laboratory-reared offspring of these animals. Our results reveal high trait lability, driven primarily by acclimation and local adaptation. By contrast, developmental plasticity, resulting from incubation temperature, had little to no effect on most traits. These results suggest that, while specialized, tropical ectotherms may be capable of rapid shifts in climate-relevant traits. © 2018 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

VL  - 48
IS  - 127
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate species and provenances of Eucalyptus spp., selecting those with high survival and productive potential under the conditions of the Santa Catarina Plateau. The test is located in the municipality of Rio Negrinho, northern Santa Catarina state. The stand was established in December 1999 with thirteen species of the genus Eucalyptus, originating from seeds of different origins. The experiment was carried out in a randomized block design with three replications and linear plots. The variables evaluated were survival (%), height (m), diameter at breast height (cm), volume (m3) and bifurcation of the individuals. Potential species in relation to quantitative characteristics were E. smithii, E. dunnii, E. benthamii, E. badjensis and E. dorrigoensis. For the qualitative variables E. badjensis, E. macarthurii, E. benthamii and E. dorrigoensis presented the best results. It was possible to verify the wide variability of the characteristics evaluated between provenances, highlighting the importance of choosing adapted genetic materials with superior quantitative characteristics. The study shows that other Eucalyptus species, besides those usually planted in the region, have a potential for commercial stands, tolerating low temperatures, frost occurrence and good productivity. © 2020 University of Sao Paolo.

TI  - Improvement of cinnamon (C. burmanii) sorting and grading through influencing factors
VL  - 425
AB  - Labour productivity influenced by work-in-process, labour skills, machineries and working environment. This study identified factors affecting the labour during sorting and grading of cinnamon. Five factors used as independent variables, namely working motivation (X1), working environment (X2), salary (X3), age (X4) and workload (X5). Factors then correlated with labour performance (Y) as dependent variable. Samples were randomly selected from respondents, of the Rasdi Fo &amp; Co. Personal characterization calculated from employee's years of service. Results then grouped according to the labour experienced, and statistical analyses were set according to F test, t test, power function, and influence factors. These methods used to analyse the working environment, in correlation to the employee performance, room temperature, humidity, lighting, and noise levels. From the results, X2, X3, X4 and X5 had no significant effect, while Y can be described as a function of 2,06(X10.326)(X20.016)(X30.170)(X40.479)(X5-0.172). Maximum room temperature recorded at 38.4°C, while minimum temperature recorded at 29.3°C, lower than the ideal level. Maximum and minimum humidity (RH) was 91.3 % and 59.2 %, respectively. The RH in working environment exceed normal level. The noise level recorded between 48.8 dBA and 78.4 dBA, which classified as normal without ear protection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Fluctuating heat stress during development exposes reproductive costs and putative benefits
VL  - 91
IS  - 2
SP  - 391-403
AB  - Temperature and thermal variability are increasing worldwide, with well-known survival consequences. However, effects on other potentially more thermally sensitive reproductive traits are less understood, especially when considering thermal variation. Studying the consequences of male reproduction in the context of climate warming and ability to adapt is becoming increasingly relevant. Our goals were to test how exposure to different average temperatures that either fluctuated or remained constant impacts different male reproductive performance traits and to assess adaptive potential to future heat stress. We took advantage of a set of Drosophila melanogaster isogenic lines of different genotypes, exposing them to four different thermal conditions. These conditions represented a benign and a stressful mean temperature, applied either constantly or fluctuating around the mean and experienced during development when heat stress avoidance is hindered because of restricted mobility. We measured subsequent male reproductive performance for mating success, fertility, number of offspring produced and offspring sex ratio, and calculated the influence of thermal stress on estimated heritability and evolvability of these reproductive traits. Both costs and benefits to different thermal conditions on reproductive performance were found, with some responses varying between genotypes. Mating success improved under fluctuating benign temperature conditions and declined as temperature stress increased regardless of genotype. Fertility and productivity were severely reduced at fluctuating mean high temperature for all genotypes, but some genotypes were unaffected at constant high mean temperature. These more thermally robust genotypes showed a slight increase in productivity under the fluctuating benign condition compared to constant high temperature, despite both thermal conditions sharing the same temperature for 6 hr daily. Increasing thermal stress resulted in higher heritability and evolvability. Overall, the effects of temperature on reproductive performance depended on the trait and genotype; performance of some traits slightly increased when high temperatures were experienced for short periods but decreased substantially even when experiencing a benign temperature for a portion of each day. While thermal stress increased genetic variation that could provide adaptive potential against climate warming, this is unlikely to compensate for the overall severe negative effect on reproductive performance as mean temperature and variance increase. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Time's arrow, time's cycle: Granulite metamorphism and geodynamics
VL  - 83
IS  - 3
SP  - 323-338
AB  - Although the thermal evolution of the mantle before c. 3.0 Ga remains undear, since c. 3.0 Ga secular cooling has dominated over heat production-this is time's arrow. By contrast, the thermal history of the crust, which is preserved in the record of metamorphism, is more complex. Heat to drive metamorphism is generated by radioactive decay and viscous dissipation, and is augmented by the influx of heat from the mantle. Notwithstanding that reliable data are sparse before the Neoarchean, we use a dataset of temperature (7), pressure (P) and thermobaric ratio (T/P at the metamorphic 'peak), and age of metamorphism (t, the timing of the metamorphic 'peak') for rocks from 564 localities ranging in age from the Cenozoic to the Eoarchean eras to interrogate the crustal record of metamorphism as a proxy for the heat budget of the crust through time. On the basis of TIP, metamorphic rocks are classified into three natural groups: high T/P type (T/P >775 degrees C/GPa, mean T/P similar to 1105 degrees C/GPa), including common and ultrahigh-temperature granulites, intermediate T/P type (T/P between 775 and 375 degrees C/GPa, mean T/P similar to 575 degrees C/GPa), including high-pressure granulites and medium- and high-temperature eclogites, and low T/P type (T/P <375 degrees C/GPa, mean T/P , similar to 255 degrees C/GPa), including blueschists, low-temperature eclogites and ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic rocks. A monotonic increase in the P of intermediate T/P metamorphism from the Neoarchean to the Neoproterozoic reflects strengthening of the lithosphere during secular cooling of the mantle-this is also time's arrow. However, temporal variation in the P of intermediate T/P metamorphism and in the moving means of T and TIP of high T/P metamorphism, combined with the clustered age distribution, demonstrate the cyclicity of collisional orogenesis and cyclic variations in the heat budget of the crust superimposed on secular cooling since c. 3.0 Ga-this is time's cycle. A first cycle began with the widespread appearance/survival of intermediate T/P and high T/P metamorphism in the Neoarchean rock record coeval with amalgamation of dispersed blocks of lithosphere to form protocontinents. This cycle was terminated by the fragmentation of the protocontinents into cratons in the early Paleoproterozoic, which signalled the start of a new cycle. The second cycle continued with the progressive amalgamation of the cratons into the supercontinent Columbia and extended until the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia in the Neoproterozoic. This cycle represented a period of relative tectonic and environmental stability, and perhaps reduced subduction during at least part of the cycle. During most of the Proterozoic the moving means for both T and T/P of high T/P metamorphism exceeded the arithmetic means, reflecting insulation of the mantle beneath the quasi-integrated lithosphere of Columbia and, after a limited reorganisation, Rodinia. The third cycle began with the steep decline in thermobaric ratios of high T/P metamorphism to their lowest value, synchronous with the breakup of Rodinia and the formation of Pannotia, and the widespread appearance/preservation of low T/P metamorphism in the rock record. The thermobaric ratios for high T/P metamorphism rise to another peak associated with the Pan-African event, again reflecting insulation of the mantle. The subsequent steep decline in thermobaric ratios of high T/P metamorphism associated with the breakup of Pangea at c. 0.175 Ga may indicate the start of a fourth cycle. The limited occurrence of high and intermediate T/P metamorphism before the Neoarchean suggests either that suitable tectonic environments to generate these types of metamorphism were not widely available before then or that the rate of survival was low. We interpret the first cycle to record stabilisation of subduction and the emergence of a network of plate boundaries in a plate tectonics regime once the balance between heat production and heat loss changed in favour of secular cooling, possibly as early as c. 3.0 Ga in some areas. This is inferred to have been a globally linked system by the early Paleoproterozoic, but whether it remained continuous to the present is unclear. The second cycle was characterised by stability from the formation of Columbia to the breakup of Rodinia, generating higher than average T and TIP of high T/P metamorphism. The third cycle reflects colder collisional orogenesis and deep subduction of the continental crust, features that are characteristic of modern plate tectonics, which became possible once the average temperature of the asthenospheric mantle had declined to <100 degrees C warmer than the present day after c. 1.0 Ga.

TI  - Adaptations of early development to local spawning temperature in anadromous populations of pike (Esox lucius)
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: In the wake of climate change many environments will be exposed to increased and more variable temperatures. Knowledge about how species and populations respond to altered temperature regimes is therefore important to improve projections of how ecosystems will be affected by global warming, and to aid management. We conducted a common garden, split-brood temperature gradient (4.5 °C, 9.7 °C and 12.3 °C) experiment to study the effects of temperature in two populations (10 families from each population) of anadromous pike (Esox lucius) that normally experience different temperatures during spawning. Four offspring performance measures (hatching success, day degrees until hatching, fry survival, and fry body length) were compared between populations and among families. Results: Temperature affected all performance measures in a population-specific manner. Low temperature had a positive effect on the Harfjärden population and a negative effect on the Lervik population. Further, the effects of temperature differed among families within populations. Conclusions: The population-specific responses to temperature indicate genetic differentiation in developmental plasticity between populations, and may reflect an adaptation to low temperature during early fry development in Harfjärden, where the stream leading up to the wetland dries out relatively early in the spring, forcing individuals to spawn early. The family-specific responses to temperature treatment indicate presence of genetic variation for developmental plasticity (G x E) within both populations. Protecting between- and within-population genetic variation for developmental plasticity and high temperature-related adaptive potential of early life history traits will be key to long-term viability and persistence in the face of continued climate change. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Overwinter thermal habitat use in lakes by anadromous arctic char
VL  - 75
IS  - 12
SP  - 2343-2353
AB  - Anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) migrate back to fresh water in late summer to spawn and (or) overwinter. Upon freshwater entry, feeding is reduced or absent, and movement activity is restricted. While the physiological responses to low temperatures (e.g., growth, metabolism) are understood, specifics of the use of thermal habitat for overwintering remains poorly characterized. This study used acoustic and archival telemetry data from two lakes in southern Labrador, Canada, to study thermal habitat use during the ice-covered period. Results showed that lake-dwelling anadromous Arctic char predominantly occupied a narrow range of temperatures (0.5–2 °C) and used cooler temperatures available within the middle and upper water column. Use of the selected temperatures is likely a strategy that lowers metabolic costs and minimizes energy expenditure, preserving stored lipids for overwinter survival and the energetic costs of preparation for seaward migration. As Arctic char are visual feeders, use of the upper water column is also thought to aid foraging efficiency by increasing the likelihood of prey capture. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing.

TI  - Fine-Tuning Temperatures in Restricted Boltzmann Machines Using Meta-Heuristic Optimization
AB  - Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) are stochastic neural networks mainly used for image reconstruction and unsupervised feature learning. An enhanced version, the temperature-based RBM (T-RBM), considers a new temperature parameter during the learning process that influences the neurons' activation. Nevertheless, the major vulnerability of such models concerns selecting an adequate system's temperature, which might lead them to inadequate training or even overfitting when wrongly set, thus limiting the network from predicting or working effectively over unseen data. This paper addresses the problem of selecting a suitable system's temperature through a meta-heuristic optimization process. Meta-heuristic-driven techniques, such as Particle Swarm Optimization, Bat Algorithm, and Artificial Bee Colony are employed to find proper values for the temperature parameter. Additionally, for comparison purposes, three standard temperature values and a random search are used as baselines. The results revealed that optimizing T-RBM is suitable for training purposes, primarily due to their complex fitness landscape, which makes fine-tuning temperatures a nontrivial task. © 2020 IEEE.

The effect of microenvironmental abiotic conditions (luminosity, temperature and relative humidity) and biotic conditions (distance from the soil to a treehopper host and host-plant phenological stage) on this tritrophic interaction was examined. Overall, the results suggest i) intensity of mite infestation (mean number of mites per infested female or family) of treehoppers (insect hosts) was twice on SU than on BS, ii) a preference of L. hringuri larvae for places with more luminosity (on both host-plants) and relative humidity (on SU), iii) a negative correlation between larval infestation and distance of the host colony to the ground, and iv) that larvae of L. hringuri could detect cues (i.e. chemical) emitted by their insect hosts or the host-plant of the insect host. Results indicate that luminosity, humidity and distance to the ground of the insect-host microenvironment affect both parasitization and prevalence of Leptus larvae mites; however, further research will be needed to understand the ecological mechanisms and consequences of these interactions and to test the hypotheses proposed herein under a chemical ecology perspective. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

SP  - 457-462
AB  - Dooars region of West Bengal is popularly known for its 3Ts: Tea, Tree and Tourism. One of the wise approaches for tea gardeners is to spray pesticides at the onset or prior to attack of the pest. Loppers are the chief culprit in this scenario. Moreover, pest surveillance also depended on climatic condition more specifically different environmental abiotic factor. This paper addressed this vital issue. Here attempts were undertaken to understand effect of rainfall and temperature on productivity of tea. In this pilot study, Madhu Tea Estate was taken as control site as because since last 10 years it was locked out and proper maintenance such as pruning, irrigation and pesticide spraying was not at all being done. On the other hand, Borodighi Tea Garden and Chowafulli Tea Garden were selected as experimental sites where proper maintenance was being done. The Borodighi Tea Garden and Chowafulli Tea Garden were situated in Jalpaiguri district. More specifically, two experimental sites were very closely associated territory. It was being found through analysis of Minitab software version 18 that both rainfall and temperature had positive correlation with productivity. © 2020, Agri. Bio. Publishers. All rights reserved.

TI  - Responses of the Northern Bering Sea and Southeastern Bering Sea Pelagic Ecosystems Following Record-Breaking Low Winter Sea Ice
VL  - 46
IS  - 16
SP  - 9833-9842
AB  - Bering Sea sea ice during winter 2017-2018 was the lowest ever recorded. Ecosystem effects of low ice have been observed in the southeastern Bering Sea, but never in the northern Bering Sea. Observations in both systems included weakened water column stratification, delayed spring bloom, and low abundances of large crustacean zooplankton. Summer Cold Pool presence was extremely limited. Young walleye pollock production and condition were similar to prior warm years, though catches of other pelagic forage fishes were low. Summer seabird die-offs were observed in the northern Bering Sea, and to lesser extent in the southeastern Bering Sea, and reproductive success was poor at monitored colonies. Selected bottom-up responses to lack of sea ice in the north were similar to those in the south, potentially providing environmental indicators to project ecosystem effects in a lesser studied system. Results offer a potential glimpse of the broader Bering Sea pelagic ecosystem under future low-ice projections. Plain Language Summary During the winter of 2017-2018, there was a lack of winter sea ice in the northern and southeastern Bering Sea. This was unprecedented, and its implications were unknown, especially for the northern Bering Sea. Ecosystem surveys showed that oceanic plants and animals at the base of the food web were delayed in their spring production and food quality was generally low. Abundances of young walleye pollock, a commercial species important to the global fish market, were average in 2018, but catches of other forage fishes were lower. Seabird die-offs in the northern Bering Sea were extensive. If heat-related ecosystem changes previously observed in the southeastern Bering Sea ecosystem are now happening in the northern Bering Sea, disruptions to food webs and increased die-offs could occur if oceans continue to warm in the future.

VL  - 127

SP  - 1355-1367
AB  - The evolution of species or ecotypes can occur gradually through neutral and adaptive genetic changes. To explore the influence of natural selection during early phases of divergence, morphological and ecological discontinuity and its adaptive significance were investigated in six pairs of alpine and independently evolved montane populations of Heliosperma pusillum s.l.; the latter are usually taxonomically recognised at the species rank in spite of their highly debatable taxonomic value. We tested whether environmental conditions – characterised by Landolt indicator values from vegetation surveys and temperature measurements – and morphology of alpine and montane populations differ discretely and in parallel across six population pairs. By reciprocal transplantation experiments in natural environments in two population pairs and in climate chambers for five population pairs we compared fitness of native versus non-native individuals. Alpine and montane populations differed in environmental conditions and morphology within each pair. Morphological differentiation occurred in parallel and correlated with environmental, but not with genetic distances. In both environments, native individuals had higher establishment success and plant size. Differentiation of the independently evolved montane populations is driven by natural selection and parallel, independent adaptation in response to drought, lower irradiance and higher, less fluctuating temperatures in montane populations. Our study system exemplifies rapid, parallel evolution leading to morphologically and ecologically strongly divergent, though fully interfertile, ecotypes. © 2018 The Authors

TI  - Haemoglobin-mediated response to hyper-thermal stress in the keystone species Daphnia magna
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
SP  - 112-120
AB  - Anthropogenic global warming has become a major geological and environmental force driving drastic changes in natural ecosystems. Due to the high thermal conductivity of water and the effects of temperature on metabolic processes, freshwater ecosystems are among the most impacted by these changes. The ability to tolerate changes in temperature may determine species long-term survival and fitness. Therefore, it is critical to identify coping mechanisms to thermal and hyper-thermal stress in aquatic organisms. A central regulatory element compensating for changes in oxygen supply and ambient temperature is the respiratory protein haemoglobin (Hb). Here, we quantify Hb plastic and evolutionary response in Daphnia magna subpopulations resurrected from the sedimentary archive of a lake with known history of increase in average temperature and recurrence of heat waves. By measuring constitutive changes in crude Hb protein content among subpopulations, we assessed evolution of the Hb gene family in response to temperature increase. To quantify the contribution of plasticity in the response of this gene family to hyper-thermal stress, we quantified changes in Hb content in all subpopulations under hyper-thermal stress as compared to nonstressful temperature. Further, we tested competitive abilities of genotypes as a function of their Hb content, constitutive and induced. We found that Hb-rich genotypes have superior competitive abilities as compared to Hb-poor genotypes under hyper-thermal stress after a period of acclimation. These findings suggest that whereas long-term adjustment to higher occurrence of heat waves may require a combination of plasticity and genetic adaptation, plasticity is most likely the coping mechanism to hyper-thermal stress in the short term. Our study suggests that with higher occurrence of heat waves, Hb-rich genotypes may be favoured with potential long-term impact on population genetic diversity. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Geochemical Characteristics, Hydrocarbon Potential, and Depositional Environment Evolution of Fine-Grained Mixed Source Rocks in the Permian Lucaogou Formation, Jimusaer Sag, Junggar Basin
VL  - 35
IS  - 1
SP  - 264-282
AB  - The Permian Lucaogou Formation (P2l) in the Jimusaer Sag, Junggar Basin is an essential source rock and a tight oil-producing layer in China. The source rock of the Lucaogou Formation is characterized by mixed sedimentation of siliciclastics, carbonates, and tuffaceous materials, and the formation of mixed source rocks is different from that of conventional source rocks (e.g., mudstones or carbonates). Our petrological observation and X-ray diffraction mineralogical analysis suggest that the mixed source rocks are divided into three types: terrigenous-dominated mixed rocks (Td-mixed rocks), carbonate-dominated mixed rocks (Cd-mixed rocks), and tuffaceous-dominated mixed rocks (Tuf-mixed rocks). Compared with the upper section, more Td- and Tuf-mixed rocks, as well as less Cd-mixed rocks, developed in the lower section. Integrated organic geochemical and molecular geochemical analyses indicate that the Lucaogou mixed source rock is abundant in organic matter (OM) (TOC = 3.12 wt %), which is at the thermally low mature to mature stage. The sources of OM mainly originate from the mixture of planktonic organisms, bacteria, and terrigenous higher plants. Comparatively, some geochemical parameters (e.g., TOC, S1 + S2, and hydrogen index) of the upper section of P2l show slightly higher values than those of the lower section both before and after extraction, indicating a higher hydrocarbon generation potential of the source rocks in the upper section. Besides, more finely disseminated bacterial and planktonic organics are present in the upper section, whereas the lower section is more enriched in terrestrial OM. The mixed source rocks of the lower section were deposited in a deeper, anoxic-dysoxic, and brackish environment, whereas those of the upper section were deposited in a shallow, suboxic, saline, and evaporative environment. Moreover, we found that the lacustrine basin evolved from a more balanced-filled scenario with moderate productivity during the lower section deposition to an under-filled lake basin with higher productivity during the upper section deposition, in response to the climatic change from warm humid to hot semiarid conditions. Accordingly, the corresponding depositional models of mixed source rocks in the upper and lower sections of the Lucaogou Formation are proposed. Overall, the mixed rocks of the Lucaogou Formation can be regarded as good source rocks, which could offer favorable targets and resource potential for tight oil exploration. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

VL  - 102
IS  - 7
SP  - 3327-3336
AB  - Finding ways to predict and control the survival of bacterial aerosols can contribute to the development of ways to alleviate a number of crucial microbiological problems. Significant damage in the membrane integrity of Escherichia coli during aerosolization and airborne suspension has been revealed which has prompted the question of how the membrane fatty acid composition and fluidity influence the survival of airborne bacteria. Two approaches of using isogenic mutants and different growth temperatures were selected to manipulate the membrane fatty acid composition of E. coli before challenging the bacteria with different relative humidity (RH) levels in an aerosol chamber. Among the mutants (fabR−, cfa. fadA−), fabR− had the lowest membrane fluidity index (FI) and generally showed a higher survival than the parental strain. Surprisingly, its resistance to airborne stress was so strong that its viability was fully maintained even after airborne suspension at 40% RH, a harsh RH level to bacterial survival. Moreover, E. coli cultured at 20 °C with a higher FI than that at 30 and 37 °C generally had a lower survival after aerosolization and airborne suspension. Unlike FI, individual fatty acid and cyclopropane fatty acid composition did not relate to the bacterial survival. Lipid peroxidation of the membrane was undetected in all the bacteria. Membrane fluidity plays a stronger role in determining the bacteria survival during airborne suspension than during aerosolization. Certain relationships between FI and bacteria survival were identified, which could help predict the transmission of bacteria under different conditions. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Long-lived larch clones may conserve adaptations that could restrict treeline migration in northern Siberia
VL  - 10
IS  - 18
SP  - 10017-10030
AB  - The occurrence of refugia beyond the arctic treeline and genetic adaptation therein play a crucial role of largely unknown effect size. While refugia have potential for rapidly colonizing the tundra under global warming, the taxa may be maladapted to the new environmental conditions. Understanding the genetic composition and age of refugia is thus crucial for predicting any migration response. Here, we genotype 194 larch individuals from an ~1.8 km2 area in northcentral Siberia on the southern Taimyr Peninsula by applying an assay of 16 nuclear microsatellite markers. For estimating the age of clonal individuals, we counted tree rings at sections along branches to establish a lateral growth rate that was then combined with geographic distance. Findings reveal that the predominant reproduction type is clonal (58.76%) by short distance spreading of ramets. One outlier of clones 1 km apart could have been dispersed by reindeer. In clonal groups and within individuals, we find that somatic mutations accumulate with geographic distance. Clonal groups of two or more individuals are observed. Clonal age estimates regularly suggest individuals as old as 2,200 years, which coincides with a major environmental change that forced a treeline retreat in the region. We conclude that individuals with clonal growth mode were naturally selected as it lowers the likely risk of extinction under a harsh environment. We discuss this legacy from the past that might now be a maladaptation and hinder expansion under currently strongly increasing temperatures. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Iodine is a microelement which occurs in natural water in different concentrations dependent on water type, origin and total dissolved solids concentration. The objects of research were natural geothermal water. In this paper, the fitness of the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method for iodine determination in water with higher temperatures was tested and selected methodological problems were discussed. Basic method parameters (precision, accuracy, linearity, uncertainty) were determined. Calculated statistical parameters of the validated method fulfil the assumed criteria. The received results (correlation coefficient equal to 0.999) show that the linearity of the ICP-MS method is good. The accuracy was expressed as recovery (R) and according to the literature is at an acceptable level. The results of precision assessments (RSD) also correspond to the literature data. © IWA Publishing 2019.

TI  - Portable aerosol sampler with liquid phase for collection of biopathogens at subzero temperatures
VL  - 11869
AB  - Aerosol samplers with a recirculating liquid film are promising devices for remote biological monitoring. The presence of the liquid film provides a high survival rate for biological objects. The relatively simpler design allows portability to the sampler, which will make it possible to conduct tests outside the laboratory. In this study an analytical expression, describing the capturing efficiency of aerosol particles in the water film, taking into account the friction forces arising from interaction of water and air in a cyclone-based aerosol collector, was obtained. A new element, took over from the theory of centrifugal sprayers - a vortex chamber, was added to the theory and design of the collector. It allows increasing the initial angular moment of the elements of air volume entering the collector, which leads in appropriately an increase of maximal height of rising liquid film and particle capturing efficiency. To analyze the obtained expressions, graphs of particle capturing efficiency on basic parameters of modified cyclone collector and volumetric air flow were calculated. The graphs made it possible to determine the optimal geometric parameters for the portable cyclone-based collector. The introduced dependence on viscosity made it possible to estimate more accurately the efficiency of the device at various temperatures (including negative temperatures). For the selected parameters, graphs particle capturing efficiency were plotted. Water-alcohol solution and Novec 1230 fluid were used as fluids capable of operating at subzero temperatures. To check the operability of the sampler, tests were carried out to collect samples of sprayed inactivated adenovirus in a microbiological safety box at the Gamaleya Institute. The results of tests are discussed. © 2021 SPIE

TI  - Microbial Survival in an Extreme Martian Analog Ecosystem: Poás Volcano, Costa Rica
VL  - 9
AB  - Past acid-sulfate hydrothermal systems on Mars have promise in their ability to have hosted life for billions of years. One method for analyzing these systems is to study analog environments on Earth. To assess the astrobiological potential of Martian acid-sulfate hydrothermal systems, the crater lake of the active Poás Volcano, Laguna Caliente, was sampled in 2013 and 2017. Laguna Caliente presents an extremely dynamic terrestrial environment with near-ambient to boiling temperatures, pH fluctuations from −0.87 to 1.5, a wide range of chemistries and redox potential, and frequent phreatic-to-phreatomagmatic eruptions. Samples of lake fluid, sulfur clumps, and lake bottom sediment underwent 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic “shotgun” sequencing, which revealed this lake hosts an extremely low biodiversity of microorganisms dominated by Acidiphilium spp. Shotgun metagenomics of the samples suggests this community has numerous genetic adaptations that confer survival, including functional pathways to reduce the effects of toxic metals and numerous metabolic pathways utilizing a variety of simple and complex sugar molecules. The identification of these various metabolic pathways suggests adaptations related to carbon limited environments, fulfillment of high energy requirements, and survival in a hostile volcanic setting. The perseverance of life in Laguna Caliente indicates life on Mars could have thrived in analogous environments, stressing the need for the search for life in relict Martian acid-sulfate hydrothermal systems.

TI  - Accelerated western European heatwave trends linked to more-persistent double jets over Eurasia
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Persistent heat extremes can have severe impacts on ecosystems and societies, including excess mortality, wildfires, and harvest failures. Here we identify Europe as a heatwave hotspot, exhibiting upward trends that are three-to-four times faster compared to the rest of the northern midlatitudes over the past 42 years. This accelerated trend is linked to atmospheric dynamical changes via an increase in the frequency and persistence of double jet stream states over Eurasia. We find that double jet occurrences are particularly important for western European heatwaves, explaining up to 35% of temperature variability. The upward trend in the persistence of double jet events explains almost all of the accelerated heatwave trend in western Europe, and about 30% of it over the extended European region. Those findings provide evidence that in addition to thermodynamical drivers, atmospheric dynamical changes have contributed to the increased rate of European heatwaves, with implications for risk management and potential adaptation strategies. Europe is a heatwave hotspot exhibiting three-to-four times faster upward trends compared to the rest of the northern midlatitudes. Here, this accelerated trend is linked to the increased persistence of Eurasian double jets in the upper troposphere.

TI  - Phenotypic and transcriptional response of Daphnia pulicaria to the combined effects of temperature and predation
VL  - 17
IS  - 7
AB  - Daphnia, an ecologically important zooplankton species in lakes, shows both genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature and fish predation, but little is known about the molecular basis of these responses and their potential interactions. We performed a factorial experiment exposing laboratory-propagated Daphnia pulicaria clones from two lakes in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California to normal or high temperature (15C or 25C) in the presence or absence of fish kairomones, then measured changes in life history and gene expression. Exposure to kairomones increased upper thermal tolerance limits for physiological activity in both clones. Cloned individuals matured at a younger age in response to higher temperature and kairomones, while size at maturity, fecundity and population intrinsic growth were only affected by temperature. At the molecular level, both clones expressed more genes differently in response to temperature than predation, but specific genes involved in metabolic, cellular, and genetic processes responded differently between the two clones. Although gene expression differed more between clones from different lakes than experimental treatments, similar phenotypic responses to predation risk and warming arose from these clone-specific patterns. Our results suggest that phenotypic plasticity responses to temperature and kairomones interact synergistically, with exposure to fish predators increasing the tolerance of Daphnia pulicaria to stressful temperatures, and that similar phenotypic responses to temperature and predator cues can be produced by divergent patterns of gene regulation. © 2022 Oliver et al.

VL  - 57

SP  - 113-121
AB  - Insects are ectothermic organisms; hence, all aspects of their biology are strongly influenced by ambient temperatures. Different insect species respond differently with phenotypic plasticity and/or genetic adaptation to changing temperatures. Here, we tested the thermal adaptation of the house fly and three of its parasitoids species by comparing life-history parameters in populations from a hot climate region (Jordan Valley) and from a moderate-climate region (Galilee). No significant differences were found between the two house fly populations, both under hot and moderate experimental conditions. Life-history parameters of the parasitoids (Muscidifurax raptor Girault & Sanders, Spalangia endius Walker, and Spalangia cameroni Perkins [Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae]) varied markedly between origins, species, sexes, and experimental conditions. Of the three species tested, only M. raptor collected in the Jordan Valley proved better adapted to experimental heat conditions, compared to its counterpart population that was collected in the Galilee. Additionally, we tested the effect of elevating temperatures on a house fly lab population for 17 consecutive generations and found no evidence for heat adaptation. We discuss our results in the context of house fly control and global warming. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America.

TI  - Contrasting Carbon Allocation Strategies of Ring-Porous and Diffuse-Porous Species Converge Toward Similar Growth Responses to Drought
VL  - 12
AB  - Extreme climatic events that are expected under global warming expose forest ecosystems to drought stress, which may affect the growth and productivity. We assessed intra-annual growth responses of trees to soil water content in species belonging to different functional groups of tree-ring porosity. We pose the hypothesis that species with contrasting carbon allocation strategies, which emerge from different relationships between wood traits and canopy architecture, display divergent growth responses to drought. We selected two diffuse-porous species (Acer saccharum and Betula alleghaniensis) and two ring-porous species (Quercus rubra and Fraxinus americana) from the mixed forest of Quebec (Canada). We measured anatomical wood traits and canopy architecture in eight individuals per species and assessed tree growth sensitivity to water balance during 2008–2017 using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI). Stem elongation in diffuse-porous species mainly depended upon the total number of ramifications and hydraulic diameter of the tree-ring vessels. In ring-porous species, stem elongation mainly depended upon the productivity of the current year, i.e., number of vessels and basal area increment. Diffuse-porous and ring-porous species had similar responses to soil water balance. The effect of soil water balance on tree growth changed during the growing season. In April, decreasing soil temperature linked to wet conditions could explain the negative relationship between SPEI and tree growth. In late spring, greater water availability affected carbon partitioning, by promoting the formation of larger xylem vessels in both functional groups. Results suggest that timings and duration of drought events affect meristem growth and carbon allocation in both functional groups. Drought induces the formation of fewer xylem vessels in ring-porous species, and smaller xylem vessels in diffuse-porous species, the latter being also prone to a decline in stem elongation due to a reduced number of ramifications. Indeed, stem elongation of diffuse-porous species is influenced by environmental conditions of the previous year, which determine the total number of ramifications during the current year. Drought responses in different functional groups are thus characterized by different drivers, express contrasting levels of resistance or resilience, but finally result in an overall similar loss of productivity.

VL  - 111

AB  - The effects of cold storage temperature and exposure duration on different developmental stages of spotted-wing drosophila (SWD) Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidae) on 'Campbell Early' grapes were examined to establish a phytosanitary control method. The immature stages (eggs, larvae and pupae) of SWD were all dead after a 6-d cold treatment at 1°C and 8-d cold treatment at 1.5 and 2°C. Probit-9 estimated a fourfold increase in cold treatment duration to achieve 99.9968% mortality, compared with the observed mortality. Efficacy tests using pupae, which were the most cold-tolerant stage, confirmed the validity of the selected temperature and exposure durations. Based on these results, 1°C, which requires a shorter exposure for complete mortality, was selected for the test in conditions that mimic those of grape exportation. Six-day cold treatments at 1°C produced 99.57%, mortality in different replicates, although the surviving pupae died later. Conversely, the 8- and 10-d treatments at 1°C showed 100% mortality, suggesting that these treatments can provide quarantine security against infestations of SWD on exported Campbell Early grapes, although an additional experiment with an increased sample size is required for further reliable conclusion. © The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - High regional and intrageneric variation in susceptibility to mass bleaching in Indo-Pacific coral species
VL  - 30
IS  - 9
SP  - 1889-1898
AB  - Aim: We investigate how susceptibility to mass bleaching varies between closely related coral species, and the validity of applying these susceptibility data (at the appropriate taxonomic level) across geographical regions. We also conduct a preliminary analysis of factors likely to affect geographical variability and examine which data are required for adequate assessment of the risk to species and regional populations from repeated mass bleaching events. Location: Twenty-two sites in the central Great Barrier Reef, Australia (GBR) and 30 sites in the central Maldives Archipelago (MA). Time period: 2002 for the GBR and 2016 for the MA. Major taxa studied: Corals (order Scleractinia). Methods: After marine heat-wave conditions, timed in situ surveys recorded bleaching responses of 7,368 coral colonies exposed to similar levels of temperature stress at a similar depth of occurrence and with similar subsequent mortality. In each region, a separate phylogenetic mixed model was used to estimate deep-time phylogenetic-, contemporary- (indicative of recent adaptation/acclimatization) and local-scale effects. The results were compared between regions in relative terms as a hierarchy of species susceptibilities. Results: Susceptibility varied widely between regions: 27 of 106 species analysed were in the same quartile for relative susceptibility in both regions. Closely related species varied widely in their individual susceptibilities. Phylogenetic effects were moderate in both regions, but greater contemporary effects in the MA suggested recent evolution and acclimatization, consistent with a stronger history of recent bleaching events. Main conclusions: The high regional and intrageneric variation in susceptibility to bleaching described here suggests that there might be important differences in the extent to which these Indian and Pacific Ocean coral populations are exhibiting responses to deep-time evolutionary changes, on the one hand, versus recent adaptation, on the other. We reveal a concerning lack of regional-scale data identifying species most at risk from this, the greatest current threat to coral reefs. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Paternal-effects in a terrestrial ectotherm are temperature dependent but no evidence for adaptive effects
VL  - 32

SP  - 1011-1021
AB  - Global rising of average temperatures and increase in extreme climatic events may largely impact animal survival and reproduction. Yet, how variation in temperature may affect male fertility, in particular ejaculate traits, and whether this can in turn affect offspring fitness, is seldom addressed. Paternal effects may be of key importance as they could impact the rate and direction of evolutionary change in response to climate change. We tested the effects of temperature experienced by males on sperm traits, and asked whether the paternal environmental temperature affected offspring phenotype. We further explored the potential for paternal effects to be adaptive, which would occur when offspring fitness increased under the same environmental conditions experienced by the fathers. We exposed male field crickets to high or low temperatures at two life stages, either throughout development or as adults, and tested sperm traits (number and quality) and offspring fitness (hatching success and survival). We further assessed sperm traits in offspring, after they had also been exposed to the same or different temperature experienced by their father. We found that temperature affected sperm traits depending on the life-stage of individuals. When the exposure was given during adulthood, males exposed to high temperature produced less sperm and of lower quality compared to males exposed to lower temperature, while if exposure was given during development, males exposed to high temperature produced more sperm and of better quality compared to males exposed to low temperatures. Offspring fitness was significantly affected by paternal temperature, evidence for anticipatory paternal effects on sperm traits was not found. Our study indicates that temperature can mediate cross-generational effects, and that paternal effects may be mediated by changes in temperature and therefore much more widespread in nature than previously assumed.

VL  - 46

SP  - 1118-1127
AB  - 1. Insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) serve a role in both desiccation resistance and sexual attractiveness. These two functions are thought to be maximised by different CHC compositions, which should lead to local adaptation between populations experiencing different natural and sexual selection pressures. 2. The Pacific field cricket (Teleogryllus oceanicus) is distributed throughout Oceania, including the Hawaiian and Cook Islands. In Hawaii, these crickets face strong natural selection from a parasitoid fly that has promoted the evolution of a novel male reproductive morph, dramatically altering sexual selection in the Hawaiian populations. The parasitoid and male polymorphism do not occur in the Cook Islands. 3. We captured male and female T. oceanicus on two Hawaiian Islands and three Cook Islands, and quantified their CHCs. We also measured temperature and RH at our collection sites to test for associations with cricket CHC profiles. 4. We discovered significant sexual dimorphism in CHC profiles, as well as differences between both island chains and particular islands. The two male reproductive morphs in Hawaii showed distinct CHC expression. There were no associations between weather variables and CHC profiles. 5. Observed differences in T. oceanicus CHC profiles appear to reflect geographic isolation rather than selection in response to local and environmental and social conditions. © 2021 The Royal Entomological Society

AB  - Since Darwin, evolutionary biologists have sought to understand the drivers and mechanisms of natural trait diversity. The field advances toward this goal with the discovery of phenotypes that vary in the wild, their relationship to ecology, and their underlying genes. Here, we established resistance to extreme low temperature in the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis briggsae as an ecological and evolutionary model system. We found that C. briggsae strains of temperate origin were strikingly more cold-resistant than those isolated from tropical localities. Transcriptional profiling revealed expression patterns unique to the resistant temperate ecotype, including dozens of genes expressed at high levels even after multiple days of cold-induced physiological slowdown. Mutational analysis validated a role in cold resistance for seven such genes. These findings highlight a candidate case of robust, genetically complex adaptation in an emerging model nematode, and shed light on the mechanisms at play. © 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - An Experimental Framework for Selectively Breeding Corals for Assisted Evolution
VL  - 8
AB  - Coral cover on tropical reefs has declined during the last three decades due to the combined effects of climate change, destructive fishing, pollution, and land use change. Drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions combined with effective coastal management and conservation strategies are essential to slow this decline. Innovative approaches, such as selective breeding for adaptive traits combined with large-scale sexual propagation, are being developed with the aim of pre-adapting reefs to increased ocean warming. However, there are still major gaps in our understanding of the technical and methodological constraints to producing corals for such restoration interventions. Here we propose a framework for selectively breeding corals and rearing them from eggs to 2.5-year old colonies using the coral Acropora digitifera as a model species. We present methods for choosing colonies for selective crossing, enhancing early survivorship in ex situ and in situ nurseries, and outplanting and monitoring colonies on natal reefs. We used a short-term (7-day) temperature stress assay to select parental colonies based on heat tolerance of excised branches. From six parental colonies, we produced 12 distinct crosses, and compared survivorship and growth of colonies transferred to in situ nurseries or outplanted to the reef at different ages. We demonstrate that selectively breeding and rearing coral colonies is technically feasible at small scales and could be upscaled as part of restorative assisted evolution initiatives. Nonetheless, there are still challenges to overcome before selective breeding can be implemented as a viable conservation tool, especially at the post-settlement and outplanting phases. Although interdisciplinary approaches will be needed to overcome many of the challenges identified in this study, selective breeding has the potential to be a viable tool within a reef managers toolbox to support the persistence of selected reefs in the face of climate change. © Copyright © 2021 Humanes, Beauchamp, Bythell, Carl, Craggs, Edwards, Golbuu, Lachs, Martinez, Palmowski, Paysinger, Randle, van der Steeg, Sweet, Treumann and Guest.

TI  - Regulatory function of sigma factors RpoS/RpoN in adaptation and spoilage potential of Shewanella baltica
VL  - 97
AB  - Shewanella baltica is a typical specific spoilage organism causing the deterioration of seafood, but the exact regulation of its adaptive and competitive dominance in diverse environments remains undefined. In this study, the regulatory function of two sigma factors, RpoS and RpoN, in environmental adaptation and spoilage potential were evaluated in S. baltica SB02. Two in-frame deletion mutants, Delta rpoS and Delta rpoN, were constructed to explore the roles in their motility, biofilm formation, stress response and spoilage potential, as well as antibiotics by comparing the phenotypes and transcription with those of wild type (WT) strain. Compared with WT strain, the Delta rpoN showed the slower growth and weaker motility due to loss of flagella, while swimming of the Delta rpoS was increased. Deletion of rpoN significantly decreased biofilm biomass, and production of exopolysaccharide and pellicle, resulting in a thinner biofilm structure, while Delta rpoS formed the looser aggregation in biofilm. Resistance of S. baltica to NaCl, heat, ethanol and three oxidizing disinfectants apparently declined in the two mutants compared to WT strain. The Delta rpoN mutant decreased sensory score, accumulation of trimethylamine, putrescine and TVB-N and protease activity, while a weaker effect was observed in Delta rpoS. The two mutants had significantly higher susceptibility to antibiotics than WT strain, especially Delta rpoN. Deficiency of rpoN and rpoS significantly repressed the activities of two diketopiperazines related to quorum sensing (QS). Furthermore, transcriptome analyses revealed that RpoN was involved in the regulation of the expression of 143 genes, mostly including flagellar assembly, nitrogen and amino acid metabolism, ABC transporters. Transcript changes of seven differentially expressed coding sequences were in agreement with the phenotypes observed in the two mutants. Our findings reveal that RpoN, as a central regulator, controls the fitness and bacterial spoilage in S. baltica, while RpoS is a key regulatory factor of stress response. Characterization of these two sigma regulons in Shewanella has expanded current understanding of a possible co-regulatory mechanism with QS for adaptation and spoilage potential.

TI  - Genotypic variation and plasticity in climate-Adaptive traits after range expansion and fragmentation of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.)
VL  - 377
IS  - 1848
AB  - Shifting range limits are predicted for many species as the climate warms. However, the rapid pace of climate change will challenge the natural dispersal capacity of long-lived, sessile organisms such as forest trees. Adaptive responses of populations will, therefore, depend on levels of genetic variation and plasticity for climate-responsive traits, which likely vary across the range due to expansion history and current patterns of selection. Here, we study levels of genetic and plastic variation for phenology and growth traits in populations of red spruce (Picea rubens), from the range core to the highly fragmented trailing edge. We measured more than 5000 offspring sampled from three genetically distinct regions (core, margin and edge) grown in three common gardens replicated along a latitudinal gradient. Genetic variation in phenology and growth showed low to moderate heritability and differentiation among regions, suggesting some potential to respond to selection. Phenology traits were highly plastic, but this plasticity was generally neutral or maladaptive in the effect on growth, revealing a potential liability under warmer climates. These results suggest future climate adaptation will depend on the regional availability of genetic variation in red spruce and provide a resource for the design and management of assisted gene flow.

TI  - Utilizing FBR to produce olefins from CO reduction using Fe- Mn nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide catalysts and comparing the performance with SBR
VL  - 8
IS  - 74
SP  - 42415-42423
AB  - Mn was used as a promoter for Fe nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The prepared catalysts were the unpromoted Fe/rGO catalysts along with two Mn promoted catalysts FeMn16 and FeMn29. These catalysts were used as Fischer-Tropsch catalysts in a Fixed Bed Reactor (FBR). The operating conditions of the reactor, namely temperature, pressure and space velocity, were varied to evaluate the catalyst performance and the olefin productivity. The olefins were produced in maximum yields of 34.5% and 31.3% with FeMn29 at 320 and 340 °C respectively. The ratio of light to heavy olefins was three times higher at 340 °C. The catalysts showed good stability up to 50 h of interrupted operation while varying the conditions at each interruption. The performance of the catalysts in the FBR was compared with a previous investigation carried out in an SBR under identical conditions with the same catalysts. The FBR was found to be more Mn tolerant than the SBR, giving very high conversion activity with high Mn concentrations (FeMn29). The FBR produced olefins in much higher yields than the SBR. The SBR was more selective to light olefins at low temperatures and high Mn loading levels, while the FBR produced light olefins at higher selectivities at high temperatures and high Mn concentrations. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - The effect of habitat selection on offspring performance in the giant water bug belostoma bifoveolatum
VL  - 99
IS  - 2
SP  - 107-115
AB  - The selection of breeding habitat is crucial for many ectotherms inhabiting aquatic environments. Giant water bugs offer an excellent model for analysis of how temperature affects breeding habitat selection and reproductive success. This work focuses on whether wetland temperature influences habitat selection and offspring success in the giant water bug Belostoma bifoveolatum Spinola, 1852. To determine breeding habitat characteristics of B. bifoveolatum, 21 wetlands lying on the environmental gradients of canopy cover and altitude were sampled in spring; water temperature was monitored and the presence or absence of adult belostomatids, incubating males, and nymphs were recorded. Several environmental variables were measured in sites where males incubated eggs and were compared with those from control sites. Field experiments were also conducted to evaluate the effect of site choice on hatching success. Belostoma bifoveolatum was found up to 1545 m above sea level, but reproduction was observed only in the warmest temporary wetlands, with low forest cover, from 300 to 1000 m above sea level. Incubating males were found in the shallowest and warmest sites within the wetlands where egg incubation time was shortest and hatching success highest. The selection of breeding habitat and incubation site, along with parental care, constitute important adaptations in B. bifoveolatum and could explain its success in this cold region. © 2021, Canadian Science Publishing.

TI  - Economic analysis and experimental investigation of a direct absorption solar humidification-dehumidification system for decentralized water production
VL  - 46
AB  - In the present work, a direct absorption solar humidifier (SH) based closed-air loop open-water loop humidification-dehumidification (HDH) desalination system is investigated experimentally. The selection of air-to-water mass flow ratios for this configuration is unknown. Hence, this work characterizes the impact of feed flowrates and recirculating air flowrates to arrive at an operating state that influences the system efficiency for a determined solar thermal input. Performance curves that directly correlate the system's Gained output ratio (GOR) against humidity-based normalized gain are proposed to enable site selection and performance estimation. Water flowrate has optimal value for the SH-HDH desalination system highlighting a delicate balance between feed water and air flowrates that allows improved heat and mass transfer in the module while minimizing overall thermal losses. A comparison of the performance of the SH-HDH system with a conventional HDH system showed 18.4% improvement. A novel approach by storing the hot water rejected from SH-HDH configuration during on-sun hours for the off-sun operation was considered. The estimated cost of water produced was ranging from 0.007 to 0.035 USD/liter, depending on received solar irradiation and rainfall at the location. Finally, a comparison of GORsolar, cost of desalination, and productivity of the present system are compared with the literature. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is a growing capability to project the impacts and economic effects of climate change across multiple sectors. This information is needed to inform decisions regarding the diversity and magnitude of future climate impacts and explore how mitigation and adaptation actions might affect these risks. Here, we summarize results from sectoral impact models applied within a consistent modelling framework to project how climate change will affect 22 impact sectors of the United States, including effects on human health, infrastructure and agriculture. The results show complex patterns of projected changes across the country, with damages in some sectors (for example, labour, extreme temperature mortality and coastal property) estimated to range in the hundreds of billions of US dollars annually by the end of the century under high emissions. Inclusion of a large number of sectors shows that there are no regions that escape some mix of adverse impacts. Lower emissions, and adaptation in relevant sectors, would result in substantial economic benefits. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

TI  - Genetic male sterility breeding in heat tolerant bell pepper: Introgression of ms10 gene from hot pepper through marker-assisted backcrossing
VL  - 285
AB  - The main goal of this research was to introgressed the genetic male sterility (GMS) gene ms10 from hot pepper (Capsicum annuum var. annuum) to heat tolerant bell pepper (C. annuum var. grossum) inbreds and to pyramid it with the non-pungent (pun1) gene. The gene positive plant selection was assisted by the SSR marker linked to ms10 gene located on chromosome I and the SCAR marker indicating the non-pungent pun1 gene presence. First, we backcrossed and screened BC1F1 and BC2F1 plants having heterozygous (Ms10ms10) genotype for GMS specific marker AVRDC-PP12. Secondly, the background recovery rate of the recurrent parent phenome (RPP) in both the backcrossed progeny was estimated by measuring the shift in means for fruit traits. Simultaneously, targeted gene positive (Ms10ms10) non-pungent (pun1) heterozygous plant(s) were identified in BC2F1 generation using BF7 and BF 9-SCAR marker. The best gene positive individual plant from each population was backcrossed with their respective recurrent parent and selfed for validation of ms10 gene. Finally, we obtained six gene positive (ms10) GMS lines designated as MSSM-1, MSSM-2, MSSM-3, MSSM-9, MSSM-17, and MSSM-21 from this work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that GMS ms10 gene has been successfully transferred from hot pepper to heat tolerant bell pepper through marker-assisted backcross breeding scheme coupled with stringent phenotypic selection. The developed GMS lines will provide great economic value for non-pungent hybrid bell pepper seed production in the near future. © 2021

TI  - The evolution of light oil thermal pilots in mauddud reservoir from lab, simulation to pilot scale
VL  - 2019
AB  - The Light Oil Steam Flood (LOSF) is proposed to increase the recovery from Mauddud reservoir in Bahrain Field. Mauddud has been on gas injection since 1938, yet residual oil saturation is still high in the gas cap due to its oil wettability. Several core lab studies were conducted confirming the high oil saturation in the gas cap. Steam flood core lab experiments were conducted recently and confirmed the residual oil saturation could reach to less than 10%. The thermal pilot project in Mauddud has gone through the following stages: 1. The first pilot started in 2013 and operated for 2.5 years: It has one horizontal well in the gas cap, one vertical producer, four vertical injectors with three Temperature Observation Wells (TOWs) clustered around one of the injectors. 2. First pilot performance was assessed and confirmed in reducing the residual oil in the gas cap by distillation and wettability alteration. 3. Second pilot was designed and initiated in 2016 to assess the economic viability for full field expansion. Throughout these stages, production monitoring, logging, core studies and simulation studies have been carried to understand the LOSF mechanisms to increase Mauddud recovery from the gas cap. This paper presents the evolution of pilot design concepts and simulation of the thermal recovery in Mauddud. It also study and assess the well configurations and pilot operating strategies designed for the thermal pilots. A sector model was constructed and calibrated, then used to select a well concept for the LOSF pilots. Seventeen different pilot concepts were considered during the selection process. The well configuration and operating strategies were driven to observe a quicker steam response in the first pilot. A number of sensitivities were conducted to develop a better understanding of the effects of the various reservoir factors. A comprehensive study was then carried out to recommend a phase development approach for full-scale field development and establish a methodology for a full-field LOSF forecast. Full Field compositional model was built in thermal reservoir simulator and was then successfully history matched with seven components equations of state (EOS). A phased development approach was then proposed for full-scale field development. The initial development will focus on the mid-dip areas with higher remaining oil saturations and a thicker oil column. After establishing production in the mid-dip flanks, development could proceed to the crestal areas, which have lower oil saturations and would likely result in higher steam/oil ratios (SORs). © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

VL  - 14

SP  - 2361-2377
AB  - Global warming could threaten over 400 species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) worldwide, including all species of sea turtle. During embryonic development, rising temperatures might lead to the overproduction of one sex and, in turn, could bias populations’ sex ratios to an extent that threatens their persistence. If climate change predictions are correct, and biased sex ratios reduce population viability, species with TSD may go rapidly extinct unless adaptive mechanisms, whether behavioural, physiological or molecular, exist to buffer these temperature-driven effects. Here, we summarize the discovery of the TSD phenomenon and its still elusive evolutionary significance. We then review the molecular pathways underpinning TSD in model species, along with the hormonal mechanisms that interact with temperatures to determine an individual's sex. To illustrate evolutionary mechanisms that can affect sex determination, we focus on sea turtle biology, discussing both the adaptive potential of this threatened TSD taxon, and the risks associated with conservation mismanagement. © 2021 The Authors.

VL  - 116

SP  - 345-361
AB  - Interrupted cutting operations, such as milling, produce fluctuating tool temperatures which directly affect the process outputs. Thus, prediction of cutting tool temperatures enables process planning, selection of materials for tool substrate and coating layers, and tool geometric design for improved productivity in machining operations. Theoretical analysis of temperature is a cost effective way to predict the tool temperatures. Considering the industrial needs, a theoretical model should be fast, easy to implement, and reliable. To that end, a novel hybrid model, which assembles analytical and numerical methods, is proposed in this study. This novel transient thermal model simulates the interrupted cutting with coated cutting tools. The proposed model includes an analytical heat flux calculation at the tool-chip interface considering the sticking-sliding contact behavior. The determined heat flux is, then, used to perform a numerical solution of the transient heat conduction problem in the cutting tool geometry with temperature-dependent thermal properties. The developed model is validated with experimental results found in literature under different cutting conditions. The results show that the model can predict the maximum temperatures generated in a thermal cycle with an accuracy of 2–10%. Thus, the proposed model can be further used to determine the process parameters, properties of coating layers, and tool geometric design. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Marine phytoplankton resilience may moderate oligotrophic ecosystem responses and biogeochemical feedbacks to climate change
VL  - 67
SP  - S378-S389
AB  - Are the oceans turning into deserts? Rising temperature, increasing surface stratification, and decreasing vertical inputs of nutrients are expected to cause an expansion of warm, nutrient deplete ecosystems. Such an expansion is predicted to negatively affect a trio of key ocean biogeochemical features: phytoplankton biomass, primary productivity, and carbon export. However, phytoplankton communities are complex adaptive systems with immense diversity that could render them at least partially resilient to global changes. This can be illustrated by the biology of the Prochlorococcus “collective.” Adaptations to counter stress, use of alternative nutrient sources, and frugal resource allocation can allow Prochlorococcus to buffer climate-driven changes in nutrient availability. In contrast, cell physiology is more sensitive to temperature changes. Here, we argue that biogeochemical models need to consider the adaptive potential of diverse phytoplankton communities. However, a full understanding of phytoplankton resilience to future ocean changes is hampered by a lack of global biogeographic observations to test theories. We propose that the resilience may in fact be greater in oligotrophic waters than currently considered with implications for future predictions of phytoplankton biomass, primary productivity, and carbon export. © 2022 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography.

VL  - 64
IS  - 3
SP  - 244-247
AB  - Studies of broadcast spawning in corals are fundamental to our understanding of early life history characteristics, reproductive biology, restoration etc. Spawning of corals for research is routinely conducted, but this is mostly restricted to sites adjacent to reefs and from broodstock collected from the wild just prior to gamete release. Only recently has it been possible to induce predictable broadcast spawning in an ex situ environment, and nobody has successfully closed the life cycle (i.e., production of an F2 generation) of these corals. Here, for the first time, we closed the life cycle of the broadcast spawning coral Acropora millepora in a fully closed ex situ mesocosm. This breakthrough has numerous implications for our understanding of reproductive biology, specifically it offers potential to deepen our understanding of the genetic influence on adaptive traits such as heat tolerance, growth and disease resistance over multiple generations. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background & Aims: Eusociality is a critical evolutionary innovation. Understanding the origin of eusociality and related regulating mechanisms has theoretical and practical significance to several research fields. A clear hierarchy and division of labor exists among individuals of social insects. The behavioral differentiation and extensive cooperation between castes are beneficial for their adaptation to complicated environmental changes. Understanding how social insects can produce individuals with differences in morphology, behavior and life-history characteristics is an important goal of much evolutionary and developmental biology research. With the rapid development of sequencing technology and bioinformatics, there have been many studies on the mechanisms underlying social insect behavioral differentiation. Here, we present recent advances on the environmental factors and physiological and molecular mechanisms regulating caste and behavioral differentiation in social insects by summarizing the current results of social insect studies, and propose the future research directions. Progresses: Both biotic factors (e.g., nutrients, pheromones, cuticular hydrocarbons) and abiotic factors (e.g., temperature, climate) can directly and indirectly affect the differentiation of insect social behavior and castes. Endocrine hormones, such as juvenile hormone (JH), ecdysteroids (20E), insulin-like peptides (ILPs), and neurohormonal bioamines, also play important roles. In addition, evolutionary changes in gene sequences or genome structure, including heritable differences and novel genes, as well as gene regulatory mechanisms, such as DNA methylation and differential expression of genes, can also affect the caste and behavior differentiation of social insects to different degrees. Prospects: We suggest strengthening the study of social behavior and regulating mechanisms in other social insect lineages, such as aphids and thrips, which are relatively understudied and which will improve the understanding of the origins and evolution of eusociality and social behaviors in insects. © 2021, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

VL  - 401
SP  - 40-51
AB  - Spatially-explicit individual-based simulation models provide a valuable tool for exploring complex ecological and evolutionary processes that are not easily empirically measured. Here, we present modifications of a spatially-explicit individual-based simulation model (CDMetaPOP) to accommodate a two-species system and simulations involving interspecific hybridization. We first describe how a hybrid (H) index is used to distinguish individuals of interspecific descent from those of either parental species. User-defined thresholds provide flexibility in the degree of admixture tolerated for classifying ‘pure’ individuals. We then detail relationships further informed by the H index, including individual growth, temperature-based fitness and selection, and mate preference behavior. Empirically derived species- and system-specific information can be incorporated into these relationships, for example, to produce differential growth among hybrids and parental species. Lastly, we demonstrate an application of this simulation framework by exploring the relative effects of temperature-based selection, mate preference behavior, and hybrid fitness on the rate and spatial extent of sympatric hybridization between two native riverine fish species, bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma), in the upper Skagit River system (United States and Canada). Results from this demonstration provide guidance for future empirical studies of bull trout, a federally threatened species. Understanding factors that contribute to the initiation and maintenance of hybridization, as well as the ecological and evolutionary consequences of this phenomenon, is of increasing importance given shifting species ranges due to large-scale landscape modification and a changing global climate. Our framework can be used to study a wide range of hybridization dynamics in any terrestrial or aquatic system, including comparisons of distinct environmental conditions or potential management responses. © 2019

TI  - Comparative study on the fertility and outcrossing characteristics of new dual-purpose genic male-sterile rice in China
AB  - The widespread application of 'two-line' hybrid rice, based on temperature- and photoperiod-sensitive genic male-sterile lines, plays an important role in ensuring global food security. Such lines are fertile in short-day/low-temperature conditions when used for self-breeding, and sterile in long-day/high-temperature conditions when used for hybrid seed production. However, fertility instability and low hybrid seed production of sterile lines are urgent problems. The aim of this study was to increase the stability of pollen sterility by studying the critical sterile-inducing temperature and stigma vitality of 97 newly selected male-sterile lines in China from 2017 to 2020. Sterility gene source analysis showed that 89.7% of the materials contained the tms5 sterile gene. After 6 days of treatment at 23.5 degrees C during the reproductive period, 42 male-sterile lines were sterile. After 10 days of treatment at 23.5 degrees C, the sterility of 12 sterile lines remained stable, indicating a high level of safety for hybrid seed production. After 10 days of low-temperature treatment at 19 degrees C, the fertile pollen rate of 47 of the 97 sterile lines was >70%, indicating a high level of seed reproduction safety. Only six of these 47 male-sterile lines could maintain low fertility after 10 days of treatment at 23.5 degrees C, indicating that they could be used safely for both hybrid seed production and sterile line reproduction. The results of delayed pollination showed that among the six lines, only Zhong 7S had high stigma vitality, and BYXA IS and HIOS-2 had medium stigma vitality. Therefore, those three sterile lines have the potential for safe hybrid seed production and high-yield seed reproduction. Based on our research, we propose a new breeding standard of dual-purpose male-sterile lines to promote the development of two-line hybrid rice.

TI  - The effects of indoor high temperature on circadian rhythms of human work efficiency
VL  - 16
IS  - 5
AB  - Indoor non-air-conditioned environments widely exist in the summer high temperature weather. The work efficiency of the people who stay indoors for a long time is seriously affected by the indoor high temperature. In this paper, the changes of the circadian rhythms of work efficiency in indoor high temperature environments were studied. Ten healthy subjects (five males and five females) were selected in the experiments randomly. In each experiment day, the maximum hourly outdoor temperature was selected as 28 ◦ C, 32 ◦ C, 36 ◦ C, and 38 ◦ C, respectively, to determine the experiment conditions. In each experiment condition, subjects’ response time, accuracy rate, grip strength, work willingness, and physiological parameters were monitored for 24 consecutive hours. Meanwhile, the hourly outdoor temperatures of the experiment day were accessed from the weather report during the experiment. Then the cosinor method and statistical method were adopted. The results indicated that the response time, grip strength, and work willingness followed circadian rhythms. However, the accuracy rates of the Stroop color-word test (SCWT) and numeral inspection task (NIT) did not show an obvious circadian rhythm. The effects of high temperature on the circadian rhythms of grip strength and work willingness were mainly reflected in the decreases of the median and amplitude. The effects on the response time were mainly reflected in the decrease of the median. In addition, forehead temperature showed a significant negative correlation to response time, and it could be considered as a predictor to assess the level of work efficiency. This study gives an alternative method to replace direct measurement of the ability indices at work site and provides basic data of 24 consecutive hours, for showing changes in human work efficiency. It could be helpful to predict the low performance in advance to reduce occupational accidents. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Insular geckos provide experimental evidence on refuge selection priorities by ectotherms
VL  - 164
SP  - 260-267
AB  - In small sedentary ectotherms, patterns of spatial use result from the interplay between multiple, often conflicting factors, including abiotic and biotic interactions. Evaluating the costs and benefits of these pressures is crucial to make correct behavioural decisions in terms of fitness. The insular São Vicente's wall gecko Tarentola substituta provides a relatively simple model system to study these questions as it inhabits arid rocky habitats where refuges are limited, density of conspecifics is high, and terrestrial predators are almost absent. In the field, adults tend to find diurnal shelter under mid-sized rocks, frequently in male-female couples, while juveniles occupy small rocks which are thermally suboptimal. A lab experiment was conducted to determine the roles of ecological (shelter size and temperature) and social (conspecifics) factors in refuge selection. Single and pair combinations of geckos of different age and sex classes were allowed to select among four refuges: cold small, hot small, cold large, or hot large rock. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that larger and thermally buffered rocks would be the preferred refuges, and that adult male-female pairs under the same rock would be more frequent than other combinations.Geckos primarily selected larger shelters, trading off the presence of conspecifics against thermal quality. In social terms, sex, adult condition and size-related disparity shaped the patterns of aggregation, resulting in lower aggregation frequencies between adults and juveniles and even between juveniles of different sizes. These results reasonably match field observations suggesting selection of rocks as diurnal retreats according to their thermal properties, and social aggregations mainly involving adult males and females but not juveniles. Overall, this combined evidence provides insights on the spatial ecology of geckos, and likely other ectotherms, under conditions of low predation, limited resources and high intraspecific competition, such as those prevailing on island systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Long-Term Decrease in Coloration: A Consequence of Climate Change?
VL  - 200
IS  - 1
SP  - 32-47
AB  - Climate change has been shown to affect fitness-related traits in a wide range of taxa; for instance, warming leads to phenological advancements in many plant and animal species. The influence of climate change on social and secondary sexual traits, which are associated with fitness because of their role as quality signals, is, however, unknown. Here, we use more than 5,800 observations collected on two Mediterranean blue tit subspecies (Cyanistes caeruleus caeruleus and Cyanistes caeruleus ogliastrae) to explore whether blue crown and yellow breast patch colorations have changed over the past 15 years. Our data suggest that coloration has become duller and less chromatic in both sexes. In addition, in the Corsican C.c. ogliastrae, but not in the mainland C.c. caeruleus, the decrease is associated with an increase in temperature at molt. Quantitative genetic analyses do not reveal any microevolutionary change in the color traits over the study period, strongly suggesting that the observed change over time was caused by a plastic response to the environmental conditions. Overall, this study suggests that ornamental colorations could become less conspicuous because of warming, revealing climate change effects on sexual and social ornaments and calling for further research on the proximate mechanisms behind these effects. © 2022 The University of Chicago.

TI  - Heat challenges can enhance population tolerance to thermal stress in mussels: a potential mechanism by which ship transport can increase species invasiveness
VL  - 20
IS  - 11
SP  - 3107-3122
AB  - It is unclear whether transport by human vectors can increase the robustness of translocated populations and thereby enhance their invasiveness. To test this concept, we investigated the effect of heat stress on the tolerance of mussel populations towards a second stress event of the same kind. The heat challenges we mimicked can be faced by marine invertebrates that are transported through regions with high sea surface temperatures on ship hulls or in ballast water tanks. The study included 5 mussel species that were collected at sites in Brazil, Chile, Finland, Germany (Baltic Sea) and Portugal. In parallel laboratory experiments, monospecific groups of individuals were exposed to heat challenges that caused 60–83% mortality in the experimental groups within 15–28 days. The surviving individuals were exposed to a second stress event of the same kind, while their survival was then compared to the robustness of conspecifics that had not been exposed to elevated temperatures before. We observed that thermal tolerance was significantly enhanced by previous heat stress experience in case of Semimytilus algosus from Chile and in case of Mytilus edulis from Germany. Our results suggest that heat challenges, which marine invertebrates experience during transport, can enhance stress tolerance in founder populations of these species in their non-native range by potentially increasing the frequency of genetically adapted genotypes. This points at the necessity to learn more about selection acting on organisms during human-mediated transport—in the aquatic but also in the terrestrial environment. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Larval dispersal in a changing ocean with an emphasis on upwelling regions
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - Dispersal of benthic species in the sea is mediated primarily through small, vulnerable larvae that must survive minutes to months as members of the plankton community while being transported by strong, dynamic currents. As climate change alters ocean conditions, the dispersal of these larvae will be affected, with pervasive ecological and evolutionary consequences. We review the impacts of oceanic changes on larval transport, physiology, and behavior. We then discuss the implications for population connectivity and recruitment and evaluate life history strategies that will affect susceptibility to the effects of climate change on their dispersal patterns, with implications for understanding selective regimes in a future ocean. We find that physical oceanographic changes will impact dispersal by transporting larvae in different directions or inhibiting their movements while changing environmental factors, such as temperature, pH, salinity, oxygen, ultraviolet radiation, and turbidity, will affect the survival of larvae and alter their behavior. Reduced dispersal distance may make local adaptation more likely in well-connected populations with high genetic variation while reduced dispersal success will lower recruitment with implications for fishery stocks. Increased dispersal may spur adaptation by increasing genetic diversity among previously disconnected populations as well as increasing the likelihood of range expansions. We hypothesize that species with planktotrophic (feeding), calcifying, or weakly swimming larvae with specialized adult habitats will be most affected by climate change. We also propose that the adaptive value of retentive larval behaviors may decrease where transport trajectories follow changing climate envelopes and increase where transport trajectories drive larvae toward increasingly unsuitable conditions. Our holistic framework, combined with knowledge of regional ocean conditions and larval traits, can be used to produce powerful predictions of expected impacts on larval dispersal as well as the consequences for connectivity, range expansion, or recruitment. Based on our findings, we recommend that future studies take a holistic view of dispersal incorporating biological and oceanographic impacts of climate change rather than solely focusing on oceanography or physiology. Genetic and paleontological techniques can be used to examine evolutionary impacts of altered dispersal in a future ocean, while museum collections and expedition records can inform modern-day range shifts. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Redefining reproductive dormancy in Drosophila as a general stress response to cold temperatures
VL  - 107
SP  - 175-185
AB  - Organisms regularly encounter unfavorable conditions and the genetic adaptations facilitating survival have been of long-standing interest to evolutionary biologists. Winter is one particularly stressful condition for insects, during which they encounter low temperatures and scarcity of food. Despite dormancy being a well-studied adaptation to facilitate overwintering, there is still considerable controversy about the distribution of dormancy among natural populations and between species in Drosophila. The current definition of dormancy as developmental arrest of oogenesis at the previtellogenic stage (stage 7) distinguishes dormancy from general stress related block of oogenesis at early vitellogenic stages (stages 8 – 9). In an attempt to resolve this, we scrutinized reproductive dormancy in D. melanogaster and D. simulans. We show that dormancy shows the same hallmarks of arrest of oogenesis at stage 9, as described for other stressors and propose a new classification for dormancy. Applying this modified classification, we show that both species express dormancy in cosmopolitan and African populations, further supporting that dormancy uses an ancestral pathway induced by environmental stress. While we found significant differences between individuals and the two Drosophila species in their sensitivity to cold temperature stress, we also noted that extreme temperature stress (8 °C) resulted in very strong dormancy incidence, which strongly reduced the differences seen at less extreme temperatures. We conclude that dormancy in Drosophila should not be considered a special trait, but is better understood as a generic stress response occurring at low temperatures. © 2018 The Authors

TI  - Fouling in membrane filtration for juice processing
VL  - 42
SP  - 76-85
AB  - Pressure-driven membrane filtration is an essential part in the juice industry as a tool for clarification and concentration due to its low-temperature treatment, high selectivity, and lower energy consumption. However, membrane fouling compromises these benefits as fouling significantly reduces the membrane performance and durability, hence increasing the operating and maintenance costs. This paper reviews the recent advances related to membrane fouling in juice processing in the light of the growing interest towards sustainable processes characterized by high economic viability and low environmental impact. This review focuses on the characteristics of membrane fouling, factors affecting membrane fouling, and techniques used to mitigate membrane fouling. Future trends and challenges for the technology development to address membrane fouling in juice processing are also discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Developing in vitro selection methods to high temperature stress in pruacan and cacao
VL  - 724
AB  - Increasing in the earth's surface temperature due to global warming threatens the survival of plants in the sub-tropics and in the tropics areas. Looking for plant varieties that can adapt to the threat of global warming impacts is very important at this time. The availability of effective and efficient selection methods are needed to get it. This study aimed to develop an in vitro selection method for resistance to high temperature stress in two tropical plants: Pruacan (Pimpinella pruatjan Molk.) and Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.). The in vitro selection methods were developed by testing the embryogenic culture of pruacan and cacao somatic embryos development under various temperature incubations. The two plants showed a different level of tolerance to high-temperature stress. Temperatures of 35 °C for two months did not cause the death of cacao somatic embryos, but the temperature of 32 °C for 2 and 3 months had caused the death of pruacan somatic embryos by 80 and 90%, respectively. The 100% death of cacao somatic embryos occurred at 40 °C and 45 °C on days 16 and 5 of incubation, respectively. The in vitro selection for high-temperature stress in pruacan and cacao plants were at 32 °C and between 40-45 °C respectively. Developing in vitro selection methods in plant species is needed to face the challenges of climate change in the future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - How does parental environment influence the potential for adaptation to global change?
VL  - 285
IS  - 1886
AB  - Parental environments are regularly shown to alter the mean fitness of offspring, but their impacts on the genetic variation for fitness, which predicts adaptive capacity and is also measured on offspring, are unclear. Consequently, how parental environments mediate adaptation to environmental stressors, like those accompanying global change, is largely unknown. Here, using an ecologically important marine tubeworm in a quantitativegenetic breeding design, we tested how parental exposure to projected ocean warming alters the mean survival, and genetic variation for survival, of offspring during their most vulnerable life stage under current and projected temperatures. Offspring survival was higher when parent and offspring temperatures matched. Across offspring temperatures, parental exposure to warming altered the distribution of additive genetic variance for survival, making it covary across current and projected temperatures in away thatmay aid adaptation to futurewarming. Parental exposure towarming also amplified nonadditive genetic variance for survival, suggesting that compatibilities between parental genomes may grow increasingly important under future warming. Our study shows that parental environments potentially have broader-ranging effects on adaptive capacity than currently appreciated, not only mitigating the negative impacts of global change but also reshaping the raw fuel for evolutionary responses to it. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - How influential are squamate reptile traits in explaining population responses to environmental disturbances?
VL  - 47
IS  - 3
SP  - 249-259
AB  - Context: Understanding how organismal attributes influence sensitivity to environmental perturbations is a central theme in ecology and conservation. Certain traits, such as body size, habitat use, dietary preference and reproductive output are considered important determinants of animal species' responses to the impacts of ecological disturbances. However, the general relationships between functional traits and post-disturbance responses by animals are not fully understood. Aims: Our primary aim was to use a meta-analysis to evaluate the influence of species traits on variation in population abundances of squamate reptiles (i.e. lizards and snakes). Methods: We extracted data from 107 original published studies, from which 1027 mean effect sizes of post-disturbance responses by 298 species were estimated. We examined short-term responses only (i.e. within 3 years since the most recent disturbance). A comprehensive range of disturbances was examined, such as habitat destruction, fragmentation, fire, and exotic-species invasions. We used Bayesian linear mixed-effect modelling (BLMM), utilising the Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm (MCMC) for the meta-regression. Specifically, we tested the influence of eight species traits (body size, diet, temporal activity pattern, sociality, reproductive mode, clutch size, habitat selection, and mean body temperature), along with disturbance type, in explaining variation in species-specific abundance responses of squamate reptiles post-disturbance. Key results: Post-disturbance abundance responses of squamate species were significantly influenced by two parameters, namely, mean body temperature and clutch size. In general, significant positive responses post-disturbance were observed for species with higher mean body temperatures and a greater clutch size. The type of disturbance had no detectable influence on squamate abundances. The influence of random effects (heterogeneity among studies and species, and broad taxonomic identity) accounted for more of the model variation than did the fixed effects (species traits and disturbance type). Conclusions: Certain species traits exerted some influence on the sensitivities of lizards and snakes to ecological disturbances, although the influence of random effects was very strong. Our findings are likely to be a result of the complexity and idiosyncratic nature of natural abundance patterns among animal species, in addition to the potential confounding effect of methodological differences among studies. Implications: The present study is the first major quantitative synthesis of how species traits influence population-level responses of squamate reptiles to ecological disturbances. The findings can be used to guide conservation efforts and ecological management, such as by prioritising the efforts of mitigation on species that reproduce more slowly, and those with lower body temperatures. © 2020 CSIRO.

TI  - The hotter the better? Climate change and voltinism of Spodoptera eridania estimated with different methods
VL  - 98
AB  - Substantial increases in global temperature are projected for the coming decades due to climate change. Considering that temperature has a strong influence on insect voltinism (i.e., number of generations per year), climate change may affect the population growth of insects, with potential consequences for food production. The southern armyworm, Spodoptera eridania, is a multivoltine species native to the American tropics that causes severe damage to several crops. In this context, this study evaluated the impacts of climate change on the voltinism of S. eridania in southern Brazil. Current and future daily temperature data were combined with non-linear and degree-day models to estimate the voltinism of this pest. Under current climate conditions, the voltinism of S. eridania ranged from 2.9 to 9.2 generations, with fewer cohorts in colder regions and more in warmer ones. A higher number of generations was predicted for the future climate scenarios evaluated, reaching up to 12.1 annual generations in certain regions by 2070. Most of the variation in voltinism was explained by location (87.7%) and by the interaction between location and mathematical model (3.0%). The degree-day model estimated an increase in the number of generations in the entire study area, while the non-linear model predicted a decrease in voltinism in the warmer regions under future climate change scenarios. Given these differences between the predictions provided by degree-day and non-linear models, the selection of the best method to be used in climate change studies should be carried out carefully, considering how species respond to temperature. A considerable increase in the number of generations of S. eridania was projected for most of the study area under the climate change scenarios evaluated, suggesting a possible rise in pest incidence levels in the coming decades. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Spatiotemporal Asymmetric Modeling of the Long Run Response of Corn Productivity to Environmental Variabilities
VL  - 151
IS  - 4
SP  - 1349-1369
AB  - A spatiotemporal statistical model for the corn productivity of Bulacan using local and global variables was generated. The data from January 1995–September 2019 for a total of 99 quarters were used. Necessary imputations and conversions aside from a transformation technique were done to match the data and generate the best fitting model. The nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag was used to determine the asymmetric long-run effects on the corn production volume of the province to the potential positive and negative changes in the amount of rainfall, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, the water level of Angat Dam, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and sea surface temperature anomaly. It also included the land area harvested as a deterministic factor. The findings show that the corn production of the selected area responds to both negative and positive shocks to the rainfall amount and availability of water supply in the dam in the long run. It also shows that the long-term effects of an increase in the minimum temperature are detrimental, whereas rising levels of carbon dioxide concentration in the environment could be profoundly contributory to the dependent variable, at least in a direct manner. Several diagnostic tests substantiated the fitness of the econometric model. The empirical findings of this study extend the generally collective results of existing literature. It may also be used as a basis for plans of action for sustainable production practices of the grain, as well as other crops in the uncertain future amidst the threat of environmental stresses. © 2022, Department of Science and Technology.

VL  - 28

SP  - 35-47
AB  - Climatic gradients model genetic diversity in widespread woody trees: the case of the widely distributed Nothofagus in the southern Andes. Widespread forest species are well suited to be the subject of studies combining adaptive responses to distinct habitats. We studied the genetic diversity of the wideranging Nothofagus pumilio that inhabits highelevation and highlatitude forests, along different environmental gradients in Patagonia. The results of this study show a strong relationship between climate and the different environmental gradients; which in turn affect the genetic variation of N. pumilio. The most influential variables were related to summer precipitations and winter temperatures, where greater genetic diversity was associated to higher precipitations and milder temperatures. This demonstrates that the genetic diversity of this species is not randomly distributed in space, but it is structured according to complex climatic models. To understand how genetic adaptation and/or environmental aspects influence species' distribution ranges is crucial to evaluate their potential for long term survival. While some genotypes may become locally extinct under different climatic settings, others might be locally adapted to particular climatic conditions, which may allow them to endure such changes. Widespread taxa as N. pumilio has undergone past environmental changes, such as those that occurred during glacial periods, through adaptation and plasticity. We highlight the importance of conserving genetic diversity of populations, not only to ensure the longterm persistence, but also to mitigate the negative impacts of global climate change. © 2019 Los Autores.

VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - The highly heterogeneous Humboldt Current System (HCS) and the 30 degrees S transition zone on the southeast Pacific coast, represent an ideal scenario to test the influence of the environment on the spatial genomic structure in marine near-shore benthic organisms. In this study, we used seascape genomic tools to evaluate the genetic structure of the commercially important ascidian Pyura chilensis, a species that exhibits a low larval transport potential but high anthropogenic dispersal. A recent study in this species recorded significant genetic differentiation across a transition zone around 30 degrees S in putatively adaptive SNPs, but not in neutral ones, suggesting an important role of environmental heterogeneity in driving genetic structure. Here, we aim to understand genomic-oceanographic associations in P. chilensis along the Southeastern Pacific coast using two combined seascape genomic approaches. Using 149 individuals from five locations along the HCS, a total of 2,902 SNPs were obtained by Genotyping-By-Sequencing, of which 29-585 were putatively adaptive loci, depending on the method used for detection. In adaptive loci, spatial genetic structure was better correlated with environmental differences along the study area (mainly to Sea Surface Temperature, upwelling-associated variables and productivity) than to the geographic distance between sites. Additionally, results consistently showed the presence of two groups, located north and south of 30 degrees S, which suggest that local adaptation processes seem to allow the maintenance of genomic differentiation and the spatial genomic structure of the species across the 30 degrees S biogeographic transition zone of the Humboldt Current System, overriding the homogenizing effects of gene flow.

TI  - The predictability of heat-related mortality in Prague, Czech Republic, during summer 2015—a comparison of selected thermal indices
VL  - 63
IS  - 4
SP  - 535-548
AB  - We compared selected thermal indices in their ability to predict heat-related mortality in Prague, Czech Republic, during the extraordinary summer 2015. Relatively, novel thermal indices—Universal Thermal Climate Index and Excess Heat Factor (EHF)—were compared with more traditional ones (apparent temperature, simplified wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT), and physiologically equivalent temperature). The relationships between thermal indices and all-cause relative mortality deviations from the baseline (excess mortality) were estimated by generalized additive models for the extended summer season (May–September) during 1994–2014. The resulting models were applied to predict excess mortality in 2015 based on observed meteorology, and the mortality estimates by different indices were compared. Although all predictors showed a clear association between thermal conditions and excess mortality, we found important variability in their performance. The EHF formula performed best in estimating the intensity of heat waves and magnitude of heat-impacts on excess mortality on the most extreme days. Afternoon WBGT, on the other hand, was most precise in the selection of heat-alert days during the extended summer season, mainly due to a relatively small number of “false alerts” compared to other predictors. Since the main purpose of heat warning systems is identification of days with an increased risk of heat-related death rather than prediction of exact magnitude of the excess mortality, WBGT seemed to be a slightly favorable predictor for such a system. © 2019, ISB.

TI  - Shifts in space and time: Ecological transitions affect the evolution of resting metabolic rates in microteiid lizards
VL  - 221
IS  - 14
AB  - Ecological diversification often encompasses exposure to new thermal regimes given by the use of specific spatial (microhabitat) and temporal (activity periods) niches. Empirical evidence provides links between temperature and physiology (e.g. rates of oxygen consumption), fostering predictions of evolutionary changes in metabolic rates coupled with ecological shifts. One example of such correspondence is the evolution of fossoriality and nocturnality in vertebrate ectotherms, where changes in metabolic rates coupled with niche transitions are expected. Because most studies address single transitions (fossoriality or nocturnality), metabolic changes associated with concomitant shifts in spatial and temporal components of habitat usage are underestimated, and it remains unclear which transition plays a major role for metabolic evolution. Integrating multiple ecological aspects that affect the evolution of thermosensitive traits is essential for a proper understanding of physiological correlates in niche transitions. Here, we provide the first phylogenetic multidimensional description of effects from ecological niche transitions both in space (origin of fossorial lineages) and in time (origin of nocturnal lineages) on the evolution of microteiid lizard (Gymnophthalmidae) metabolic rates. We found that evolution of resting metabolic rates was affected by both niche transitions, but with opposite trends. Evolution of fossoriality in endemic diurnal microteiids is coupled with a less thermally sensitive metabolism and higher metabolic rates. In contrast, a reduction in metabolic rates was detected in the endemic fossorial-nocturnal lineage, although metabolic thermal sensitivity remained as high as that observed in epigeal species, a pattern that likely reduces locomotion costs at lower temperatures and also favors thermoregulation in subsuperficial sand layers. © 2018.

VL  - 8
SP  - 40955-40965
AB  - Live fish waterless transport strategy for the purpose of consumption or ornament is a novel technology, which can implement the larger volume transportation with high survival results as well as less wastewater pollution. The aim of this study was to establish an accurate survival prediction system based on the least physiological stress variations in different temperature ranges, which statistically analyzes the trend of key stress factors under the well life-supported temperatures to improve the final survival result. Furthermore, the accuracy of survival prediction can be adaptively and dynamically improved in consideration of the historical survival series in different seasons. In order to verify the practicability and performance of the system, Paralichthys olivaceus was selected as experimental subjects to carry out dynamic survival prediction experiments for over 30 hours waterless transportation, and the accuracy of the survival prediction system has verified over 97.2% in 0.5-2.5C°, which show that mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) by less than 0.2 and 0.07 to produce the most accurate estimation in the comparison. The development of this survival prediction system can significantly optimize the current waterless delivery management by reducing the potential mortality and providing the managerial references for industrialization of the live fish waterless logistics. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Adaptation to environmental conditions within the native range of exotic species can condition the invasion success of these species outside their range. The striking success of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, to invade temperate regions has been attributed to the winter survival of diapause eggs in cold environments. In this study, we evaluate genetic polymorphisms (SNPs) and wing morphometric variation among three biogeographical regions of the native range of A. albopictus. Reconstructed demographic histories of populations show an initial expansion in Southeast Asia and suggest that marine regression during late Pleistocene and climate warming after the last glacial period favored expansion of populations in southern and northern regions, respectively. Searching for genomic signatures of selection, we identified significantly differentiated SNPs among which several are located in or within 20 kb distance from candidate genes for cold adaptation. These genes involve cellular and metabolic processes and several of them have been shown to be differentially expressed under diapausing conditions. The three biogeographical regions also differ for wing size and shape, and wing size increases with latitude supporting Bergmann's rule. Adaptive genetic and morphometric variation observed along the climatic gradient of A. albopictus native range suggests that colonization of northern latitudes promoted adaptation to cold environments prior to its worldwide invasion. © 2019 The Author(s).

VL  - 8

SP  - 13277-13284
AB  - Photodriven CH4 conversion has been regarded as a promising green strategy for fabrication of value-added commodity chemicals, in particular methanol. However, due to the incomplete transformation of intermediates or the overoxidation of products, a good selectivity of methanol is hard to achieve. Here, we present a highly selective transformation of methane to methanol using gold modified zinc oxide as a photocatalyst under full light spectrum irradiation at atmospheric temperature. The selectivity of methanol can reach 99.1% with a productivity of 1371 μmol g-1. Fine tuning the loading amount of gold nanoparticles (0.75 wt%) and inputting an appropriate light energy are the pivotal factors for selectivity improvement. Besides, in contrast to the reported photocatalytic aerobic CH4 oxidation on gold modified zinc oxide, we find that both oxygen and water, rather than only molecular oxygen, provide the O-source for methanol formation. This result is verified through 18O-isotope tests (18O2 and H218O), leading to a disparate mechanism. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Hygienic assessment of fish handling practices along production and supply chain and its public health implications in Central Oromia, Ethiopia
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - Fishborne diseases are among the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Contamination of the aquatic ecosystem and unhygienic handling practices along the fish supply chain can lead to a contaminated fish. Consumption of raw or under cooked fish and fish products is a major source of fishborne infections in humans. Despite reports of fish contamination with foodborne pathogens in Ethiopia, information regarding the hygienic status of fish handling practices is limited. We assessed fish hygienic handling practices at production sites and along the fish supply chain in three towns in east Shewa zone of Oromia. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire interviews and personal observations. The study consisted of purposively selected respondents comprising of 50 fishermen, 10 retailers, 20 food establishments serving fish, and 120 consumers. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test were used to present the proportion of various actors along the fish production and supply chain and to compare the proportions of observations among the different categories respectively. We observed that the lakes were accessible to animals and exposed to chemical and microbial contaminations through rainwater run-off. Fish were processed under unhygienic practices like washing of filleted fish with lake water, indiscriminate processing at unhygienic landing sites, use of a single knife for processing all fish with infrequent washing and with no disinfection in between. Majority (70%; n = 10) of the retailers and all the food establishments transported fish in vehicles with no cold chain facilities. Good hygienic practices we observed were the use of refrigerators for storage in all retailers and 70% (n = 20) of the food establishments; 30% of retailers used vehicles with a cold chain facility for the transportation of fish. Over three-fourths (77%; n = 120) of the consumers preferred consuming raw fish; 80% of them lacked the knowledge of fishborne diseases. The study revealed a wide range of unhygienic handling practices along fish production and supply chain; lack of infrastructure for post-harvest fish handling and processing, lack of appropriate transportation facilities and presence of knowledge gaps regarding fish borne diseases. © 2022, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.

VL  - 10

AB  - In Europe, numerous Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) provenance trials have been established and evaluated at a juvenile age. Still, information about the adaptation potential and long-term fitness of transferred seedlots in the Baltic Sea region is lacking. The aim of the study was to evaluate the adaptation capacity of provenances and assess the patterns of their long-term reaction to environmental transfer. We examined a 32-year-old provenance trial in the mild Baltic Sea coastal climate ofWestern Latvia. Significant differences in height and stem volume were observed among provenances. Growth superiority for certain local and Carpathian provenances was maintained over more than one-third of the rotation period. The best predictor of climate transfer functions was minimum temperature of the coldest month at the place of origin, explaining 28% variation in tree height. Populations from sites with more frost days and a colder mean annual temperature, minimum temperature, and lower annual heat-moisture index than the planting site were generally taller. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Improving indoor thermal comfort, air quality and the health of older adults through environmental policies in London
VL  - 2069
AB  - In this work we evaluate the potential of selected environmental strategies in reducing air pollution and summertime indoor overheating. Associated changes in mortality rates are also calculated for older adults in London. Reducing these risks for vulnerable groups is an immediate priority and given that seniors spend most of their time indoors, our focus is on strategies that prioritize the transformation of residential environments for indoor thermal comfort and air quality improvements. For each strategy, we develop specific scenarios related to building adaptations and test potential reductions on indoor overheating and pollutant exposures from outdoor sources (PM2.5), as well as on senior mortality through the CRAFT tool (Cities Rapid Assessment Framework for Transformation). We then pick the scenarios with highest impacts on mortality, aiming to formulate effective policy recommendations for Greater London. Preliminary results suggest that environmental policies related to the installation of shading could have the highest reduction in heat and pollution-related senior mortality, followed by moderate effects due to building insulation retrofits and the greening of roofs. With an increasing ageing population in the UK and beyond, our work highlights the need for city-level policies to address building modifications, considering the importance of indoor spaces for older adults. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

TI  - Sparse evidence for selection on phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature
VL  - 374
IS  - 1768
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity is frequently assumed to be an adaptive mechanism by which organisms cope with rapid changes in their environment, such as shifts in temperature regimes owing to climate change. However, despite this adaptive assumption, the nature of selection on plasticity within populations is still poorly documented. Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of selection on thermal plasticity. Although there is a large literature on thermal plasticity, we found very few studies that estimated coefficients of selection on measures of plasticity. Those that did do not provide strong support for selection on plasticity, with the majority of estimates of directional selection on plasticity being weak and non-significant, and no evidence for selection on plasticity overall. Although further estimates are clearly needed before general conclusions can be drawn, at present there is not clear empirical support for any assumption that plasticity in response to temperature is under selection. We present a multivariate mixed model approach for robust estimation of selection on plasticity and demonstrate how it can be implemented. Finally, we highlight the need to consider the environments, traits and conditions under which plasticity is (or is not) likely to be under selection, if we are to understand phenotypic responses to rapid environmental change. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of plasticity in phenotypic adaptation to rapid environmental change'.

TI  - Upper Thermal Tolerance Indicated by CTmax Fails to Predict Migration Strategy and Timing, Growth, and Predation Vulnerability in Juvenile Brown Trout (Salmo trutta)
VL  - 94
IS  - 4
SP  - 215-227
AB  - AbstractPartial migration is common in a variety of taxa and has important ecological and evolutionary implications, yet the underlying factors that lead to different migratory strategies are not clearly understood. Given the importance of temperature in serving as a cue for migration, along with its role in regulating metabolism, growth, reproduction, and survival, we examined how intraspecific variation in critical thermal maximum (CTmax) values influenced migratory strategy (residency vs. migration), timing of migration, growth, and predation vulnerability in a wild population of partially anadromous juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta). Using passive integrated transponder telemetry and mark-recapture techniques, we identified individuals that out-migrated to sea, assumed residency, and were predated by cormorants several months later. Acute thermal stress induced by conducting CTmax trials did not affect the final fate of assayed fish compared with controls. We found that mass and body condition predicted CTmax and migration timing, but CTmax failed to predict migratory strategy or timing, growth (of resident fish), or predation vulnerability. Although there may be links between mass, thermal tolerance, and migration strategy, the relationship between CTmax and migration remains unclear. The role of upper thermal tolerance in influencing life-history strategies should not be neglected, however, as alternative indicators of thermal tolerance could be further explored. The high degree of variation in CTmax estimates warrants additional investigation of how increasingly prevalent high-temperature events might drive selection toward thermally tolerant extremes, which is particularly relevant in a rapidly warming world.

VL  - 13

SP  - 449-462
AB  - Two of the most invasive freshwater bivalve species in temperate regions worldwide are the Ponto-Caspian dreissenids Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis. Throughout their range, observations have been made of a dominance shift favouring D. r. bugensis where the two species co-occur. Although both dreissenids have been widely studied, the mechanisms driving this dominance shift are not completely understood. Our long-term and short-term field experiments assessed a selection of species traits related to growth and settlement, which may be linked to a competitive benefit for either of both species. We assessed relative population densities in time and space, mortality, and inter-and intraspecific interactions in relation to environmental factors like temperature, salinity, and light intensity, using 14 × 14 cm PVC settlement plates. Dreissenids were identified, counted and measured over 11 years in the waterbody where D. r. bugensis was first discovered in Western Europe. Dreissena polymorpha appeared to have a competitive benefit over D. r. bugensis by being able to settle earlier, i.e. in spring, while other studies indicate the opposite. As salinities in the study region were relatively high in spring, this discrepancy may be explained by a higher salinity tolerance of D. polymorpha, as is known from the literature. In addition, Common Coots predated D. r. bugensis clusters. Dreissena polymorpha were not usually found in such clusters. Regardless of these competitive benefits for D. polymorpha, D. r. bugensis is the dominant species in the region. One possible explanation could be the fact that D. r. bugensis was found in similar densities on both light exposed and shaded fouling plates. Dreissena polymorpha on the other hand, was practically absent on light-exposed plates after 12 months. Therefore, a wider range of habitats seems to be suitable for the settlement of D. r. bugensis. Another driver of the dominance shift can be linked to it having faster growth than D. polymorpha, especially during spring. More generally, D. r. bugensis occurred in higher population densities on plates with D. polymorpha than on plates with only D. r. bugensis. Dreissena polymorpha individuals may thus induce the settlement of additional individuals of D. r. bugensis. A final reason for the dominance of D. r. bugensis concerns its low winter mortality. While the number of D. polymorpha individuals more than halved over the winter 2016–2017, no significant decrease in numbers of D. r. bugensis was recorded. © 2018, Regional Euro-Asian Biological Invasions Centre.

VL  - 130
IS  - 1
SP  - 128-141
AB  - Thermal conditions during pregnancy affect the length of gestation and phenotype of offspring in viviparous lizards. However, past studies have typically exposed females to basking treatments throughout pregnancy, meaning that effects specific to late pregnancy (including cues for parturition) or to night temperatures are poorly understood. We examined effects of thermal treatments during late-embryonic development on Woodworthia 'Otago/Southland', a viviparous gecko with an unusual capacity to reproduce annually or biennially. Among females from a cool-climate, biennially reproducing population, elevated levels of basking opportunity and night temperature during late summer together increased the proportion of births occurring before winter in the laboratory. Offspring born before winter also had higher mass and body condition than those born after winter. Regardless of the season, the daytime body temperature of females declined shortly before parturition (putatively assisting survival of fully developed embryos in utero), then increased immediately after parturition to match that of neonates. Overall, the combined effects of warmer days and nights could help to explain geographical variation in birth season for this species. Furthermore, climate change might shift the modal birth season at cool sites from spring to the preceding autumn, with loss of offspring mass in utero over warm winters also potentially favouring a shift in birth season over time. © 2020 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

VL  - 41
IS  - 1
AB  - Many subtropical fishes spawn multiple batches throughout a year. To understand plasticity in their reproductive output, we evaluated variation in oocyte size and batch fecundity for an exploited subtropical cutlassfish, Trichiurus japonicus, between two temperature periods (warm vs. cold) on the NE and SW coasts of Taiwan, northwestern Pacific. Given greater temperature variability on NE compared with SW coast, we hypothesized greater changes between warm and cold periods in oocyte size and fecundity for T. japonicus on the NE coast. We found opposite changes in sizes of ripe oocytes between periods (cold > warm on the NE but warm > cold on the SW coast) but consistent patterns in batch fecundity between coasts (warm > cold). Furthermore, the between-period patterns in female length were consistent on both coasts (warm > cold). The differential between-period patterns in oocyte size were related to potential adaptive responses to differential thermal environments between coasts, whereas the changes in fecundity mainly involved plastic processes (e.g., changes in population demography or movement). Together, our findings suggest that variability of temperature and maternal effects underlie recruitment variability of T. japonicus. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

VL  - 68

SP  - 137-142
AB  - In this study, a new ecological dispatching model for cascade hydropower stations considering fish reproduction is proposed by adding the ecological flow demand for fish spawning to the scheduling target of cascade hydropower stations. The study was conducted in the middle reaches of Jinsha River basin where Liyuan-Ahai cascade hydropower stations are located. By sorting out and analysing the habits and demands of aquatic organisms in the river along with the river water temperature and incoming water conditions, the hydrological and water temperature conditions suitable for experimental ecological regulation of the cascade section of the Jinsha River were obtained. Liyuan-Ahai cascade reservoirs were selected to carry out experimental ecological regulation simulations under different inflow scenarios. This study provides scientific basis and reference for cascade hydropower station dispatching, which can help restoration of the environment and satisfy optimal social and economic benefits. © 2021, Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

TI  - No evidence of fine scale thermal adaptation in green turtles
VL  - 514
SP  - 110-117
AB  - Adaptation to increasing temperatures may enable species to mitigate the long-term impacts of climate change. Sea turtles have temperature dependent sex determination (TSD) and variation in the thermal reaction norm, which influences offspring sex ratio, has been suggested as a potential adaptive mechanism to rising global temperatures. Here, we investigate the sex ratio of green turtle Chelonia mydas offspring from nests on beaches with notable differences in their thermal properties, to look for evidence of localised adaptation. We compared pivotal temperatures and hatch success in both the laboratory and in situ using eggs laid on two nesting beaches (dark vs. pale sand) at Ascension Island that represent the extremes of the range of incubation temperatures experienced by this population. We found no effect of beach of origin on pivotal temperatures, hatch success, or hatchling size in the laboratory or the wild. This suggests that turtles from the same rookery are not locally adapted to different thermal conditions experienced during incubation. Under predicted climate change scenarios, this will result in reduced hatch success and an increased proportion of female offspring unless temporal or spatial range shifts occur. © 2019 The Authors

TI  - Isolation and characterization of a temperature-sensitive lethal strain of Anopheles arabiensis for SIT-based application
VL  - 11
AB  - Background: Malaria is still a global health problem and vector control is the cornerstone of disease control strategies using indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated nets. The situation is becoming acute with widespread resistance to the limited arsenal of available insecticide classes. Therefore, new and innovative tools to reduce Plasmodium transmission are in need and this situation raised considerable interest in using sterile insect technique (SIT) against human pest insects, particularly Anopheles malaria vectors. When considering a mosquito release programme, one of the first issues to be addressed is how to eliminate/separate the hematophagous vector females. In this paper, we report the development and evaluation of an Anopheles arabiensis temperature-sensitive lethal (tsl) strain towards its potential use for the development of a genetic sexing strain (GSS). Anopheles arabiensis male mosquitoes originated from North Cameroon were treated with 0.05% ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). The mutagen was added to 10% sucrose solution and mosquitoes fed ad-libitum for 24h and 48h on a cotton wool soaked with sucrose-mutagen solution placed at the top of the cup. Treated males were then allowed to mate with wild virgin females and their progenies were screened for heat sensitivity from F3 to F8, until the isolation and establishment of a tsl strain which was further characterized by assessing its productivity (fecundity and fertility), larval development, adult longevity as well as nature and inheritance pattern of the tsl. Results: Observations showed that the number of eggs laid and their hatch rate were similar between females that mated with mutagenized males and those from the control suggesting that mutagenesis didn't affect An. arabiensis male fecundity and fertility. At F3, fourteen isofemale families out of 88 tested, which showed mortalities ranged between 50 and 80 %, were selected as lines potentially containing a tsl mutation. From F4 to F8, a tsl strain was isolated and established by screening L1 larvae at 41°C for 3 hours. This strain showed similar life history traits compared to the wild type strain in terms of fertility, larval development time and adult's emergence. Crossing experiments to further assess the nature and inheritance pattern of the tsl phenotype showed that it is due to a recessive allele located on an autosome. Conclusion: The successful establishment of the An. arabiensis tsl strain is a valuable tool towards the development of a GSS for SIT applications against this species. This will be done by induction of a Y-autosome translocation to link the wild-type allele to the Y chromosome in such manner that males are wild-type (temperature resistant) and females are mutant (temperature sensitive). © 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - Heat seekers: A tropical nocturnal lizard uses behavioral thermoregulation to exploit rare microclimates at night
VL  - 82
SP  - 107-114
AB  - Environmental temperatures play a vital role in the physiological and behavioral activity of ectotherms. Behavioral thermoregulation allows animals to modify their body temperature to optimize functions critical to fitness, including digestion, growth, reproduction, and locomotor performance. Diurnal reptiles are a classic model system to answer questions related to thermal ecology, whereas behavioral thermoregulation in nocturnal species is thought to be strongly constrained by low environmental thermal heterogeneity at night. The few studies describing the thermal ecology of nocturnal reptiles indicate a majority of thermoregulatory behavior (if any) occurs during the day within diurnal retreats, but few examined this behavior throughout the night. In tropical systems, thermal heterogeneity may remain high, even at night, allowing nocturnal ectotherms to thermoregulate through conduction on surfaces that retain heat after sunset. We investigated the thermoregulatory behavior of a tropical nocturnal gecko (Australian house gecko, Gehyra dubia) by measuring its preferred temperature in a thermal gradient, and selected body temperatures using radio telemetry, in relation to available operative environmental temperatures obtained using thermal models. Preferred body temperatures of geckos ranged from 31.4 ± 0.59–34.5 ± 0.55 °C in a laboratory thermal gradient. In the field, during winter, geckos were more effective thermoregulators than in the summer. In low thermal quality habitats, geckos sought rare, warm microclimates at night to maintain body temperatures warmer than most available environmental temperatures, and were highly effective thermoregulators. For ectotherms, appropriate environmental temperatures are a vital resource for survival, similar to food or shelter. The ability to exploit rare microclimates is especially important for nocturnal species, as heterogeneity of environmental temperatures is reduced at night compared to the day. In a warming world, it is vital to understand the thermal ecology of nocturnal ectotherms, as other species may shift to become more nocturnal to avoid lethal diurnal temperatures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Experimental simulation of environmental warming selects against pigmented morphs of land snails
VL  - 11

SP  - 1111-1130
AB  - In terrestrial snails, thermal selection acts on shell coloration. However, the biological relevance of small differences in the intensity of shell pigmentation and the associated thermodynamic, physiological, and evolutionary consequences for snail diversity within the course of environmental warming are still insufficiently understood. To relate temperature-driven internal heating, protein and membrane integrity impairment, escape behavior, place of residence selection, water loss, and mortality, we used experimentally warmed open-top chambers and field observations with a total of >11,000 naturally or experimentally colored individuals of the highly polymorphic species Theba pisana (O.F. MÜLLER, 1774). We show that solar radiation in their natural Mediterranean habitat in Southern France poses intensifying thermal stress on increasingly pigmented snails that cannot be compensated for by behavioral responses. Individuals of all morphs acted neither jointly nor actively competed in climbing behavior, but acted similarly regardless of neighbor pigmentation intensity. Consequently, dark morphs progressively suffered from high internal temperatures, oxidative stress, and a breakdown of the chaperone system. Concomitant with increasing water loss, mortality increased with more intense pigmentation under simulated global warming conditions. In parallel with an increase in mean ambient temperature of 1.34°C over the past 30 years, the mortality rate of pigmented individuals in the field is, currently, about 50% higher than that of white morphs. A further increase of 1.12°C, as experimentally simulated in our study, would elevate this rate by another 26%. For 34 T. pisana populations from locations that are up to 2.7°C warmer than our experimental site, we show that both the frequency of pigmented morphs and overall pigmentation intensity decrease with an increase in average summer temperatures. We therefore predict a continuing strong decline in the frequency of pigmented morphs and a decrease in overall pigmentation intensity with ongoing global change in areas with strong solar radiation. © 2020 The Authors.

VL  - 27

SP  - 108-120
AB  - Many species with broad distributions are exposed to different thermal regimes which often select for varied phenotypes. This intraspecific variation is often overlooked but may be critical in dictating the vulnerability of different populations to environmental change. We reared Port Jackson shark (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) eggs from two thermally discrete populations (i.e. Jervis Bay and Adelaide) under each location's present-day mean temperatures, predicted end-of-century temperatures and under reciprocal-cross conditions to establish intraspecific thermal sensitivity. Rearing temperatures strongly influenced ṀO2Max and critical thermal limits, regardless of population, indicative of acclimation processes. However, there were significant population-level effects, such that Jervis Bay sharks, regardless of rearing temperature, did not exhibit differences in ṀO2Rest, but under elevated temperatures exhibited reduced maximum swimming activity with step-wise increases in temperature. In contrast, Adelaide sharks reared under elevated temperatures doubled their ṀO2Rest, relative to their present-day temperature counterparts; however, maximum swimming activity was not influenced. With respect to reciprocal-cross comparisons, few differences were detected between Jervis Bay and Adelaide sharks reared under ambient Jervis Bay temperatures. Similarly, juveniles (from both populations) reared under Adelaide conditions had similar thermal limits and swimming activity (maximum volitional velocity and distance) to each other, indicative of conserved acclimation capacity. However, under Adelaide temperatures, the ṀO2Rest of Jervis Bay sharks was greater than that of Adelaide sharks. This indicates that the energetics of cooler water population (Adelaide) is likely more thermally sensitive than that of the warmer population (Jervis Bay). While unique to elasmobranchs, these data provide further support that by treating species as static, homogeneous populations, we ignore the impacts of thermal history and intraspecific variation on thermal sensitivity. With climate change, intraspecific variation will manifest as populations move, demographics change or extirpations occur, starting with the most sensitive populations. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Fruit abscission facilitates the optimal conditions and timing of seed dispersal. Environmental regulation of tropical fruit abscission has received little attention, even though climate change may have its strongest impacts in tropical regions. In this study, oil palm fruit abscission was monitored during multiple years in the Benin Republic to take advantage of the climatic seasonality and the continuous fruit production by this species. An innovative multivariable statistical method was used to identify the best predictors of fruit abscission among a set of climate and ecophysiological variables, and the stage of inflorescence and fruit bunch development when the variables are perceived. The effects of climate scenarios on fruit abscission were then predicted based on the calibrated model. We found complex regulation takes place at specific stages of inflorescence and bunch development, even long before the fruit abscission zone is competent to execute abscission. Among the predictors selected, temperature variations during inflorescence and fruit bunch development are major determinants of the fruit abscission process. Furthermore, the timing of ripe fruit drop is determined by temperature in combination with the trophic status. Finally, climate simulations revealed that the abscission process is robust and is more affected by seasonal variations than by extreme scenarios. Our investigations highlighted the central function of the abscission zone as the sensor of environmental signals during reproductive development. Coupling ecophysiological and statistical modeling was an efficient approach to disentangle this complex environmental regulation. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Variation in developmental temperature alters adulthood plasticity of thermal tolerance in Tigriopus californicus
VL  - 222
IS  - 22
AB  - In response to environmental change, organisms rely on both genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity to adjust key traits that are necessary for survival and reproduction. Given the accelerating rate of climate change, plasticity may be particularly important. For organisms in warming aquatic habitats, upper thermal tolerance is likely to be a key trait, and many organisms express plasticity in this trait in response to developmental or adulthood temperatures. Although plasticity at one life stage may influence plasticity at another life stage, relatively little is known about this possibility for thermal tolerance. Here, we used locally adapted populations of the copepod Tigriopus californicus to investigate these potential effects in an intertidal ectotherm. We found that low latitude populations had greater critical thermal maxima (CTmax) than high latitude populations, and variation in developmental temperature altered CTmax plasticity in adults. After development at 25°C, CTmax was plastic in adults, whereas no adulthood plasticity in this trait was observed after development at 20°C. This pattern was identical across four populations, suggesting that local thermal adaptation has not shaped this effect among these populations. Differences in the capacities to maintain ATP synthesis rates and to induce heat shock proteins at high temperatures, two likely mechanisms of local adaptation in this species, were consistent with changes in CTmax owing to phenotypic plasticity, which suggests that there is likely mechanistic overlap between the effects of plasticity and adaptation. Together, these results indicate that developmental effects may have substantial impacts on upper thermal tolerance plasticity in adult ectotherms. © 2019. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd

TI  - Unnatural selection of salmon life histories in a modified riverscape
VL  - 26
IS  - 3
SP  - 1235-1247
AB  - Altered river flows and fragmented habitats often simplify riverine communities and favor non-native fishes, but their influence on life-history expression and survival is less clear. Here, we quantified the expression and ultimate success of diverse salmon emigration behaviors in an anthropogenically altered California river system. We analyzed two decades of Chinook salmon monitoring data to explore the influence of regulated flows on juvenile emigration phenology, abundance, and recruitment. We then followed seven cohorts into adulthood using otolith (ear stone) chemical archives to identify patterns in time- and size-selective mortality along the migratory corridor. Suppressed winter flow cues were associated with delayed emigration timing, particularly in warm, dry years, which was also when selection against late migrants was the most extreme. Lower, less variable flows were also associated with reduced juvenile and adult production, highlighting the importance of streamflow for cohort success in these southernmost populations. While most juveniles emigrated from the natal stream as fry or smolts, the survivors were dominated by the rare few that left at intermediate sizes and times, coinciding with managed flows released before extreme summer temperatures. The consistent selection against early (small) and late (large) migrants counters prevailing ecological theory that predicts different traits to be favored under varying environmental conditions. Yet, even with this weakened portfolio, maintaining a broad distribution in migration traits still increased adult production and reduced variance. In years exhibiting large fry pulses, even marginal increases in their survival would have significantly boosted recruitment. However, management actions favoring any single phenotype could have negative evolutionary and demographic consequences, potentially reducing adaptability and population stability. To recover fish populations and support viable fisheries in a warming and increasingly unpredictable climate, coordinating flow and habitat management within and among watersheds will be critical to balance trait optimization versus diversification. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Prediction of temperature field for automotive generator based on Kriging and NSGA-III algorithms
VL  - 26
IS  - 1
SP  - 86-95
AB  - Based on the Kriging proxy model and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III), the temperature field distribution of each component of the automotive alternator is predicted under different operating conditions. The simulation analysis of the global temperature field distribution of the generator was carried out by the fluid-solid coupling calculation software of finite element modeling. The results show that when running at 10 000 r/min, the maximum temperature of the machine is located on the three-phase stator winding and the lowest temperature area appears in the cooling fan blades. The experimental measurements were established and validated against the analysis with simulations and then the suitable sampling locations and operating conditions were selected for experimental measurement. With the Pareto multi-objective optimization theory, the Kriging proxy model for temperature field prediction was constructed, and the optimization algorithm of NSGA-III was implemented for optimizing generation by generation. Mobw was referred as the evaluation index for the offspring selection and MAPE was adopted for the predicting error analysis. The results demonstrate that the maximum error of temperature field distribution by prediction with this method is 2.78%, and for the high-speed and long-running conditions, the prediction results are more accurate with the error of 0.53%. The validity, accuracy and convenience are detected in the prediction algorithm. © 2022, Harbin University of Science and Technology Publication. All right reserved.

TI  - Evolutionary origins of viviparity consistent with palaeoclimate and lineage diversification
VL  - 34
IS  - 7
SP  - 1167-1176
AB  - It is of fundamental importance for the field of evolutionary biology to understand when and why major evolutionary transitions occur. Live-bearing young (viviparity) is a major evolutionary change and has evolved from egg-laying (oviparity) independently in many vertebrate lineages and most abundantly in lizards and snakes. Although contemporary viviparous squamate species generally occupy cold climatic regions across the globe, it is not known whether viviparity evolved as a response to cold climate in the first place. Here, we used available published time-calibrated squamate phylogenies and parity data on 3,498 taxa. We compared the accumulation of transitions from oviparity to viviparity relative to background diversification and a simulated binary trait. Extracting the date of each transition in the phylogenies and informed by 65 my of global palaeoclimatic data, we tested the nonexclusive hypotheses that viviparity evolved under the following: (a) cold, (b) long-term stable climatic conditions and (c) with background diversification rate. We show that stable and long-lasting cold climatic conditions are correlated with transitions to viviparity across squamates. This correlation of parity mode and palaeoclimate is mirrored by background diversification in squamates, and simulations of a binary trait also showed a similar association with palaeoclimate, meaning that trait evolution cannot be separated from squamate lineage diversification. We suggest that parity mode transitions depend on environmental and intrinsic effects and that background diversification rate may be a factor in trait diversification more generally. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Irreversible impact of early thermal conditions: an integrative study of developmental plasticity linked to mobility in a butterfly species
VL  - 225
IS  - 3
AB  - Within populations, phenotypic plasticity may allow adaptive phenotypic variation in response to selection generated by environmental heterogeneity. For instance, in multivoltine species, seasonal changes between and within generations may trigger morphological and physiological variation enhancing fitness under different environmental conditions. These seasonal changes may irreversibly affect adult phenotypes when experienced during development. Yet, the irreversible effects of developmental plasticity on adult morphology have rarely been linked to life-history traits even though they may affect different fitness components such as reproduction, mobility and self-maintenance. To address this issue, we raised larvae of Pieris napi butterflies under warmor cool conditions to subsequently compare adult performance in terms of reproduction performance (as assessed through fecundity), displacement capacity (as assessed through flight propensity and endurance) and selfmaintenance (as assessed through the measurement of oxidative markers). As expected in ectotherms, individuals developed faster under warm conditions and were smaller than individuals developing under cool conditions. They also had more slender wings and showed a higher wing surface ratio. These morphological differences were associated with changes in the reproductive and flight performance of adults, as individuals developing under warm conditions laid fewer eggs and flew larger distances. Accordingly, the examination of their oxidative status suggested that individuals developing under warm conditions invested more strongly into self-maintenance than individuals developing under cool conditions (possibly at the expense of reproduction). Overall, our results indicate that developmental conditions have long-term consequences on several adult traits in butterflies. This plasticity probably acts on life-history strategies for each generation to keep pace with seasonal variations and may facilitate acclimation processes in the context of climate change. © 2022.

AB  - This paper investigates the intensification of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) in open-cell foam structures. For confirming this point, the metallic foams with different alloy (aluminum and FeCrAl), pore density (10-40 ppi), and (20% Co-0.5% Re)/Al2O3 catalyst layer thicknesses were prepared. Catalytic results of aluminum foams show excellent thermal behavior but catalyst coatings thicker than ∼70 μm suffer from catalyst effectiveness loss, increasing methane selectivity, and decreasing C5+ hydrocarbon selectivity. Conversely, FeCrAl foams also exhibited a similar critical maximum catalyst layer thickness but with diffusional and thermal limitations resulting in both temperature and selectivity runaways at higher thicknesses. Finally, the observed good thermal control and tortuosity of the narrow porous structure for aluminum foams permitted enhanced production of C5+ hydrocarbons to 87 kgC5+ m-3 h-1 at 250 °C, 26% higher than the productivity obtained with parallel channel aluminum monolith coated with a similar catalyst amount. © 2018 American Chemical Society.

TI  - On consonance between a mathematical method for the CET prediction and constrained / unconstrained solidification
VL  - 30
SP  - 459-466
AB  - Some properties of the functions yielding from the temperature field have been employed as a tool to determine the structural zones' localization in a large static steel ingot. Thus, a numerical simulation was performed to generate the temperature field converged subsequently into the thermal gradient field. As a result, the selection of a zone, in which a columnar into equiaxed structure transformation (CET) is expected, is possible. It is shown that the CET - zone is formed when the thermal gradient becomes temporarily constant. Moreover, the CET localization can be easily controlled / shifted by the mold thickness selection. Both temperature and thermal gradient fields were also calculated to predict mathematically the creation of some structural zones in the continuously solidifying brass ingot. The columnar structure resulting from the constrained growth seems dominant in these ingots. However, when the s/l interface rate and velocity of the liquidus isotherm movement are subjected to a separation then the birth of the equiaxed structure is to be expected. In the industrial practice, the following structural zones are evinced in a continuously cast brass ingot: chilled columnar grains-, (CC), fine columnar grains-, (FC), columnar grains-, (C), equiaxed grains zone, (E), and eventually the single crystal, (SC), situated axially. The current innovative method for the mathematical predictions of the CET appearance in the static ingot turns out also useful in the reproduction of the all mentioned structural zones' localization. In particular, a study of the behavior of the velocity of the liquidus isotherm movement and thermal gradient changes versus solidification time delivers a precise information about these structural zones' situation.

VL  - 12
IS  - 4
SP  - 2626-2635
AB  - Moisture sorption isotherms of chironji kernels were determined at 25, 35 and 45 °C over a water activity range of 0.11–0.93. Three sorption models i.e., Guggenheim–Anderson–de Boer (GAB), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Caurie were evaluated to find out their fitness to the sorption data. Thermodynamic properties of sorbed water were analyzed over the selected range of water activity and temperature. The result showed that the sorption isotherms reflected Type II BET sorption characteristics with a clear hysteresis at the temperatures. Of the three models, GAB and Caurie models were found superior predicting the sorption of chironji kernels over the entire range of water activity values. The monolayer moisture content values calculated by the best-fitted GAB and Caurie model for adsorption were 9.86 and 6.31%, 8.023 and 6.18%, 6.90 and 5.97% (db) and for desorption were 6.53 and 6.01%, 5.85 and 5.68%, 4.21 and 5.60% (db), respectively at 25, 35 and 45 °C. The value of isosteric heat decreased with increasing moisture content and approached the latent heat of pure water. Sorption entropy increased with increasing moisture content and decreased gradually with increase in moisture content. The spreading pressures, for both adsorption and desorption, increased with increasing water activity at the three selected temperatures. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Stay or go – how topographic complexity influences alpine plant population and community responses to climate change
VL  - 30
SP  - 41-50
AB  - In the face of climate change, populations have two survival options − they can remain in situ and tolerate the new climatic conditions (“stay”), or they can move to track their climatic niches (“go”). For sessile and small-stature organisms like alpine plants, staying requires broad climatic tolerances, realized niche shifts due to changing biotic interactions, acclimation through plasticity, or rapid genetic adaptation. Going, in contrast, requires good dispersal and colonization capacities. Neither the magnitude of climate change experienced locally nor the capacities required for staying/going in response to climate change are constant across landscapes, and both aspects may be strongly affected by local microclimatic variation associated with topographic complexity. We combine ideas from population and community ecology to discuss the effects of topographic complexity in the landscape on the immediate “stay” or “go” opportunities of local populations and communities, and on the selective pressures that may have shaped the stay or go capacities of the species occupying contrasting landscapes. We demonstrate, using example landscapes of different topographical complexity, how species’ thermal niches could be distributed across these landscapes, and how these, in turn, may affect many population and community ecological processes that are related to adaptation or dispersal. Focusing on treeless alpine or Arctic landscapes, where temperature is expected to be a strong determinant, our theorethical framework leads to the hypothesis that populations and communities of topographically complex (rough and patchy) landscapes should be both more resistant and more resilient to climate change than those of topographically simple (flat and homogeneous) landscapes. Our theorethical framework further points to how meta-community dynamics such as mass effects in topographically complex landscapes and extinction lags in simple landscapes, may mask and delay the long-term outcomes of these landscape differences under rapidly changing climates. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - An energetics–performance framework for wild fishes
VL  - 101
IS  - 1
SP  - 4-12
AB  - There is growing evidence that bioenergetics can explain relationships between environmental conditions and fish behaviour, distribution and fitness. Fish energetic needs increase predictably with water temperature, but metabolic performance (i.e., aerobic scope) exhibits varied relationships, and there is debate about its role in shaping fish ecology. Here we present an energetics–performance framework, which posits that ecological context determines whether energy expenditure or metabolic performance influence fish behaviour and fitness. From this framework, we present testable predictions about how temperature-driven variability in energetic demands and metabolic performance interact with ecological conditions to influence fish behaviour, distribution and fitness. Specifically, factors such as prey availability and the spatial distributions of prey and predators may alter fish temperature selection relative to metabolic and energetic optima. Furthermore, metabolic flexibility is a key determinant of how fish will respond to changing conditions, such as those predicted with climate change. With few exceptions, these predictions have rarely been tested in the wild due partly to difficulties in remotely measuring aspects of fish energetics. However, with recent advances in technology and measurement techniques, we now have a better capacity to measure bioenergetics parameters in the wild. Testing these predictions will provide a more mechanistic understanding of how ecological factors affect fish fitness and population dynamics, advancing our knowledge of how species and ecosystems will respond to rapidly changing environments. © 2022 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential of survival and growth dynamics of Listeria mono-cytogenes strains and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis and Typhimurium, inoculated artificially (individually and in mixture) on two ready-to-eat (RTE) cooked smoked meat products. For the purpose of the study 120 slices of cooked smoked sausage and 40 slices of cooked smoked loin were purchased and inoculated with the strains. Two storage temperatures were selected: 6o C and 10o C for 8 days. The study was performed as challenge tests in a secondary contamination scenario to investigate the presence and/or absence of pathogenic bacteria during the shelf life of the products. The inoculum levels at the start of the experiment were 4.46 log10 CFU/g and 2.88 log10 CFU/g for the L. monocytogenes strains at the surface of the cooked smoked loin and cooked smoked sausage respectively. Using the same inoculation method, but adding Salmonella enterica serovars to the mixture, the inoculum levels were 4.15 log10 CFU/g at the surface of the cooked smoked loin and 2.94 log10 CFU/g at the surface of the cooked smoked sausage. L. monocytogenes was detected at all sampling days on both storage temperatures. It showed an average increase by 0.5–1.0 log10 CFU/g on the cooked smoked sausage and by 2.0–3.3 log10 CFU/g for the cooked smoked pork loin for the du-ration of the study. Salmonella enterica serovars were also present at each sampling day on both storage temperatures. Typical colonies were isolated and serotyped, confirming the survival of these pathogenic bacteria. Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium was the predominant serovar at almost every sampling day. The results from our study showed no competitive relationship in the presence of Salmonella and L. monocytogenes in contaminated meat products. The two types of microorganisms were successfully adapted and developed independently under appropriate condi-tions, including temperature, humidity, water activity and pH. © 2022, Trakia University.

AB  - Microwave heating faces growing interest in many industries because of its large potential in increasing productivity and energy efficiency. Nevertheless, the main challenge of this heating method is to provide sufficient uniformity of the temperature distribution, in particular in industrial scale production. Several temperature maxima and minima typically occur in a sample because of the standing waves inside a cavity. An optimization-based approach is presented to increase the temperature homogeneity by exiting selected eigenmodes of the cavity. Results of a related experiment show the performance of the developed algorithm. © Editorial Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, 2019.

TI  - Eco-physiological responses of copepods and pteropods to ocean warming and acidification
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - We compare physiological responses of the crustacean copepod Calanus pacificus and pelagic pteropod mollusk Limacina helicina to ocean temperatures and pH by measuring biomarkers of oxidative stress, antioxidant defences, and the activity of the respiratory electron transport system in organisms collected on the 2016 West Coast Ocean Acidification cruise in the California Current System. Copepods and pteropods exhibited strong but divergent responses in the same habitat; copepods had higher oxygen-reactive absorbance capacity, glutathione-S-transferase, and total glutathione content. The ratio between reduced to oxidised glutathione was higher in copepods than in pteropods, indicating lower oxidative stress in copepods. Pteropods showed higher activities of glutathione reductase, catalase, and lipid peroxidation, indicating increased antioxidant defences and oxidative stress. Thus, the antioxidant defence system of the copepods has a greater capacity to respond to oxidative stress, while pteropods already face severe stress and show limited capacity to deal with further changes. The results suggest that copepods have higher adaptive potential, owing to their stronger vertical migration behaviour and efficient glutathione metabolism, whereas pteropods run the risk of oxidative stress and mortality under high CO 2 conditions. Our results provide a unique dataset and evidence of stress-inducing mechanisms behind pteropod ocean acidification responses. © 2019, The Author(s).

VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SP  - 55-68
AB  - Populations at the margins of a species' geographic range are often thought to be poorly adapted to their environment. According to theoretical predictions, gene flow can inhibit these range edge populations if it disrupts adaptation to local conditions. Alternatively, if range edge populations are small or isolated, gene flow can provide beneficial genetic variation and may facilitate adaptation to environmental change. We tested these competing predictions in the annual wildflower Clarkia pulchella using greenhouse crosses to simulate gene flow from sources across the geographic range into two populations at the northern range margin. We planted these between-population hybrids in common gardens at the range edge and evaluated how genetic differentiation and climatic differences between edge populations and gene flow sources affected lifetime fitness. During an anomalously warm study year, gene flow from populations occupying historically warm sites improved fitness at the range edge and plants with one or both parents from warm populations performed best. The effects of the temperature provenance of gene flow sources were most apparent at early life history stages, but precipitation provenance also affected reproduction. We also found benefits of gene flow that were independent of climate: after climate was controlled for, plants with parents from different populations performed better at later lifestages than those with parents from the same population, indicating that gene flow may improve fitness via relieving homozygosity. Further supporting this result, we found that increasing genetic differentiation of parental populations had positive effects on fitness of hybrid seeds. Gene flow from warmer populations, when it occurs, is likely to contribute adaptive genetic variation to populations at the northern range edge as the climate warms. On heterogeneous landscapes, climate of origin may be a better predictor of gene flow effects than geographic proximity. © 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - Climate change drives trait-shifts in coral reef communities
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Climate change is expected to have profound, partly unforeseeable effects on the composition of functional traits of complex ecosystems, such as coral reefs, and some ecosystem properties are at risk of disappearing. This study applies a novel spatially explicit, individual-based model to explore three critical life history traits of corals: heat tolerance, competitiveness and growth performance under various environmental settings. Building upon these findings, we test the adaptation potential required by a coral community in order to not only survive but also retain its diversity by the end of this century under different IPCC climate scenarios. Even under the most favourable IPCC scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP 2.6), model results indicate that shifts in the trait space are likely and coral communities will mainly consist of small numbers of temperature-tolerant and fast-growing species. Species composition of coral communities is likely to be determined by heat tolerance, with competitiveness most likely playing a subordinate role. To sustain ~15% of current coral cover under a 2 °C temperature increase by the end of the century (RCP 4.5), coral systems would have to accommodate temperature increases of 0.1–0.15 °C per decade, assuming that periodic extreme thermal events occurred every 8 years. These required adaptation rates are unprecedented and unlikely, given corals’ life-history characteristics. © 2019, The Author(s).

TI  - Sustainable green roofs: a comprehensive review of influential factors
AB  - Green roofs have gained much attention as a modern roofing surface due to their potential to deliver many environmental and social benefits. Studies have indicated that different GR designs deliver different ecosystem services, and there are important factors that affect GR performance. This article reviewed significant factors that influence GR performance and sustainability. Substrate and drainage layer material choice significantly affects stormwater retention potential, leachate quality, plant survival, and determines GR environmental footprints. Subsequently, type of plants, their form, and kinds used on GRs impact GR ecosystem function. Leaf area is the most studied trait due to its influence on the cooling potential and energy performance. In order to achieve a sustainable GR, it is essential to select the type of plants that have a high survival rate. Perennial herbs, particularly forbs and grass as dominant groups, are heat and drought tolerant, which make them suitable in GR experiment. Furthermore, selecting a suitable irrigation system is as important as two other factors for having a sustainable GR. Irrigation is essential for plant survival, and due to the current pressure on valuable water sources, it is important to select a sustainable irrigation system. This review presents three sustainable irrigation methods: (i) employing alternative water sources such as rainwater, greywater, and atmospheric water; (ii) smart irrigation and monitoring; and (iii) using adaptive materials and additives that improve GR water use. This review sheds new insights on the design of high-performance, sustainable GRs and provides guidance for the legislation of sustainable GR. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Thermal acclimation of flies from three populations of Drosophila melanogaster fails to support the seasonality hypothesis
VL  - 81
SP  - 25-32
AB  - In seasonal environments, natural selection should favor genotypes that acclimate to slow and predictable changes in temperature. Selective pressure for acclimation should be especially strong for animals that complete many generations per year, because seasonal warming or cooling causes offspring to experience different temperatures than their parents did. Here, we studied variation in acclimation capacity among three populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We used a reverse acclimation design to see whether developmental acclimation persisted throughout adulthood. Flies developed from fertilization to adulthood at either 16 degrees or 26 degrees C. Then, flies either remained at the same temperature or moved to the other temperature for 7 days. We measured fecundity at seven temperatures ranging from 14 degrees to 36 degrees C. Genotypes from North Carolina and Vermont laid more eggs at 16 degrees C after spending the larval and adult stages at 16 degrees C, instead of 26 degrees C. In both populations, the benefit of acclimation to 16 degrees C during development was erased by acclimation to 26 degrees C during adulthood. In contrast to our prediction, genotypes from Indiana laid fewer eggs at 16 C or 26 degrees C after developing at this temperature. Overall, these data provide only weak support for the models of optimal acclimation in seasonal environments.

AB  - Cities can be used as in situ replicates to assess the responses of organisms to environmental changes, such as increased heat or pollution. Community-level studies and more rarely population-level studies have been conducted, but they are not often based on multiple city replicates, thus preventing generalization. Our study tested whether colonies of the ant Temnothorax nylanderi from forest and urban populations exhibit distinct responses to pollution. Because this is a social species, we could also test whether social traits (colony size and mean size of adult workers) affected the response of colonies to urbanization. We collected colonies from four pairs of forest and urban habitats and reared them in the laboratory under normal or cadmium-supplemented diets. We then measured the emergence rate and size of newly-produced workers as well as the mortality rate of adult workers. In all four forest/city replicates, urban colonies were less negatively affected by cadmium than forest colonies for emergence rate and size of newly-produced workers, but not for mortality rate of adult workers. We did not find any correlation between social traits and cadmium resistance, in contrast with what was found in other eusocial insects. We discuss the potential adaptive nature of this differential response. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Despite widespread interest in describing and forecasting the impacts of climate change on species distributions, poor understanding of the climate variables that shape distributions and conflicting perspectives on the role that species traits play in mediating shifts have limited our ability to interpret and project changes in species distributions. Using standardized survey data along the northeast US continental shelf, we assessed the historical exposure and sensitivity of 81 species of marine chordates, arthropods, and molluscs to 24 sea surface temperature (SST) variables in two seasons. By comparing temperature trends in geographies available to species against temperature trends in geographies used by them we were able to identify which variables species track consistently through space and time. Logistic regression analyses were then used to assess whether species traits affected the likelihood of niche tracking while accounting for the season and temporal window in which temperatures were summarized and methodological constraints that might have limited our ability to detect tracking responses. A slight majority of species (52%) clearly shifted their distributions to track at least one temperature variable through space and time. Tracking rates were much lower on a per variable basis (5.1% of 3432 variables), despite widespread exposure to changing temperatures (89.2% of 3432 variables). None of the twelve ecological traits we investigated – including traits related to dispersal ability, ecological specialization, reproductive capacity, and commercial harvest – accounted for differences in tracking responses across species even after accounting for differences in climate exposure. Our results suggest widespread behavioral or physiological flexibility among our study species, or ongoing genetic adaptation to changing temperatures. They also suggest that divergent selection on climate sensitivities of close relatives may limit the utility of ecological traits for predicting distributional responses to future climate change. © 2018 The Authors
