TI  - A hybrid deep transfer learning strategy for thermal comfort prediction in buildings
VL  - 204
AB  - Since the thermal condition of living spaces affects the occupants' productivity and their quality of life, it is important to design effective heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) control strategies for better energy efficiency and thermal comfort. An essential step in HVAC control and energy optimization is thermal comfort modeling. Recently, data-driven thermal comfort models have been preferred over the Fanger's Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model due to higher accuracy and ease of use. However, the unavailability of comprehensive labelled thermal comfort data from the occupants poses a significant modeling challenge. This paper addresses data inadequacy issues by adopting ‘transfer learning’ to leverage well learned knowledge from source domain (same climate zones) to target domain (different climate zone) where modeling data is sparse. Specifically, a Transfer Learning based Convolutional Neural Networks-Long Short Term Memory neural networks (TL CNN-LSTM) is designed for effective thermal comfort modeling that exploits the spatio-temporal relations in the thermal comfort data. The significant modeling parameters for TL CNN-LSTM are identified using the Chi-squared test. Further, the lack of sufficient samples across all thermal conditions in the available thermal comfort datasets was handled by Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Experiments with two source (ASHRAE RP-884 and Scales Project) and one target (Medium US office) datasets demonstrate the ability of TL CNN-LSTM in achieving an accuracy of >55% with limited data in target buildings. The limitation of TL CNN-LSTM is its continued dependence on intrusive parameters and the challenges in assessing its adaptability to different climate zones. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Adaptability and stability of eucalypt clones at different ages across environmental gradients in Brazil
VL  - 454
AB  - The genetic gains from eucalypt breeding programs have decreased compared to previous decades while productivity reduced in recent years. This decrease is mainly attributed to climate change that, according to studies, has been limiting productivity and changing the adaptation of forest species. But other aspects can be listed, as pests and diseases and decreasing gains with the advance of breeding programs. The objective of this work is to investigate the genotype × site × age interaction in a multi-environment trial with eucalypt clones to verify the adaptability and stability of the genotypes and, finally, to identify mega-environments over time, as well as the influence of climate variables on the genotype performances. The trait diameter at breast height (DBH) of 11 Eucalyptus commercial clones at 11 sites (range from −0.84 to −24.23 latitude and from −39.60 to −52.59 longitude) and three evaluated ages (Age 1 – ranging from 13 to 17 months after planting; Age 2 – from 31 to 34 months; Age 3 – from 48 to 53 months old) was measured and analyzed by factor analytic multiplicative mixed (FAMM) model associated with the GGE biplot and multivariate regression tree using climate variables. A significant G × E interaction and genotypes with different performance across environments and ages were observed. There are clones with high adaptability to specific sites while others show good stability. The results clustered the sites into three mega-environments according to a latitude gradient, over time. The performance of Eucalyptus clones over time indicate precisely either roughly similar or extremely contrasting environments. Temperature affected the most the clustering of the studied sites followed by the latitudinal gradient, impacting productivity negatively, regardless of age. These results may help future studies on the development of selection strategies in tropical regions to address climate change and assist forest breeding programs to deal with the effect of climate change on eucalypt productivity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Direct and indirect parental exposure to endocrine disruptors and elevated temperature influences gene expression across generations in a euryhaline model fish
VL  - 2019
IS  - 1
AB  - Aquatic organisms inhabiting polluted waterways face numerous adverse effects, including physiological disruption by endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). Little is known about how the temperatures associated with global climate change may influence the response of organisms exposed to EDCs, and the effects that these combined stressors may have on molecular endpoints such as gene expression. We exposed Menidia beryllina (inland silversides) to environmentally relevant concentrations (1 ng/L) of two estrogenic EDCs (bifenthrin and 17α-ethinylestradiol; EE2) at 22 ◦ C and 28 ◦ C. We conducted this experiment over multiple generations to better understand the potential effects to chronically exposed populations in the wild. We exposed adult parental fish (F0) for 14 days prior to spawning of the next generation. F1 larvae were then exposed from fertilization until 21 days post hatch (dph) before being transferred to clean water tanks. F1 larvae were reared to adulthood, then spawned in clean water to test for further effects of parental exposure on offspring (F2 generation). Gene expression was quantified by performing qPCR on F0 and F1 gonads, as well as F1 and F2 larvae. We did not detect any significant differences in the expression of genes measured in the parental or F1 adult gonads. We found that the 28 ◦ C EE2 treatment significantly decreased the expression of nearly all genes measured in the F1 larvae. This pattern was transferred to the F2 generation for expression of the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) gene. Expression of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) and G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) revealed changes not measured in the previous generation. Effects of the bifenthrin treatments were not observed until the F2 generation, which were exposed to the chemicals indirectly as germ cells. Our results indicate that effects of EDCs and their interactions with abiotic factors, may not be adequately represented by singular generation testing. These findings will contribute to the determination of the risk of EDC contamination to organisms inhabiting contaminated waterways under changing temperature regimes. Copyright 2019 DeCourten et al.

AB  - Aims The shape plasticity of plant leaves is an important survival strategy to high temperature and drought in arid region, yet reliable evidences are insufficient to validate the fundamental concepts. Our objective was to demonstrate the specific effects of leaf morphology on leaf surface temperature. Methods Infrared thermal images were processed to determine the leaf temperature and shape parameters of simulated and actual leaf shape. Microclimatic conditions were recorded using a automatic weather station near the sampling plot, including wind speed, radiation and air temperature. Important findings Under the drought and high temperature, the plasticity of leaf shape appeared an important measure to regulate leaf temperature, except leaf transpiration. The exchange rates of matter and energy between leaves and the environment were enhanced by smaller leaves that effectively decreased leaf temperature. With low wind speed and high temperature, leaf surface temperature decreased 2.1 °C per 1 cm reduction in leaf width. However, leaf surface temperature of a simulated leaf decreased 0.60–0.86 °C per 1 cm reduction in leaf width. Results from this study will help us to understand plant adaptability and survival strategy in arid region. © 2018 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology. All rights reserved.

AB  - To meet the demand for food from a growing global population, aquaculture production is under great pressure to increase as capture fisheries have stagnated. However, aquaculture has raised a range of environmental concerns, and further increases in aquaculture production will face widespread environmental challenges. The effects of climate change will pose a further threat to global aquaculture production. Aquaculture is often at risk from a combination of climatic variables, including cyclone, drought, flood, global warming, ocean acidification, rainfall variation, salinity, and sea level rise. For aquaculture growth to be sustainable its environmental impacts must reduce significantly. Adaptation to climate change is also needed to produce more fish without environmental impacts. Some adaptation strategies including integrated aquaculture, recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS), and the expansion of seafood farming could increase aquaculture productivity, environmental sustainability, and climate change adaptability. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper assesses the viability of providing down and up spinning reserves by renewable energy resources (RES) in island power systems. The process consists of evaluating the impact of providing spinning reserve on the system operation costs of different islands by simulating the unit commitment problem. The assessment is carried out for La Palma (small size) and Tenerife (medium size) island power systems, and by considering different wind source availability scenarios for sample weeks of different seasons in current and future years. This paper differentiates between up and down reserves and studies their impacts separately. Results show that enabling RES to provide just down spinning reserve has economic benefits for all scenarios, by reducing over 40% the amount of thermal generation and over 30% the systems costs for high wind scenarios. It also confirms that employing variable deloading of wind energy as a source of up reserve is advisable, mainly in scenarios with high share of wind sources. In some scenarios, using RES as reserve provider, reduces the amount of thermal generation more than 50%, compared to when RES does not participate as a source of reserve, and can even lead to a full RES coverage of demand. © 2021 The Authors.

VL  - 210

SP  - 907-923
AB  - Chromatin modifications, including methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me) by the Polycomb group proteins, play a broadly conserved role in the maintenance of cell fate. Diverse chromatin organization modifier (chromo) domain proteins act as “readers” of histone methylation states. However, understanding the functional relationships among chromo domains and their roles in the inheritance of gene expression patterns remains challenging. Here, we identify two chromo-domain proteins, CEC-1 and CEC-6, as potential readers of H3K27me in Caenorhabditis elegans, where they have divergent expression patterns and contribute to distinct phenotypes. Both cec-1 and cec-6 genetically interact with another chromo-domain gene, cec-3, a reader of H3K9 methylation. Combined loss of cec-1 and cec-3 leads to developmental defects in the adult that result in decreased fitness. Furthermore, loss of cec-6 and cec-3 surprisingly leads to a progressive loss of fertility across generations, a “mortal germline” phenotype. Our results provide evidence of functional compensation between H3K27me and H3K9me heterochromatin pathways, and show that histone methylation readers contribute to both somatic development and transgenerational fitness. © 2018 by the Genetics Society of America.

AB  - In recent years, an increasing amount of overheating issues in buildings has been reported. Despite available knowledge and recognition of the problem by research, in practice little attention has been paid to the problem. The aim of the paper is to identify contradictions, missing interconnections, communication deficits or barriers. Terminologies used, and time and dynamics in the context of overheating and heatwaves will be discussed. Planning pathways and their consequences on preparedness for overheating or heatwaves will be discussed subsequently. In the context of overheating as well for heatwaves, informing people about the human ability to acclimatise to seasonal changes and addressing acceptable healthy temperature ranges instead of comfort ranges could be supportive in relaxing people's expectations towards indoor climate. Three areas should become a focus of future activities: a) enhancing adaptability in humans b) managing human expectation towards the indoor environment and c) enhancing adaptability of buildings. Time and dynamics in building performance, adaptation processes and mortality predictions are interrelated and will require more attention in future studies. © 2018 Proceedings of 10th Windsor Conference: Rethinking Comfort.

SP  - 211-221
AB  - The clover mite, Bryobia praetiosa Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), is an agricultural pest, as well as a frequent invader of hospitals and homes. However, its adaptability to different temperatures is not well understood. We used age- and stage-specific life tables to investigate the effects of temperature on demographic parameters of B. praetiosa from 15 to 35°C under a long-day photoperiod (16:8 [L:D] h). The clover mite is a thelytokous species (consisting of only females) due to its infection with the symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia. The egg-to-adult development time of female B. praetiosa decreased as the temperature increased from 15 to 32.5°C. At 35°C, females laid eggs, but no eggs hatched. The lower thermal threshold (t) and the thermal constant (K) for egg-to-adult females were 8.7°C and 274.1 degree-days, respectively. The intrinsic optimum temperature (TØ) was 22.4°C. The oviposition period decreased with increasing temperature. Fecundity was highest at 20°C and extremely low at 30°C. The net reproductive rate (R0) decreased as the temperature increased from 15 to 30°C, but no significant difference was observed between 15 and 20°C. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) varied from 0.0721/d at 15°C to 0.1679/d at 25°C, and then decreased to 0.1203/d at 30°C. These results should be useful in developing management strategies for B. praetiosa. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America.

TI  - Impacts and Drivers of Smooth Brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.) Invasion in Native Ecosystems
VL  - 11
IS  - 10
AB  - Smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.) is an invasive cool‐season grass that has spread throughout the Great Plains of North America. The species is considered one of the most widespread exotic grasses that has successfully invaded both cool‐season and warm‐season native prairies. In the prairies where it has invaded, there has often been a total elimination of native species and an overall homogenization of ecosystems. Smooth brome has greater competitive abilities compared to many native grasses and can foster their total elimination in many instances. The greater competitiveness can be partially attributed to its ability to alter the soil and hydrological properties of a site. It is a deep‐rooted rhizomatous grass species that thrives in nitrogen‐enriched soil, and since its leaf tissue decomposes faster than native species, it in turn increases the soil nitrogen level, causing positive plant–soil feedback. Moreover, smooth brome is able to transport the required nutrients from older plants to the newer progenies invading new nutrient‐depleted areas, making it a potent invader. However, the impact of smooth brome is not limited to soil biochemistry alone; it also affects other ecosystem components such as the movement and behavior of many native arthropods, thereby altering the overall population dynamics of such species. Thus, smooth brome invasion poses a serious threat to the remnant prairies of the Great Plains, and efficient management strategies are urgently needed to control its invasion. Control measures such as mowing, grazing, burning, and herbicide application have been effectively used to manage this species. However, due to the widespread distribution of smooth brome across North America and its adaptability to a wide range of environmental conditions, it is challenging to translate the management strategies from one area to another. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Critical review of multigeneration system powered by geothermal energy resource from the energy, exergy, and economic point of views
AB  - Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels have made the use of renewable sources the world's most important energy challenge. Among renewable energies, geothermal energy has a special place due to its sustainable resources and shallow environmental impacts. These energy sources are classified as low-grade thermal energy sources, so they cannot independently provide a high amount of thermal energy. Therefore, extensive studies have been conducted on practical methods of using geothermal energy for multigeneration productions. Studies on geothermal energy-based systems to supply energy to various systems such as chillers, electrolyzers, turbines, and desalination units are reviewed in this study. As the methods, scenarios, and practical possibilities of multigenerational system (MGS) are limited, in this study, while expressing the limitations and problems of these systems, the most critical issues raised in this issue are examined and analyzed, and compatibility, products, Levelized cost of energy, energy and exergy efficiencies, and technical issues are summarized. Also, due to the limitations of geothermal energy sources in recent studies, their combination with other renewable energy sources has been evaluated. Therefore, the classification of studies conducted to combine renewable energy sources with the geothermal system to achieve multigeneration productions is thrown in the last part of this study. The results of the studies show that the combination of geothermal energy with other renewable energy sources is used in 90% of cases to provide heat and cold load and in 10% of cases to generate electrical power. These systems also improve energy and exergy efficiency and economic viability by increasing stability. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Can confrontation of mortality – facing down our fears and denial of death – make what time we have into a better life? We think so. Through a study of the issues and experience with dying individuals and their loved ones, we will show evidence of how this happens, and how it might be made to happen more often. Years ago in the U.S., as is often still true in some cultures, death and dying were seen up close and personal from an early age. The old and infirm spent their final weeks and months at home, surrounded and cared for by relatives or close friends. It’s a system that worked for centuries. By weaving the experience of dying into the souls of the living, generation after generation learned to accept the cyclical nature of life, and to experience joy even in its lingering moments. But thanks to relentless urbanization, increasingly mobile societies and the loosening of family ties in the 20th century, dying happened more and more in isolation. People died in cold, bright-lit intensive care units or in impersonal nursing homes and institutions, and the notions of staying young forever or prolonging life at all costs turned dying into some alien act, something to be feared and fought. Along with the familiarity with life’s end, the celebration of life itself became diminished. © Inter-Disciplinary Press 2011

TI  - Predicting the effects of climate change on tadpole stage fitness in the Korean brown frog Rana uenoi Matsui, 2014 (Amphibia: Ranidae)
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
SP  - 41-48
AB  - Jeju Island, South Korea is a biodiversity hotspot, but the vulnerability of Jeju Island fauna to climate change has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we tested the adaptability of the Korean large brown frog Rana uenoi to future climate change. While increased temperatures did not affect the hatchability of frog eggs, hatched tadpoles in greenhouse treatment with less exposure to sunlight (less maximum temperature) were significantly (14%) shorter in length after three weeks of growth, indicating increased temperature of early season helps growth of tadpoles. However, right after three weeks, all tadpoles in a higher-temperature treatment (outside) died after the experiment logged a maximum temperature of 34.3°C. In the field, the average temperature of puddles without tadpoles (puddles in the middle of the rivulet with all day exposure to sunlight) was 33.2°C. During an indoor temperature elevation experiment, tadpoles suddenly died at 32.4°C. Therefore, the expected maximum survivable temperature for R. uenoi is around 32°C. Our results therefore suggest that R. uenoi tadpoles are vulnerable to elevated temperatures and could suffer mortality from climate change. Climate change will continue to cause extreme weather events like this (sudden elevation of temperature in spring), and frogs, especially tadpoles with restricted movement, will be particularly vulnerable to these events. Identifying how adaptable these amphibian species are to the weather events predicted by future climate change scenarios will be key for their conservation on Jeju Island. © 2022. TCRP Foundation.

TI  - Survival and thermal resistance of Salmonella in dry and hydrated nonfat dry milk and whole milk powder during extended storage
VL  - 337
AB  - Foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella can endure dry environments of milk powders for extended periods due to the increased adaptability at a low water activity (aw) and proliferate when powders are hydrated. This study compared the survivability and the thermal resistance of a 5-serovar Salmonella cocktail in dry and hydrated nonfat dry milk (NFDM) and whole milk powder (WMP) stored for 180 days at ambient temperature (~20 °C). This study was designed as two factorial (storage days and milk powder type) randomized complete block design with three replications as blocks. The milk powders were spray inoculated with 5-serovar Salmonella cocktail and dried back to the original pre-inoculation aw. The D-values of Salmonella in inoculated NFDM and WMP were determined periodically (every 30 days, starting from day one). The milk powders were also individually hydrated on each analysis day to determine D- and z-values of Salmonella in hydrated powders. The D-values were determined using thermal-death-time disks and hot-water baths at 80, 85 and 90 °C for milk powders, and 59, 62 and 65 °C for hydrated powders. The D- and z-values of Salmonella at specific temperatures within dry or hydrated powders during the storage period were compared at P ≤ 0.05 using two-way ANOVA and Tukey's Test. The D-values of Salmonella in WMP on day 1 were 18.9, 9.9 and 4.4 min at 80, 85 and 90 °C, respectively, which increased to 29.4, 13.6 and 6.5 min at 80, 85 and 90 °C, respectively, on day 180. Whereas, D-values of Salmonella in NFDM on day 1 were 17.9, 9.2 and 4.4 min at 80, 85 and 90 °C, respectively, and stayed similar during the storage. The D-values of Salmonella in milk powder remained similar throughout the storage once hydrated. The overall z-value of Salmonella in NFDM and WMP was 16.3 °C, whereas in hydrated NFDM and WMP, the overall z-value was 6.4 °C. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Laboratory comparison of two Aphelinus Mali clades for control of woolly apple aphid from Hebei Province, China
VL  - 108
IS  - 3
SP  - 400-405
AB  - Aphelinus Mali (Haldeman) is an effective natural enemy of woolly apple aphid (WAA), Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausmann). Previous studies have found that, with WAA from Shandong Province (Qingdao) as the host, there are significant differences in various biological characteristics between a Shandong clade and Liaoning clade of A. Mali. The ability of the Shandong clade to control this aphid was significantly higher than that of the Liaoning clade in Shandong Province. In order to determine whether differences were caused by better adaptation of the Shandong parasitoid clade to the population of the host in that province or if it represents a more general fitness of this clade to control the host regardless of location, we compared the same parasitoid clades with hosts from Hebei Province. We found no significant differences in the developmental threshold temperature, effective accumulated temperature, fecundity, longevity, and oviposition period of the two clades, but the duration of host searching of the Shandong clade was significantly longer than that of the Liaoning clade. The instantaneous attack rate, the control ability (a/Th), the search parameter (Q) of the Shandong clade (0.0946, 0.543, 0.0725) of A. Mali were higher than that of the Liaoning clade (0.0713, 0.382, 0.0381), and therefore, with WAA from Hebei Province as the host, the host adaptability of the Shandong clade of A. Mali was not worse than that of the Liaoning clade, while the pest control ability of the Shandong clade was still greater than that of the Liaoning clade. © 2018 Cambridge University Press.

TI  - Assessing the potential of thermochemical water splitting cycles: A bridge towards for clean and sustainable hydrogen generation
VL  - 286
AB  - Thermochemical water separation methods are one of the clean and green hydrogen production methods. Thermochemical cycles are divided into two groups; hybrid thermochemical cycles which are using electrical energy and thermal energy, and pure thermochemical cycles which are using only thermal energy. In this study, the most studied S-I, HyS, Fe-Cl, Cu-Cl and Mg-Cl pure/hybrid thermochemical cycles available in the open literature are examined in terms of efficiency and cost comparatively. Besides, its advantages, disadvantages and challenges are also summarized. Thermochemical cycles have promising values both in terms of cost and environmental impact. Cu-Cl thermochemical cycle offers 0.0023 ADP (kg Sb eq), 0.0026 AP (kg SO2 eq), 0.3370 GWP (kg CO2 eq), 2.27 × 10–08 ODP (kg CFC-11 eq) and 2.4235 HTP (kg 1, 4-DB eq). These values can be said to be more environmentally friendly than other hydrogen production methods. The Cu-Cl hybrid cycle is promising in terms of multigenerational integration. Apart from these cycles, thermochemical cycles that are new in the literature are examined and explained in detail. Among them, the NaOH, Cu-Cl and Boron thermochemical cycles appear to be promising in terms of efficiency, cost and productivity. In these cycles, the NaOH cycle is promising as it operates at 500 °C. It also has the highest energy efficiency with 82% among new cycles. More importantly, such thermeochemical/hybrid cycles are suitable to use the renewable heat and electricity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Effects of temperature and repeat measurement on fast-start, swimming performance and post-exhaustion metabolic characteristics in Brachymystax lenok tsinlingensis
VL  - 41
IS  - 6
SP  - 2505-2514
AB  - Temperature is one of the most important abiotic factors for ectothermic animals and has been called the "ecological master factor" for fish. In the context of global climate warming, the temperature adaptability of cold-water fish has become a focus of interest and concern. Brachymystax lenok tsinlingensis, a threatened fish in Qinling Mountain region, is a second-class state-protected wild animal in the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals, and is generally regarded as one of the two southernmost-distributed Salmonid fish worldwide. Remarkably, the lowest elevation at which B. lenok tsinlingensis occurs has risen by about 300 m, likely reflecting shifting thermal ranges in response to changing climate. Although water temperature is crucial for the survival and distribution of B. lenok tsinlingensis, information on the thermal biology of this species remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of temperature and repeat measurement on fitness-related parameters (i. e. fast-start, swimming performance and post-exhaustion metabolic characteristics) in B. lenok tsinlingensis. The results showed that: (1) the latency time (7 ^) of fast-start in B. lenok tsinlingensis became shorter as the temperature increased (P < 0.05), but temperature and repeat measurement had no significant effect on the reaction rate (R) (P>0.05) . (2) Both gait transition speed (Ug a i t) and constant acceleration test speed (Uc a t) were significantly affected by temperature (P < 0.05), while those were not affected by repeat measurement (P>0.05). (3) Temperature had a significant effect on the routine metabolic rate (RMR) and the maximum metabolic rate (MMR) (P<0.05), but had no significant influence on the metabolic scope (MS) (P>0.05) . Besides, the MS and MMR were not significantly affected by repeat measurement (P>0.05). (4) The Ql 0 values of physiological parameters was larger in the direction of low acclimation temperature (6—12T!), and smaller in the direction of high acclimation temperature (12—18T!) . The results indicated that: (1) B. lenok tsinlingensis could react more rapidly at high temperature, but it mainly adopted the strategy of "keeping still" rather than escaping in response to the low-intensity mechanical stimulation. (2) The swimming performance of B. lenok tsinlingensis was sensitive to temperature changes, and the optimum temperature for swimming performance was estimated to be between 12T! and 1 8 1 . (3) B. lenok tsinlingensis showed excellent performance in metabolic recovery and repeat swimming performance, however, due to the relatively weak swimming ability of this species, it may be vulnerable to changes in habitat water temperature and flow environment. © 2021 Science Press.

TI  - Fruit Fly in a Challenging Environment: Impact of Short-Term Temperature Stress on the Survival, Development, Reproduction, and Trehalose Metabolism of Bactrocera dorsalis (Diptera: Tephritidae)
VL  - 13
IS  - 8
AB  - Simple Summary Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) is a widespread and economically important insect pest, infesting various fruits and vegetables. Due to the instability of climate change in early spring and autumn, extreme cold and hot temperatures were developed in a short period of time. Exposure to sudden short-term high or low temperatures may affect the reproduction, development, and physiological changes of B. dorsalis. In this study, we determined the effects of short-term temperature treatments on the growth, development, fecundity, and trehalose metabolism of B. dorsalis. The results showed that development and reproduction of the flies were negatively affected when temperature was below 10 degrees C; or more than 31 degrees C, even causing permanent sterility at extreme temperatures. The changes of glucose, glycogen, trehalose, and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase level had a correlation with the population dynamics of the fruit flies. Our present study can provide a scientific basis for population monitoring, prediction, and comprehensive prevention of the fruit fly. An understanding of physiological damage and population development caused by uncomfortable temperature plays an important role in pest control. In order to clarify the adaptability of different temperatures and physiological response mechanism of B. dorsalis, we focused on the adaptation ability of this pest to environmental stress from physiological and ecological viewpoints. In this study, we explored the relationship between population parameters and glucose, glycogen, trehalose, and trehalose-6-phosphate synthase responses to high and low temperatures. Compared with the control group, temperature stress delayed the development duration of all stages, and the survival rates and longevity decreased gradually as temperature decreased to 0 degrees C and increased to 36 degrees C. Furthermore, with low temperature decrease from 10 degrees C to 0 degrees C, the average fecundity per female increased at 10 degrees C but decreased later. Reproduction of the species was negatively affected during high-temperature stresses, reaching the lowest value at 36 degrees C. In addition to significantly affecting biological characteristics, temperature stress influenced physiological changes of B. dorsalis in cold and heat tolerance. When temperature deviated significantly from the norm, the levels of substances associated with temperature resistance were altered: glucose, trehalose, and TPS levels increased, but glycogen levels decreased. These results suggest that temperature stresses exert a detrimental effect on the populations' survival, but the metabolism of trehalose and glycogen may enhance the pest's temperature resistance.

TI  - Degradation based operational optimization model to improve the productivity of energy systems, case study: Solid oxide fuel cell stacks
VL  - 158
SP  - 81-91
AB  - In the present study a comprehensive thermodynamic model and degradation based optimization framework for energy management of anode supported solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks are carried out. The optimization framework determines optimum operating conditions to maximize system productivity (energy generation over system lifetime) considering degradation mechanisms. The main degradation mechanisms in anode supported SOFCs are nickel coarsening and oxidation. In this study, the optimum operating conditions regarding these degradation mechanisms to achieve maximum productivity at different target lifetimes are derived. The results show that target lifetime has a significant impact on system productivity and optimum operating temperature and current density. Furthermore, SOFC optimum operating conditions as a function of target lifetime are derived. To show the effectiveness of the developed framework, model outputs are compared with two other operating strategies; a base case strategy that optimizes system operating conditions without considering degradation mechanisms and a strategy based on Department of Energy's (DOE) 2016 fuel cell report. Results illustrated that degradation based optimization is more beneficial for improving the entire performance in long-term operation. For instance, system productivity is 7.4% higher in comparison with DOE strategy during 40,000 h operating lifetime. It is expected that the proposed methodology will lead to more rapid commercialization of SOFC technology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - An IoT-based Smart Agriculture System with Locust Prevention and Data Prediction
SP  - 201-206
AB  - Locust and grasshopper infestation have a long history of affecting crops and human lives. From ancient Egypt to the Bronze age, everywhere, we have seen the manifestation of locust outbreaks and how humans have fought against it for their survival generations after generations. The latest locust eruption began in June 2019 and has continued through 2020. It has been the worst one in the last 70 years in Middle Africa, Middle East, South Asia, and South America. Countries are taking precautions to be safe from this outbreak because, after this corona pandemic, no nation is willing to face another economic pandemic. In advances of facing the consequences of the locust swarms, we need to find an effective and smart solution. In this paper, we have come up with the idea of monitoring important agricultural factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity using sensors to provide real-time information to the farmers about imminent locust infestation to their mobile. Also, to ease their work, our proposed system will provide water and pesticides automatically to the fields by using Raspberry Pi and Node MCU. Our proposed system will generate ultraviolet light and loud noise to kill the insects in case of a locust outbreak. As locust's habitats are closely related to different agricultural factors, linear regression, logistic regression, and support vector regression, machine learning algorithms have been implemented to predict the temperature and humidity so that the farmers can anticipate these factors well ahead of time and plan accordingly. Overall a next-generation solution to fight the locusts has been implemented in this paper. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - With the increasing global warming, climate change has affected human survival and development, which has become an important problem facing the world. Therefore, green building has become the most important development trend, which is an important measure of the corresponding sustainable development strategy. Through green building, China can implement energy conservation and emission reduction strategy, which will better deal with global warming. Green building needs multi-disciplinary technology combination, which needs to set the design goal according to the local environment, form and function. By strengthening the natural regulation of climate, green buildings can better apply the environmental climate change, which will meet the requirements of energy conservation and health. This paper mainly studies the adaptability of the subtropical marine climate green building, which can better design the building in line with energy conservation, health and function. Taking Guangzhou as an example, this paper analyzes the adaptive design of green building through examples. © 2020 Coastal Education Research Foundation Inc.. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mimicking Transgenerational Signals of Future Stress: Thermal Tolerance of Juvenile Chinook Salmon Is More Sensitive to Elevated Rearing Temperature Than Exogenously Increased Egg Cortisol
VL  - 8
AB  - Elevated temperatures resulting from climate change are expected to disproportionately affect ectotherms given their biological function has a direct link to environmental temperature. Thus, as climate change leads to rapid increases in water temperatures in rivers, aquatic ectotherms, such as fish may be highly impacted. Organisms can respond to these stressors through flexible and rapid phenotypic change induced via developmental and/or transgenerational plasticity. In oviparous species, gravid females may translate environmental stress across generations via increased exposure of eggs to maternally derived glucocorticoids (i.e., maternal stress), which has been shown to result in diverse phenotypic effects in offspring. Recent studies suggest these phenotypic changes from maternal glucocorticoids may elicit predictive adaptive responses, where offspring exposed to maternal stress may be better prepared for the stressful environment they will encounter (i.e., environmental match hypothesis). We applied the environmental match hypothesis to examine whether a prenatal exogenous increase in egg cortisol may prepare Chinook salmon offspring (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to cope with thermal challenges after being reared in chronically elevated temperatures. Specifically, we exposed eggs to aqueous bath of cortisol-dosed (1,000 ng/mL) or control (0 ng/ml) solutions, and then raised both treatments at current (+0°C—contemporary ambient river temperature) or elevated (+3°C—projected future river temperature) thermal regimes. We quantified thermal performance in fish 7–9 month post fertilization using two methods: via critical thermal maximum (CTMax), and energetic responses (in plasma cortisol, glucose, and lactate) to environmentally relevant, but challenging thermal spikes over 3 days. Overall, we found that exposure to elevated rearing temperatures had a large impact on thermal tolerance, where elevated-temperature reared offspring had significantly higher CTMax. In comparison, egg cortisol treatment had little to no clear effects on CTMax and blood energetic response. Our study demonstrates the importance of elevated water temperatures as an inducer of offspring phenotypes (via early developmental cues), and highlights the significance of examining offspring performance in environments with ecologically relevant stressors. © Copyright © 2020 Warriner, Semeniuk, Pitcher, Heath and Love.

VL  - 224
SP  - 730-741
AB  - Concentrating solar power (CSP) plants convert solar energy to electricity and can be deployed with a thermal storage capability to shift electricity generation from time periods with available solar resource to those with high electricity demand or electricity price. Rigorous optimization of plant design and operational strategies can improve the market-competitiveness and commercial viability; however, such optimization may require hundreds of annual performance simulations, each of which can be computationally expensive when including considerations such as optimization of dispatch scheduling, sub-hourly time resolution, and stochastic effects due to uncertain weather or electricity price forecasts. This paper proposes a methodology to reduce the computational burden associated with simulation of electricity yield and revenue for CSP plants over a single- or multi-year period. Data-clustering techniques are employed to select a small number of limited-duration time blocks for simulation that, when appropriately weighted, can reproduce generation and revenue over a single year or within each year of a multi-year period. After selection of appropriate data features and weighting factors defining similarity between time-series profiles, the methodology captured annual revenue within 2.3%, 1.7%, or 1.2% using simulation of 10, 30, or 50 three-day exemplar time blocks, respectively, for each of three single-year location/weather/market scenarios and five plant configurations ranging from low to high solar multiple and storage capacity. When applied to multi-year datasets, the proposed methodology can capture inter-year variability that is unavailable from typical meteorological year (TMY) datasets while simultaneously requiring simulation of less than a single year of data. © 2021 International Solar Energy Society

TI  - The effect of untreated sewage discharge in food availability, egg production, and female survival of the copepod Acartia tonsa in a southwestern Atlantic estuary
VL  - 49
AB  - Estuarine copepods are considered ecological relevant components in the marine trophic webs and have high phenotypic plasticity and adaptability to face the environmental variations coastal marine ecosystems typically show. This work aims to assess the Acartia tonsa food availability, egg production, and female survival in an urban-industrial sewage discharge site (Canal Vieja, CV) and a non-disturbed site by sewage (Bahia del Medio, BM) from the Bahia Blanca Estuary, Argentina. Acartia tonsa females and microplankton samples, used as natural food, were taken during the austral warm season 2008-2009. The experimental incubations of the females were performed in a laboratory simulating the in situ environmental conditions. The microplankton showed different composition and abundance values between both studied sites. The survival of females showed significant differences between the sites, but the egg production did not show clear differences between them. A positive correlation was found among egg production, diatom, and tintinnid-ciliate abundances. A low female survival (16.5%) was observed when high ammonium concentrations (35.15 mu M) were recorded at CV. The concentration of nitrogenous nutrients, especially ammonium, along with pH and turbidity, were the drivers explaining the variation in the reproductive performance and survival of A. tonsa. Our findings further understand the reproductive performance, plasticity, and survival of key planktonic organisms in polluted coastal areas. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Stress-induced reproductive arrest in Drosophila occurs through ETH deficiency-mediated suppression of oogenesis and ovulation
VL  - 16
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Environmental stressors induce changes in endocrine state, leading to energy re-allocation from reproduction to survival. Female Drosophila melanogaster respond to thermal and nutrient stressors by arresting egg production through elevation of the steroid hormone ecdysone. However, the mechanisms through which this reproductive arrest occurs are not well understood. Results: Here we report that stress-induced elevation of ecdysone is accompanied by decreased levels of ecdysis triggering hormone (ETH). Depressed levels of circulating ETH lead to attenuated activity of its targets, including juvenile hormone-producing corpus allatum and, as we describe here for the first time, octopaminergic neurons of the oviduct. Elevation of steroid thereby results in arrested oogenesis, reduced octopaminergic input to the reproductive tract, and consequent suppression of ovulation. ETH mitigates heat or nutritional stress-induced attenuation of fecundity, which suggests that its deficiency is critical to reproductive adaptability. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that, as a dual regulator of octopamine and juvenile hormone release, ETH provides a link between stress-induced elevation of ecdysone levels and consequent reduction in fecundity. © 2018 Adams et al.

TI  - Carryover effects of temperature and pCO(2) across multiple Olympia oyster populations
VL  - 30
IS  - 3
AB  - Predicting how populations will respond to ocean change across generations is critical to effective conservation of marine species. One emerging factor is the influence of parental exposures on offspring phenotype, known as intergenerational carryover effects. Parental exposure may deliver beneficial or detrimental characteristics to offspring that can influence larval recruitment patterns, thus shaping how populations and community structure respond to ocean change. Impacts of adult exposure to elevated winter temperature and pCO2 on reproduction and offspring viability were examined in the Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) using three populations of adult, hatchery-reared O. lurida, plus an additional cohort spawned from one of the populations. Oysters were sequentially exposed to elevated temperature (+4°C, at 10°C), followed by elevated pCO2 (+2,204 μatm, at 3,045 μatm) during winter months. Male gametes were more developed after elevated temperature exposure and less developed after high pCO2 exposure, but there was no impact on female gametes or sex ratios. Oysters previously exposed to elevated winter temperature released larvae earlier, regardless of pCO2 exposure. Those exposed to elevated winter temperature as a sole treatment released more larvae on a daily basis but, when also exposed to high pCO2, there was no effect. These combined results indicate that elevated winter temperature accelerates O. lurida spermatogenesis, resulting in earlier larval release and increased production, with elevated pCO2 exposure negating effects of elevated temperature. Altered recruitment patterns may therefore follow warmer winters due to precocious spawning, but these effects may be masked by coincidental high pCO2. Offspring were reared in common conditions for 1 yr, then deployed for 3 months in four estuarine bays with distinct environmental conditions. Offspring of parents exposed to elevated pCO2 had higher survival rates in two of the four bays. This carryover effect demonstrates that parental conditions can have substantial ecologically relevant impacts that should be considered when predicting impacts of environmental change. Furthermore, Olympia oysters may be more resilient in certain environments when progenitors are pre-conditioned in stressful conditions. Combined with other recent studies, our work suggests that the Olympia may be more equipped than other oysters for the challenge of a changing ocean. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America

AB  - Particulate materials possessing dual functionalities have received tremendous investigations in many fields, owing to their superiority over mono-functional counterparts and their potential for process integration and intensification. This review focuses on bi-functional catalytic particles which also serve as sorbents/adsorbents or heat suppliers in the scheme of various thermo-chemical processes, enabling inherent separation or energy conservation within single-step operation. Bi-functional particles applied for integration of reaction and separation including sorption-enhanced hydrogen production and integrated capture and catalytic conversion processes are reviewed in detail, providing insights into material design and key performance indicators. On the other hand, bi-functional particles applied for integration of reaction and non-thermal radiation heating, including electrothermal and photothermal assisted heterogeneously catalyzed reactions, are also reviewed, with emphasis on the material property and energy efficiency improvement. These bi-functional particles show broad adaptability and feasibility in various reactions operated in integrated and intensified schemes, affording huge potentials for further improving productivity and efficiency in thermo-chemical processes. © 2021 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences

VL  - 646
SP  - 1045
AB  - Excessive temperatures tend to occur in dual clutch transmissions (DCTs) due to large amount of friction heat generated in the compact space, but seriously deteriorate shift quality and even reduce lifespans. In order to accurately obtain the DCT temperature in real-time, a four-parameter model is proposed to modify the previously studied static two-parameter model by introducing two dynamic coefficients. According to the deduction of energy balance equation based on a one-dimension assumption, the two dynamic coefficients are found to inherently change along with the friction heat and ambient temperature. Their changing rates constitute a four-parameter model. The new model is verified by dynamometer experiments, which show higher accuracy and better adaptability to working conditions than the static two-parameter model. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - Exploring the mechanisms of heat wave vulnerability at the urban scale based on the application of big data and artificial societies
VL  - 127
SP  - 573-583
AB  - Rapid urbanisation has altered the vulnerability of urban areas to heat wave disasters. There is an urgent need to identify the factors underlying the effect of heat waves on human health and the areas that are most vulnerable to heat waves. In this study, we plan to integrate indices associated with heat wave vulnerability based on meteorological observation data, remote sensing data and point of interest (POI) data; analyse the influence of urbanisation on the urban vulnerability environment; and explore the relationship between the vulnerability environment and heat-wave-related mortality. Finally, we attempt to map the spatial distribution of high heat-wave-related mortality risk based on the results of heat wave vulnerability study and artificial society. The results reveal that 1) there are differences in the influence of urbanisation on heat wave exposure, sensitivity and adaptability; 2) the exposure and sensitivity level effects on the lower limit of health impacts and the adaptability level effects on the upper limit of the health impact from heat wave in a given study area; and 3) areas vulnerable to the effects of heat waves are not confined to the city centre, which implies that residents living in suburban areas are also vulnerable to heat waves. Finally, this study not only explores the factors contributing to the impacts of heat waves but also describes the spatial distribution of the risk of disaster-associated mortality, thereby providing direct scientific guidance that can be used by cities to address heat wave disasters in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - MORE CROP PER DROP: THE MAGIC OF SWEET POTATO (Ipomoea batatas L.) †
VL  - 25
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Water is the most valuable resource in agriculture. Agricultural development in semi-arid eastern Kenya is essentially dependent on intermittent rainfall. An accurate estimate of sweet potato water usage and productivity is considered a significant feature of conservation agriculture under such climatic conditions. Methodology: The research was conducted for two seasons, from December 2018 to April 2019 and October 2019 to March 2020, with the aim of quantifying the water use efficiencies of two sweet potato varieties, Kabode and Bungoma. Assuming that there were no variations in water-use efficiency between the two varieties. The experiment was established as RCBD for the two seasons. Treatments comprised of sole sweet potato varieties of Kabode and Bungoma, together with their intercrops with common beans. Results: Seasonal effective rainfall values were 302 and 639.2 mm, whereas the mean saturation pressure deficit recorded was 2.5 and 2.4 Kpa for S (I) and S (II), respectively. This presented S(I) with 815.1 mm ETcrop demanding 622.1 mm irrigation water, whereas S(II) envisaged a 3.3% decrease in ETcrop values; 788 mm and requiring 427.6 mm of supplemental irrigation water to attain optimal sweet potato yields. Similarly, the test crops paraded WUE values of 39.8 and 30.0 kg ha-1 mm-1 and water productivity indices based on rain water were 1.11 and 0.95 kg m-3 for Kabode and Bungoma varieties, respectively. HI for S (I) were 40.8 and 35.4% whilst 54.2 and 46.8 % for Kabode and Bungoma varieties, respectively. Implications: WUE values of the sweet potato crop increased from warm-dry season S (I) to the warm-wet season S (II), as Kabode portrayed a higher adaptability. These results provide an acumen for decision making in the setting of climate change. Conclusions: Kabode variety differed significantly with Bungoma variety in their abilities to efficiently use water, thus portraying its adaptability in such a peculiar environment. The climatic environment: dew point temperatures and saturation pressure deficit had no significant impact on sweet potato water use efficiency. © 2022 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

Objective. To determine the agroclimatic adaptability of the maize crop for different agricultural regions of the Mato Grosso State, Brazil. Methodology. This work was developed at the State University of Mato Grosso (UNEMAT), on the dependences of the Centro Tecnológico de Geoprocessamento e Sensoriamento Remoto (CETEGEO-SR). A study was carried out on the adaptability of maize in the municipalities of Rondonópolis, Cuiabá, Tangará da Serra, Campo Novo do Parecis, Sorriso, and Sinop, in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil. The climatic variables of precipitation and air temperature, calculated on ten-day periods, were used for each municipality as provided by the Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (INMET). Based on the climatic requirements of the crop, the adaptability of maize during the year was classified. Results. The recommended sowing of the season maize in the municipalities is between the 30th and 33rd ten-day periods and for off-season maize it is between the 1st to 5th ten-day periods, without damage to the development, productivity, and crop harvest. All municipalities are considered suitable for growing maize with the average air temperature. Regarding precipitation, maize is classified as moderated by excess water for cultivation in the spring and summer periods. Implications. This study provides knowledge and technical recommendations on the use of water in the maize crop, as well as the correct sowing date and cultivation of this crop for the study region. Conclusion. The maize crop is suitable for cultivation in the municipalities studied, with recommended sowing between October to February. © 2021 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessment of productivity and adaptability of Camelina Sativa varieties
VL  - 341
AB  - The aim of this research is to assess the varieties of winter camelina in terms of productivity and adaptability in a contrast agroclimatic environment of the Middle Volga region and the region of steppe Crimea in 2016-2018. The climate of the Middle Volga region is moderately continental. The precipitation varies from 350 to 750 mm a year. The average year temperature is 5.3 °C. The climate of the steppe Crimea region is continental. The average year temperature here is 15.1 °C and the precipitation varies between 350 and 450 mm a year. In average the yield of different camelina varieties fluctuated between 1.59 and 1.83 t/ha, depending on the environment condition index (Ii -0.19-0.46). In the Penza region, the Kozir and Baron varieties gave the biggest yield with the productivity of crops equal to 1.80 and 1.83 t/ha respectively. In Crimea, the biggest yield was given by the Dikiy variety (1.74 t/ha). The variability of productivity is low at 7.4-10.1% and medium at 11.5-13.2%. The Baron variety has a low variation factor (7.4 and 11.5%) regardless of a cultivation region. All varieties had high stability which was 1.20-1.25 and 1.30-1.46 depending on a region. The Baron and Kozir varieties had the highest stability reaching 1.46 and 1.25 respectively. All varieties had a high index of stability for this crop, equal to 0.50-0.59. Camelina is tolerant of all stress factors and forms a stable yield in different cultivation conditions. All varieties showed a great ecological adaptivity and flexibility with the bi values equal to 1 and varying between 0.92-1.07. The most stable and flexible variety in the case of the Penza region is Baron (bi=0.92; σdr2=0.07) while in the region of Crimea it is Kozir (bi=0.99; σdr2=0.07). The Dikiy variety has high adaptivity parameters in both regions (bi=0.93-0.97; σdr2=0.06). The variance analysis showed that the share of "variety" factor influence is from 38.4% (the Penza region) to 39.2% (Crimea). In the variety-region relationship the influence of a variety is 40.6%. The share of "years" factor influence is 21.7-24.6%, depending on a region. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 11

AB  - Climate change is causing dramatic changes in global ocean temperature and salinity, threatening coral survival. Coral growth and metabolism are greatly affected by the temperature, salinity and feeding time of the environment. In order to explore the threats to coral survival caused by climate change, this study will investigate the changes in body composition, digestive enzymes and metabolism of G. columna at different temperatures and salinities. A maximum G. columna growth rate was observed at 25 °C and 30–35 psu salinity. The G. columna could survive in a wide salinity range of 25–40 psu. However, the maximum number and weight of G. columna polyps was determined at 30–35 psu. Furthermore, 30–35 psu salinity at 25 °C led to the best G. columna growth and survival, mainly because of their enhanced nutrient absorption rate, polyp expansion rate, metabolic rate and adaptability. Comparing various salinity-temperature treatment groups, all ob-tained values for growth, behavior and metabolism were significantly higher (p < 0.05) for 30 psu at 25 °C than other treatment groups resulting in maximum G. columna yield. In addition, the optimal timing of G. columna feeding was assessed by studying changes in body composition and digestive enzymes within 24 h of feeding. The results showed that G. columna has higher protein and protease activity between 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon. Therefore, at 25 °C, 30–35 psu and feeding will enhance G. columna growth and survival. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Influence of Season and External Morphology on Thermal Comfort and Physiological Responses in Bulls from Two Breeds Adapted to a Subtropical Climate
VL  - 22
SP  - 1-20
AB  - Animals in subtropical regions can be exposed to periods of thermal stress. Locally adapted breeds are especially important in this context, but these have little information available in their natural environments. The aim of this study was to assess whether season affects thermal comfort and physiological responses to increased temperatures of two breeds of bulls in a subtropical climate. Four Angus and four Crioulo Lageano bulls were used in this study. Body and testicles measurements, skin pigmentation and thickness, hair number, length and pigmentation, respiratory rate, panting score, rectal temperature and haematological profile were recorded on three occasions in summer and winter, morning and afternoon. The surface temperature of the flank, eye and scrotum were obtained by infrared thermography. Hair coat colour was determined by CIELAB method. Thermal comfort indexes were calculated from meteorological data. Statistical analysis included analyses of variance, correlations and a partial least squares regression in determining which traits were the most important in thermal adaptability. External morphology of the bulls was important for explaining physiological changes in both seasons, but their contribution was greater in summer. Bulls experienced moderate heat stress in summer, which led to significant physiological responses, which were more pronounced in Angus bulls. The main differences in thermal adaptation found between breeds were the hair coat characteristics and respiratory rate. Despite using different mechanisms to cope with environmental challenges, all bulls were able to maintain optimal testicular thermoregulation as well as systemic normothermia throughout the seasons, showing good adaptation to the climate conditions. © 2021.

TI  - Environmental predictability drives adaptive within- and transgenerational plasticity of heat tolerance across life stages and climatic regions
VL  - 35
IS  - 1
SP  - 153-166
AB  - Although environmental variability and predictability have been proposed as the underlying ecological context in which transgenerational plasticity (TGP) arises, the adaptive significance and interaction with within-generation plasticity (WGP) in such scenarios is still poorly understood. To investigate these questions, we considered the tolerance to upper thermal limits of larvae and adults of the desert endemic Drosophila mojavensis adapted to different climatic regions (Desert vs. Mediterranean climate). Thermal plasticity was investigated by acclimating parents and offspring at 36°C (vs. at 25°C). We then used historical temperature variation data from both regions to perform individual-based simulations by modelling expected components of adaptive plasticity in multiple life stages. Our results indicated that thermal response to ramping heat shocks was more pronounced in larvae, where acclimation treatments in parents and offspring increased their heat-shock performance, while heat knockdown in adults was only increased by offspring acclimation of adults. The relative contribution of WGP and TGP was greater for the population from the more thermally variable Sonoran Desert. Similarly, individual-based simulations of evolving maternal effects indicated that variation in tolerance to upper thermal limits across life stages and climates is expected from its adaptive significance in response to environmental predictability. Our approach offers a new perspective and interpretation of adaptive plasticity, demonstrating that environmental predictability can drive thermal responses across generations and life stages in a scenario with regional climate variability.

TI  - New exploration strategy in igneous petroliferous basins – Enlightenment from simulation experiments
VL  - 36
IS  - 4
SP  - 971-985
AB  - There are two kinds of relationships between magmatism and the generation of hydrocarbons from source rocks in petroliferous basins, namely: (1) simultaneous magmatism and hydrocarbon generation, and (2) magmatism that occurs after hydrocarbon generation. Although the influence of magmatism on hydrocarbon source rocks has been extensively studied, there has not been a systematic comparison between these two relationships and their influences on hydrocarbon generation. Here, we present an overview of the influence of magmatism on hydrocarbon generation based on the results of simulation experiments. These experiments indicate that the two relationships outlined above have different influences on the generation of hydrocarbons. Magmatism that occurred after hydrocarbon generation contributed deeply sourced hydrogen gas that improved liquid hydrocarbon productivity between the mature and overmature stages of maturation, increasing liquid hydrocarbon productivity to as much as 451.59% in the case of simulation temperatures of up to 450°C during modelling where no hydrogen gas was added. This relationship also increased the gaseous hydrocarbon generation ratio at temperatures up to 450°C, owing to the cracking of initially generated liquid hydrocarbons and the cracking of kerogen. Our simulation experiments suggest that gaseous hydrocarbons dominate total hydrocarbon generation ratios for overmature source rocks, resulting in a change in petroleum accumulation processes. This in turn suggests that different exploration strategies are warranted for the different relationships outlined above. For example, simultaneous magmatism and hydrocarbon generation in an area means that exploration should focus on targets likely to host large oilfields, whereas in areas with magmatism that post-dates hydrocarbon generation the exploration should focus on both oil and gas fields. In addition, exploration strategies in igneous petroliferous basins should focus on identifying high-quality reservoirs as well as determining the relationship between magmatism and initial hydrocarbon generation. © The Author(s) 2018.

TI  - Diapause in a tropical oil-collecting bee: Molecular basis unveiled by RNA-Seq
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Diapause is a natural phenomenon characterized by an arrest in development that ensures the survival of organisms under extreme environmental conditions. The process has been well documented in arthropods. However, its molecular basis has been mainly studied in species from temperate zones, leaving a knowledge gap of this phenomenon in tropical species. In the present study, the Neotropical and solitary bee Tetrapedia diversipes was employed as a model for investigating diapause in species from tropical zones. Being a bivoltine insect, Tetrapedia diversipes produce two generations of offspring per year. The first generation, normally born during the wet season, develops faster than individuals from the second generation, born after the dry season. Furthermore, it has been shown that the development of the progeny, of the second generation, is halted at the 5th larval instar, and remains in larval diapause during the dry season. Towards the goal of gaining a better understanding of the diapause phenomenon we compared the global gene expression pattern, in larvae, from both reproductive generations and during diapause. The results demonstrate that there are similarities in the observed gene expression patterns to those already described for temperate climate models, and also identify diapause-related genes that have not been previously reported in the literature. Results: The RNA-Seq analysis identified 2275 differentially expressed transcripts, of which 1167 were annotated. Of these genes, during diapause, 352 were upregulated and 815 were downregulated. According to their biological functions, these genes were categorized into the following groups: cellular detoxification, cytoskeleton, cuticle, sterol and lipid metabolism, cell cycle, heat shock proteins, immune response, circadian clock, and epigenetic control. Conclusion: Many of the identified genes have already been described as being related to diapause; however, new genes were discovered, for the first time, in this study. Among those, we highlight: Niemann-Pick type C1, NPC2 and Acyl-CoA binding protein homolog (all involved in ecdysteroid synthesis); RhoBTB2 and SASH1 (associated with cell cycle regulation) and Histone acetyltransferase KAT7 (related to epigenetic transcriptional regulation). The results presented here add important findings to the understanding of diapause in tropical species, thus increasing the comprehension of diapause-related molecular mechanisms. © 2018 The Author(s).

VL  - 30
IS  - 2
SP  - 224-230
AB  - Much scientific research dedicated to understanding the effects of freshwater salinization caused by road de-icing salts has utilized static exposures, with many tests conducted at winter or spring temperatures. While relevant for lentic ecosystems, pulsed patterns of salinity occur in lotic environments, particularly in summer months where precipitation can decrease elevated salinity levels caused by retention of residual salts. The current study aimed to evaluate the effects of pulsed patterns of salinity on the emergence, sex ratio, and fecundity of Chironomus dilutus over two generations of laboratory exposure. Three road de-icing salt treatments, including a control, modeled after environmental monitoring data of two local streams, were used to determine the ecological effects of periodic declines in salinity on C. dilutus at summer temperatures. No significant effects were observed on emergence success or sex ratios within or across generations, but fecundity of C. dilutus in the high salt treatment was reduced regardless of generation (P < 2e−16), possibly due to increased osmoregulatory stress caused by increased salinities. The intermediate and decreasing salinities may account for the lack of negative effects on emergence success and sex ratios by protecting sensitive life stages. More research is needed on long-term effects of reduced fecundity on population viability. The current study suggests more research using a similar experimental design is needed to fully evaluate the influence of road de-icing salts in lotic environments, as static laboratory exposures may not accurately reflect environmental changes in salinity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

TI  - A chromosome-level genome assembly provides insights into the environmental adaptability and outbreaks of Chlorops oryzae
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
AB  - A chromosome-level genome assembly for the rice pest, Chlorops oryzae, pinpoints molecular pathways that might contribute toward increased outbreaks for this important crop pest. Chlorops oryzae is a pest of rice that has caused severe damage to crops in major rice-growing areas in recent years. We generated a 447.60 Mb high-quality chromosome-level genome with contig and scaffold N50 values of 1.17 Mb and 117.57 Mb, respectively. Hi-C analysis anchored 93.22% scaffolds to 4 chromosomes. The relatively high expression level of Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) and antioxidant genes in response to thermal stress suggests these genes may play a role in the environmental adaptability of C. oryzae. The identification of multiple pathways that regulate reproductive development (juvenile hormone, 20-hydroxyecdsone, and insulin signaling pathways) provides evidence that these pathways also play an important role in vitellogenesis and thus insect population maintenance. These findings identify possible reasons for the increased frequency of outbreaks of C. oryzae in recent years. Our chromosome-level genome assembly may provide a basis for further genetic studies of C. oryzae, and promote the development of novel, sustainable strategies to control this pest.

TI  - Meta-analysis of 35 studies examining the effect of indoor temperature on office work performance
VL  - 203
AB  - Several relationships between air temperature and work performance have been published. We reanalysed the one developed in 2006 by Seppa center dot nen et al.; which is probably the best known. We found that even when significant, its prediction accuracy is very low (R2 = 0.05, MAE = 1.9%, RMSE = 3.1%). We consequently reviewed the literature and found 35 studies on the effects of temperature on office work performance. We used Seppa center dot nen et al.'s approach to normalise the data reported in these studies and explored the feasibility to develop a new relationship using regression models, models based on the Maximal Adaptability framework, and machine learning. We could not find a relationship between temperature and office work performance neither for the range of temperatures measured in most of the office buildings (20 degrees C-30 degrees C) or a wider range (18 degrees C-34 degrees C). Plausible reasons are discussed including the variety of methods used to assess performance, the multiple uncontrolled confounders, and the fact that temperature alone may not fully describe how the thermal environment affects building occupants. We do not recommend the use in practice of any of the models relating temperature to office work performance examined in the present study. The lack of relationships does not necessarily refute that temperature affects the performance of office work. Coordinated research predicated on a shared protocol enabling integrated analysis in the modelling of the relationships between the indoor thermal environment and office work performance is proposed to be carried out before using them in practice. We made the database opensource and developed an application for data exploring.

TI  - Experimental Analysis of Survival and Recovery of Ship Fouling Mussels During Transit Between Marine and Freshwaters
VL  - 8
AB  - Ships and boats may transport whole communities of non-indigenous species (NIS) through hull biofouling, some members of which may become invasive. Several studies have evaluated the diversity of these communities, but very few have analyzed the survival of organisms after their voyages into different and potentially inhospitable conditions. This factor is important to consider because the last port of call approach for risk assessments assumes that if the conditions observed in the last port of call are different from those observed in a receiving port, risks are diminished or null. Using an innovative experimental system, we tested the survival and recovery of the marine blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the freshwater zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) by exposing them to adverse salinity conditions at varying temperatures to simulate ships and boats transiting to ports or marinas with contrasting environmental conditions. Both mussel species, which are well-known for their adaptability to new environments as aquatic NIS, survived better at colder temperatures, with blue mussels surviving up to 14 days in freshwater, and zebra mussels up to 8 days in marine water. This highlights the importance of considering the resistance of fouling organisms to adverse conditions in vector and species risk assessments.

TI  - Impact of temperature on survival rate, fecundity, and feeding behavior of two aphids, aphis gossypii and acyrthosiphon gossypii, when reared on cotton
VL  - 12
IS  - 6
AB  - Simple Summary Understanding the effects of high temperature on pest insects is important in predicting their population dynamics. Aphis gossypii (Glover) and Acyrthosiphon gossypii (Mordviiko) are the two most destructive aphids on cotton in Xinjiang Province, China. This study examined the effect of different temperatures (29 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 35 degrees C) on the adult survival rate, fecundity, and feeding behavior of Ap. gossypii and Ac. gossypii. Our results showed that the adverse effects of high temperatures (32 degrees C, 35 degrees C) on aphid adult survival and fecundity were greater for Ac. gossypii than Ap. gossypii. Feeding data showed that Ac. gossypii spent more time feeding on xylem than phloem under all temperature treatments, which contrasted with Ap. gossypii. The time of phloem ingestion by Ap. gossypii at 32 degrees C was significantly higher than at 29 degrees C, while for Ac. gossypii, this value significantly decreased when temperature increased. These feeding patterns indicate that Ac. gossypii obtains less nutrition from phloem in support of its development and fecundity. Data generated in this study will serve as the basis for predicting the effect of increased temperature on these two cotton aphids. Aphid performance is sensitive to temperature changes. Previous studies found that Acyrthosiphon gossypii (Mordviiko) was more sensitive to high temperature than Aphis gossypii (Glover). However, the effects of high temperatures on the survival, fecundity, and feeding behavior of these two aphid adults are not clear. This study examined the effect of different temperatures (29 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 35 degrees C) on the adult survival rate, fecundity, and feeding behavior of these two aphid species. Our results showed that the adverse effects of high temperatures (32 degrees C and 35 degrees C) on aphid adult survival and fecundity were greater for Ac. gossypii than Ap. gossypii. The electrical penetration graph (EPG) data showed that Ac. gossypii spent more time feeding on xylem than phloem under all temperature treatments, which contrasted with Ap. gossypii. The time of phloem ingestion by Ap. gossypii at 32 degrees C was significantly higher than at 29 degrees C, while for Ac. gossypii, this value significantly decreased when temperature increased. These feeding patterns indicate that Ac. gossypii obtains less nutrition from phloem in support of its development and fecundity. Data generated in this study will serve as the basis for predicting the effects of increased temperature on these two cotton aphids.

TI  - Precise single base substitution in the shibire gene by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated homology directed repair in Bactrocera tryoni
VL  - 21
AB  - Background: Pest eradication using the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) involves high-density releases of sterilized males that mate with wild females and ultimately suppress the population. Sterilized females are not required for SIT and their removal or separation from males prior to release remains challenging. In order to develop genetic sexing strains (GSS), conditional traits such as temperature sensitive lethality are required. Results: Here we introduce a known Drosophila melanogaster temperature sensitive embryonic lethal mutation into Bactrocera tryoni, a serious horticultural pest in Australia. A non-synonymous point mutation in the D. melanogaster gene shibire causes embryonic lethality at 29 °C and we successfully used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to recreate the orthologous shibire temperature sensitive-1 (shits1) mutation in B. tryoni. Genotypic analyses over three generations revealed that a high fitness cost was associated with the shits1 mutant allele and shits1 homozygotes were not viable at 21 °C, which is a more severe phenotype than that documented in D. melanogaster. Conclusions: We have demonstrated the first successful use of CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce precise single base substitutions in an endogenous gene via homology-directed repair in an agricultural pest insect and this technology can be used to trial other conditional mutations for the ultimate aim of generating genetic sexing strains for SIT. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - Comprehensive assessment indicator of ecosystem resilience in central asia
VL  - 13
IS  - 2
AB  - The ecosystems in the arid inland areas of Central Asia are fragile and severely degraded. Understanding and assessing ecosystem resilience is a challenge facing ecosystems. Based on the net primary productivity (NPP) data estimated by the CASA model, this study conducted a quantitative analysis of the ecosystem’s resilience and comprehensively reflected its resilience from multiple dimensions. Furthermore, a comprehensive resilience index was constructed. The result showed that plain oasis’s ecosystem resilience is the highest, followed by deserts and mountainous areas. From the perspective of vegetation types, the highest resilience is artificial vegetation and the lowest is forest. In warm deserts, the resilience is higher in shrubs and meadows and lower in grassland vegetation. High coverage and biomass are not the same as the strong adaptability of the ecosystem. Moderate and slightly inelastic areas mainly dominate the ecosystem resilience of the study area. The new method is easy to use. The evaluation result is reliable. It can quantitatively analyze the resilience latitude and recovery rate, a beneficial improvement to the current ecosystem resilience evaluation. © 2021 by the authors.

VL  - 56
IS  - 4
SP  - 465-471
AB  - Here, we reared the loquat psyllid, Cacopsylla biwa Inoue (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) at different temperatures to examine the effects of temperature on their development. Cacopsylla biwa successfully developed in the 10–25 °C range, and the optimal temperature range from oviposition to adult emergence was 10–20 °C. The developmental zero (T0) and effective accumulative temperature (k) for the development of eggs and oviposition to adult emergence were 7.0 °C and 127°-days, and 6.5 °C and 521°-days, respectively. Based on these values, the number of annual generations of C. biwa in Tokushima prefecture in the 2016–2017 was estimated to be 7 without reproductive diapause, developmental delay due to high temperatures, and pre-oviposition period. We also conducted a field study to monitor the occurrence of C. biwa adult using yellow sticky traps. During the occurrence period of the 3rd–6th generations after summer diapause, the data estimated laboratory experiments were consistent with the observed data in the field. However, the occurrence periods of the 1st–2nd generation and the 7th generation could not be confirmed owing to unclear peaks of caught adults. Based on the findings of our rearing experiments, the low density observed in the field may have been due to developmental delays caused by high temperatures. © 2021, The Japanese Society of Applied Entomology and Zoology.

TI  - Effective production of sodium isobutyl xanthate using carbon disulfide as a solvent: Reaction kinetics, calorimetry and scale-up
VL  - 200
SP  - 444-453
AB  - Alkyl xanthates are by far the most widely used collectors in the froth flotation beneficiation of base metal sulfide and precious metal ores. However, the commercial xanthate production process suffers from low yield, low productivity, poor containment and environmental pollution. To address these issues, an effective method was developed for the synthesis of xanthates using carbon disulfide as both a reactant and the solvent. This study involved the optimization of various process parameters, including solvent dosage, temperature, caustic alkali particle size, and agitation speed, to intensify the conversion of sodium isobutyl xanthate (SIBX) and elucidate the reaction kinetics. The results indicated that carbon disulfide leads to a higher yield and better purity than solvents such as dichloromethane, petroleum ether, acetone, and water. Moreover, the addition of solvent allows the synthesis of high-purity xanthates by employing commercial grainy/sheet caustic soda as the raw material without further pulverization. The rate of the xanthation reaction was controlled by the rate of diffusion through the product layer, and the apparent activation energy was calculated to be 15 kJ.mol(-1). In addition, the thermal behavior of xanthate synthesis in a medium was monitored in a 2 L reaction calorimeter (RC1e) under the optimal conditions. Finally, a pilot-plant process was conducted in a 4000 L stainless-steel-jacketed reactor. The results demonstrated that xanthate production using excess carbon disulfide as a self-solvent gave excellent yield (>95%) and purity (>90%), whereas the kneader approach provided SIBX in only a 91% yield and 84% purity. Furthermore, this technology has widespread adaptability for the preparation of C-2 to C-8 xanthates. Compared with the traditional kneader approach, this new synthesis technology completely eliminates the required pulverization of caustic alkali, intensifies mass and heat transfer via the solvent, raises the productivity and improves the manufacturing environment, offering an effective and promising approach for the clean production of xanthates.

TI  - Cohort profile: the multigeneration Respiratory Health in Northern Europe, Spain and Australia (RHINESSA) cohort
VL  - 12
IS  - 6
AB  - Purpose The Respiratory Health in Northern Europe, Spain and Australia (RHINESSA) cohort was established to (1) investigate how exposures before conception and in previous generations influence health and disease, particularly allergies and respiratory health, (2) identify susceptible time windows and (3) explore underlying mechanisms. The ultimate aim is to facilitate efficient intervention strategies targeting multiple generations. Participants RHINESSA includes study participants of multiple generations from ten study centres in Norway (1), Denmark (1), Sweden (3), Iceland (1), Estonia (1), Spain (2) and Australia (1). The RHINESSA core cohort, adult offspring generation 3 (G3), was first investigated in 2014-17 in a questionnaire study (N=8818, age 18-53 years) and a clinical study (subsample, n=1405). Their G2 parents participated in the population-based cohorts, European Community Respiratory Heath Survey and Respiratory Health In Northern Europe, followed since the early 1990s when they were 20-44 years old, at 8-10 years intervals. Study protocols are harmonised across generations. Findings to date Collected data include spirometry, skin prick tests, exhaled nitric oxide, anthropometrics, bioimpedance, blood pressure; questionnaire/interview data on respiratory/general/reproductive health, indoor/outdoor environment, smoking, occupation, general characteristics and lifestyle; biobanked blood, urine, gingival fluid, skin swabs; measured specific and total IgE, DNA methylation, sex hormones and oral microbiome. Research results suggest that parental environment years before conception, in particular, father's exposures such as smoking and overweight, may be of key importance for asthma and lung function, and that there is an important susceptibility window in male prepuberty. Statistical analyses developed to approach causal inference suggest that these associations may be causal. DNA methylation studies suggest a mechanism for transfer of father's exposures to offspring health and disease through impact on offspring DNA methylation. Future plans Follow-up is planned at 5-8 years intervals, first in 2021-2023. Linkage with health registries contributes to follow-up of the cohort. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

TI  - High temperature mortality of Wolbachia impacts the sex ratio of the parasitoid Ooencyrtus mirus (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae)
VL  - 10
AB  - Background. Wolbachia bacteria are estimated to occur in more than half of all insect species. In Hymenoptera, Wolbachia often manipulates its host’s reproduction to its own advantage. Wolbachia is likely the reason that males are rare in the uniparental Ooencyrtus mirus Triapitsyn &amp; Power (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae). The likelihood of producing male offspring can be increased by giving mothers a continuous supply of Bagrada hilaris (Burmeister) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) host eggs to parasitize for 2–3 weeks, by feeding the parents antibiotics, or by rearing parent wasps at high temperatures; all variables that have been shown to correlate with depleting Wolbachia titers in other organisms. The purpose of the current study was to determine whether thelytoky in O. mirus is due to Wolbachia, and if so, at what time in development the sex change occurs. We also wished to determine if Wolbachia removal results in the production of intersexes, as in some other hymenopterans. Finally, mating behavior was observed to see if and where it breaks down as a result of the species becoming thelytokous. Methods. Females were collected from parental lines of O. mirus reared at 26, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and 36 ◦C. The offspring of these females were reared at 26 ◦C, and their sex-ratio was determined. In a subsequent experiment, the parental generation was switched between 26 ◦C and 36 ◦C during development to narrow down the critical period at which changes occurred that subsequently affected the sex-ratio of their offspring. Results. The sex ratio was male biased in the offspring of O. mirus parents reared at 34 ◦C and 36 ◦C (high temperatures), even if the offspring themselves were reared at 26 ◦C. The constant temperature at which the percentage of males started to increase after two generations was 31 ◦C (10% males), rising to 39% males at 33 ◦C, and 100% males at 34 ◦C and 36 ◦C. Lasting more than 2 days, the critical period for the change toward a male biased sex ratio was during the second half of the parent’s development. Molecular diagnostic assays confirmed that O. mirus females contain Wolbachia and males do not. Examination of preserved males and male-female pairs under a dissecting microscope showed no signs of intersex characters. Observation of the mating behavior of live O. mirus showed that males initiate courtship by drumming their antennae on a female’s antennae, but after a few seconds, the females typically turn and walk away. However, a few instances of possible copulation were noted. Conclusions. As hypothesized, the results indicated that thelytoky in O. mirus is likely mediated by Wolbachia bacteria. To maximize the population growth rate without generating males, the best temperature for mass rearing this species is 30 ◦C. Copyright 2022 Power et al.

TI  - A neritic species in a hypersaline lagoon; population structure of Acartia fancetti in relation to hyperhaline and thermal stresses
VL  - 498
SP  - 8-15
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity and adaptation are common traits of organisms living in highly dynamic and changing,environments. Several copepod species, especially estuarine dwelling species, have demonstrated high phenotypic plasticity and adaptability to variations in environmental conditions. Copepods play a critical role in aquatic foodwebs and their population structure is closely linked to water quality fluctuations, especially salinity and temperature. However, few studies have examined the response of population structure to environmental stress. Here, we examine the population structure, egg production and hatching success of Acartia fancetti in relation to hypersalinity (30, 40, 50 and 60) and temperature (15 degrees C and 20 degrees C). A. fancetti is a neritic species occupying a key niche in the hypersaline areas of the Coorong, South Australia. Our results show a significant influence of salinity and temperature on the population size, nauplii production, copepodites production and adults of A. fancetti. The maximum numbers of nauplii, copepodites and adults were at salinity 30 and 40, at both 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C. However, substantial population sizes were also observed at salinity 50 and 60 in 15 degrees C treatments. At 20 degrees C, no individual was observed at salinity 60. This study indicates that the population of A. fancetti in the Coorong is tolerant to hypersalinity at lower temperatures, but the combined effects of haline and thermal stress significantly reduces the ability of this species to survive at higher temperatures. The distribution of A. fancetti in the Coorong is also affected by the environmental change related to anthropogenic activities.

TI  - Intraspecific growth response to drought of abies alba in the southeastern carpathians
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
AB  - The intensity and frequency of drought have increased considerably during the last decades in southeastern Europe, and projected scenarios suggest that southern and central Europe will be affected by more drought events by the end of the 21st century. In this context, assessing the intraspecific genetic variation of forest tree species and identifying populations expected to be best adapted to future climate conditions is essential for increasing forest productivity and adaptability. Using a tree-ring database from 60 populations of 38-year-old silver fir (Abies alba) in five trial sites established across Romania, we studied the variation of growth and wood characteristics, provenancespecific response to drought, and climate-growth relationships during the period 1997–2018. The drought response of provenances was determined by four drought parameters: resistance, recovery, resilience, and relative resilience. Based on the standardized precipitation index, ten years with extreme and severe drought were identified for all trial sites. Considerable differences in radial growth, wood characteristics, and drought response parameters among silver fir provenances have been found. The provenances’ ranking by resistance, recovery, and resilience revealed that a number of provenances from Bulgaria, Italy, Romania, and Czech Republic placed in the top ranks in almost all sites. Additionally, there are provenances that combine high productivity and drought tolerance. The correlations between drought parameters and wood characters are positive, the most significant correlations being obtained between radial growth and resilience. Correlations between drought parameters and wood density were non-significant, indicating that wood density cannot be used as indicator of drought sensitivity. The negative correlations between radial growth and temperature during the growing season and the positive correlations with precipitation suggest that warming and water deficit could have a negative impact on silver fir growth in climatic marginal sites. Silvicultural practices and adaptive management should rely on selection and planting of forest reproductive material with high drought resilience in current and future reforestation programs. © 2021 by the authors.

VL  - 122
SP  - 26-31
AB  - The anode material is vital to improve the power generation of a microbial fuel cell (MFC). In this study, a carbon nanotube (CNT)-coated sponge with macro-porous structure, high surface area, and high conductivity was constructed as an anode to encapsulate Escherichia coli K12 (E. coli K12) cells. To achieve high power generation of the MFC, the optimal concentration of the CNT coating the sponge was found to be 30 mg mL−1. At this concentration, a maximum power density of 787 W m−3 and a chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of 80.9% were obtained with a long stable electricity generation process in batch mode. This indicates that the biofilm on the CNT (30 mg mL−1)-coated sponge possessed excellent electroactivity and stability. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images confirmed that the CNT-coated sponge provided a suitable microenvironment for E. coli K12 cells to maintain their attachment and colonization. Additionally, a CNT-dependent viability phenomenon of the E. coli K12 cells was discovered after electricity generation. This CNT-dependent viability of the E. coli K12 cells was stable and sustainable after storage at −20 °C in a milk tube for one year. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

SP  - 251-272
AB  - Ocean warming and acidification are major climate change stressors for marine invertebrate larvae, and their impacts differ between habitats and regions. In many regions species with pelagic propagules are on the move, exhibiting poleward trends as temperatures rise and ocean currents change. Larval sensitivity to warming varies among species, influencing their invasive potential. Broadly distributed species with wide developmental thermotolerances appear best able to avail of the new opportunities provided by warming. Ocean acidification is a multi-stressor in itself and the impacts of its covarying stressors differ among taxa. Increased pCO2 is the key stressor impairing calcification in echinoid larvae while decreased mineral saturation is more important for calcification in bivalve larvae. Non-feeding, non-calcifying larvae appear more resilient to warming and acidification. Some species may be able to persist through acclimatization/adaptation to produce resilient offspring. Understanding the capacity for adaptation/acclimatization across generations is important to predicting the future species composition of marine communities. © Oxford University Press 2018.

TI  - Isotopic filtering reveals high sensitivity of planktic calcifiers to Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum warming and acidification
VL  - 119
IS  - 9
AB  - Ocean warming and acidification driven by anthropogenic carbon emissions pose an existential threat to marine calcifying communities. A similar perturbation to global carbon cycling and ocean chemistry occurred ∼56 Ma during the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), but microfossil records of the marine biotic response are distorted by sediment mixing. Here, we use the carbon isotope excursion marking the PETM to distinguish planktic foraminifer shells calcified during the PETM from those calcified prior to the event and then isotopically filter anachronous specimens from the PETM microfossil assemblages. We find that nearly one-half of foraminifer shells in a deep-sea PETM record from the central Pacific (Ocean Drilling Program Site 865) are reworked contaminants. Contrary to previous interpretations, corrected assemblages reveal a transient but significant decrease in tropical planktic foraminifer diversity at this open-ocean site during the PETM. The decrease in local diversity was caused by extirpation of shallow- and deep-dwelling taxa as they underwent extratropical migrations in response to heat stress, with one prominent lineage showing signs of impaired calcification possibly due to ocean acidification. An absence of subbotinids in the corrected assemblages suggests that ocean deoxygenation may have rendered thermocline depths uninhabitable for some deeper-dwelling taxa. Latitudinal range shifts provided a rapid-response survival mechanism for tropical planktic foraminifers during the PETM, but the rapidity of ocean warming and acidification projected for the coming centuries will likely strain the adaptability of these resilient calcifiers. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Transgenerational epigenetic sex determination: Environment experienced by female fish affects offspring sex ratio
VL  - 277
AB  - Sex determination is a complex process that can be influenced by environment in various taxa. Disturbed environments can affect population sex ratios and thus threaten their viability. Emerging evidences support a role of epigenetic mechanisms, notably DNA methylation, in environmental sex determination (ESD). In this work, using zebrafish as model and a transgenerational experiment comprising 4 successive generations, we report a strength link between the promotor methylation level of three genes in female gonads and population sex ratio. One generation of zebrafish was exposed throughout its lifetime to cadmium (Cd), a non-essential metal, at an environmentally relevant concentration. The subsequent generations were not exposed. At the first and the third generation a subset of individuals was exposed to an elevated temperature, a well-known masculinizing factor in zebrafish. While heat was associated to an increase in the methylation level of cyp19a1a gene and population masculinization, foxl2a/dmrt1 methylation levels appeared to be influenced by Cd and fish density leading to offspring feminization. Ancestral Cd exposure indeed led to a progressive feminization of the population over generations and affected the sex plastic response of zebrafish in response to heat. The effect of Cd on the methylation level of foxl2a was observed until the third generation, supporting potential transgenerational inheritance. Our results support (i) a key role of cyp19a1a methylation in SD in zebrafish in response to environmental cues and (ii) the fact that the environment experienced by parents, namely mothers in the present case, can affect their offspring sex ratio via environment-induced DNA methylation changes in gonads. Pollution experienced by female fish transgenerationally affects the sex of their offspring via gonadal DNA methylation changes, leading to an increasingly biased sex ratio over generations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Soft electronics have garnered considerable attention as a promising alternative to conventional electronics with fixed shapes and sizes because of their facile and intimate shape-adaptability to complex operating environments. Their practical applications, however, have been plagued by limited maneuverability, which predominantly stemmed from tethered electrical cords or rigid/bulky power sources. Here, we present light-triggered autonomous shape-reconfigurable and locomotive rechargeable power sources (SL-PSs), in which quasi-solid-state supercapacitors (SCs) are monolithically integrated with thermoresponsive liquid crystalline polymer networks (LCNs) substrates using a device-customized printing process. The SCs are designed to enable photothermal effect as well as adjustable capacitive storage. The LCNs are synthesized to provide thermomechanical deformation by programmable anisotropic molecular contract/expansion. Upon exposure to light or heat, the SL-PSs exhibit autonomous and reversible shape-morphing within a few seconds without impairing their electrochemical performance. Moreover, the SL-PSs convey a model cargo through photothermal stimuli-induced wire-crawling and simultaneously transfer their on-board stored electrical energy, demonstrating their potential viability as an untethered soft robotic power source. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Polymorphic diversity, such as elytra patterns of insects, is regarded as an external phenotypic characteristic driven by both genetics and environmental pleiotropy. The multicolored Asian ladybird, Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), both an efficient natural enemy of herbivores and an invasive species with a worldwide distribution, shows a multitude of elytral patterns and strong environmental adaptability. Some studies have documented differences of ecological adaptability among H. axyridis morphotypes, but none compared their predatory performance under differing environmental conditions, to further understand the evolutionary significance of elytral pattern diversity. We evaluated predation (number of prey consumed per time unit) on three different herbivores by melanic/succinic and male/female adults of H. axyridis, under different temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35°C). and photoperiods (4:20, 8:16, 12:12, 16:8, 20:4). We found significant differences in prey consumed by the predator between gender and polymorphic types, including under comparable environment parameters. Furthermore, there were also significant differences in predation when temperature and photoperiod regimes varied. Our results hinted a high plasticity in prey consumption relative to polymorphic type and gender in H. axyridis. These findings could be informative for developing further biological control programs relying on H. axyridis, notably for optimizing the effectiveness of predator releases according to polymorph to be used and environment targeted. © 2019 E.

TI  - Assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems to climate change based on climate exposure, vegetation stability and productivity
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Global warming has brought many negative impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, which makes the vulnerability of ecosystems one of the hot issues in current ecological research. Here, we proposed an assessment method based on the IPCC definition of vulnerability. The exposure to future climate was characterized using a moisture index (MI) that integrates the effects of temperature and precipitation. Vegetation stability, defined as the proportion of intact natural vegetation that remains unchanged under changing climate, was used together with vegetation productivity trend to represent the sensitivity and adaptability of ecosystems. Using this method, we evaluated the vulnerability of ecosystems in Southwestern China under two future representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) with MC2 dynamic global vegetation model. Results: (1) Future (2017–2100) climate change will leave 7.4% (under RCP 4.5) and 57.4% of (under RCP 8.5) of areas under high or very high vulnerable climate exposure; (2) in terms of vegetation stability, nearly 45% of the study area will show high or very high vulnerability under both RCPs. Beside the impacts of human disturbance on natural vegetation coverage (vegetation intactness), climate change will cause obvious latitudinal movements in vegetation distribution, but the direction of movements under two RCPs were opposite due to the difference in water availability; (3) vegetation productivity in most areas will generally increase and remain a low vulnerability in the future; (4) an assessment based on the above three aspects together indicated that future climate change will generally have an adverse impact on all ecosystems in Southwestern China, with non-vulnerable areas account for only about 3% of the study area under both RCPs. However, compared with RCP 4.5, the areas with mid- and high-vulnerability under RCP 8.5 scenario increased by 13% and 16%, respectively. Conclusion: Analyses of future climate exposure and projected vegetation distribution indicate widespread vulnerability of ecosystems in Southwestern China, while vegetation productivity in most areas will show an increasing trend to the end of twenty-first century. Based on new climate indicators and improved vulnerability assessment rules, our method provides an extra option for a more comprehensive evaluation of ecosystem vulnerability, and should be further tested at larger spatial scales in order to provide references for regional, or even global, ecosystem conservation works. © 2020, The Author(s).

VL  - 2020
IS  - 6
AB  - Background: Predicting the effects of climate warming on the dynamics of ecological systems requires understanding how temperature influences birth rates, death rates and the strength of species interactions. The temperature dependance of these processes—which are the underlying mechanisms of ecological dynamics—is often thought to be exponential or unimodal, generally supported by short-term experiments. However, ecological dynamics unfold over many generations. Our goal was to empirically document shifts in predator–prey cycles over the full range of temperatures that can possibly support a predator–prey system and then to uncover the effect of temperature on the underlying mechanisms driving those changes. Methods: We measured the population dynamics of the Didinium-Paramecium predator–prey system across a wide range of temperatures to reveal systematic changes in the dynamics of the system. We then used ordinary differential equation fitting to estimate parameters of a model describing the dynamics, and used these estimates to assess the long-term temperature dependance of all the underlying mechanisms. Results: We found that predator–prey cycles shrank in state space from colder to hotter temperatures and that both cycle period and amplitude varied with temperature. Model parameters showed mostly unimodal responses to temperature, with one parameter (predator mortality) increasing monotonically with temperature and one parameter (predator conversion efficiency) invariant with temperature. Our results indicate that temperature can have profound, systematic effects on ecological dynamics, and these can arise through diverse and simultaneous changes in multiple underlying mechanisms. Predicting the effects of temperature on ecological dynamics may require additional investigation into how the underlying drivers of population dynamics respond to temperature beyond a short-term, acute response.

TI  - A dual-mode novel Parabolic Trough Collector for process heating applications in small scale industries—Thermo-hydraulic and performance investigation
VL  - 218
AB  - Only a few industries worldwide use solar heat for industrial processes, despite the fact that it is a proven and cleaner solution. More over, Small-scale industries need hot water and low-enthalpy steam, but such systems receive scant attention due to the active nature of Parabolic Trough Collectors as well as the use of less efficient flat plate technology in this temperature range. This delineate the opportunity for research focus in efficient passive technologies especially in low temperature range. In this regard a novel dual mode Parabolic Trough Collector based on an Open Natural Circulation Loop (PTC-ONCL) is proposed here. Focus of this work is to assess the proposed system's suitability for process heating applications requiring hot water/low enthalpy steam, especially in rural areas. Experiments are conducted on an in-house prototype. A novel methodology for correlating actual solar data to the input heat load for the in-house test facility is developed. Five representative solar days are considered for individual tests. Startup, transient, and efficiency parameters are evaluated. Productivity, industrial viability, and environmental impact are also accessed. Throughout the test, the loop maintained a stable flow, where the start-up oscillations, thermal oscillations and type-I instabilities are observed. The system operates at an unprecedented efficiency of 72 ± 4% in hot water mode and 70 ± 5% in Steam generation over a 7 h period. The economic analysis shows an ambitious Levelized Cost of Heat of 2.8 cents/kWh, with a payback period of 3.21 years. Moreover environmental study shows its huge potential in reducing the CO2 emissions. A dimensionless index is proposed to represent the solar day and is correlated to predict the average water temperature and steam generated with RMSE values of 0.98 °C and 0.125 kg respectively. The solar day index comprehends the total irradiation, wind velocity and the ambient temperature. The proposed PTC-ONCL system is capable of producing an annual average of 8.67 kgday−1 and/or 150 L of hot water at an average temperature of 89.07 °C. The results, and the system's low cost and near-maintenance-free nature demonstrates its capability in the desired application, both technologically and economically. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 184
AB  - The availability, adaptability, reliability and productivity of modern industrial complexes, maintenance costs, energy costs and industrial production costs depend also on the intensity of wear of the elements of tribo-mechanical systems. Gear cutting operations are usually a bottleneck of production, especially in higher types of production. Therefore, the necessity of researching the process of gear cutting by hob milling is obvious. In the paper a part of the results related to the possibility of direct measurement of the temperature in a very complex process of gear cutting of cylindrical gears by hob milling is given. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.

TI  - Partners in mischief: Functional networks of heat shock proteins of Plasmodium falciparum and their influence on parasite virulence
VL  - 9
IS  - 7
AB  - The survival of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum under the physiologically distinct environments associated with their development in the cold-blooded invertebrate mosquito vectors and the warm-blooded vertebrate human host requires a genome that caters to adaptability. To this end, a robust stress response system coupled to an efficient protein quality control system are essential features of the parasite. Heat shock proteins constitute the main molecular chaperone system of the cell, accounting for approximately two percent of the malaria genome. Some heat shock proteins of parasites constitute a large part (5%) of the ‘exportome’ (parasite proteins that are exported to the infected host erythrocyte) that modify the host cell, promoting its cyto-adherence. In light of their importance in protein folding and refolding, and thus the survival of the parasite, heat shock proteins of P. falciparum have been a major subject of study. Emerging evidence points to their role not only being cyto-protection of the parasite, as they are also implicated in regulating parasite virulence. In undertaking their roles, heat shock proteins operate in networks that involve not only partners of parasite origin, but also potentially functionally associate with human proteins to facilitate parasite survival and pathogenicity. This review seeks to highlight these interplays and their roles in parasite pathogenicity. We further discuss the prospects of targeting the parasite heat shock protein network towards the developments of alternative antimalarial chemotherapies. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Sustained Drought, but Not Short-Term Warming, Alters the Gut Microbiomes of Wild Anolis Lizards
VL  - 88
IS  - 19
SP  - e0053022
AB  - As rising temperatures threaten biodiversity across the globe, tropical ectotherms are thought to be particularly vulnerable due to their narrow thermal tolerance ranges. Nevertheless, physiology-based models highlighting the vulnerability of tropical organisms rarely consider the contributions of their gut microbiota, even though microbiomes influence numerous host traits, including thermal tolerance. We combined field and lab experiments to understand the response of the slender anole lizard (Anolis apletophallus) gut microbiome to climatic shifts of various magnitude and duration. First, to examine the effects of long-term climate warming in the wild, we transplanted lizards from the mainland Panama to a series of warmer islands in the Panama Canal and compared their gut microbiome compositions after three generations of divergence. Next, we mimicked the effects of a short-term "heat-wave" by using a greenhouse experiment and explored the link between gut microbiome composition and lizard thermal physiology. Finally, we examined variation in gut microbiomes in our mainland population in the years both before and after a naturally occurring drought. Our results suggest that slender anole microbiomes are surprisingly resilient to short-term warming. However, both the taxonomic and predicted functional compositions of the gut microbiome varied by sampling year across all sites, suggesting that the drought may have had a regional effect. We provide evidence that short-term heat waves may not substantially affect the gut microbiota, while more sustained climate anomalies may have effects at broad geographic scales. IMPORTANCE As climate change progresses, it is crucial to understand how animals will respond to shifts in their local environments. One component of this response involves changes in the microbial communities living in and on host organisms. These "microbiomes" can affect many processes that contribute to host health and survival, yet few studies have measured changes in the microbiomes of wild organisms experiencing novel climatic conditions. We examined the effects of shifting climates on the gut microbiome of the slender anole lizard (Anolis apletophallus) by using a combination of field and laboratory studies, including transplants to warm islands in the Panama Canal. We found that slender anole microbiomes remain stable in response to short-term warming but may be sensitive to sustained climate anomalies, such as droughts. We discuss the significance of these findings for a species that is considered highly vulnerable to climate change. As climate change progresses, it is crucial to understand how animals will respond to shifts in their local environments. One component of this response involves changes in the microbial communities living in and on host organisms.

AB  - Insect neuropeptides play an important role in regulating physiological functions such as growth, development, behavior and reproduction. We identified temperature-sensitive neuropeptides and receptor genes of the cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. We identified 38 neuropeptide precursor genes and 35 neuropeptide receptors and constructed a phylogenetic tree using additional data from other insects. As temperature adaptability enables B. tabaci to colonize a diversity of habitats, we performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction with two temperature stresses (low = 4 °C and high = 40 °C) to screen for temperature-sensitive neuropeptides. We found many neuropeptides and receptors that may be involved in the temperature adaptability of B. tabaci. This study is the first to identify B. tabaci neuropeptides and their receptors, and it will help to reveal the roles of neuropeptides in temperature adaptation of B. tabaci. © 2020 The Authors.

VL  - 43
AB  - The increasing fossil energy demand and carbon emissions pose a significant challenge to the world. According to climate adaptability design, the balcony is open type in Changsha. The study evaluates the energy-saving potential and the economic and environmental feasibility of installing the balcony in living rooms, and considering the effect of balcony orientations and air conditioning types. The economic viability is analyzed using the construction cost of the balcony and the extra market price of a residence with a balcony paid by the holder, respectively. Environmental feasibility assessment mainly adopts the CO2 emission payback period as the index. The annual electricity saving percentage of the split-type air conditioner in the living rooms facing four orientations with a balcony is in between 6.7% and 12.3%. And the balcony's investment payback period facing east or west orientation is less than 50 years based on construction cost. It has better environmental benefits with the CO2 emission payback period of the balcony facing four orientations is in between 10.4 and 24.6 years. Considering a living room constructed with a balcony, it is not feasible for dwellers to use a gas boiler, adopting the radiant floor system during the heating from the perspective of economic and CO2 emission. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Assessing vulnerability of agriculture system to climate change in the SAARC region
VL  - 5
AB  - Agriculture production is primarily influenced by human-induced management interventions whereas climate plays an important role. Climate change with increasing global carbon dioxide concentration and changes in temperature, precipitation and other climatic parameters play a significant role in influencing agriculture productivity. The assessment of the vulnerability of agriculture production under the influence of climate change can be done using process-based vegetation models. We assessed the vulnerability of agriculture production for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations comprising of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka using the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) model. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) was simulated under the forcing of climatic variables of the climate change scenarios of representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, 4.5 & 8.5) for the year 2050 using JULES. JULES is a process-based model that simulates fluxes of carbon, energy, and momentum between the atmosphere, land surface, and water to estimate the productivity of a system. The sensitivity was calculated as the inter-annual dispersion from the average NPP of assessment period 2016 to 2050, whereas adaptive capacity was calculated as the slope of productivity regressed over the assessment period. The vulnerability was calculated by subtracting the values of adaptability from sensitivity. The JULES simulated NPP was also compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS 17A) derived NPP for the period 2000–2014. The simulated NPP had a decreasing trend under projected climate change scenarios of 2050 for all the SAARC nations compared to recent years average of 2000–2014. The analysis reveals that one-third of the SAARC region is highly sensitive under low to moderate emission scenarios, while it was observed that under high emission scenarios the sensitivity would reduce with increased vulnerability. We observed that the vulnerability of the system is not alone influenced by sensitivity and any change in adaptive capacity or resilience would also impact the overall vulnerability of the system. © 2021

SP  - 95-100
AB  - In this study, the quality and reproductive success of wild Black Sea Trout (Salmo trutta labrax) were investigated. In total 32 wild trout (27.3 +/- 13.6 g and 13.9 +/- 2.3 cm) from the Bicki Stream in Kocaeli Province in the Marmara Region were kept in circular fiberglass outdoor flow-through tanks (1.5m empty set) at the mean water temperature of 11.8 +/- 4.5 degrees C. In November 2016, when the water temperature was 8.4 degrees C, the first spawning of wild trout occurred. Sperm volume (ml), Motility (%) and VCL (mu m/sec) values were determined to be 7.5 +/- 2.5, 70.42 +/- 0.83 and 70.35 +/- 3.98, respectively. The weight (g), total fecundity and egg diameter (mm) values of female fish were listed to be 513.75 +/- 78, 1.171 +/- 171, and 3.84 +/- 0.02, respectively. In the experiment, 5.859 wild Black sea trout eggs were fertilized. The eyed-egg stage occurred 24 days (288 day-degree) post fertilization and the survival rate from fertilization to the eyed-stage was 28%. Wild Black Sea trout larvae from P1 (Paternal Generation) hatched 48 days after fertilization with the hatching rate of 7%.

SP  - 126-132
AB  - The optimal variety choice for each specific region is one of the main factors influencing the productivity increase and improving the quality of the table and seed potato. It is necessary to cultivate varieties that combine the maximum adaptability to abiotic environmental factors and high field resistance or immunity to various phytopathogens. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify varieties and hybrid material of potatoes of various genetic and geographical origin with high resistance to high air temperatures and insufficient moisture. The research was conducted during April and May 2021 at the laboratory of biotechnology of agricultural plants of the Samara Scientific Research Agriculture Institute named after N. M. Tulaykov – branch of the SamSC RAS, Bezenchuk vil., Russia. The maximum average productivity was characterized by medium-early varieties Krasa Meschery (32.3 t/ha), Debut (27.8 t/ha) and Sudarynya (26.2 t/ha) and medium-ripe varieties Utro (29.4 t/ha), Siversky (32.2 t/ha) and Alaska (31.0 t/ha). It is shown that in conditions of arid climate, medium-early and medium-ripe potato varieties with genotypes of intensive and neutral type have an advantage in yield over varieties of other varieties. The interrelation of morphological features of the aboveground part of the potato plant with the yield of tubers is established. It is shown that in conditions of high air temperature and insufficient humidification, varieties with a high rate of green mass growth in the period from 50 to 60 days from planting and with a high number of stems per plant can have an advantage. he obtained results can be used in breeding work for heat resistance and drought resistance for a quick preliminary assessment of a significant amount of hybrid potato material at the initial stages of the breeding process, as well as one of the stages of a comprehensive study of new varieties. © 2022, Gaurav Society of Agricultural Research Information Centre.

VL  - 10
IS  - 10
SP  - 1-11
AB  - Systematic cryo‐banking of semen and testicular tissues is critical to preserve the genetic value of recently deceased or neutered black‐footed ferrets (BFFs). Specifically, recovering or producing mature sperm cells from vitrified‐warmed issues offers additional options in assisted reproduction. This could, in turn, enhance the genetic management of this rare and endangered species over multiple generations. The objective of the study was to evaluate structural properties, DNA fragmentation, cell viability, and germ cell composition in vitrified testicular tissues from BFFs directly after warming or after warming plus a short in vitro culture period. Tissue biopsies from five adult BFFs were either kept fresh or vitrified with a standard protocol (using dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and glycerol) and warmed at 50 °C for 5 s. Some of the warmed samples were then cultured in vitro for 24 h. Fresh, warmed, and warmed/cultured tissues were analyzed using different indicators: histology of seminiferous tubules, intact Sertoli cells (vimentin labeling), DNA integrity, cell viability, germ cell composition (Oct4 and Boule labeling). Percentages of intact seminiferous tubules decreased after vitrification/warming and returned to the level of fresh samples after culture. While percentages of cells labeled with vimentin, with intact DNA integrity, or proportions of viable cells were affected by vitrification/warming, they all reached similar or better levels than the fresh tissue after culture. Proportions of cells labeled with Boule antibodies also improved during in vitro culture post‐warming. We demonstrated for the first time that BFF testes subjected to vitrification, rapid warming, and short in vitro culture were viable and maintained the ability to resume germ cell progression. Cryopreserved testicular tissues could potentially contribute to new strategies to enhance BFF assisted reproduction as well as conservation efforts. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Effect of long-term temperature stress on the intestinal microbiome of an invasive snail
VL  - 13
AB  - The gut microbiome is vital to the physiological and biochemical functions of the host, and changes in the composition of these microbial communities may affect growth and adaptability to the environment. Pomacea canaliculata is an invasive freshwater snail which has become a serious agricultural pest. Temperature adaptation is considered an important reason for the widespread distribution of this species. To date, the contribution of the gut microbes to host fitness of P. canaliculata during long-term temperature stress is not well understood. In this study, the morphological changes and intestinal microbiome of P. canaliculata under long-term stress at low temperature (15°C) and high temperature (35°C) were investigated with laboratory experiments. Compared with control group (25°C), the alpha diversity increased and pathogenic bacteria enriched changed under high and low temperature stress. The effect of high temperature stress on the intestinal microbiome of P. canaliculata was more significant than that of low temperature stress. A sustained high temperature environment led to an increase in the abundance of pathogenic bacteria, such as Aeromonas and Enterobacter, and a decrease in the abundance of immune-related bacteria such as Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Lactococcus. These intestine microbiome changes can increase the risk of diseases like intestinal inflammation, and lead to more deaths at high temperature environments. In addition, with the extension of stress time from 14 to 28 days, the beneficial bacteria such as Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Lactococcus were significantly enriched, while potential pathogenic bacteria such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Shivalella, and Flavobacterium decreased, suggesting that intestinal microbiota may play an important role in host response to heat stress. These results are consistent with previously reported results that the survival rate of both male and female P. canaliculata no longer significantly reduced after 21 days of high temperature stress, suggesting that the surviving P. canaliculata had gradually adapted to high temperature environments under long-term high temperature stress.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis reveals the molecular mechanisms of heterosis on thermal resistance in hybrid abalone
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Heterosis has been exploited for decades in different animals and crops due to it resulting in dramatic increases in yield and adaptability. Hybridization is a classical breeding method that can effectively improve the genetic characteristics of organisms through heterosis. Abalone has become an increasingly economically important aquaculture resource with high commercial value. However, due to changing climate, abalone is now facing serious threats of high temperature in summer. Interspecific hybrid abalone (Haliotis gigantea ♀ × H. discus hannai ♂, SD) has been cultured at large scale in southern China and has been shown high survival rates under heat stress in summer. Therefore, SD has become a good model material for heterosis research, but the molecular basis of heterosis remains elusive. Results: Heterosis in thermal tolerance of SD was verified through Arrhenius break temperatures (ABT) of cardiac performance in this study. Then RNA-Sequencing was conducted to obtain gene expression patterns and alternative splicing events at control temperature (20 °C) and heat stress temperature (30 °C). A total of 356 (317 genes), 476 (435genes), and 876 (726 genes) significantly diverged alternative splicing events were identified in H. discus hannai (DD), H. gigantea (SS), and SD in response to heat stress, respectively. In the heat stress groups, 93.37% (20,512 of 21,969) of the expressed genes showed non-additive expression patterns, and over-dominance expression patterns of genes account for the highest proportion (40.15%). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the overlapping genes among common DEGs and NAGs were significantly enriched in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, mitophagy, and NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, we found that among these overlap genes, 39 genes had undergone alternative splicing events in SD. These pathways and genes may play an important role in the thermal resistance of hybrid abalone. Conclusion: More alternative splicing events and non-additive expressed genes were detected in hybrid under heat stress and this may contribute to its thermal heterosis. These results might provide clues as to how hybrid abalone has a better physiological regulation ability than its parents under heat stress, to increase our understanding of heterosis in abalone. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Mapping Heat-Health Vulnerability Based on Remote Sensing: A Case Study in Karachi
VL  - 14
IS  - 7
AB  - As a result of global climate change, the frequency and intensity of heat waves have increased significantly. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), extreme temperatures in southwestern Pakistan have exceeded 54 °C in successive years. The identification and assessment of heat-health vulnerability (HHV) are important for controlling heat-related diseases and mortality. At present, heat waves have many definitions. To better describe the heat wave mortality risk, we redefine the heat wave by regarding the most frequent temperature (MFT) as the minimum temperature threshold for HHV for the first time. In addition, different indicators that serve as relevant evaluation factors of exposure, sensitivity and adaptability are selected to conduct a kilometre-level HHV assessment. The hesitant analytic hierarchy process (H-AHP) method is used to evaluate each index weight. Finally, we incorporate the weights into the data layers to es-tablish the final HHV assessment model. The vulnerability in the study area is divided into five levels, high, middle-high, medium, middle-low and low, with proportions of 3.06%, 46.55%, 41.85%, 8.53% and 0%, respectively. Health facilities and urbanization were found to provide advantages for vulnerability reduction. Our study improved the resolution to describe the spatial heterogeneity of HHV, which provided a reference for more detailed model construction. It can help local government formulate more targeted control measures to reduce morbidity and mortality during heat waves. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

SP  - 153-164
AB  - We estimated thermal developmental thresholds (T0) and degree-day (DD) constants for the immature stages of two tephritid pests, Bactrocera zonata (Saunders) and Ceratitis capitata (Weidenmann). Males of both species were trapped in an Egyptian guava orchard during the fruiting seasons of 2016 and 2017 and trap catches were compared with peak flights predicted by the DD model based on local weather data. Ceratitis capitata had faster development than B. zonata at 20 and 25 °C, but their overall developmental rate was similar at 30 and 35 °C. The thermal threshold of development (T0) of B. zonata was higher than that of C. capitata, indicating greater sensitivity to cold. Although 35 °C yielded the fastest development of both species, survival was higher at 30 °C, with B. zonata experiencing a slight advantage, suggesting better tropical adaptation. Immature development of B. zonata and C. capitata was estimated to require 338 and 373 d, respectively, and 616 and 424 DD for a complete generation. Trap catches over both seasons showed good correspondence to peaks of fly activity predicted by the DD models; deviations from expectation ranged from 0 to 7 d for both fly species. Both species had four overlapping generations per season, with B. zonata abundance peaking in the first generation in both years, but only in 2016 for C. capitata. The models predict about eight and 12 generations per year in northeast Egypt for B. zonata and C. capitata, respectively. These models should be useful for timing pest control measures to coincide with periods of peak fly activity in fruit orchards. © 2020 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

TI  - Whales in warming water: Assessing breeding habitat diversity and adaptability in Oceania's changing climate
VL  - 25
IS  - 4
SP  - 1466-1481
AB  - In the context of a changing climate, understanding the environmental drivers of marine megafauna distribution is important for conservation success. The extent of humpback whale breeding habitats and the impact of temperature variation on their availability are both unknown. We used 19 years of dedicated survey data from seven countries and territories of Oceania (1,376 survey days), to investigate humpback whale breeding habitat diversity and adaptability to climate change. At a fine scale (1 km resolution), seabed topography was identified as an important influence on humpback whale distribution. The shallowest waters close to shore or in lagoons were favored, although humpback whales also showed flexible habitat use patterns with respect to shallow offshore features such as seamounts. At a coarse scale (1° resolution), humpback whale breeding habitats in Oceania spanned a thermal range of 22.3–27.8°C in August, with interannual variation up to 2.0°C. Within this range, both fine and coarse scale analyses of humpback whale distribution suggested local responses to temperature. Notably, the most detailed dataset was available from New Caledonia (774 survey days, 1996–2017), where encounter rates showed a negative relationship to sea surface temperature, but were not related to the El Niño Southern Oscillation or the Antarctic Oscillation from previous summer, a proxy for feeding conditions that may impact breeding patterns. Many breeding sites that are currently occupied are predicted to become unsuitably warm for this species (>28°C) by the end of the 21st century. Based on modeled ecological relationships, there are suitable habitats for relocation in archipelagos and seamounts of southern Oceania. Although distribution shifts might be restrained by philopatry, the apparent plasticity of humpback whale habitat use patterns and the extent of suitable habitats support an adaptive capacity to ocean warming in Oceania breeding grounds. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Alterations in amino acid metabolism during growth by Staphylococcus aureus following exposure to H2O2 – A multifactorial approach
VL  - 4
IS  - 5
AB  - Temperature and pH are known to vary in a wound site due to the immune response and subsequent healing processes. This study used a multifactorial design to examine the cellular responses of Staphylococcus aureus to hydrogen peroxide (0–100 mM) when bacteria were grown in temperatures of 37 ± 2 °C and pH 7 ± 1, conditions potentially encountered in wound sites. A centroid sample was included in the design which represented the mid-point values of all three environmental parameters (37 °C, pH 7, 50 mM H2O2). Cytoplasmic extracts and corresponding medium supernatants were analysed for amino acid composition by gas chromatography. Exposures of S. aureus to H2O2 during the inoculation process resulted in extended lag phases lasting well after the peroxide had been neutralised by the bacterium's antioxidant systems, after which the bacteria eventually resumed growth at equivalent rates to the controls. Even though the subsequent growth rates appeared normal, the cells exhibited a variant metabolic regime at the mid-exponential phase of growth as a result of the initial exposure to peroxide. The alterations in metabolism were reflected by the differential amino acid profiles measured in the cytoplasmic extracts (P &lt; 0.0001). The data indicated that the metabolic responses to H2O2 challenge were uniquely different depending on the variations of temperature and pH. The uptake patterns of amino acids from the media also altered depending on prevailing environmental conditions. From these results, it was proposed that a specific reproducible homeostasis could be induced under a specific set of defined environmental conditions. It was also evident that early toxic insults on the bacterial culture could have lasting impacts on cellular homeostasis after successive generations, even after the offending chemical had been removed and initial cell integrity restored. It was concluded that metabolic homeostasis would be continually adjusting and responding to changing environmental conditions to deploy defensive proteins as well as optimising processes for survival. The powerful ability to continually and rapidly adapt to the environment may represent the key feature supporting the virulence of S. aureus as an opportunistic pathogen invading the wound site. © 2018 The Authors

TI  - Oviposition behavior and biological aspects of Ceraeochrysa cincta (Schneider, 1851) (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) over successive generations
AB  - Green lacewings (Neuroptera: Chryspidae) are insects broadly distributed worldwide that are associated with various crops and pests and an important group of predators, therefore, mass rearing of these insects for subsequent release in the field depends on a better understanding on the biological cycle and behavior of the predators. This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics of population development and oviposition of Ceraeochrysa cincta (Schneider, 1851) in successive generations. Three generations of C. cincta, comprising 15 random couples maintained under stable conditions of temperature (25 ± 1℃), relative humidity (70 ± 10%), and photoperiod (12 L:12D), were used. The period of pre-oviposition and the number and viability of the eggs were evaluated every 24 h throughout the lifespan of the females and the biological characteristics were evaluated using fertility life table. The results revealed that oviposition of eggs without peduncle occurs in C. cincta species tend to start earlier as the generations increases and that these non-pedunculated eggs are infertility. The fertility life table demonstrated higher R0, rm and λ values and lower T and TD values for the first generation. It can be concluded that as the number of generations increases the oviposition behavior and the development of the C. cincta population is affected. © 2022, African Association of Insect Scientists.

TI  - 3-Hydroxybutyrate Derived from Poly-3-Hydroxybutyrate Mobilization Alleviates Protein Aggregation in Heat-Stressed Herbaspirillum seropedicae SmR1
VL  - 86
IS  - 17
AB  - Under conditions of carbon starvation or thermal, osmotic, or oxidative shock, mutants affected in the synthesis or mobilization of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) are known to survive less well. It is still unclear if the synthesis and accumulation of PHB are sufficient to protect bacteria against stress conditions or if the stored PHB has to be mobilized. Here, we demonstrated that mobilization of PHB in Herbaspirillum seropedicae SmR1 was heat-shock activated at 45°C. In situ proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (i.e., 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance) showed that heat shock increased amounts of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) only in H. seropedicae strains able to synthesize and mobilize PHB. H. seropedicae SmR1 mutants unable to synthesize or mobilize PHB were more susceptible to heat shock and survived less well than the parental strain. When 100 mM 3-hydroxybutyrate was added to the medium, the ΔphaC1 strain (an H. seropedicae mutant unable to synthesize PHB) and the double mutant with deletion of both phaZ1 and phaZ2 (i.e., ΔphaZ1.2) (unable to mobilize PHB) showed partial rescue of heat adaptability (from 0% survival without 3HB to 40% of the initial viable population). Addition of 200 mM 3HB before the imposition of heat shock reduced protein aggregation to 15% in the ΔphaC1 mutant and 12% in the ΔphaZ1.2 mutant. We conclude that H. seropedicae SmR1 is naturally protected by 3HB released by PHB mobilization, while mutants unable to generate large amounts of 3HB under heat shock conditions are less able to cope with heat damage. IMPORTANCE Bacteria are subject to abrupt changes in environmental conditions affecting their growth, requiring rapid adaptation. Increasing the concentration of some metabolites can protect bacteria from hostile conditions that lead to protein denaturation and precipitation, as well as damage to plasma membranes. In this work, we demonstrated that under thermal shock, the bacterium Herbaspirillum seropedicae depolymerized its intracellular stock polymer known as poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), rapidly increasing the concentration of 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and decreasing protein precipitation by thermal denaturation. Mutant H. seropedicae strains unable to produce or depolymerize PHB suffered irreparable damage during thermal shock, resulting in fast death when incubated at 45°C. Our results will contribute to the development of bacteria better adapted to high temperatures found either in natural conditions or in industrial processes. In the case of H. seropedicae and other bacteria that interact beneficially with plants, the understanding of PHB metabolism can be decisive for the development of more-competitive strains and their application as biofertilizers in agriculture. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - To understand mechanisms of crop adaptability to various previous crop croppings, evaluate crop performance on the croppings, and identify suitable crop combinations for rotation of major crops in the cold and arid region of Northern China. A five-year field experiment was conducted using five crops from 2015 to 2019, including potato (Solanum tuberosum), faba bean (Vicia faba), forage maize (Zea mays), oat (Avena sativa), and beet (Beta vulgarwas). Yields of potato, oat, and beet in rotation were 1.30-1.68, 1.28-1.48, and 1.25-1.48 times of those in continuous cropping of single crops, respectively. Yield of faba bean on beet cropping was 10.58% lower than that of continuous faba bean while yield of forage maize on oat or beet stubble was 9.10%-15.42% lower than that of continuous forage maize. The LERr of 10 crop combinations was 1.09-1.68, indicating positive effects of rotation. Combinations of oat → potato, beet → potato, forage maize → potato and faba bean → potato had higher LERr, indicating faba bean and forage maize might be more durable of continuous cropping. In terms of productivity, suitable crop combinations for rotation in the area were oat → potato, beet → potato, forage maize → potato, faba bean → potato and oat → beet. © 2020, Science Press.

TI  - Fabrication of High-Performance Silver Mesh for Transparent Glass Heaters via Electric-Field-Driven Microscale 3D Printing and UV-Assisted Microtransfer
VL  - 31
IS  - 32
AB  - Great challenges remain concerning the cost-effective manufacture of high-performance metal meshes for transparent glass heaters (TGHs). Here, a high-performance silver mesh fabrication technique is proposed for TGHs using electric-field-driven microscale 3D printing and a UV-assisted microtransfer process. The results show a more optimal trade-off in sheet resistance (Rs = 0.21 Ω sq−1) and transmittance (T = 93.9%) than for indium tin oxide (ITO) and ITO substitutes. The fabricated representative TGH also exhibits homogeneous and stable heating performance, remarkable environmental adaptability (constant Rs for 90 days), superior mechanical robustness (Rs increase of only 0.04 in harsh conditions–sonication at 100 °C), and strong adhesion force with a negligible increase in Rs (2–12%) after 100 peeling tests. The practical viability of this TGH is successfully demonstrated with a deicing test (ice cube: 21 cm3, melting time: 78 s, voltage and glass thickness: 4 V, 5 mm). All of these advantages of the TGHs are attributed to the successful fabrication of silver meshes with high resolution and high aspect ratio on the glass substrate using the thick film silver paste. The proposed technique is a promising new tool for the inexpensive fabrication of high-performance TGHs. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

TI  - Feasibility study on direct flame impingement heating applied for the solution heat treatment, forming and cold die quenching technique
VL  - 36
SP  - 398-404
AB  - The solution heat treatment, forming and cold die quenching (HFQ) process has been developed and adopted for forming high strength complex-shaped components of light alloys in the automotive industry. In order to exploit and increase the competitiveness of this technology, production cycle time and manufacturing costs need to be reduced to enable high productivity and energy efficiency. This can be realised by reducing the cycle time for heating a metallic sheet to its solution heat treatment temperature during the HFQ process, and by decreasing post ageing time. Rapid heating methods are capable of providing a solution to be integrated into this novel forming technique of HFQ. This paper presents feasibility study on the adoption of the direct flame impingement (DFI) heating method that has a high potential for non-ferrous blanks to achieve higher heating rate in HFQ processes, compared to convection heating in a conventional furnace. The adaptability of DFI heating for HFQ process has been validated, in terms of capability of high heating rate, quality of surface layer examination and lap-shear strength measurement of bonded samples. © 2018

VL  - 49

SP  - 89-95
AB  - There is accumulating evidence to show that environmental stressors can regulate a variety of phenotypes in descendants through germline-mediated epigenetic inheritance. Studies of model organisms exposed to environmental cues (e.g., diet, heat stress, toxins) indicate that altered DNA methylations, histone modifications, or non-coding RNAs in the germ cells are responsible for the transgenerational effects. In addition, it has also become evident that maternal provision could provide a mechanism for the transgenerational inheritance of stress adaptations that result from ancestral environmental cues. However, how the signal of environmentally-induced stress response transmits from the soma to the germline, which may influence offspring fitness, remains largely elusive. Small RNAs could serve as signaling molecules that transmit between tissues and even across generations. Furthermore, a recent study revealed that neuronal mitochondria! perturbations induce a transgenerational induction of the mitochondria! unfolded protein response mediated by a Wnt-dependent increase in mitochondria! DNA levels. Here, we review recent work on the molecular mechanism by which parental experience can affect future generations and the importance of soma-to-germline signaling for transgenerational inheritance.

TI  - Differences in Early Season Emergence and Reproductive Activity Between Spathius agrili (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and Spathius galinae, Larval Parasitoids of the Invasive Emerald Ash Borer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae)
VL  - 49
IS  - 2
SP  - 334-341
AB  - Both Spathius agrili Yang and Spathius galinae Belokobylskij and Strazanac are host-specific parasitic wasps introduced for biological control of emerald ash borer in North America. Spathius agrili is native to northeastern China and S. galinae comes from a more northern, colder climate in the Russian Far East. Their origin may lead to differing abilities to adapt to climate and their host in North America. We conducted both field and laboratory experiments to determine the timing of early season emergence and synchronization of each parasitoid species to their host in the United States, and if manipulating prerelease conditions could affect emergence time. A cold acclimatization treatment prior to parasitoid emergence was assessed and compared with untreated control group reared with standard rearing protocols. Stands of naturally emerald ash borer-infested ash were sampled at two locations in Virginia throughout the experiment to determine when the parasitoid-susceptible life stage (third to fourth instar) occurred. Untreated S. galinae emerged approximately 2 wk earlier than any other cohort, whereas cold acclimatized S. galinae emerged later than any other cohort. Emergence time of S. agrili was unaffected by cold acclimatization. Cold acclimatization treatment did not affect the parasitism rate of either species, nor did it have multigenerational effects. Emergence time of the subsequent generation of S. agrili was delayed by cold acclimatization treatment, whereas S. galinae experienced no multigenerational effects. At Virginia field sites, susceptible EAB larvae were present during the emergence time of all four groups of parasitoids. Untreated S. galinae had the least overlap with any susceptible EAB larvae. © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America.

TI  - Assessment of pupal mortality in Hypena opulenta: An obstacle for establishment of a classical biological control agent against invasive swallow-worts
VL  - 47
IS  - 4
SP  - 527-535
AB  - Common obstacles for establishment of newly-introduced biological control agents include climate and the activity of native antagonists. In temperate climates, these obstacles can disproportionately affect overwintering life-stages because they are exposed to low winter temperatures, and may rely on passive defence from predators. We conducted a series of field exposure experiments with predator-exclusion treatments, in Ontario, Canada, to identify mortality factors for the pupae of Hypena opulenta, a biological control agent for invasive swallow-worts in North America. During two winters, predation rates in containers with large holes, that enabled predation, were relatively low (mean: 23.75%) but non-predation mortality in closed containers was high (mean: 66.25%), particularly during the colder of the two winters (87.5% vs. 52.5%). During the summer, non-predation mortality in closed containers was low (mean: 7.5%) but predation rates in containers with large holes were higher than during the winter (mean: 53.33%), increasing as the summer progressed. Predation in containers with large holes was 70% during late summer, compared with 25% during the spring. Across all seasons, pupal predation was dominated by large non-arthropod predators. Hypena opulenta can complete 2 generations per year. Photoperiods that induce diapause occur earlier in the introduced range than in the native range, however, and H. opulenta individuals in parts of the introduced range are likely to enter diapause early after a single generation. Our results highlight additional vulnerabilities encountered by such individuals, and can contribute to models predicting population dynamics of H. opulenta across its introduced range. © 2022 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

TI  - Sustainable Production of Acrylic Acid via 3-Hydroxypropionic Acid from Lignocellulosic Biomass
VL  - 9
IS  - 49
SP  - 16659-16669
AB  - Lignocellulosic biomass is a promising renewable feedstock for the sustainable manufacturing of biofuels and bioproducts. Among emerging bioproducts, 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is of particular interest as a platform chemical to produce commercially significant chemicals such as acrylic acid. In this study, BioSTEAM-an open-source platform-was leveraged to design, simulate, and evaluate (via techno-economic analysis, TEA, and life cycle assessment, LCA) biorefineries producing acrylic acid via fermentation of sugars (glucose and xylose) to 3-HP. The biorefinery could produce acrylic acid with a minimum product selling price (MPSP) of $1.72-2.08·kg-1 (5th-95th percentiles; baseline at $1.83·kg-1). Advancements in key technological parameters (fermentation yield, titer, and saccharification solids loading) could greatly enhance the biorefinery's performance (MPSP of $1.29-1.52·kg-1 with ∼88% probability of market-competitiveness, a global warming potential of 3.00 [2.53-3.38] kg CO2-eq·kg-1, and a fossil energy consumption of 39.9 [31.6-45.1] MJ·kg-1). A quantitative sustainable design framework was used to explore alternative fermentation regimes (neutral/low-pH fermentation across titer, yield, and productivity combinations) and alternative feedstocks (first/second-generation feedstocks across price and sugar/carbohydrate content). Overall, this research highlights the ability of agile TEA-LCA to screen promising biorefinery designs, navigate sustainability trade-offs, prioritize research needs, and establish a roadmap for the continued development of bioproducts and biofuels. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Automated mobile sensing: Towards high-granularity agile indoor environmental quality monitoring
VL  - 127
SP  - 268-276
AB  - Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is a critical aspect of the built environment to ensure occupant health, comfort, well-being and productivity. Existing IEQ monitoring approaches rely on sensor networks deployed at selected locations to collect environmental measurements, and are limited in scale and adaptability due to infrastructure cost and maintenance requirement. To enable high-granularity IEQ monitoring with agile adaption to the dynamic indoor environment, we propose an “automated mobile sensing” system that dispatches a sensor-rich navigation-capable robot to actively survey the indoor space. Data collected in this fashion is sparse in the joint temporal and spatial domain, and cannot be used directly for IEQ evaluation. To deal with this special characteristics, we developed a spatio-temporal interpolation algorithm to capture the global trend and local variation in order to use the data efficiently to reconstruct the IEQ dynamics. We compared the performance of the automated mobile sensing with a dense sensor network in a laboratory where we measured the air-change effectiveness (ASHRAE standard 129) for four different conditions. Results indicate that automated mobile sensing is able to accurately estimate the parameters with a minimal sensor cost and calibration effort. Potential applications of this system include indoor thermal comfort, lighting, indoor air quality and acoustic monitoring, pollutant source identification, and building commissioning. We shared publicly the source codes for robot control, sensor setup, and interpolation algorithm to encourage comparison study and further development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In order to solve the problems of poor quality of roasted products, low productivity, high energy consumption and serious environmental pollution induced by traditional iron ore magnetization roasting technology and equipment, an innovative suspended magnetization roasting process of preheating-heat-retaining reduction-reoxida-tion was proposed. The process has the characteristics of wide adaptability of raw materials, homogeneity of roasted products, high iron recovery, low production energy consumption and less pollution emissions, and is suitable for the treatment of hematite, limonite, siderite and their mixed refractory iron ores. A series of key technologies such as the flow control of heterogeneous ore powders in suspension, low temperature heat-retaining reduction, precise phase transformation control of iron minerals and simultaneous recovery of heat have been developed. Meanwhile, a demonstration project of efficient beneficiation of refractory iron ores based on suspended magnetization roasting with a throughput of 500kg/h was completed. Currently, the process has achieved an industrial application of 1. 65 million t/a in Jiuquan Iron and Steel (Group) Co., Ltd., which will provide a demonstration for the efficient use of refractory iron ores. © 2019 Gangtie Yanjiu Xuebao.

VL  - 45

SP  - 801-813
AB  - Aquatic pathogens are a major concern for fish hatchery production, fisheries management, and conservation, and disease control needs to be addressed. Two important salmonid pathogens are Myxobolus cerebralis and Flavobacterium psychrophilum that cause whirling disease and bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD), respectively. Innate disease resistance is a potential option for reducing disease-related mortality in hatchery-reared rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, Walbaum). Two experiments were conducted to assess pathogen resistance of first-generation (F1) rainbow trout created by crossing M. cerebralis- and F. psychrophilum-resistant strains. In the first experiment, we exposed two rainbow trout strains and one F1 cross to six treatments: control (no exposure), mock injection, F. psychrophilum only, M. cerebralis only, F. psychrophilum then M. cerebralis, and M. cerebralis then F. psychrophilum. Results indicated that the F1 cross was not resistant to either pathogen. In the second experiment, we exposed five rainbow trout strains and four rainbow trout crosses to F. psychrophilum. The second experiment indicated that at least one rainbow trout cross was F. psychrophilum-resistant. Achieving dual resistance may be possible using selective breeding but only some multigenerational strains are suitable candidates for further evaluation. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Heritability of animal individuality in fish: Distribution, behavior, metabolism and stress response
VL  - 536
AB  - Animal individuality is proposed to describe individual differences in behavior. Individuals may exhibit consistent differences in behavioral traits within a population, and these traits are heritable. It has also been known that animal individuality can be attributed to both genetic and environmental effects. We previously observed the presence of bold individuals (BI) and shy individuals (SI) in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). However, the individuality distribution and the behavioral phenotype of offspring with different individualities remain unclear. In this study, the temperature and acidity challenges of larvae at 25 days-post-hatch (DPH) and juvenile (50 DPH) of bold and shy flounder offspring were investigated at pH = 7.3, 7.7, 8.1 and temperature at 4, 18, 28 °C. On 25 DPH, bold offspring (BO) showed higher survival rates with acidity at pH = 7.3 and 4 °C challenge. Three behavioral phenotypes (bold, middle and shy individuals, BI, MI and SI) were observed in both juvenile (8 MPH) bold and shy flounder offspring. The percentage of SI offspring from the shy maternal line (SS) was higher than BI offspring from the bold maternal line (BB) (0.75 vs. 0.58). BI from both BO (BB) and SO (SB) were more motivated to feed and active during net confinement than SI (BS and SS). Furthermore, BB and SB exhibited higher metabolic rates and actively responded to predator stressor, while BS and SS showed a divergent tendency. However, the metabolism of the offspring seemed to be partially affected by their maternal line. Taken together, our study indicates that screening of animal individuality in population would improve animal welfare and increase the output efficiency of flounder in aquaculture. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Temperature affects transition timing and phenotype between key developmental stages in white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus yolk-sac larvae
VL  - 103
IS  - 9
SP  - 1149-1162
AB  - Temperature differentially influences developmental trajectories of traits during early life stages that can affect survival and recruitment. Experiments were conducted to quantify temperature-induced developmental responses of White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) yolk-sac larvae (YSL) reared at temperatures encountered across the species' range (12.5, 14.0, 15.5, and 17.0 degrees C). We quantified effects of temperature on timing of transitions between sequential developmental stages from hatch to initiation of exogenous feeding. Rate of development significantly increased at warmer compared to cooler temperatures; no significant difference was observed between 15.5 and 17.0 degrees C or 12.5 and 14.0 degrees C. When standardized by relative timing of development (RTi), developmental rate was not significantly different among treatments. Morphological traits (total length; body area; yolk-sac area; head area; gill filament area; mouth area; pectoral fin area) were measured daily, though only data for YSL reared at 12.5 and 17.0 degrees C was used to quantify phenotypic variation. Morphological traits (excluding yolk-sac area) were generally larger 48+ hours post hatch for YSL reared at 17. 0 degrees C compared to 12.5 degrees C. In contrast, these same traits, with the exception of gill filament area, were larger in 12.5 degrees C reared YSL when considered as a function of developmental stage. These opposing results suggest trade-offs associated with allocating resources to a particular trait depended on rearing temperature. Our results provide the ability to estimate timing of critical early life stages (i.e., hatch, emergence) as a function of temperature which is an important management tool to understand how early life development contributes to recruitment processes and adaptability in thermally altered systems.

AB  - The blade cylinder root is a key component connecting the blade and pitch bearing of a wind turbine and is 20% of the blade’s manufacturing cost. Blade cylinder roots are manufactured using the open die forging method with steel alloy. However the blade cylinder root for 750 KW class wind turbine is manufactured using AA5083 cast material to reduce weight. The purpose of this study is to develop a hot open die forging method, through experiment and FEA, using AA5083 material manufactured by continuous casting. The forging process was designed using the mandrel forging method. Hot compression tests were conducted to obtain flow stress of cast microstructure at different temperatures and strain rates. Control parameters of each forging process were analyzed/compared to predict adaptability of the mandrel forging process. High productivity, good internal quality, shapes, and dimension were verified by prototypes manufactured by the proposed forging process. Copyright © The Korean Society for Precision Engineering

AB  - The viscoelastic surfactants (VES)-based acid diverters are frequently used to divert acid flow from high-permeability layers into low-permeability for enhanced overall productivity of the treated well. In general, an optimum VES-based system possesses advantages of decrease in absorption loss, damage of reservoir, and improved adaptability of active agents to high salinity. Herein, we report the synthesis of three new zwitterionic gemini surfactants (1-3) and previously known amidosulfobutaine (C(18)AMP3SB) has been accomplished for the investigation of diverting acid performance. The synthesis of these surfactants was achieved by the amidation of the acid chlorides of commercially available fatty acids with 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine followed by subsequent reactions with appropriate sultone or ethyl 4-bromobutanoate. The synthesized surfactants were well characterized by spectroscopic methods including IR and NMR spectroscopy. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results suggested that surfactants (1-3) and C(18)AMP3SB possess excellent thermal stability, with no appreciable loss of mass up to 300 degrees C. The viscosity measurements of the neat surfactants (1-3) and C(18)AMP3SB were performed under various temperatures, in the presence of different concentration of calcium chloride salt with the aid shear viscosimetry. The analysis revealed that the viscosity of neat C(18)AMP3SB increases with increase in concentration of CaCl2. With 10% CaCl2 solution, the viscosity was increased from 7.5 to 33.55 cPs, whereas in 20% CaCl2 the viscosity reached to 102 cPs with rise in temperature from ambient to 90 degrees C. Moreover, the viscosity of neat surfactants (1-3) did not exhibit any appreciable viscosity change under the experimental conditions. However, the mixture of surfactants (1-3) each in combination with C(18)AMP3SB (1:1) displayed significant upsurge in the viscosity, up to more than 10 folds.

TI  - Cardiac activity with acute exposure to sub-zero temperatures illustrates the survival mechanism of invasive crayfish
VL  - 93
AB  - The ability to withstand climate and weather extremes can play a key role in survival and establishment of nonnative species. We investigated the effect of acute exposure to sub-zero temperature on the heart rate and recovery capacity of invasive crayfish Faxonius limosus, Pacifastacus leniusculus, and Procambarus clarkii. The experiments used non-invasive sensors to assess cardiac activity relative to survival and recovery of crayfish during short (30 min) and prolonged (60 min) exposures to -18 degrees C. All P. clarkii specimens survived freezing temperature and rewarming and recovered after the short exposure, and 25% recovered after prolonged exposure. All F. limosus and P. leniusculus died during the recovery period following both exposures. In all tested specimens a heartbeat was measurable several hours after conclusion of exposure, gradually declining in F. limosus and P. leniusculus. The P. clarkii heart rate decreased abruptly upon exposure to sub-zero temperature, and recovery to nearly the pre-exposure rate took longer than for F. limosus and P. leniusculus. Heartbeat decline slopes were as follows: P. clarkii, 80.2 degrees +/- 2.1 degrees, > F. limosus, 74.9 degrees +/- 4.1 degrees, > P. leniusculus, 70.3 degrees +/- 3.7 degrees. During the cooling warming cycle, F. limosus and P. leniusculus demonstrated more gradual heartbeat decline and more rapid recovery to original levels but ultimately did not survive, most likely due to energy depletion associated with heartbeat fluctuation while cooling. These findings may increase our understanding of the broader distribution of P. clarkii than expected according to its ecological optima and provide insight into the mechanisms of invasive crayfish adaptability.

VL  - 102

AB  - In natural populations, insects regularly face an adverse impact of different natures: harsh weather swings, lack of food resources, the insecticidal treatment. We studied the effect of repeated episodes of mild heat stress of different frequencies on stress resistance of Drosophila melanogaster females. We found out that the mild heat stress (38°С, 1 hr) repeated daily within 2 weeks resulted in (a) an increased activity of the dopamine (DA) metabolism enzymes, DA-dependent arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase, which suggested a decrease in DA level, and (b) an increased survival rate under acute heat stress (38°С, 4 hr). The same mild heat stress repeated weekly had no effect on these parameters. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Expression of heat shock proteins in adult honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) workers under hot-arid subtropical ecosystems
VL  - 26
IS  - 7
SP  - 1372-1376
AB  - Heat stress elicits the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in honey bee subspecies. These highly conserved proteins have significant role in protecting cells from thermal-induced stresses. Honey bees in subtropical regions face extremely dry and hot environment. The expression of HSPs in the nurses and foragers of indigenous (Apis mellifera jemenitica) and imported European (Apis mellifera ligustica and Apis mellifera carnica) honey bee subspecies after heat shock treatment were compared using SDS-PAGE. Hsp70 and Hsp82 were equally expressed in the nurses of all tested bee subspecies when exposed to 40 degrees C and 45 degrees C for 4 h. The forager bees exhibited differential expression of HSPs after heat stress. No HSPs was expressed in the foragers of A. m. jemenitica, and Hsp70 was expressed only in the foragers of A. m. ligustica and A. m. carnica at 40 degrees C. A prominent diversity in HSPs expression was also exhibited in the foragers at 45 degrees C with one HSP (Hsp70) in A. m. jemenitica, two HSPs (Hsp40 and Hsp70) in A. m. carnica, and three HSPs (Hsp40, Hsp60 and Hsp70) in A. m. ligustica. No HSPs was expressed in the control nurse and forager bees at any of the tested temperatures. These findings illustrated the differences in HSP expression among nurse and forager bees. It is obvious that the native foragers are more heat tolerant with least HSPs expression than exotic bee races. Further investigations will help to understand the potential role of HSPs in the adaptability, survival, and performance of bee subspecies in harsh climate of the subtropical regions.

TI  - The presence of multiple parasitoids decreases host survival under warming, but parasitoid performance also decreases
VL  - 289
IS  - 1971
AB  - Current global changes are reshaping ecological communities and modifying environmental conditions. We need to recognize the combined impact of these biotic and abiotic factors on species interactions, community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Specifically, the strength of predator prey interactions often depends on the presence of other natural enemies: it weakens with competition and interference or strengthens with facilitation. Such effects of multiple predators on prey are likely to be affected by changes in the abiotic environment, altering top-down control, a key structuring force in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Here, we investigated how warming alters the effects of multiple predators on prey suppression using a dynamic model coupled with empirical laboratory experiments with Drosophila parasitoid communities. While multiple parasitoids enhanced top-down control under warming, parasitoid performance generally declined when another parasitoid was present owing to competitive interactions. This could reduce top-down control over multiple generations. Our study highlights the importance of accounting for interactive effects between abiotic and biotic factors to better predict community dynamics in a rapidly changing world and thus better preserve ecosystem functioning and services such as biological control. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

TI  - Templateless, Plating-Free Fabrication of Flexible Transparent Electrodes with Embedded Silver Mesh by Electric-Field-Driven Microscale 3D Printing and Hybrid Hot Embossing
VL  - 33
IS  - 21
AB  - Flexible transparent electrodes (FTEs) with an embedded metal mesh are considered a promising alternative to traditional indium tin oxide (ITO) due to their excellent photoelectric performance, surface roughness, and mechanical and environmental stability. However, great challenges remain for achieving simple, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly manufacturing of high-performance FTEs with embedded metal mesh. Herein, a maskless, templateless, and plating-free fabrication technique is proposed for FTEs with embedded silver mesh by combining an electric-field-driven (EFD) microscale 3D printing technique and a newly developed hybrid hot-embossing process. The final fabricated FTE exhibits superior optoelectronic properties with a transmittance of 85.79%, a sheet resistance of 0.75 Ω sq−1, a smooth surface of silver mesh (Ra ≈ 18.8 nm) without any polishing treatment, and remarkable mechanical stability and environmental adaptability with a negligible increase in sheet resistance under diverse cyclic tests and harsh working conditions (1000 bending cycles, 80 adhesion tests, 120 scratch tests, 100 min ultrasonic test, and 72 h chemical attack). The practical viability of this FTE is successfully demonstrated with a flexible transparent heater applied to deicing. The technique proposed offers a promising fabrication strategy with a cost-effective and environmentally friendly process for high-performance FTE. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

TI  - From gametogenesis to spawning: How climate-driven warming affects teleost reproductive biology
VL  - 97
IS  - 3
SP  - 607-632
AB  - Ambient temperature modulates reproductive processes, especially in poikilotherms such as teleosts. Consequently, global warming is expected to impact the reproductive function of fish, which has implications for wild population dynamics, fisheries and aquaculture. In this extensive review spanning tropical and cold-water environments, we examine the impact of higher-than-optimal temperatures on teleost reproductive development and physiology across reproductive stages, species, generations and sexes. In doing so, we demonstrate that warmer-than-optimal temperatures can affect every stage of reproductive development from puberty through to the act of spawning, and these responses are mediated by age at spawning and are associated with changes in physiology at multiple levels of the brain–pituitary–gonad axis. Response to temperature is often species-specific and changes with environmental history/transgenerational conditioning, and the amplitude, timing and duration of thermal exposure within a generation. Thermally driven changes to physiology, gamete development and maturation typically culminate in poor sperm and oocyte quality, and/or advancement/delay/inhibition of ovulation/spermiation and spawning. Although the field of teleost reproduction and temperature is advanced in many respects, we identify areas where research is lacking, especially for males and egg quality from “omics” perspectives. Climate-driven warming will continue to disturb teleost reproductive performance and therefore guide future research, especially in the emerging areas of transgenerational acclimation and epigenetic studies, which will help to understand and project climate change impacts on wild populations and could also have implications for aquaculture. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Mild O-2-aided alkaline pretreatment effectively improves fractionated efficiency and enzymatic digestibility of Napier grass stem towards a sustainable biorefinery
VL  - 319
AB  - Napier grass is a promising energy source on account of its strong adaptability and high productivity. Herein, an O2-aided alkaline pretreatment with mild operating conditions was developed to modify Napier grass stem structure for improving its fractionated efficiency and enzymatic digestibility. Compared with the conventional alkaline pretreatment, it could be proceeded at lower temperature (80 °C) and dilute NaOH solution (1%) to remove over 80% lignin and retain 92% cellulose. The recovered lignin possessed typical structures of native lignin and well-preserved molecular weight, anticipating feasible potential in preparation of biomaterials or aromatic chemicals. Coupled with the enzymatic hydrolysis managements of solid remain and hydrolysate after the pretreatment, the recovery yields of glucose and xylose based on the raw material feeds reached 89.7% and 90.2%, respectively. This contribution demonstrates a highly-reliable strategy to fractionate Napier grass stem for maximizing fermentation sugar production and valorizing lignin toward sustainable biorefinery processes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 63

AB  - Year-round continuous reproduction in tropical regions is an established paradigm in marine ecology. In this study, we tested this paradigm using the ghost shrimp Callichirus seilacheri from the tropical eastern Pacific as a model species. We also examined size-frequency distribution, sex ratio, and recruitment cycle to contribute to the biological knowledge of this species. To this end, a total of 456 individuals of C. seilacheri were collected during 12 months of sampling. Population structure was symmetrical for both sexes, and the overall sex ratio did not differ from evenness. Males outnumbered females in smaller size classes, though, revealing a potential sex-dependent mortality in small individuals. The breeding pattern followed the well-marked seasonal regime of the region, with ovigerous females registered during the rainy season. While natural variation in the seawater temperature had no influence on reproduction of this species, changes in water salinity possibly triggered the appearance of egg-bearing females in the population. Recruitment occurred throughout the year but was more intense during the dry season, following the appearance of ovigerous females. The adaptability of the life cycle of C. seilacheri to the seasonal climate provides further evidence that reproduction in tropical species is not always continuous. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Techniques for extending shelf life of guava fruits: A review
VL  - 1205
SP  - 959-969
AB  - Guava (Psidium guajava L.) is an exquisite, nutritionally and economically valuable fruit crop of tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Guava fruits are relished world over for fresh consumption, as well as processed into other delicacies like juice, jam and jelly to extend availability throughout the year. Guava outshines other tropical fruits in productivity, hardiness, adaptability, nutritional value, and ensures higher economic returns to growers with minimal inputs. Guava is highly nutritious and a good source of calcium, iron and phosphorus. Vitamin C content of guava fruit is 2-5 times that of citrus fruit. Despite its wide adaptability and high nutritive value, world trade of guava fruit is limited due to its delicate nature, short postharvest life and susceptibility to chilling injury and diseases. Guava, being a highly perishable fruit, undergoes rapid postharvest ripening in a few days under ambient conditions and becomes overripe and mealy within a week. In cold storage, the fruit can maintain quality for up to 15 days at 8-10 degrees C and 85-90% RH. Controlled/modified atmosphere storage methods can extend the shelf life, but, an inappropriate storage atmosphere may result in accumulation of fermentative metabolites resulting in development of severe off-flavors. The use of anti-transpirants, wax coatings, growth retardants, irradiation and different types of storage facilities have been tried to increase the shelf life of harvested fruits with limited success. Recent technologies such as the phospholipase D inhibition technology using hexanal compositions have been observed to enhance shelf life for a month through its multifold actions involving the modulation of ethylene signal transduction pathway and gene expression.

AB  - A Continuous Variable Transmission is an unconventional type of transmission which transmits torque/power from the crankshaft of the engine to the wheels that run on the ground. It is a single speed step- less transmission with the help of pulleys and a belt to obtain uninterrupted and continuous infinite gear ratios within a finite limit. Infinite gear ratios are obtained by varying belt diameter over pulleys. Due to continuous contact between the belt and the pulley, the friction between both the surfaces leads to the generation of heat over a period of time. At higher speed, instances and clutch slippage situations produce more amount of heat in CVT components. Studies show that CVT surface temperatures may reach up as high as 80°C to 120°C depending upon the various speeds of CVT, which affects the service life of components in long run and simultaneously its performance is reduced. So, necessary cooling is required to enhance the life of CVT. The main objective of this work is reducing the surface temperature from 80°C to 60°C in static condition around the pulleys of a CVT by increasing its surface area in the form of rectangular and cylindrical fins which is subjected to natural convection and by comparing the changes in temperature distribution and heat dissipated using both the fins. The temperature distribution is analyzed for different models using steady -state thermal analysis tool in Ansys. The fin material used is aluminum alloy of 3003 grade for its feasibility of machining, welding, and comparatively higher thermal conductivity. © TJPRC Pvt. Ltd.

TI  - Decoding the Gene Variants of Two Native Probiotic Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Strains through Whole-Genome Resequencing: Insights into Bacterial Adaptability to Stressors and Antimicrobial Strength
VL  - 13
IS  - 3
AB  - In this study, whole-genome resequencing of two native probiotic Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains—UTNGt21A and UTNGt2—was assessed in order to identify variants and perform annotation of genes involved in bacterial adaptability to different stressors, as well as their antimicrobial strength. A total of 21,906 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in UTNGt21A, while 17,610 were disclosed in the UTNGt2 genome. The comparative genomic analysis revealed a greater number of deletions, transversions, and transitions within the UTNGt21A genome, while a small difference in the number of insertions was detected between the strains. A divergent number of types of variant annotations were detected in both strains, and categorized in terms of low, moderate, and high modifier impact on the protein effectiveness. Although both native strains shared common specific genes involved in the stress response to the gastrointestinal environment, which may qualify as a putative probiotic (bile salt, acid, temperature, osmotic stress), they were different in their antimicrobial gene cluster organization, with UTNGt21A displaying a complex bacteriocin gene arrangement and dissimilar gene variants that might alter their defense mechanisms and overall inhibitory capacity. The genome comparison revealed 34 and 9 genomic islands (GIs) in the UTNGt21A and UTNGt2 genomes, respectively, with the overrepresentation of genes involved in defense mechanisms and carbohydrate utilization. In addition, pan-genome analysis disclosed the presence of various strain-specific genes (shell genes), suggesting a high genome variation between strains. This genome analysis illustrates that the bacteriocin signature and gene variants reflect a niche-inherent pattern. These extensive genomic datasets will guide us to understand the potential benefits of the native strains and their utility in the food or pharmaceutical sectors. © 2022 by the author.

TI  - Use of the Product from Low Pressure Extraction (Crambe Seed Oil and Methyl Acetate) for Synthesis of Methyl Esters and Triacetin Under Supercritical Conditions
VL  - 122
IS  - 6
AB  - Methyl esters (ME) and triacetin production from the supercritical interesterification of the product from low pressure extraction (crambe seed oil and methyl acetate) are evaluated. Reactions are conducted at 300–375 °C for different residence times, at 20 MPa, and under these conditions the thermal stability of triacetin is evaluated. The effect of the free fatty acid (FFA) concentration (in oil) is determined. An increase in temperature favors the formation of ME and triacetin at shorter reaction times. At 375 °C, after 15 min a drop in the ME yield is observed and triacetin is not detected. A reduction in the triacetin concentration (reaching ≈99%) is observed at 375 °C. High FFA concentration (in oil) initially provided higher product generation, however, after 15 min no influence is observed. The highest ME yield (≈60%) is obtained at 300 °C, along with 1.22 wt% triacetin and ≈5.0 wt% unreacted compounds. Practical Applications: This paper reports new experimental data on an integrated process for the production of methyl esters from low pressure extraction (crambe seeds and methyl acetate) and supercritical reaction of the extraction mixture. The technique used allows the removal of a high quantity of oil from good quality crambe seeds. The viability of applying the integrated process to obtain oils with a high content of free fatty acids is verified, promoting the obtainment of relatively simple methyl esters. The procedure does not require oil purification and solvent recovery prior to the reaction. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim

VL  - 78

SP  - 68-77
AB  - Median timing of reproduction in salmonid populations is generally consistent among years, reflecting long-term patterns of natural selection from characteristics of the local environment. However, altered selection from factors related to climate change or human intervention might shift timing over generations, with implications for the population’s persistence. To study these processes, we modeled median timing of redd (nest) counts as an index of spawning timing by natural-origin Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in the Skagit River system in Washington State, USA. Over the last 2–6 decades, natural-origin salmon have been spawning later by 0.03–0.52 days·year–1, while a naturally spawning group that is influenced by strays from a hatchery has been spawning earlier by 0.19 days·year–1. Trends in the spawning timing of hatchery-origin strays may reflect opposing selection from the hatchery, where egg take for propagation has become earlier by 0.58 days·year–1. As mean August river temperatures have risen over the period of record, hatchery timing trends may be moving in the opposite direction from the plastic or adaptive patterns expressed by natural-origin fish. © Canadian Science Publishing.

TI  - Effects of salinity and temperature on growth and survival of diploid and tetraploid larvae of the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas
VL  - 550
AB  - Tetraploid of Crassostrea gigas was first reported in the 1990s, but its biological characteristics are seldomly known. To understand the adaptation of tetraploid larvae to salinity and temperature, the effects of salinity treatments (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 psu) and temperature treatments (18, 23 and 28 °C) on the growth and survival of tetraploid and diploid larvae were comparatively studied. In salinity treatments, the accumulative survival rate (ASR) and relative growth rate (RGR) of tetraploid larvae were generally lower than that of diploid larvae (P < 0.05). The maximum ASR and RGR of tetraploid larvae occurred at 30 psu, with the values of 41.09% and 152.91%, respectively. At day 16, the maximum difference in ASR between diploid and tetraploid larvae was 36.41% at 20 psu, and the maximum difference in RGR of diploid and tetraploid larvae was 62.36% at 10 psu. The ASR and RGR of tetraploid larvae were lower than that of diploid larvae under temperature treatments (P < 0.05). The maximum ASR and RGR of tetraploid larvae occurred at 28 °C, with the values of 19.67% and 235.40%, respectively. The ASR of both diploid and tetraploid larvae decreased sharply in the first four days. The RGR of larvae at 18 °C was much lower than that at 23 °C and 28 °C (P < 0.05). Hence, a salinity range of 25–30 psu and a temperature range of 23–28 °C are suitable culture conditions for tetraploid larvae. These results indicate that the natural environment conditions can meet the temperature and salinity requirements for the survival and growth of tetraploid larvae. However, tetraploid larvae are less adaptable to temperature and salinity than diploid larvae. The environmental adaptability of tetraploid needs further improvement. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 33

SP  - 13-22
AB  - [Objective] Comprehensive evaluation on growth traits, quality traits and adaptability of domestic secondary provenance/family introduced previously was conducted to select superior provenance/family most suited to local growth. [Method] Designed by completely randomized blocks with 4 tree-plot and 8 replicates, 19 secondary provenances/families of domestic teak species were analyzed by variance and correlation in survival rate, growth traits and quality traits of 4.5-year-old and 30.5-year-old trees to select superior secondary provenances/families according to clustering method and coordinate composite evaluation with multi-characters. [Result] There were significant or highly significant differences among provenances/families in survival rate, growth traits and quality traits of 4.5-year-old and 30.5-year-old trees except survival rate of 4.5-year-old trees. No significant correlation was found between 4.5-year-old trees and 30.5-year-old trees in all traits, however, there were significant or highly significant positive correlation among growth traits, between growth traits and survival rate, and between growths and stem form of among same aged trees. The growth traits and stem form were highly significant positive correlated with latitude of seed source and significant or high significant negative correlated with annual average temperature. Two secondary provenances and two secondary families were selected by cluster analysis and coordinate composite evaluation method, of which the individual volume of dominant tree of 30.5-year-old trees was higher than that of local provenance and local superior family increased by 261.65%-291.29% and 20.18%-26.11% respectively. Superior provenances had very remarkable effect on selection. [Conclusion] One provenance from Guangdong, one provenance from Yunnan and two families from Yunnan are identified as the teak provenances/family most suitable to be planted in southwest Hainan Province, and a further selection to the family from Yunnan will achieve greater gains. © 2020, Editorial Department of Forest Research.

TI  - Heat wave event facilitates defensive responses in invasive C3 plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. under elevated CO2 concentration to the detriment of Ophraella communa
VL  - 13
AB  - To predict and mitigate the effects of climate change on communities and ecosystems, the joint effects of extreme climatic events on species interactions need to be understood. Using the common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.)-leaf beetle (Ophraella communa) system, we investigated the effects of heat wave and elevated CO2 on common ragweed growth, secondary metabolism, and the consequent impacts on the beetle. The results showed that elevated CO2 and heat wave facilitated A. artemisiifolia growth; further, A. artemisiifolia accumulated large amounts of defensive secondary metabolites. Being fed on A. artemisiifolia grown under elevated CO2 and heat wave conditions resulted in the poor performance of O. communa (high mortality, long development period, and low reproduction). Overall, under elevated CO2, heat wave improved the defensive ability of A. artemisiifolia against herbivores. On the other hand, enhanced adaptability to climatic changes may aggravate invasive plant distribution, posing a challenge to the control of invasive plants in the future. Key message Being fed on A. artemisiifolia grown under elevated CO2 and heat wave conditions resulted in the poor performance of O. communa (high mortality, long development period, and low reproduction). Elevated CO2 and heat waves resulted in the accumulation of secondary metabolites in A. artemisiifolia. After feeding on the secondary metabolites accumulated by A. artemisiifolia, the mortality of O. communa increased.

TI  - Response stability of radial growth of Chinese pine to climate change at different altitudes on the southern edge of the Tengger Desert
VL  - 35
AB  - In recent decades, the climate in northwest China has warmed significantly, especially since the 1980 s, and there has been a period of rapid temperature increase and abundant precipitation since 2010. This has a profound impact on the species structure, distribution and productivity of forest ecosystems. The results of many studies indicate that the response of radial tree growth to global climate change is nonlinear at high altitudes and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. However, altitudinal trends of tree radial growth response to climate change need to be investigated at different locations because of existing local variability in site-specific climatic conditions. Therefore, tree ring chronologies at high (2562 m), middle (2446 m) and low (2328 m) altitudes of Changling Mountain on the southern edge of the Tengger Desert were established to investigate the response to climate change. The results indicated that the interannual variation trends of the basal area increment (BAI) of Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) at the three altitudes showed first increases, then decreases, and then showed increases again. Trees at the high altitude showed a significant decline in 1997, and those at the middle and low altitudes significantly declined after 1982, while all trees showed growth after 2010. The radial growth of Chinese pine at the three altitudes was mainly restricted by drought stress, but the radial growth at the middle and low altitudes was more restricted by mean temperature and mean maximum temperature. Chinese pine showed unstable responses to climatic factors at the three altitudes, with the middle and high altitudes showing a more stable response to precipitation in the previous year. The drought resistance of Chinese pine first increased and then decreased under drought events, while the resilience first decreased and then increased with climate change. The relationship between trees and climatic factors, as well as the growth pattern and resistance of trees, change with climate change, resulting in differences in survival strategies and adaptability to future climate conditions among trees at the three altitudes. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Seasonal Development of Plant Bugs (Heteroptera, Miridae): Subfamily Phylinae, Tribes Pilophorini, Hallodapini, and Phylini
VL  - 102
IS  - 1
SP  - 20-40
AB  - Abstract: The review analyzes the available literature data on the seasonal development of plant bugs of the subfamily Phylinae distributed in the Holarctic Region. The data set concerns 39 species from 3 tribes: Pilophorini, Hallodapini, and Phylini. The tribe Pilophorini is represented by 5 species, 3 of which complete one generation per year and hibernate at the egg stage. However, there is no reason to believe that their annual cycles are obligatory univoltine, since they have been studied only in regions with a relatively cold climate. Two other species of this tribe, Pilophorus confusus and P. typicus, are multivoltine in regions with a warmer climate (Spain and Japan, respectively), where they also overwinter at the egg stage. The data on 3 species of the tribe Hallodapini indicate that they have similar seasonal cycles with a single generation per year and overwintering at the egg stage. The greatest diversity of seasonal patterns is known in the tribe Phylini. Two out of 5 Chlamydatus species included in this review overwinter as adults, although overwintering at the egg stage is generally characteristic of the family Miridae. Three species of this genus have a multivoltine seasonal cycle, and no data are available on the voltinism and overwintering stage of two other species, Ch. allii and Ch. wilkinsoni. Of the remaining 26 species of the tribe Phylini, 6 species have a multivoltine seasonal cycle and complete from 2 to 4 generations per year in different climatic zones. The bivoltine Campylomma verbasci from the same tribe has a seasonal adaptation unusual for true bugs, namely the shift of host plants during the year realized by different generations: after overwintering, the bugs move from woody plants to herbaceous ones. In general, the subfamily Phylinae is very species-rich and has highly diverse ecological characteristics, such as trophic specialization, voltinism, overwintering stage, seasonal shift of host plants, wing polymorphism, etc. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

TI  - Knockdown of sarcolipin (SLN) impairs substrate utilization in human skeletal muscle cells
VL  - 49
IS  - 7
SP  - 6005-6017
AB  - Background: Recent studies have highlighted that uncoupling of sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) by sarcolipin (SLN) increases ATP consumption and contributes to heat liberation. Exploiting this thermogenic mechanism in skeletal muscle may provide an attractive strategy to counteract obesity and associated metabolic disorders. In the present study, we have investigated the role of SLN on substrate metabolism in human skeletal muscle cells. Methods and results: After generation of skeletal muscle cells with stable SLN knockdown (SLN-KD), cell viability, glucose and oleic acid (OA) metabolism, mitochondrial function, as well as gene expressions were determined. Depletion of SLN did not influence cell viability. However, glucose and OA oxidation were diminished in SLN-KD cells compared to control myotubes. Basal respiration measured by respirometry was also observed to be reduced in cells with SLN-KD. The metabolic perturbation in SLN-KD cells was reflected by reduced gene expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α) and forkhead box O1 (FOXO1). Furthermore, accumulation of OA was increased in cells with SLN-KD compared to control cells. These effects were accompanied by increased lipid formation and incorporation of OA into complex lipids. Additionally, formation of complex lipids and free fatty acid from de novo lipogenesis with acetate as substrate was enhanced in SLN-KD cells. Detection of lipid droplets using Oil red O staining also showed increased lipid accumulation in SLN-KD cells. Conclusions: Overall, our study sheds light on the importance of SLN in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in human skeletal muscle. Findings from the current study suggest that therapeutic strategies involving SLN-mediated futile cycling of SERCA might have significant implications in the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic disorders.

AB  - The control of the solidification process of energetic materials is important to prevent manufacturing defects in high explosive ammunitions. The present work aims to propose an optimisation procedure to determine the value of the model parameter, avoiding the traditional trial and error approach. In this work, the solidification of TNT has been numerically modelled employing apparent heat capacity method and the model parameter was optimised using genetic algorithm. One dimensional numerical model has been solved in Comsol Multiphysics Modeling Software and the genetic algorithm code was written in Matlab. The Neumann’s analytical solution of the solidification front was used as a reference to build the fitness function, following the inverse problems concepts. The optimum model parameter has been predicted after 20 generations and among 30 candidate solutions for each generation. The numerical solution performed with the optimised model parameter has agreed with the analytical solution, indicating the feasibility of the proposed procedure. The discrepancy was 3.8 per cent when maximum difference between analytical and numerical solutions was observed. © 2019, DESIDOC

TI  - The Effect of Low-Growing Rootstocks on the Adaptability and Productivity of Sour Cherry Varieties (Prunus cerasus L.) in Arid Conditions
VL  - 8
IS  - 5
AB  - Sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.), having a rich composition of biologically active connections and antioxidants, is gaining increasing popularity among agricultural producers. Increasing the production of sour cherry fruits requires the introduction of modern technology, one of the elements of which is low-growing rootstocks. For many cultures, the use of low-growing rootstocks has been widely studied, but there is very little information on their use in cherry plantations. We studied new varieties and rootstocks of cherries in the conditions of the dry steppe zone, where this issue had not been studied before. Sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) varieties—Toy, Memory of Zhukova, and Loznovskaya—are the most adapted to the conditions in which the experiments were conducted. Russian breeding forms (Krymsk, Krasnodar region), which were taken as rootstocks, are widely used for sweet cherries (Prunus avium L.), but are practically never used for sour cherries (Prunus cerasus L.). The influence of rootstocks on such parameters as drought resistance, heat resistance, winter hardiness, and productivity was studied in variety–rootstock combinations. The study showed that they had the greatest drought resistance, and accordingly affected the grafted variety with rootstock, in the pedigree of which there are wild species. These rootstocks were of the VSL and RVL series. The study of the productivity of variety–rootstock combinations showed that in the grafted varieties the most rapid entry into the fruiting season and the greatest increase in the yield was facilitated by the rootstock forms of VSL-1 and VSL-2 (K5) which made it possible to obtain a yield of 5.8–8.1 kg/tree, depending on the variety grafted onto them. However, it is necessary to continue the research that has been started in order to fully determine the possible qualitative and quantitative parameters of the studied variety–rootstock combinations and to identify the most promising ones for further introduction into industrial production. This work was carried out within the framework of the topic of the state task of the Scientific Research Center of Agroecology of the Russian Academy of Sciences No. 0713-2019-0009: “Theoretical foundations, creation of new competitive biotypes of agricultural crops with high productivity, quality, sustainability and varietal technologies based on the latest methods and technological solutions in a changing climate, including seed breeding and nursery breeding”. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Low vulnerability of arctic fox dens to climate change-related geohazards on bylot island, nunavut, canada
VL  - 7
IS  - 4
SP  - 746-761
AB  - Climate change increases the risk of severe alterations to essential wildlife habitats. The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus (Linnaeus, 1758)) uses dens as shelters against cold temperatures and predators. These dens, needed for successful reproduction, are generally dug into the active layer on top of permafrost and reused across multiple generations. We assessed the vulnerability of Arctic fox dens to the increasing frequency of geohazards (thaw settlement, mass movements, and thermal erosion) that is arising from climate change. On Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada) we developed, and calculated from field observations, a qualitative vulnerability index to geohazards for Arctic fox dens. Of the 106 dens studied, 14% were classified as highly vulnerable, whereas 17% and 69% had a moderate and low vulnerability, respectively. Vulnerability was not related to the probability of use for reproduction. Although climate change will likely impact Arctic fox reproductive dens, such impact is not a major threat to foxes of Bylot Island. Our research provides the first insights into the climate-related geohazards potentially affecting Arctic fox ecology in the next decades. The developed method is flexible and could be applied to other locations or other species that complete their life cycle in permafrost regions. © 2021, Canadian Science Publishing.

TI  - TERN, Australia's land observatory: Addressing the global challenge of forecasting ecosystem responses to climate variability and change
VL  - 14
IS  - 9
AB  - The global challenge of understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses to climate extremes and climate change is addressed in this review of research enabled through environmental research infrastructure (RI) provided by Australia's Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN). Two primary climatic drivers of ecosystem structure and function in Australia are fire and aridity, to which Australian flora and fauna have shown marked adaptability. Australian vegetation shows resilience to climate extremes of flooding rains, droughts and heatwaves such that variability in primary productivity of Australian vegetation has a tangible effect on the global carbon cycle. Nonetheless, Australian flora and ecosystems could be vulnerable to projected climate change (e.g. to increasing vapour pressure deficit). Refugia are also vulnerable to climate change, with conditions in these areas already near the tipping point for a change in community composition. Ensuring genetic diversity during directional change in climate (e.g. increasing aridity) requires proactive approaches to conservation and restoration projects. To address these challenges, TERN provides environmental RI at three scales of observation: (i) environmental monitoring using remote sensing techniques at a landscape and continental scale; (ii) a spatially extensive network of ecosystem monitoring plots; and (iii) intensely measured sites collecting detailed data on ecosystem processes. Through partnerships with international environmental RIs, TERN enables research that addresses global challenges, on the first steps toward the forecasting of ecosystem-climate interactions. © 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Assessing the heat vulnerability of different local climate zones in the old areas of a Chinese megacity
VL  - 11
IS  - 7
AB  - Frequent and extreme heat waves have strongly influenced the sustainable development of cities and resulted in a higher level of mortality in residents. Using the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification scheme, combined with the factors of land surface temperature (LST), building age (BA), and housing price (HP), and the normalized values of which represent heat exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability, respectively, this paper investigates a practical method for assessing the heat vulnerability of different LCZ classes in the old areas of a Chinese megacity, taking the Yuzhong district of Chongqing city as a case study. The results reveal that the distribution of LCZ classes in this study area exhibits a typical circle-layer distribution pattern from the city center to the suburbs. Heavy industry areas are the most vulnerable, with the highest exposure to heat waves, the oldest building age and the lowest housing price. Compact class areas (compact high-rise, compact mid-rise and compact low-rise) are usually more vulnerable than open class areas (open high-rise, open mid-rise, and open low-rise) and low-rise buildings are always more susceptible to heat waves than mid-rise and high-rise buildings. The methods and findings can help us to better understand the comprehensive and space-time action rules of heat vulnerability, thereby inspiring scientific and rational urban planning strategies to mitigate or adapt to urban heat weaves towards the sustainable development of cities and society. © 2019 by the authors.

TI  - Embryo Development and Effects of Temperature, Salinity, and Light Intensity on Egg Hatching of Calanoid Copepod Bestiolina amoyensis (Calanoida: Paracalanidae)
VL  - 9
AB  - Bestiolina amoyensis distributes in subtropical inshore waters across the Pacific Ocean, with a relatively long reproductive lifespan and high intrinsic population increase rate compared with other small paracalanid species, which makes it a good candidate to develop culture techniques for hatchery larval rearing. However, the reproductive biology of this subtropical broadcast spawning species is still largely unknown. The present investigation provides the first published data on the embryo development and effects of different light intensities (0, 500, and 1,000 lx), temperatures (16 degrees C, 18 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 22 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 26 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 32 degrees C, and 34 degrees C), and salinities (22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, and 34 psu) on hatching success rates of B. amoyensis. The same batch of eggs were collected from gravid females to observe their embryonic development and incubated under designed light intensities, temperatures, and salinities. Results showed that the whole embryonic development of B. amoyensis lasted, on average, 6 h and 40 min at 26 degrees C, and egg hatching time of B. amoyensis shortened exponentially with the increasing temperature. The highest egg hatching rate (100%) was recorded from the 0-lx treatment, indicating that the dark condition was favorable for the egg incubation of B. amoyensis. The optimum temperature and salinity range for the hatching success of B. amoyensis was 22 degrees C-30 degrees C (above 94%) and 22-34 psu salinity (above 88%), respectively, indicating that B. amoyensis had wide adaptability to temperature and salinity. Light and too low or high temperature leads to abnormal embryonic development and malformed nauplii. The relatively wide adaptability to temperature and salinity and fast embryo development also suggests that B. amoyensis was a good candidate as live feed for hatchery larval rearing.

VL  - 11
AB  - Perhaps the main factor determining success of space travel will be the ability to control effects of ionizing radiation for humans, but also for other living organisms. Manned space travel will require the cultivation of food plants under conditions of prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation. Although there is a significant literature concerning the effects of acute high dose rate exposures on plant genetics, growth, and development, much less is known concerning the effects of chronic low dose irradiation especially those related to the impacts of the high energy protons and heavy ions that are encountered in the space environment. Here, we make the argument that in situ studies of the effects of radionuclides at nuclear accident sites (e.g., Chernobyl and Fukushima), atomic bomb test sites, and areas of naturally high radiation levels, could provide insights concerning the mechanisms of radiation effects on living systems that cannot be assessed short of conducting research in space, which is not yet feasible for large scale, long term, multigenerational experiments. In this article we review the literature concerning the effects of chronic low-dose rate radiation exposure from studies conducted in Chernobyl, Fukushima, and other regions of the world with high ambient radiation levels (parts of India in particular). In general, mutation rates and other measures of genetic damage are considerably elevated, pollen and seed viability are reduced, growth rates are slower, and the frequency of developmental abnormalities is increased, although there is considerable variation among taxa for these effects. In addition, there are interactions between radiation and other environmental stressors (e.g., temperature, drought, heavy metals) that may play important roles in determining susceptibility to radiation induced stress. © 2020 Mousseau and Møller.

TI  - Chronic exposure to anthropogenic and climate related stressors alters transcriptional responses in the liver of zebrafish (Danio rerio) across multiple generations
VL  - 240
AB  - The antidepressant, venlafaxine (VFX), and climate change stressors, such as increased water temperature and decreased dissolved oxygen, are current threats to aquatic environments. This study aimed to determine how microRNAs (miRNAs) and predicted targeted transcripts were altered in livers of zebrafish exposed to these stressors, and livers of their un-exposed F1 and F2 offspring. Following a 21 day exposure to multiple stressors (1 μg/L VFX, +5 °C ambient, 50% O2), then a subsequent 21 day recovery, relative abundances of cyp3a65, hsp70, hsp90, and ppargc1a and miRNAs predicted to target them (miR-142a, miR-16c, miR-181c, and miR-129, respectively) were measured in the liver via quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). There were significant decreases in miR-142a in the exposed F0 generation and the exposed F1 generation. While there were no changes detected in cyp3a65 relative abundance, there was a significant inverse relationship between cyp3a65 and miR-142a. Hsp70 expression significantly increased in the F1 generation, which persisted to the F2 generation and the relative abundance of hsp90 significantly increased in all generations. There was a significant reduction in miR-181c in the F1 generation, but there was no significant relationship between miR-181c and hsp90. Finally, there was a significant decrease in ppargc1a relative abundance in the F1 generation which was associated with an increase in miR-129. Combined, these results suggest that parental exposure to multiple, environmentally relevant stressors can confer transcriptional and epigenetic responses in the F1 and F2 generations, although identifying which stressor is a driving force becomes unclear. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Effect of Altitude on Volatile Organic and Phenolic Compounds of Artemisia brevifolia Wall ex Dc. From the Western Himalayas
VL  - 10
AB  - Adaptation to changing environmental conditions is a driver of plant diversification. Elevational gradients offer a unique opportunity for investigating adaptation to a range of climatic conditions. The use of specialized metabolites as volatile and phenolic compounds is a major adaptation in plants, affecting their reproductive success and survival by attracting pollinators and protecting themselves from herbivores and other stressors. The wormseed Artemisia brevifolia can be found across multiple elevations in the Western Himalayas, a region that is considered a biodiversity hotspot and is highly impacted by climate change. This study aims at understanding the volatile and phenolic compounds produced by A. brevifolia in the high elevation cold deserts of the Western Himalayas with the view to understanding the survival strategies employed by plants under harsh conditions. Across four sampling sites with different elevations, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sampling and subsequent GCMS analyses showed that the total number of volatile compounds in the plant headspace increased with elevation and that this trend was largely driven by an increase in compounds with low volatility, which might improve the plant’s resilience to abiotic stress. HPLC analyses showed no effect of elevation on the total number of phenolic compounds detected in both young and mature leaves. However, the concentration of the majority of phenolic compounds decreased with elevation. As the production of phenolic defense compounds is a costly trait, plants at higher elevations might face a trade-off between energy expenditure and protecting themselves from herbivores. This study can therefore help us understand how plants adjust secondary metabolite production to cope with harsh environments and reveal the climate adaptability of such species in highly threatened regions of our planet such as the Himalayas.

TI  - Glutamate uptake is important for osmoregulation and survival in the rice pathogen &ITBurkholderia glumae &IT
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Bacteria exhibit an optimal growth rate in culture media with sufficient nutrients at an optimal temperature and pH. In addition, the concentration of solutes plays a critical role in bacterial growth and survival. Glutamate is known to be a major anionic solute involved in osmoregulation and the bacterial cell’s response to changes in solute concentration. To determine how glutamate uptake is involved in osmoregulation in the rice bacterial pathogen Burkholderia glumae BGR1, we mutated the gltI gene encoding a periplasmic substrate binding protein of a glutamate transport system to abolish glutamate uptake, and monitored the growth of the gltI null mutant in Luria-Bertani medium. We found that the gltI null mutant showed a slower growth rate than the wild-type strain and experienced hyperosmotic stress resulting in water loss from the cytoplasm in stationary phase. When the incubation time was extended, the mutant population collapsed due to the hyperosmotic stress. The gltI null mutant exhibited loss of adaptability under both hypoosmotic and hyperosmotic stresses. The growth rate of the gltI null mutant was restored to the level of wild-type growth by exogenous addition of glycine betaine to the culture medium, indicating that glycine betaine is a compatible solute in B. glumae. These results indicate that glutamate uptake from the environment plays a key role in osmoregulation in B. glumae. © 2018 Kang, Hwang.

AB  - Walterinnesia morgani is one of the venomous snakes that localized in Khuzestan Province in southwestern of Iran, The epidermis of snakes is made of six epidermal layers termed oberhautchen, β, mesos α, lacunar, and clear, and have been shown to function as the main barrier to evaporative water loss and essential for life on dry land. Regarding the temperature of Khuzestan province and its high temperature, identification of fatty acids in W. morgani skin can help us to identify the adaptability of this species to temperature conditions. The present study skin lipids were analyzed by GC/FID and fatty acids identified in skin include: Octadecanoic acid, Linoleic acid, Tricosanoic acid, Cis-9-Oleic acid, Nervonic acid, Heptadecanoic acid, Palmitic acid and Cis-11-eicosenoic acid. The presence of these fatty acids in the W. morgani skin is effective in survival and tolerance in tropical weather conditions in Khuzestan province. © 2020, Zoological Society, Kolkata, India.

TI  - Blood-brain barrier in brain tumors: Biology and clinical relevance
VL  - 22
IS  - 23
AB  - The presence of barriers, such as the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and brain–tumor barrier (BTB), limits the penetration of antineoplastic drugs into the brain, resulting in poor response to treatments. Many techniques have been developed to overcome the presence of these barriers, including direct injections of substances by intranasal or intrathecal routes, chemical modification of drugs or constituents of BBB, inhibition of efflux pumps, physical disruption of BBB by radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (EMP), laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT), focused ultrasounds (FUS) combined with microbubbles and convection enhanced delivery (CED). However, most of these strategies have been tested only in preclinical models or in phase 1–2 trials, and none of them have been approved for treatment of brain tumors yet. Concerning the treatment of brain metastases, many molecules have been developed in the last years with a better penetration across BBB (new generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors like osimertinib for non-small-cell lung carcinoma and neratinib/tucatinib for breast cancer), resulting in better progression-free survival and overall survival compared to older molecules. Promising studies concerning neural stem cells, CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptors) strategies and immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors are ongoing. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Global long-term mapping of surface temperature shows intensified intra-city urban heat island extremes
VL  - 72
AB  - Surface temperatures are generally higher in cities than in rural surroundings. This phenomenon, known as Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), increases the risk of heat-related human illnesses and mortality. Past global studies analysed this phenomenon aggregated at city scale or over seasonal and annual time periods, while human impacts strongly depend on shorter term heat stress experienced locally. Here we develop a global long-term high-resolution dataset of daytime SUHI, offering an insight into the space–time variability of the urban–rural temperature differences which is unprecedented at global scale. Our results show that across urban areas worldwide over the period 2003–2020, 3-day SUHI extremes are on average more than twice as high as the warm-season median SUHI, with local exceedances up to 10 K. Over this period, SUHI extremes have increased more rapidly than warm-season medians, and averaged worldwide are now 1.04 K or 31% higher compared to 2003. This can be linked with increasing urbanisation, more frequent heatwaves, and greening of the earth, processes that are all expected to continue in the coming decades. Within many cities there are hotspots where extreme SUHI intensity is 10–15 K higher compared to relatively cooler city parts. Given the limited human adaptability to heat stress, our results advocate for mitigation strategies targeted at reducing SUHI extremes in the most vulnerable and exposed city neighbourhoods. © 2021

TI  - A Temperature Compensation Method for aSix-Axis Force/Torque Sensor Utilizing Ensemble hWOA-LSSVM Based on Improved Trimmed Bagging
VL  - 22
IS  - 13
AB  - The performance of a six-axis force/torque sensor (F/T sensor) severely decreased when working in an extreme environment due to its sensitivity to ambient temperature. This paper puts forward an ensemble temperature compensation method based on the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) tuning the least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) and trimmed bagging. To be specific, the stimulated annealing algorithm (SA) was hybridized to the WOA to solve the local entrapment problem, and an adaptive trimming strategy is proposed to obtain the optimal trim portion for the trimmed bagging. In addition, inverse quote error (invQE) and cross-validation are employed to estimate the fitness better in training process. The maximum absolute measurement error caused by temperature decreased from 3.34% to 3.9 × 10−3% of full scale after being compensated by the proposed method. The analyses of experiments illustrate the ensemble hWOA-LSSVM based on improved trimmed bagging improves the precision and stability of F/T sensors and possesses the strengths of local search ability and better adaptability. © 2022 by the authors.

VL  - 10

SP  - 781-793
AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP), as an important variable and ecological indicator in grassland ecosystems, can reflect environmental change and the carbon budget level. The Ili River Valley is a wetland nestled in the hinterland of the Eurasian continent, which responds sensitively to the global climate change. Understanding carbon budget and their responses to climate change in the ecosystem of Ili River Valley has a significant effect on the adaptability of future climate change and sustainable development. In this study, we calculated the NPP and analyzed its spatio-temporal pattern of the Ili River Valley during the period 2000–2014 using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and an improved Carnegie-Ames-Stanford (CASA) model. Results indicate that validation showed a good performance of CASA over the study region, with an overall coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.65 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 20.86 g C/(m2•a). Temporally, annual NPP of the Ili River Valley was 599.19 g C/(m2•a) and showed a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2014, with an annual decrease rate of–3.51 g C/(m2•a). However, the spatial variation was not consistent, in which 55.69% of the areas showed a decreasing tendency, 12.60% of the areas remained relatively stable and 31.71% appeared an increasing tendency. In addition, the decreasing trends in NPP were not continuous throughout the 15-year period, which was likely being caused by a shift in climate conditions. Precipitation was found to be the dominant climatic factor that controlled the inter-annual variability in NPP. Furthermore, the correlations between NPP and climate factors differed along the vertical zonal. In the medium-high altitudes of the Ili River Valley, the NPP was positively correlated to precipitation and negatively correlated to temperature and net radiation. In the low-altitude valley and high-altitude mountain areas, the NPP showed a negative correlation with precipitation and a weakly positive correlation with temperature and net radiation. The results suggested that the vegetation of the Ili River Valley degraded in recent years, and there was a more complex mechanism of local hydrothermal redistribution that controlled the growth of vegetation in this valley ecosystem. © 2018, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Responses of Leptinaria unilamellata (Gastropoda: Subulinidae) to Novel Micro-Environmental Conditions: Shift in Shell Morphology and the Balance between Protection against Desiccation and Reproductive Success
VL  - 37
IS  - 2
SP  - 148-158
AB  - In the present study, we observed that Leptinaria unilamellata responds to changes in microclimatic conditions through shifts in shell morphology. Over three laboratory generations, shell differences between two populations, representing distinct morphotypes, became less evident. Only F1 generations from both populations showed shell morphometry very similar to the field parental snails, suggesting maternal effect. Snails from the locality with higher values of rainfall, relative humidity and evaporation index and smaller values of temperature and insolation produced more and larger hatchlings. Snails from the locality with less favorable climatic conditions presented shells traits that offer protection against desiccation, but reduce reproductive success. These snails showed smaller offspring production and faster response to a desiccation regime, through changes in conchiometrics. In addition, the results of the present study suggest that the spire index plays a less important role in determining protective properties of the shell of L. unilamellata, in response to desiccation risk, compared to aperture dimension. As shell aperture dimension is an important trait related to resistance to desiccation, and at the same time to reproduction, plastic responses to environmental conditions promoting the balance between survival and reproductive success are critical for the species adaptive success. © 2020 Zoological Society of Japan.

TI  - Temporal and spatial microbiome dynamics across natural populations of the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola
VL  - 98
IS  - 2
AB  - Host-symbiont interactions may form obligatory or facultative associations that are context dependent. Long-term studies on microbiome composition from wild populations should assess the temporal and spatial dynamics of host-microbe associations. We characterized the temporal and spatial variation in the bacterial microbiome composition in six populations of the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola for 2.5 years, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of whole spiders. Individuals within a nest exhibit highly similar microbiomes, which remain stable over several generations and are not predictably affected by seasonal variation in temperature or humidity. This stability in nest microbiome is likely due to social transmission, whereas drift-like processes during new nest foundations explain variation in host microbiomes between nests. This is supported by the lack of obligate symbionts (i.e. no symbionts are present in all spider individuals). Quantitative PCR analyses showed that the bacterial load of individual spiders is stable in healthy nests but can increase dramatically in perishing nests. These increases are not driven by specific bacterial taxa but likely caused by loss of host immune control under deteriorating conditions. Spider nests show an annual survival rate of approximately 45%, but nest death is not correlated to microbiome composition, and the bacteria found in S. dumicola are not considered to be high virulence pathogens. High temporal stability of the social spider microbiome, but nest death is often preceded by a massive increase in bacterial numbers.

TI  - The Structural Violence Trap: Disparities in Homicide, Chronic Disease Death, and Social Factors Across San Francisco Neighborhoods
VL  - 234
IS  - 1
SP  - 32-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: On average, a person living in San Francisco can expect to live 83 years. This number conceals significant variation by sex, race, and place of residence. We examined deaths and area-based social factors by San Francisco neighborhood, hypothesizing that socially disadvantaged neighborhoods shoulder a disproportionate mortality burden across generations, especially deaths attributable to violence and chronic disease. These data will inform targeted interventions and guide further research into effective solutions for San Francisco's marginalized communities. STUDY DESIGN: The San Francisco Department of Public Health provided data for the 2010-2014 top 20 causes of premature death by San Francisco neighborhood. Population-level demographic data were obtained from the US American Community Survey 2015 5-year estimate (2011-2015). The primary outcome was the association between years of life loss (YLL) and adjusted years of life lost (AYLL) for the top 20 causes of death in San Francisco and select social factors by neighborhood via linear regression analysis and heatmaps. RESULTS: The top 20 causes accounted for N = 15,687 San Francisco resident deaths from 2010-2014. Eight neighborhoods (21.0%) accounted for 47.9% of city-wide YLLs, with 6 falling below the city-wide median household income and many having a higher percent population Black, and lower education and higher unemployment levels. For chronic diseases and homicides, AYLLs increased as a neighborhood's percent Black, below poverty level, unemployment, and below high school education increased. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the mortality inequity burdening socially disadvantaged San Francisco neighborhoods, which align with areas subjected to historical discriminatory policies like redlining. These data emphasize the need to address past injustices and move toward equal access to wealth and health for all San Franciscans. Copyright © 2022 by The Author(s).

TI  - Operationalizing the net-negative carbon economy
VL  - 596

SP  - 377-383
AB  - The remaining carbon budget for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will probably be exhausted within this decade1,2. Carbon debt3 generated thereafter will need to be compensated by net-negative emissions4. However, economic policy instruments to guarantee potentially very costly net carbon dioxide removal (CDR) have not yet been devised. Here we propose intertemporal instruments to provide the basis for widely applied carbon taxes and emission trading systems to finance a net-negative carbon economy5. We investigate an idealized market approach to incentivize the repayment of previously accrued carbon debt by establishing the responsibility of emitters for the net removal of carbon dioxide through ‘carbon removal obligations’ (CROs). Inherent risks, such as the risk of default by carbon debtors, are addressed by pricing atmospheric CO2 storage through interest on carbon debt. In contrast to the prevailing literature on emission pathways, we find that interest payments for CROs induce substantially more-ambitious near-term decarbonization that is complemented by earlier and less-aggressive deployment of CDR. We conclude that CROs will need to become an integral part of the global climate policy mix if we are to ensure the viability of ambitious climate targets and an equitable distribution of mitigation efforts across generations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

TI  - Research on intelligent energy-saving design strategy of building thermal comfort experience in western Sichuan based on Climate Consultant software - - Take the unlimited bookstore of Santai Middle School in Mianyang city as an example
SP  - 173-178
AB  - Nowadays, cultural self-confidence is increasingly emphasized. The architectural field is also paying more and more attention to traditional Chinese architecture. The contemporary expression of the spatial characteristics of traditional buildings is especially valued. This article discusses the modern architectural space creation strategy based on the traditional architectural space composition of Western Sichuan. In addition, it was verified in practice with the unlimited bookstore project of Santai Middle School in Mianyang City. First, we conducted an analysis of climate adaptability in western Sichuan region through the Climate Consultant software. Then we adopted a combination of modern construction technology and materials to make the building sustainable. Finally, we come up with the modern translation strategy, which is based on the space of traditional buildings in Western Sichuan. That is, the modern translation of column and tie construction, reproduction of life scenes in the space under the eaves, and construction of the core space of the courtyard [1]. It is expected to provide a certain reference for the inheritance and development of traditional architecture in Western Sichuan. © 2022 ACM.

VL  - 11

AB  - Low temperature is a critical factor restricting the growth and survival of aquatic animals, but research on the mechanism of response to low temperature in Cherax destructor is limited. C. destructor is one of the most important freshwater crustaceans with strong adaptability in Australia, and it has been commercialized gradually in recent years. Here, growth indicators, antioxidant parameters, anti-stress gene expression, and transcriptome sequencing were used on crayfish following 8 weeks of low-temperature acclimation. The results showed that weight gain, length gain, and molting rates decreased as the temperature decreased. The activity of antioxidant enzymes decreased, while the content of antioxidant substances and the expression of anti-stress genes increased. Transcriptome sequencing identified 589 differentially expressed genes, 279 of which were upregulated and 310 downregulated. The gene functions and pathways for endocrine disorders, glucose metabolism, antioxidant defense, and immune responses were identified. In conclusion, although low-temperature acclimation inhibited the basal metabolism and immune ability of crayfish, it also increased the antioxidant substance content and anti-stress-gene expression to protect the organism from low-temperature damage. This study provided molecular insights into the study of low-temperature responses of low-temperature-tolerant crustacean species. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Mangroves are plants that can live in ecosystems with high salinity and are affected by waves and tides of seawater. The unique adaptability of mangroves allows them to become one of the contributors to aquatic productivity. Mangroves are susceptible to growing in habitats contaminated with waste, especially solid waste. This study aims to investigate the rehabilitation of mangrove vegetation. The research was conducted at three research stations representing the rehabilitation mangrove ecosystem in the mangrove area of BeeJay Bakau Resort, Probolinggo City, East Java, Indonesia. The mangrove vegetation data were collected using a systematic sampling technique based on the transect plot. Analysis of mangrove vegetation includes species density, relative density, species frequency, species relative frequency, species cover, species relative cover, and index of importance. The analysis showed three mangrove species found at the research stations, namely Rhizophora mucronata, Rhizophora stylosa, and Avicennia marina. The Importance Value Index (IVI) of mangroves at the three research stations showed that A. marina had the highest IVI value in both the tree and sapling categories. The condition of the aquatic environment in the area is classified as good, where the values of temperature, salinity, and pH can support mangrove growth well. © 2022, BIOFLUX SRL.

AB  - Today's industry presents many challenges whose the competitiveness weighs heavily on productivity. The future industry or industry 4.0 requires a new way for organizing industrial processes and must integrate smarter maintenance tools capable of greater adaptability in production. This new organization must respond to competitiveness challenges to achieve customer expectations but with a short deadline to market and an optimized cost production in terms of energy consumed reduced breakdowns, etc. One of the failures encountered in the industry, object of our study, is the unbalance corresponds to a rotor imbalance, shaft … due to the non-coincidence of the principal axe of inertia and the inertia center with the rotation axis. Our contribution is to develop the main components surveillance of an industrial installation continuously and follow the evolution through quantifiable and qualifiable data which allows preventing a dysfunction before stopping the production. This surveillance uses very precise predictive maintenance technologies and can tracks parameters in real time: vibration, consumed energy and the various components temperature. © 2022, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

VL  - 258
AB  - Rainbow trout is a new fish farming object for Uzbekistan, the adaptability of which (first of all, growth) to local conditions should be carefully studied. We analyzed the growth of rainbow trout in the conditions of flowing pools and cages in the foothill zone of Tashkent province of Uzbekistan. From March to October, the water temperature in the Khojikent reservoir varied from 4.9 to 13.1 °C, the amount of dissolved oxygen was 8.4 to 11.5 mg/l, and the pH was 7.40 to 7.67. In the flowing basin, the temperature was 15-18 °C, pH 7.2-7.5, the amount of dissolved oxygen 6.1-11.2 mg/l. The conditions of the foothill zones of Uzbekistan in terms of water quality are favorable for the development of trout breeding. During the season, fish in cages increased from 250 g to 623 g, in pools from 25 g to 390 g on average. The waste was 1.7%. The actual fish productivity of the basin is 39 kg/m3, the cage is 30 kg/m3 and the feed coefficient in the basin is 1.2, in the cages - 1.09. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.

AB  - The evolution of the global strategic situation following the Cold War suggests the need to expand the definition of national security to include environmental threats to stability. Environmental security refers to a range of security issues triggered or intensified by environmental factors such as climate change, resources, demographic factors, natural disasters, environmental change, and non-sustainable practices. Environmental stress has the potential to destabilize states, but especially in the developing world because they are characteristically more dependent on the environment for economic productivity and they lack the resiliency to overcome these challenges. This chapter does not suggest that environmental stress––alone––causes warfare. To be more precise, it can potentially trigger violent conflict in unique situations of extreme civil instability and within failing states. The problem that we face today is that the number of failing states is growing, and they are more vulnerable to instability caused by environmental stress because they suffer from four causally related effects: (1) reduced agricultural production; (2) economic decline; (3) population displacement; and (4) civil disruption. These effects determine the vulnerability and adaptability of a society. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 44

SP  - 69-76
AB  - Objective: This paper aims to clarify the status of surface fuel and corresponding fire behavior characteristics of pure Pinus yunnanensis stand under the conditions of periodic (burning cycle was 1 year) prescribed burning, and then explore the impact of prescribed burning on the fire behavior of surface fuel of P. yunnanensis, and reasonably evaluate the ecological significance of prescribed burning, so as to provide scientific basis for forest fire management and fighting. Method: Sampling in field investigation and simulating combustion in laboratory, using the SPSS23.0 to process and analyze the data, we explored the influence of fuel types, fuel loads, moisture content and other characteristics of prescribed burning on fire behavior such as the temperature of fire, flame height, thermal radiation, spread rate, burning rate, fire intensity, etc. in Zhaobi Mountain, Xinping County, Yuxi City, Yunnan Province of southwestern China. Result: (1) The main fuel on the surface of pure P. yunnanensis stand was the withered pine needles, plus a small amount of withered pine branches and cones and dead ferns, the species was relatively single, and most of the fuel under the forest was fine fuel. (2) From 2018 to 2020, the average moisture content of dead fuel under the pure forest of P. yunnanensis was 9.39%, 8.04% and 9.89%, and the average fuel loads were (0.937 ± 0.303) kg/m2, (0.926 ± 0.253) kg/m2 and (0.669 ± 0.248) kg/m2, respectively. (3) The simulated fire behavior in the laboratory included: the fire intensity was (245.95 ± 130.51) kW/m, the flame height was (0.92 ± 0.22) m, fire ground temperature was (437.5 ± 171.6) ℃, the thermal radiation was (6.3 ± 0.9) kW/m2, the spread rate was (1.1 ± 0.3) m/min, the ignition time of the surface fuel was 1 s and burning rate was about 62%. (4) The mortality of P.yunnanensis in natural state was about 1.33%. In the field survey in 2018 and 2020, the mortality of P. yunnanensis under prescribed burning was 0.93% and 1.27%, respectively.P. yunnanensis has certain fire resistance. Conclusion: (1) For the pure P. yunnanensis stand under periodic prescribed burning, the canopy density of the standing forest is large, and the combustible vegetation under the forest is less, mainly pine needle litter and grass. (2) Prescribed burning can effectively reduce the surface fuel load, and the average load of surface fuel is less than 1 kg/m2. During the fire prevention period, the moisture content of the dead fuel on the surface of P. yunnanensis forest is less than 10%, which is easy to be ignited, but the flame height is within the range of 0.5−1.5 m, and the fire intensity is less than 750 kW/m, which belongs to low intensity fire; the temperature of the fire ground is high, the thermal radiation is strong, the fire spread speed is general, and the fire field can be controlled; the simulated burning rate in the laboratory is high, and the combustion effect is good. (3) It is necessary and feasible to carry out periodic prescribed burning in fire prone habitats and forests with certain adaptability to fire.

AB  - Solar geoengineering has been receiving increased attention in recent years as a potential temporary solution to offset global warming. One method of approximating global-scale solar geoengineering in climate models is via solar reduction experiments. Two generations of models in the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) have now simulated offsetting a quadrupling of the CO<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula 2 concentration with solar reduction. This simulation is idealized and designed to elicit large responses in the models. Here, we show that energetics, temperature, and hydrological cycle changes in this experiment are statistically indistinguishable between the two ensembles. Of the variables analyzed here, the only major differences involve highly parameterized and uncertain processes, such as cloud forcing or terrestrial net primary productivity. We conclude that despite numerous structural differences and uncertainties in models over the past two generations of models, including an increase in climate sensitivity in the latest generation of models, the models are consistent in their aggregate climate response to global solar dimming. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

VL  - 556
AB  - Anthropogenic activity has created unique environmental drivers, which may interact to produce unexpected effects. My aim was to conduct a systematic review of the interactive effects of anthropogenic drivers on endocrine responses in non-human animals. The interaction between temperature and light can disrupt reproduction and growth by impacting gonadotropins, thyroid hormones, melatonin, and growth hormone. Temperature and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) interact to modify reproduction with differential effects across generations. The combined effects of light and EDCs can be anxiogenic, so that light-at-night could increase anxiety in wildlife. Light and noise increase glucocorticoid release by themselves, and together can modify interactions between individuals and their environment. The literature detailing interactions between drivers is relatively sparse and there is a need to extend research to a broader range of taxa and interactions. I suggest that incorporating endocrine responses into Adverse Outcome Pathways would be beneficial to improve predictions of environmental effects. © 2022

TI  - Variation in the β Diversity of Fish Species in Haizhou Bay
VL  - 28
IS  - 4
SP  - 451-459
AB  - Species diversity is one of the most important characteristics of biological communities and an important factor affecting the function and stability of ecosystems. The variation in diversity has been a topic of great interest in ecological research for many years, whereas β diversity, an important aspect of species diversity, has been studied in terrestrial ecosystems and freshwater ecosystems more than in marine ecosystems. Haizhou Bay is a traditional fishing ground in the Yellow Sea and historically has had rich fishery resources. However, the fishery resources in Haizhou Bay have seriously declined in recent years due to overfishing, environmental pollution, and human activities. The purpose of this study was to understand the temporal and spatial variation in β diversity of the fish species in Haizhou Bay to provide a scientific basis for the conservation of fishery resources and the construction of protected marine areas. The data in this study were collected from fishery resource surveys conducted in Haizhou Bay in the autumn of 2011 and 2013–2019 using bottom trawl. Non-parametric methods, including the Chao’s and Bootstrap approaches, were used to estimate the number of fish species, namely species richness, in the entire area of Haizhou Bay and in each sampling station. On this basis, β diversity was calculated according to the additive principle with a variety of measurement methods, including Sorenson’s index and Cody’s index, which reflects the similarity of species composition between the two groups and the substitutability between groups, respectively. To evaluate the spatial variation in β diversity, survey stations were divided into two groups along the 20 m isobath roughly by K-Means Cluster. The results of this study showed that the richness and β diversity of the fish species in Haizhou Bay decreased significantly in recent years, the Cody’s index decreased, and the Sorenson’s index increased slightly. The result reflected biotic homogenization in the marine ecosystem and it also indicated a remarkable difference in the trend of β diversity between deep water and shallow water. The decline in biodiversity has become a common phenomenon, which is closely related to human activities, especially long-term overfishing. In addition, environmental factors, especially the rise of sea water temperature, also contribute significantly to biotic homogenization. In summary, our research indicated that the abundance and β diversity of the fish species in Haizhou Bay decreased substantially from 2011 to 2019, and these changes were associated with the life history of fish species and their adaptability to the environment. These changes were also closely related to human activities, such as overfishing, environmental pollution, habitat destruction, and the water temperature increase caused by climate change. The driving mechanism remains to be further explored. In-depth studies on β diversity are helpful for understanding the fluctuation of marine fish communities, managing and protecting fishery resources, and providing a reference for constructing marine protected areas, which have great significance to the sustainable use of fishery resources and the protection of biodiversity. © 2021.

AB  - Thermoelectric generators have strong potential for aerospace and aircraft applications. However, traditional manufacturing methods for thermoelectric devices severely limit device adaptability and consequently marketability. Laser powder bed fusion is an additive manufacturing method which shows promising potential for producing thermoelectric devices. Thermoelectric materials pose unique challenges compared to metals because of low thermal conductivity, brittle fracture characteristics, and irregular powder particle morphologies. Herein, we communicate processing procedures to fabricate thermoelectric parts of Bi2Te3 through laser powder bed fusion. We identify the successful combination of key process parameters—laser power, scan speed, hatch distance, and powder layer thickness—to achieve high-quality parts in terms of density and physical properties, and we demonstrate the impact of process parameter variation on built part quality. While it cannot exclusively determine part quality, the volumetric energy density is a useful guide in deciding process parameters for thermoelectric materials, and the optimal value is between 9 and 11 J/mm3 for Bi2Te3. We demonstrate successful fabrication of different freeform geometries of Bi2Te3 powders. The results suggest it is possible to extend this method more broadly to other semiconductor materials, including thermoelectric power generation materials applicable for space applications. © 2022, ASM International.

TI  - Spatial distribution of butterflies in accordance with climate change in the Korean Peninsula
VL  - 12
IS  - 5
SP  - 1-18
AB  - The effects of climate change are becoming apparent in the biosphere. In the 20th century, South Korea experienced a 1.5 °C temperature increase due to rapid industrialization and urbanization. If the changes continue, it is predicted that approximately 15-37% of animal and plant species will be endangered after 2050. Because butterflies act as a good indicator for changes in the temperature, the distribution of butterflies can be used to determine their adaptability to climate patterns. Local meteorological data for the period 1938-2011 were used from the National Forest Research Institute of Korea. Local temperature data were additionally considered among the basic information, and the distribution patterns of butterflies were analyzed for both the southern and northern regions. Southern butterflies (with northern limit) tend to increase in number with significant correlation between the temperature and number of habitats (p < 0.000), while northern butterflies (with southern limit) show no statistical significance between the temperature and number of habitats, indicating their sensitivity to temperature change. This finding is in accordance with the conclusion that southern butterflies are more susceptible to climate change when adapting to local environments and expanding their original temperature range for survival, which leads to an increase in the numbers of their habitats. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Inactivation efficacy and mechanisms of plasma activated water on bacteria in planktonic state
VL  - 129
IS  - 5
SP  - 1248-1260
AB  - Aims: The study aimed to investigate the inactivation efficacy and mechanisms of plasma activated water (PAW) on selected bacteria in planktonic state. Methods and Results: Plasma activated water was generated using an atmospheric cold plasma jet at 15, 22 and 30 kV for 5 min. Escherichia coli, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Shewanella putrefaciens were selected as the representative bacterial species. Each bacterial suspension was inoculated into PAW immediately after generation, and the viable counts at different exposure times of 0·5, 1, 3, 5 and 24 h during 4°C storage were measured to determine the inactivation efficacy. Scanning electron microscopy images of the bacteria were conducted to examine the structural changes. Physicochemical properties of PAW, including pH, conductivity, oxidation reduction potential (ORP), and reactive species of H2O2, NO2− and NO3− were measured. The results demonstrated that inactivation efficacy was in positive correlation with voltage and exposure time. Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to PAW than Gram-positive bacteria. Morphology damage was observed for all the bacterial species. PAW was significantly acidified, conductivity and ORP were significantly increased, and reactive species were detectable after 48 h. Conclusions: This study offered a better understanding of the inactivation mechanisms of PAW, and the inactivation efficacy can be affected by voltage, exposure time and bacterial species. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study demonstrated the potential usage of PAW as an alternative disinfectant. © 2020 The Society for Applied Microbiology

TI  - An IoT SoC for Agricultural Applications
AB  - The constant growth of the population and the diminution of the arable land is a threat for the Humankind. Technology applied to agriculture can save the Humankind from a food and climate crisis. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) recommends to increase agricultural production by 70 % in 2050. On the other hand, agriculture is one of the major contributors to the global warming while it is one of the most adversely affected by this global warming. Therefore, it is important to increase productivity while preserving planetary boundaries. In this challenging context we propose to monitor the growth and health of plants by handling on the field parameters such as soil moisture, soil pH, soil temperature, soil salinity, etc. In order to do this, an Internet of Things (IoT) system has been designed. This system is based on a versatile System on a Chip (SoC), using the LoRa protocol for transmission and a low-power energy scheme to operate independently. The SoC processes locally the parameters on the edge and sends data to the cloud for analysis and prediction. It takes automatic actions and provides recommendations to the farmer. Low power, versatility, adaptability, edge computing, ease of use and low cost are the main constraints of the IoT system and the designed SoC. This paper details the design of the SoC architecture including the used design flow and the main results based on the specifications. © 2022 IEEE.

TI  - Joint influence of genetic origin and climate on the growth of Masson pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.) in China
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Adaptive of trees and its correlation with the climatic are causing changes in tree species performance and distribution, which will change breeding programs and influence forest productivity. To further evaluate the joint influence of climatic factors and provenance on the ring width (RW) and ring density (RD) of Masson pine. We selected 18 provenances at Chun’an (CA) and Taizi Mountain (TZS) test site, which representing four different breeding regions, including the south, west, north and east-central regions. The results showed that the provenance effects were significantly for the RW and RD. The provenances from high temperature and low latitude regions had greater mean RW compared to species from local and cold sources. The geographical genetic variation in wood traits is generally weak. The correlation between RW of Masson pine and precipitation was stronger in the relatively arid TZS site compared with that in relatively wet CA site, as well as the effect of temperature and precipitation on RD was earlier than that in CA test site. The response relationship between establishing the width of tree rings and the environmental variables of provenance indicated that during the transition from the northern and western breeding regions to the eastern and southern breeding regions, the response of RW to climate factors changed from being temperature-based to being precipitation-based. In addition, the response of provenance to the climate of seed sources origin showed their own variation characteristics in each breeding area. Therefore, genetic improvement of big diameter wood and wood density can be gain through selection of provenance and analysis of adaptability. © 2020, The Author(s).

TI  - Alternative eucalypts for commercial pulpwood production at moderately dry sites in the warm temperate zone of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa
VL  - 80
IS  - 2
SP  - 115-129
AB  - During 2001, a series of four site–taxa interaction trials was established in the warm temperate (mean annual temperature range 16–19 °C) forestry climatic zone of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. The main objective was to investigate the commercial forestry potential of a range of alternative Eucalyptus and Corymbia taxa for moderately dry (mean annual precipitation < 850 mm) sites within the zone. At rotation end, all trials received final standing tree measurements. At one of the sites (Rockvale), trees of eight promising alternative taxa were felled, stem measurements and wood samples taken, and wood and fibre productivities determined. On the basis of tree growth and wood and fibre production, C. citriodora subsp. variegata, C. henryi, E. badjensis, E. benthamii and E. dorrigoensis (listed alphabetically) demonstrated the greatest potential as commercial alternatives for moderately dry sites in the KZN warm temperate zone. The majority of these taxa showed strong site specificity. Eucalyptus benthamii was the only taxon showing high growth adaptability to the entire range of site conditions applied in the series. The non-susceptibility of C. citriodora subsp. variegata and C. henryi to the current topical insect pests Thaumastocoris peregrinus, Leptocybe invasa and Glycaspis brimblecombei elevates the appeal of these taxa as potential alternative planting choices for moderately dry sites within lower altitude (<1 100 m asl) areas of the climate zone. The matching of the most promising alternative taxa in the series to the range of sites encountered in moderately dry areas of the KZN warm temperate forestry zone is discussed in this paper. © 2017 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

TI  - Implicit and Explicit Measurement of Work-Related Age Attitudes and Age Stereotypes
VL  - 11
AB  - Age attitudes and age stereotypes in the workplace can lead to discrimination and impaired productivity. Previous studies have predominantly assessed age stereotypes with explicit measures. However, sole explicit measurement is insufficient because of social desirability and potential inaccessibility of stereotypical age evaluations to introspection. We aimed to advance the implicit and explicit assessment of work-related evaluations of age groups and age stereotypes and report data collected in three samples: students (n = 50), older adults (n = 53), and workers (n = 93). Evaluative age attitudes were measured implicitly with an Implicit Association Test. Regardless of group, age, and condition (neutral or semantically biased stimuli), the results confirm a stable, moderate implicitly measurable preference for younger over older workers. Whereas explicit measures of general age preferences showed no clear age preference, differentiated explicit measures of work-related age stereotypes also revealed stable preferences in all three samples: Younger workers were rated higher on performance and adaptability and older workers were rated higher on competence, reliability, and warmth. The explicit-implicit correlations were relatively low. Although explicit work-related age stereotypes are differentiated, the stable implicitly measured age bias raises concern. We suggest to apply implicit and explicit measures in the field of ageism in the workplace. © Copyright © 2020 Kleissner and Jahn.

TI  - Non-liquid alternative coolants in robotic machining
VL  - 2113
AB  - Robotic machining is starting to feature in the industry thanks to its high flexibility, adaptability, large workspace and low cost. In fact, many studies have already confirmed that robotic machining can be a real cost saving and flexible alternative to large scale conventional CNC machines, due to the aforesaid advantages. However, robotic machining operations are usually carried out in open environments in industrial companies, making conventional cooling systems (flood coolants such as neat oils or water-soluble oils) not directly applicable to them. Thus, the aim of this paper is to evaluate the possible implementation of different non-liquid alternative coolants such as gaseous nitrogen (N2), air, carbon dioxide (CO2) or argon (Ar) into robotic machining with the purpose of improving the current capability of this technology. To that end, different round turning tests were conducted on the 34CrNiMo6 alloyed steel, where several cooling conditions were applied: cryogenic nitrogen gas (2.5 bar), compressed air (2.5, 6.9 and 8 bar), cold compressed air (6.9 bar) and flood cooling (1 L/min). Results were compared against dry machining. Thereby, the study proved the analysed non-liquid alternative coolants to be a great option for robotic machining, since they were able to improve both the machining performance and productivity of dry machining. On the other hand, compressed air showed to be the most cost-effective solution among the alternative coolants, due to the high purchase price of the nitrogen (N2). © 2019 Author(s).

TI  - Gas Pool Coupled Activating TIG Welding Method with Coupling Arc Electrode
VL  - 31
IS  - 1
AB  - Gas pool coupled activating TIG (GPCA-TIG) welding put forward in-house can dramatically enhance weld penetration of TIG welding through introducing active element oxygen to reverse the Marangoni convection flow in the molten pool. In order to further improve the welding productivity, the normal solid tungsten electrode is replaced by a kind of coupling arc electrode. The changes of arc pressure distribution along anode surface and the weld appearance were evaluated. On this basis, the dependences of weld shape characterized with weld depth, width and undercut on the main welding parameters were discussed. The results indicate, the substitution of coupling arc electrode can lead to an obvious decrease of arc pressure. Compared to hollow tungsten electrode and twin tungsten electrodes, the coupling arc electrode is much easier to manufacture and has more compacter structure. Combined with the symmetric distribution of arc pressure in different directions, this electrode has extensive adaptability. In the GPCA-TIG welding with coupling arc electrode, both the substitution of coupling arc electrode and the introduction of outer active gas oxygen can reduce the possibilities of producing humping bead and undercut. Their joint action makes this welding method have the capability of realizing high travel speed and deep penetration welding. © 2018, The Author(s).

VL  - 6
IS  - 1
AB  - Windbreaks or shelterbelts are a management tool to protect crops from damaging horizontal wind flow, and may provide a useful buffer between farmland and urbanized areas by reducing pesticide drift, dust, and noise associated with farming activities. Plant selection for windbreaks in the Intermountain West can be difficult as high elevation coupled with extreme temperatures, high pH soils, and limited access to water are common. This study assessed eight tree species for suitability as a windbreak in the Intermountain West, with a particular focus on initial establishment and use at the urban–agriculture interface. Species were assessed for mortality, size, canopy density, insect and disease issues, and initial cost. Measurements of shadow characteristics were used as a novel approach to compare canopy density and porosity. Standard poplar (Populus x canadensis) and ‘Theves’ columnar poplar (Populus nigra ‘Afghanica’) were the most effective at rapid establishment, but species with more moderate growth rates, such as aspen, juniper, and hackberry, may provide lower long-term maintenance costs for the environmental conditions found in the Intermountain West. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Effects of 462 nm light-emitting diode on the inactivation of Escherichia coli and a multidrug-resistant by tetracycline photoreaction
VL  - 7
IS  - 9
AB  - The adaptability of bacterial resistance to antibiotics contributes to its high efficiency during evolution. Tetracycline (TC) is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent. Chromatographic analyses and mass spectrometry were used to study the effects of the light illumination of a 462 nm light-emitting diode (LED) on the conformational changes of TC in a phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.8). Especially, the inactivation of superoxide anion radicals (O2 •−) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), including that of a multidrug-resistant E. coli (MDR E. coli), were investigated during the photolysis of TC. A photolysis product of TC (PPT) was generated in an alkaline solution after the illumination of a blue light. The mass spectra of PPT had characteristic ion signals in m/z 459, 445, and 249.1 Da. The PPT has the molecular formula of C22 H22 N2 O9, and the exact mass is 458.44 g/mol. The inactivation of MDR E. coli is not significant with TC treatment. The drug-resistant ability of MDR E. coli has a less significant effect on PPT, and the changed conformation of TC retained the inactivation ability of MDR E. coli upon blue light photoreaction. With TC, illuminated by a blue light in a pH 7.8 PBS, O2 •− was generated from TC photolysis, which enhanced the inactivation of E. coli and MDR E. coli. A 96.6% inactivation rate of MDR E. coli was reached with TC under 2.0 mW/cm2 blue light illumination at 25 ± 3° C for 120 min, and the effects of the TC-treated photoreaction on MDR E. coli viability repressed the growth of MDR E. coli by 4 to 5 logs. The present study of the blue light photoreaction of TC offers a new approach to the inactivation of MDR E. coli. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Coping with the impacts of urban heat islands. A literature based study on understanding urban heat vulnerability and the need for resilience in cities in a global climate change context
VL  - 171
SP  - 1140-1149
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) is a phenomenon whereby temperature levels in urban areas are higher than in surrounding rural settings. Urban heat islands are a matter of increasing concern, since they can affect communities by exacerbating air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions (due to the greater use of air conditioning) and the occurrence of heat-related illness, and may lead to higher levels of mortality. This paper provides a description of the phenomena of (UHI) and an analysis of how cities are vulnerable to it. It highlights the need for resilience and the variety of means by which the UHI can be tackled. It describes a set of trends in two regions in Germany and Australia, which illustrate the scope of the problem in the northern and southern hemispheres, and the scale of vulnerability. Then, existing UHI vulnerability assessments are analysed to highlight common features and differences. Based on this, we propose a classification of adaptability parameters to support vulnerability assessments. The paper also discusses current mitigation approaches mentioned in the literature, and how these address some vulnerabilities. It concludes that both a better understanding of the UHI phenomena and consideration of the particular context of each city is needed to make urban areas more resilient to UHI. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Sea urchin embryos have been used for more than a century in the study of fertilization and early development. However, several of the species used, such as Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, have long generation times making them suboptimal for transgenerational studies. Results: Here, we present an overview of the development of a rapidly developing echinoderm species, Lytechinus pictus, from fertilization through sexual maturation. When grown at room temperature (20°C) embryos complete the first cell cycle in 90 minutes, followed by subsequent cleavages every 45 minutes, leading to hatching at 9 hours postfertilization (hpf). The swimming embryos gastrulate from 12 to 36 hpf and produce the cells which subsequently give rise to the larval skeleton and immunocytes. Larvae begin to feed at 2 days and metamorphose by 3 weeks. Juveniles reach sexual maturity at 4 to 6 months of age, depending on individual growth rate. Conclusions: This staging scheme lays a foundation for future studies in L. pictus, which share many of the attractive features of other urchins but have the key advantage of rapid development to sexual maturation. This is significant for multigenerational and genetic studies newly enabled by CRISPR-CAS mediated gene editing. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

TI  - Production of haploid gynogens to inform genomic resource development in the paleotetraploid pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus)
VL  - 538
AB  - Order Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefishes) is an ancient lineage of osteichthyan fishes (>200 million years old) with most extant species at conservation risk. A relatively basal species, the pallid sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus albus, is a federally endangered species native to the Mississippi and Missouri River basins. Hybridization with sympatric shovelnose sturgeon, S. platorynchus, is one of several threats to pallid sturgeon. Current molecular markers cannot reliably distinguish among pure species and multigenerational backcrosses. This information is critical for implementation of management strategies to increase populations through natural reproduction and artificial propagation. Genotypes from a large panel of unlinked single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may provide greater resolution of the two species; however, paralogous sequence variants (PSVs) within individuals resulting from an ancient whole genome duplication event confound SNP development. The aim of this study was to produce pallid sturgeon gynogens that contain 100% homozygous DNA contributed by only the maternal parent and have enough DNA for future SNP marker development. When homozygous gynogens are sequenced, heterozygosity at a locus within an individual indicates the presence of incorrectly aligned sequences that contain PSVs; accurate identification of these multi-locus contigs can facilitate their exclusion when developing disomic markers. In this study, we attempted to produce two types of pallid sturgeon gynogens: a) haploid gynogens produced from the activation of pallid sturgeon eggs with ultraviolet-irradiated sperm from the distantly related paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), and b) doubled haploids produced from the activation of pallid sturgeon eggs with irradiated paddlefish milt followed by thermal shock to suppress the first mitotic division. Production of doubled haploids, gynogens with 100% homozygous DNA and double the genome content of haploid gynogens, was pursued because it was originally unknown if haploid gyongens would survive long enough to attain enough genetic material for SNP marker development. We performed flow cytometry and microsatellite genotyping on the specimens in order to confirm haploid and doubled haploid status. Our study was unable to successfully yield doubled haploids; however, we successfully produced haploid gynogens that contained enough nuclear DNA for our future SNP marker development study. Interestingly, this study also produced paddlefish × pallid sturgeon hybrids in the control groups in two separate years; this is the first study to report viable offspring between the paddlefish and a Scaphirhynchus sturgeon species and reflects on the malleability of the genomes of the species in this order. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The accuracy of genomic predictions for bacterial cold water disease resistance remains higher than the pedigree-based model one generation after model training in a commercial rainbow trout breeding population
VL  - 545
AB  - Bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) causes significant mortality and economic losses in salmonid aquaculture. Previously, we reported high genomic prediction accuracy of 0.72 for BCWD resistance in rainbow trout using the 57 K Axiom SNP array. Due to the high cost of phenotyping and genotyping in rainbow trout breeding programs, it is paramount to know if acceptable genomic prediction accuracy can be obtained in the subsequent generation without retraining the prediction model. In the current study, we found that the accuracy of genomic prediction without model retraining in the subsequent generation was reduced from 0.65 and 0.61 to 0.56 and 0.53 using a lower density array of 10 K SNPs and a panel of 49 QTL-linked SNPs, respectively. Although markedly lower than the genomic prediction with model retraining, the prediction accuracy without retraining was better than the pedigree-based model (PBLUP) with retraining (0.48) and substantially higher than the PBLUP model accuracy without retraining (0.22). We conclude that genomic selection provides better prediction accuracy than the traditional PBLUP model even when ‘skipping’ one generation of model retraining. The weighted single-step GBLUP (wssGBLUP) and single-step Bayesian multiple regression BayesB (ssBMR-BayesB) had higher genomic prediction accuracy than single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP), which is consistent with the oligogenic inheritance of BCWD resistance in this population. Imputation from the 10 K array genotypes back to the 57 K array genotypes did not improve the accuracy of genomic prediction, likely due to the high linkage disequilibrium in rainbow trout aquaculture breeding populations and the oligogenic architecture of BCWD resistance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 440
AB  - The characteristics of submerged macrophytes communities, water environment factors and substrate environmental factors of Lake Qionghai wetland were investigated in April 2018 by laying out 21 sample points. A total of 8 submerged macrophytes species were recorded in the 21 sample points. Myriophyllum spicatum, Vallisneria natans, Ceratophyllum demersum, and Potamogeton malaianus were the main submerged macrophytes species in Lake Qionghai wetland. The depth of submerged macrophytes was less than 2m, and submerged plants were found in most areas of lakeside zone. Submerged macrophytes had a strong adaptability to substrate, it could grow in artificial stacked group rocks, natural lakeside stone sand, natural alluvial river sand, loess and silt, etc, but the substrate with high nutrition was more favorable to the growth of submerged macrophytes than the substrate with low nutrition. Water nutrients, bottom nutrients and water depth are the decisive factors affecting the growth of submerged macrophytes, while transparency, chemical oxygen demand, light, temperature, water flow and pH are the decisive factors affecting the survival of submerged macrophytes. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

VL  - 29
IS  - 2
SP  - 1044-1052
AB  - Sub-health is a state of mind and body between health and disease. It often manifests as depression, irritability, depression, anxiety, insomnia, lack of energy, and susceptibility to colds. Chinese traditional sports Taijiquan is the use of "yin and yang opening and closing to move the whole body" to achieve the purpose of strengthening the body. It has the characteristics of rigidity and softness, combination of dynamic and static, and physical fitness. It is a good health exercise. The purpose of this article is to study the effect of Taijiquan on sub-health status under a cloth microscope. The research object selected in this article is students. Experimental data show that Tai Chi exercise has a significant therapeutic effect on improving the sub-health status of college students. Conditions such as decreased memory and reduced adaptability have been significantly improved. Experimental data show that Taijiquan has a significant effect on the treatment of sub-health symptoms of college students, with an effective rate of more than 80%. The experimental subjects in the experimental group have significant changes in scores before and after the experiment, and have significant differences (P <0.05). Therefore, it is suggested that public physical education courses in universities should address the phenomenon that some students are physically weak and in a sub-health state. Under the guidance of "health first", vigorously promote health care that has health effects such as Tai Chi and can also improve students' physical health course. © 2020, Interamerican Society for Electron Microscopy (CIASEM).

VL  - 24

SP  - 1016-1030
AB  - Buildings are responsible for approximately 36% of carbon emissions in the European Union. Besides, gradual aging and a lack of adaptability and flexibility of buildings often lead to destructive interventions, resulting not only in higher costs but also in a large amount of construction and demolition waste (CDW). Recently, an innovative system (Ref. VEEP project) has been developed to recycle CDW for the manufacturing of energy-efficient prefabricated concrete elements (PCE) for new building construction. By applying life cycle costing (LCC) and life cycle assessment (LCA), this study aimed to determine whether the use of VEEP PCE leads to lower carbon emission and lower associated costs over the life cycle of an exemplary four-story residential building in the Netherlands than a business-as-usual (BAU) PCE scenario. This paper provides a case study on the alignment and/or integration of LCA and LCC in an independent and a combined manner (via monetization). This study examines how the internalization of carbon emission and discount rate will affect the final life cycle costs over a 40-year life span. The simulation results show that the key to economic viability and environmental soundness of VEEP PCE is to reduce production cost and to optimize the thermal performance of the novel isolation material Aerogel; internalization of external cost monetarizes the environmental advantage thus slightly expands the cost advantage of low carbon options, but leads to larger uncertainty about the LCC result. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Essential role of a Plasmodium berghei heat shock protein (PBANKA_0938300) in gametocyte development
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - The continued existence of Plasmodium parasites in physiologically distinct environments during their transmission in mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts requires effector proteins encoded by parasite genes to provide adaptability. Parasites utilize their robust stress response system involving heat shock proteins for their survival. Molecular chaperones are involved in maintaining protein homeostasis within a cell during stress, protein biogenesis and the formation of protein complexes. Due to their critical role in parasite virulence, they are considered targets for therapeutic interventions. Our results identified a putative P. berghei heat shock protein (HSP) belonging to the HSP40 family (HspJ62), which is abundantly induced upon heat stress and expressed during all parasite stages. To determine the role HspJ62, a gene-disrupted P. berghei transgenic line was developed (ΔHspJ62), which resulted in disruption of gametocyte formation. Such parasites were unable to form subsequent sexual stages because of disrupted gametogenesis, indicating the essential role of HspJ62 in gametocyte formation. Transcriptomic analysis of the transgenic line showed downregulation of a number of genes, most of which were specific to male or female gametocytes. The transcription factor ApiAP2 was also downregulated in ΔHspJ62 parasites. Our findings suggest that the downregulation of ApiAP2 likely disrupts the transcriptional regulation of sexual stage genes, leading to impaired gametogenesis. This finding also highlights the critical role that HspJ62 indirectly plays in the development of P. berghei sexual stages and in facilitating the conversion from the asexual blood stage to the sexual stage. This study characterizes the HspJ62 protein as a fertility factor because parasites lacking it are unable to transmit to mosquitoes. This study adds an important contribution to ongoing research aimed at understanding gametocyte differentiation and formation in parasites. The molecule adds to the list of potential drug targets that can be targeted to inhibit parasite sexual development and consequently parasite transmission. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Isolation and identification of chromium reducing bacillus cereus species from chromium-contaminated soil for the biological detoxification of chromium
VL  - 17
IS  - 6
AB  - Chromium contamination has been an increasing threat to the environment and to human health. Cr(VI) and Cr(Ⅲ) are the most common states of chromium. However, compared with Cr( Ⅲ), Cr(VI) is more toxic and more easily absorbed, therefore, it is more harmful to human beings. Thus, the conversion of toxic Cr(VI) into Cr(Ⅲ) is an accepted strategy for chromium detoxification. Here, we isolated two Bacillus cereus strains with a high chromium tolerance and reduction ability, named B. cereus D and 332, respectively. Both strains demonstrated a strong pH and temperature adaptability and survival under 8 mM Cr(VI). B. cereus D achieved 87.8% Cr(Ⅵ) removal in 24 h with an initial 2 mM Cr(VI). Cu(Ⅱ) was found to increase the removal rate of Cr(VI) significantly. With the addition of 0.4 mM Cu(Ⅱ), 99.9% of Cr(Ⅵ) in the culture was removed by B. cereus 332 in 24 h. This is the highest removal efficiency in the literature that we have seen to date. The immobilization experiments found that sodium alginate with diatomite was the better method for immobilization and B. cereus 332 was more efficient in immobilized cells. Our research provided valuable information and new, highly effective strains for the bioremediation of chromium pollution. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Antibacterial activity of polygonum orientale extracts against clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, the agent of bacterial canker of tomato disease
VL  - 62
AB  - Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis (Cmm), which is a Gram positive bacterium, causes the bacterial canker of tomato disease. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Polygonum orientale extracts against Cmm. In this study firstly, effects of three extracting parameters (extractive time, extractive temperature, and solid to liquid ratio) of orthogonal experiment design L27(313) were conducted. Secondly, survival rate was determined and inhibition zone of Cmm rescued post-stress was monitored. Finally, extracellular OD260nm value, extracellular protein content, conformational structure of membrane protein, extracellular alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity, and ATPase activity were measured to investigate the antibacterial mechanism. Results of orthogonal experiment revealed that extractive time and extractive temperature had highly significant (PO.01) effects on the antibacterial activity of P. orientale extracts. The optimum conditions were as follows: 10h of extractive time, 60°C of extractive temperature, and 1:20 (g:mL) of solid to liquid ratio. This study also demonstrated that the living cells of each sample from survival rate test had almost no resistance or adaptability, and rescued Cmm cells were much easier to be inhibited by P. orientale extracts. The results of antibacterial mechanism indicated that cell membrane and cell wall of Cmm were seriously damaged by P. orientale extracts, and P. orientale extracts reduced the intracellular ATPase activity dramatically. All these findings suggested that P. orientale extracts had a strong antibacterial activity to inhibit Cmm, and could be used for the ecological management of the bacterial canker of tomato disease. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - With the rapid development of the society and economy as well as the growth of population, the contradiction between our country's timber supply and demand is still prominent, and its dependence on foreign countries is high. Faced with limited land resources, there is an urgent need to cultivate forest resources more efficiently and with high quality, and to apply precision silviculture technologies in various links such as directive breeding and intensive management. The multi-platform, multi-angle, multi-mode three-dimensional observation system and quantitative analysis method constructed by modern remote sensing technology are the key technologies for precision silviculture. The integrated and accurate new precision silviculture system, built with remote sensing technology as the core, from soil type analysis, land adaptability evaluation, ecological environment simulation to tree breeding, irrigation and fertilization, forest growth monitoring, pest control, etc., will fully support the overall quality and efficiency improvement of modern forestry as well as the precise improvement of forest quality. This review article first introduces the application status of RGB cameras, multispectral, hyperspectral, LiDAR, thermal infrared and fluorescence sensors in precision silviculture, and makes a comprehensive comparison of their application characteristics and measurement indicators; then, focuses on the use of remote sensing in the three key application directions i.e., high-quality species selection, monitoring and diagnosis of nutrient stress, accurate water and fertilizer sprinkler irrigation, as well as the analysis of the common needs of each application direction; finally, from three aspects, i.e., multi-source remote sensing information fusion, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and 3S technology integration, and the integrated application of remote sensing data with physiological and ecological models and radiation transmission models, the development trend and application prospects of future remote sensing technology in precision silviculture are analyzed. © 2021, Science Press.

TI  - Modelling Drosophila suzukii adult male populations: A physiologically based approach with validation
VL  - 11
IS  - 11
SP  - 1-15
AB  - Simple Summary Drosophila suzukii is an injurious insect pest infesting soft fruit cultivations worldwide. In the recent years, it has spread in new territories, favored by its capability of adapting in new environments. Because of the severe reduction of the yields in cultivated fields, mainly due to the feeding and ovipositional activities, several studies were conducted on the side of the control strategies. However, the cost of the active ingredients, and the safeguard of the environmental and human health led scientists to introduce new tools for decision making. Among the latter, mathematical models play an important role, since their capability to summarize a pool of biological information such that the relations between the species and the external environment. The development and validation of mathematical models which faithfully describe the life cycle of ectotherms, as insects are, provide reliable tools to use in an integrated pest management framework. This work extends the application of a physiologically based model in the case study of D. suzukii, providing a validation in the case of an insect pest relevant in agriculture, and an accurate estimation of a set of biological parameters. The Spotted Wing Drosophila (SWD), Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura), is a harmful insect pest for soft fruit cultivations. Even though its main hosts belong to the genera Prunus and Rubus, its high polyphagy and adaptability to new environments makes it a serious problem for farmers worldwide, who have reported several economic losses because of this pest. A wide series of proposals to control SWD are available and operate in line with the mechanisms of integrated pest management, demonstrating their high efficiency when applied at the opportune moment. This work aims to apply and validate a physiologically based model which summarises all the available information about D. suzukii biology, such as the relationship between environmental temperature and its development, fertility and mortality rates. The model provided, as a result, a description of a population of SWD females taking into consideration the multiple generations that occurred during the year. Simulations were then compared with field data collected in a three-year survey in two experimental fields located in the Sabina Romana area (Lazio, Italy). More specifically, D. suzukii males were monitored with traps in fields cultivated with mixed varieties of cherries and they were selected because of their clearer identification in comparison to females. Results showed a high level of reliability of simulations in representing the field data, highlighting at the same time that there is no discrepancy in simulating D. suzukii females in order to represent male populations.

TI  - Traits for stress-tolerance are associated with long-term plant survival on green roofs
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Green roofs may contribute to biodiversity conservation. However, these habitats are not typically planted to support biodiversity and are not monitored to see how communities change over time. Plants on green roofs must be adapted to high stress caused by drought and severe temperatures. Over several generations, plant functional diversity may decrease, as only species able to colonize and survive in harsh habitats persist. If particular traits aid in survival, careful species selection could direct the trajectory of green roof succession and ensure future biodiversity support. In this study, we used long-term vegetation surveys from six green roofs in northeast Germany to discern patterns of plant traits and functional diversity. To determine if site managers could predict future green roof diversity by extrapolating from a common pattern of change, we compared our results with analyses of a chronosequence (1-93 years since establishment) of 13 sites in the same region. We also measured site-level properties of the chronosequence sites to explore factors other than time that may contribute to functional diversity. We found that plant functional diversity generally increased during an initial establishment period but subsequently decreased. Mature communities were primarily made up of species highly tolerant of stress and repeated disturbance. Our results differed slightly between the long-term and chronosequence site types, highlighting the uniqueness of green roof communities. Site-specific factors, including building height, vegetated area, soil depth and soil water-holding capacity, likely contribute to plant functional diversity on green roofs. ©The Author(s) 2018.

VL  - 38
IS  - 4
SP  - 628-640
AB  - Winter survival develops efficient tolerance mechanisms in plants by regulating cold-responsive and cold-regulated genes at the transcriptional level. Hence, an insight into the expression would provide the molecular function of these cold responsive genes. In this study, an uncharacterized gene encoding a cold-regulated (Cor413) protein identified from Saccharum spontaneum (wild relative species of sugarcane) low-temperature transcriptome with environmental adaptability is isolated and characterized. The full-length coding region possesses an open reading frame of 642 bp, which encodes a putative polypeptide of 213 amino acids of molecular weight 25.6 kDa and an isoelectric point (Pi) of 9.69. The SsCor413 sequence showed a high similarity to monocot Cor413 proteins comprising a WCOR413 domain. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that Cor413 protein has multispanning transmembrane helices along with highly conserved phosphorylation sites. String analysis suggested that SsCor413 is grouped with LEA and Rab proteins that are involved in freezing tolerance. Gene ontology analysis assigned the protein to terms such as “plasma membrane,” “cold acclimation,” and “response to cold.” Sub-cellular localization experiments of sugarcane callus and onion epidermal cells indicated the nuclear localized expression. Quantitative gene expression analysis indicated that the SsCor413 gene is up-regulated in leaf and root tissues of S. spontaneum under low temperature, salinity, and water deficit stress conditions. These results highlight the potential role of SsCor413 in abiotic stress tolerance, and this gene could be a new candidate for combating multiple stresses in sugarcane. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 42
IS  - 6
AB  - With the rise in wearable technology and “health culture”, we are seeing an increasing interest and affordances in studying how to not only prolong life expectancy but also in how to improve individuals’ quality of life. On the one hand, this attempts to give meaning to the increasing life expectancy, as living above a certain threshold of pain and lack of autonomy or mobility is both degrading and unfair. On the other hand, it lowers the cost of continuous care, as individuals with high quality of life indexes tend to have lower hospital readmissions or secondary complications, not to mention higher physical and mental health. In this paper, we evaluate the current state of the art in physiological therapy (biofeedback) along with the existing medical grade and consumer grade hardware for physiological research. We provide a quick primer on the most commonly monitored physiologic metrics, as well as a brief discussion on the current state of the art in biofeedback-assisted medical applications. We then go on to present a comparative analysis between medical and consumer grade biofeedback devices and discuss the hardware specifications and potential practical applications of each consumer grade device in terms of functionality and adaptability for controlled (laboratory) and uncontrolled (field) studies. We end this article with some empirical observations based on our study so that readers might use take them into consideration when arranging a laboratory or real-world experience, thus avoiding costly time delays and material expenditures. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 13
IS  - 6
AB  - The potential correlation between fir tree-ring width (Abies borisii regis Mattf.) variability and the respective variability of the main climatic parameters in the region of University Forest of Pertouli (central Greece) are being analyzed in the current study, taking into consideration a 60-year period (1961–2020). Correlation and response function analyses were applied to examine the climate–tree-growth relationship. Precipitation was found to be the most crucial and driving factor that most intensively influences the tree growth of A. borisii-regis trees under Mediterranean climate conditions. It was evident that this species is characterized by drought sensitivity and even a short and mild drought event could significantly influence adversely its growth and productivity. June, May and July precipitation present the higher and statistically significant correlation of monthly precipitation with tree-ring width, affecting the ring-width variability by 31.2%. Temperature (mean, max or min) does not seem to highly influence the tree growth, despite the obvious and statistically significant trend increase that has been recorded in the last decades within the frame of climate change. June maximum temperature presents a strong negative correlation with tree-ring width, while April maximum temperature is positively correlated with tree-ring width. The combined impact of precipitation and max temperatures on tree-ring growth is 38.5%. Snow did not reveal any statistically significant correlation to tree-ring width, independent of the height of monthly snow accumulation. A. borisii-regis grown in high altitudes in the Mediterranean region demonstrate high adaptability to the recorded temperature increase and could potentially be able to adapt in future to even warmer climate conditions. The constructed tree-ring chronology could be utilized towards the implementation of further dendroclimatological analyses and climate reconstruction. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of this research was to study a promising MD 1–17 Melissa officinalis L. subsp. altissima (Smith.) Arcang. variety sample obtained in the collection of the gene pool of the Research Institute of Agriculture of Crimea (RIAC) in comparison with Krymchanka (selected in the RIAC) and Lada (selected in the All-Russian research Institute of medicinal and aromatic plants(VILAR) varieties of lemon balm M. officinalis L. subsp. officinalis. In 2017–2019, in the Department of Essential Oil and Medicinal Plants of the RIAC,a competitive variety trial of lemon balm varieties was conducted in accordance with the methodological recommendations for the selection of essential-oil plants. A territory where this study was conducted belongs to one of the five agroclimatic regions – the upper piedmont, warm, not enough humid; to the northern subarea with moderately mild winters. Weather conditions during the years of competitive variety trial varied significantlya fact that allowed assessing the adaptability of studied variety samples and forecasting the nature of productivity potential realization in different growing conditions. As a result, it was found that MD 1–17 variety sample significantly exceeds other varieties in terms of yield of fresh raw materials, on average, by 62.2 and 77.4%, and in yield of air-dried raw materials, on average, by 32.2 and 52.2%, respectively. In terms of obtaining essential oil from air-dried raw materials, this variety sample exceeds the best in this parameter Crimean variety Krymchanka by 56.3%. Basic components of its essential oil are caryophyllene (25.3–35.9%) and germacrene D (17.7–31.2%) with almost complete absence or insignificant amount of citral (0.1–7.3%); the proportion of latter in essential oils of Krymchanka and Lada varieties can reach 36.6% or more. Novelty of this study includes the creation of the first variety of a new promising essential oil plant –M. altissima. Raw materials of this variety and products of its processing may be of interest for different ways of use, including the perfumery and cosmetics industry, for food purposes as a component of tea compositions, etc. © 2020, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool.

TI  - Pennycress (Thlaspi arvense) a new non-food crop for oil-based biofuel production in Europe and USA
VL  - 2018
SP  - 123-126
AB  - The development of alternative feedstocks for producing oil-based biofuels needs to meet the majority of the following criteria: low cost, high oil content, low agricultural inputs, favorable fatty acid (FA) composition, compatibilitywith existing farm equipment and infrastructure, production in off-season from conventional commodity crops, adaptability to marginal/idle lands, and viable markets for co-products such as seed meal. Recently a “potential weed”, pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) has become one of the most attractive new non-food oil crops. Pennycress is highly tolerant to low temperatures, tolerating temperatures below-15°C after reaching a 4-to-6-leaves rosette stage. The seed contains up to 37% oil (DM) with the major fatty acid as erucic (36%). The fatty acid composition in pennycress has been shown to have physical properties suitable for biofuels like biodiesel and hydro-treated renewable jet fuel (HRJ). In the last decade, pennycress has attracted increasing interest as a potential oilseed for biofuel production in the USA, either biodiesel and/or jet fuel, in Europe very few studies have specifically focused on pennycress. In the present study, we compared the productivity of pennycress in response to environment in two European countries, Italy (Bologna) and Greece (Aliartos), and in two USA states, Illinois (Peoria) and Minnesota (Morris). Seed yield, seed oil content and oil compositions were evaluated in response to growing environment. Representative seed samples from each study location was solvent extracted for total oil recovery and compared across locations. © 2018 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

VL  - 12
AB  - Yaks (Bos grunniens) live primarily in high-altitude hypoxic conditions and have a unique intestinal micro-ecosystem, remarkable adaptability, and strong climatic resistance. Accumulating evidence revealed the importance of probiotics in host metabolism, gut microbiota, growth performance, and health. The goal of this study was to screen out probiotics with excellent probiotic potential for clinical application. In this study, four strains of Bacillus, i.e., Bacillus proteolyticus (named Z1 and Z2), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (named J), and Bacillus subtilis (named K), were isolated and identified. Afterward, their probiotic potential was evaluated. Antioxidant activity tests revealed that Z1 had the highest DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, whereas Z2 had higher reducing power and inhibited lipid peroxidation. Additionally, the antibacterial testing revealed that all strains were antagonistic to three indicator pathogens, Escherichia coli C83902, Staphylococcus aureus BNCC186335, and Salmonella enteritidis NTNC13349. These isolates also had a higher hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, and acid and bile tolerance, all of which helped to survive and keep dangerous bacteria out of the host intestine. Importantly, all strains could be considered safe in terms of antibiotic susceptibility and lack of hemolysis. In conclusion, this is the first study to show that B. proteolyticus and B. amyloliquefaciens isolated from yaks have probiotic potential, providing a better foundation for future clinical use. © Copyright © 2021 Zeng, He, Li, Zhang, Huang, Wang, Li, Bao, Iqbal, Fakhar-e-Alam Kulyar and Li.

AB  - As opposed to remarkable advances in the cell therapy industry, research reveal inexplicable difficulties associated with preserving and post-thawing cell death. Post cryopreservation apoptosis is a common occurrence that has attracted the attention of scientists to use apoptosis inhibitors. Transporting cells without compromising their survival and function is crucial for any experimental cell-based therapy. Preservation of cells allows the safe transportation of cells between distances and improves quality control testing in clinical and research applications. The vitality of transported cells is used to evaluate the efficacy of transportation strategies. For many decades, the conventional global methods of cell transfer were not only expensive but also challenging and had adverse effects. The first determination of some projects is optimizing cell survival after cryopreservation. The new generation of cryopreservation science wishes to find appropriate and alternative methods for cell transportation to ship viable cells at an ambient temperature without dry ice or in media-filled flasks. The diversity of cell therapies demands new cell shipping methodologies and cryoprotectants. In this review, we tried to summarize novel improved cryopreservation methods and alternatives to cryopreservation with safe and viable cell shipping at ambient temperature, including dry preservation, hypothermic preservation, gel-based methods, encapsulation methods, fibrin microbeads, and osmolyte solution compositions. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

TI  - Warmer winters increase the breeding success of the Goosander in the Pomeranian Lake District in Poland
VL  - 69
IS  - 3
SP  - 31-40
AB  - Northern Hemisphere species generally respond to global warming by withdrawing from the southern margins of their distributions and shifting their breeding sites northwards. However, the situation regarding the breeding populations of Goosanders Mergus merganser merganser in Europe appears to be paradoxical: in many places, an increase in the breeding population and range extension have been documented. We studied the breeding biology of this species during the breeding seasons of 1987-1996. We show that the breeding success of a Goosander population breeding in Northern Poland was higher following winters when the ice cover disappeared earlier. There was a significant positive relationship between the disappearance of ice cover and the clutch initiation date, and the breeding success of early broods was higher. The overall mean clutch initiation date was 13 April ± 15 days (SD). The yearly means of clutch initiation dates varied from the beginning of April to the beginning of May. It seems likely that, among other factors, the Goosander's adaptability in terms of the timing of breeding may be partially responsible for the expansion of the species into new areas in the last 30 years. © 2021 Polish Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Functional response of Amblyseius eharai (Acari: Phytoseiidae) on Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae)
VL  - 16
IS  - 12
AB  - Amblyseius eharai is a generalist predatory mite that consumes spider mites, rust mites, thrips, and pollen, with a high adaptability to various plants. To better understand ecological and behavioral aspects of this species, we investigated its functional response to different stages of two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. Furthermore, we compared its environmental adaptability with that of other referenced phytoseiids using a temperature-dependent model of the intrinsic rate of increase. We were able to calculate the functional response parameters of both sexes of A. eharai when preying on eggs or larvae of T. urticae and, for females only, when preying on the deutonymph of T. urticae. Among the various combinations tested herein, A. eharai females preying on T. urticae larvae had the highest attack rate and shortest handling time. For eggs of T. urticae, A. eharai showed a lower attack rate; however, its handling time for eggs was significantly shorter compared to other phytoseiids. Using T. urticae larva as a prey, the attack rate of female A. eharai was higher and the handling time of both sexes of this species was shorter than those of other phytoseiid mites. Amblyseius eharai populations can show maximum performance quickly due to this species’ lower optimal temperature for population growth (28.1C) compared to other phytoseiid mites. Thus, we provided evidence that this predatory mite has the potential to be a new, effective biological control agent of greenhouse pests such as T. urticae due to its high predation capacity and low optimal temperature. © 2021 Park et al.

TI  - Assessing Changes in the Value of Forest Ecosystem Services in Response to Climate Change in China
VL  - 14
IS  - 8
AB  - Ecosystem services are the basis of human survival and development and play an irreplaceable role in maintaining the dynamic balance of the earth’s life support system and environment. This study evaluated the annual forest ecosystem service values (ESVs) and their spatial evolution characteristics from 2001 to 2020 in China and revealed the impact of climatic factors as well. The equivalent factor method was applied to calculate ESVs in combination with net primary productivity (NPP) calculated by the CASA model. The water conservation results based on the InVEST model and equivalent factor method were compared to test the reliability of the method. From 2001 to 2020, the annual forest ESVs ranged from RMB 9.17 trillion to 10.81 trillion (the same below), with an average of RMB 9.99 trillion in China. The forest ESVs increased from the northwest to the southeast regions of China with the lowest values of less than RMB 3 million per square kilometer and relatively high values of more than RMB 9 million per square kilometer. In the past 20 years, the forest ESVs have shown a significant increasing trend, especially in the Northeast Forest Region and Southeast Forest Region. The ESVs have decreased only in very few forest areas such as Cuona and Motuo counties on the southern edge of Tibet Province in Southwest China and Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties in southern Taiwan. The mean annual forest ESV was necessarily higher in the recent 10 years (2011–2020, RMB 10.43 trillion) than in the previous 10 years (2001–2010, RMB 9.55 trillion), while the spatial growth rate was usually less than 20%. The annual forest ESVs were significantly correlated with temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration but not with sunshine hours and relative humidity across the 20 years. In most areas (>60%), the positive impact of various climatic factors was dominant, and the area positively affected by precipitation was the largest (76%). The mean annual forest water conservation from 2001 to 2020 was RMB 1.46 trillion based on the InVEST model and was RMB 1.77 trillion based on the equivalent factor method. Overall, the results obtained by the two methods are roughly equal and mostly spatially matched. This study has some guiding significance for utilizing resources rationally, strengthening ecological environment protection and improving adaptability to climate change. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Analysis of the probiotic characteristics and adaptability of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum DMDL 9010 to gastrointestinal environment by complete genome sequencing and corresponding phenotypes
VL  - 158
AB  - Here we aimed to explore some vital phenotypes and potential genes involved in probiotic functions and adaptive responses of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum DMDL 9010 (LP9010), isolated from Chinese traditional naturally fermented paocai. We found that LP9010 showed good tolerance to simulated human gastrointestinal tract, self-coagulation and cholesterol-reducing abilities, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Comparative genomic analysis of six L. plantarum strains showed that LP9010 contained 392 unique genes. LP9010 genome possessed 281 genes related to carbohydrate transport and metabolism, including 138 sugar transporters and 60 phosphotransferase system enzymes. LP9010 contained high number (98) of carbohydrate-active enzymes especially glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases. Extensive stress-related proteins may help the survival of LP9010 under gastrointestinal environment including temperature, pH, bile, osmotic and oxidative stresses. Many surface or extracellular proteins identified in LP9010 can attribute to adhesion to various extracellular matrices or external environment. The plantaricin gene cluster of LP9010 showed high identity with that of the reference strain WCFS1. Three exopolysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters, two in the chromosome and one in Plasmid 2 were present in LP9010, and only one cluster was highly homologous to WCFS1. This study provided new insights into the probiotic properties and interaction with gastrointestinal environment of LP9010. © 2022 The Authors

TI  - Apple detection model based on lightweight anchor-free deep convolutional neural network
VL  - 2
IS  - 1
SP  - 99-110
AB  - Intelligent production and robotic oporation are the efficient and sustainable agronomic route to cut down economic and environmental costs and boosting orchard productivity. In the actual scene of the orchard, high performance visual perception system is the premise and key for accurate and reliable operation of the automatic cultivation platform. Most of the existing apple detection models, however, are difficult to be used on the platforms with limited hardware resources in terms of computing power and storage capacity due to too many parameters and large model volume. In order to improve the performance and adaptability of the existing apple detection model under the condition of limited hardware resources, while maintaining detection accuracy, reducing the calculation of the model and the model computing and storage footprint, shorten detection time, this method improved the lightweight MobileNetV3 and combined the object detection network which was based on keypoint prediction (CenterNet) to build a lightweight anchor-free model (M-CenterNet) for apple detection. The proposed model used heatmap to search the center point (keypotint) of the object, and predict whether each pixel was the center point of the apple, and the local offset of the keypoint and object size of the apple were estimated based on the extracted center point without the need for grouping or Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). In view of its advantages in model volume and speed, improved MobileNetV3 which was equipped with transposed convolutional layers for the better semantic information and location information was used as the backbone of the network. Compared with CenterNet and SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector), the comprehensive performance, detection accuracy, model capacity and running speed of the model were compared. The results showed that the average precision, error rate and miss rate of the proposed model were 88.9%, 10.9% and 5.8%, respectively, and its model volume and frame rate were 14.2MB and 8.1fps. The proposed model is of strong environmental adaptability and has a good detection effect under the circumstance of various light, different occlusion, different fruits' distance and number. By comparing the performance of the accuracy with the CenterNet and the SSD models, the results showed that the proposed model was only 1/4 of the size of CenterNet model while has comparable detection accuracy. Compared with the SSD model, the average precision of the proposed model increased by 3.9%, and the model volume decreased by 84.3%. The proposed model runs almost twice as fast using CPU than the CenterNet and SSD models. This study provided a new approach for the research of lightweight model in fruit detection with orchard mobile platform under unstructured environment. © 2020 Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

TI  - Factors affecting the reproduction and mass-rearing of sclerodermus brevicornis (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae), a natural enemy of exotic flat-faced longhorn beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Lamiinae)
VL  - 11
IS  - 10
SP  - 1-22
AB  - Simple Summary Natural enemies play a fundamental role in the control of invasive insects and may be particularly important in controlling Xylopagous beetle, which are difficult to contain with traditional chemicals as they are usually concealed within wood. Among the natural enemies that have proven effective against these beetles are parasitoid species in the genus Sclerodermus. The present article furthers knowledge of Sclerodermus brevicornis performance, focusing on the survival capability under different thermal conditions and the longer-term influences of these conditions. Many species of long-horned beetles are invasive pests causing significant economic damage in agro-forestry systems. They spend the majority of their life-cycle concealed inside natural wood or wooden packaging materials and are largely protected from adverse environmental conditions and pesticide sprays. Biological control via parasitoid natural enemies including members of the bethylid genus Sclerodermus, has proven effective against some long-horned beetles that are invasive in China. In Europe, the biocontrol potential of native Sclerodermus species is being evaluated with a view to developing efficient mass-rearing techniques and then actively deploying them against invasive Asian beetles. Here, we continue evaluations of S. brevicornis by establishing that groups of females that have already reared offspring to emergence are capable of reproducing subsequent hosts and by evaluating the lifetime reproductive capacity of individual females provided with successive hosts. Additionally, we assess the laboratory shelf-life of adult females stored for different times at different temperatures including cold storage, and then assess the post-storage reproductive performance of groups of females provided with a single host. We found that adult female longevity declines with increasing storage temperature and that most aspects of subsequent performance are negatively affected by high temperatures. The adaptability to low temperature storage enhances the suitability of S. brevicornis to mass-rearing programs and thus biocontrol deployment.

TI  - Research on the spatial pattern characteristics of the Taihu Lake "Dock Village" based on microclimate: A case study of Tangli Village
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
AB  - "Dock Village" terrain is, as its name implies, a region that contains settlements reminiscent of docks, in terms of their elongated shape, their outward upward tilt, and their location in the center of low, wide valleys. Dock village terrain features deep, fertile soil suitable for farming. Taihu Lake contains a number of classic examples of dock villages. Dock villages are relatively independent and hidden, characteristics that not only play a role in security and defense, but also, more importantly, are associated with enhanced climate adaptability, a relative lack of cold weather, and equable levels of heat and humidity. The dock village reflects the wisdom and distillation of traditional Chinese ecological practices and is highly valued as a research topic. Based on microclimate theory and ENVI-met software, four microclimate indices, namely, air temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and relative humidity, were simulated and analyzed in this study. The correlation between spatial characteristics and microclimate was studied from four perspectives: plane space, cross-section space, vertical section space, and linear development space. This research summarizes the historical context and evolution of the dock village spatial form in the construction of contemporary human settlements. It also provides scientific suggestions for the protection and sustainable development of ancient villages. © 2019 by the authors.

VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the suitability of semi-arid region of Central Morocco for wheat production using Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) considering weather, soil properties and crop management production factors. Model calibration was carried out using data collected from field trials. A quantitative statistics, i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and index of agreement (d) were used in model performance evaluation. Furthermore, series of simulations were performed to simulate the future scenarios of wheat productivity based on climate projection; the optimum sowing date under water deficit condition and selection of appropriate wheat varieties. The study showed that the performance of the model was fairly accurate as judged by having RMSE = 0.13, NSE = 0.95, and d = 0.98. The realization of future climate data projection and their integration into the APSIM model allowed us to obtain future scenarios of wheat yield that vary between 0 and 2.33 t/ha throughout the study period. The simulated result confirmed that the yield obtained from plots seeded between 25 October and 25 November was higher than that of sown until 05 January. From the several varieties tested, Hartog, Sunstate, Wollaroi, Batten and Sapphire were yielded comparatively higher than the locale variety Marzak. In conclusion, APSIM-Wheat model could be used as a promising tool to identify the best management practices such as determining the sowing date and selection of crop variety based on the length of the crop cycle for adapting and mitigating climate change. © 2021, The Author(s).

TI  - Study of the adaptability of scion-rootstock combinations of plum tree to temperature stressors in the Krasnodar Territory
VL  - 254
AB  - The relevance of the research is due to a change in the strength, frequency and direction of harmful weather stresses associated with climate change, which has an extremely negative effect on the general condition and productivity of plants, disrupts the conditions for the exit of plants from the dormant stage, while accelerating the rate of spring development. The rise of positive temperatures in the autumn period delays the entry of plants into the phase of organic dormancy, impairing their preparation for the winter. This paper provides an assessment of the adaptive response of the optimal course of growth and development of scion-rootstock combinations (SRC), taking into account changes in environmental conditions. The complexity of interaction mechanisms in the scion-rootstock-environment system is presented. Analysis of variance has shown that quantitative traits have complex genetic systems, which are characterized by multivariance of the reaction associated with multilevel redefinition of the genetic organization of quantitative traits of the SRC when changing the environmental limits. The value of the work is in the fact that the selected objects are perennial fruit crops, which are an interacting complex of two genotypes. The best combinations of grafts and rootstocks in the studied varieties in the specific environmental conditions and with given growing technologies were identified: Stanley / PK SK 1, Stanley / Druzhba, Renklod Donetskiy-1 / Evrika 99, Renklod Donetskiy-1 / cherry plum, Milena / Evrika 99 The highest-yielding under the changed conditions, and hence the most adaptive, were the combinations of plum variety Stanley on the rootstocks of PK SK 1 and Druzhba. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.

TI  - Adaptability of Robusta Coffee ( Coffea Canephora) at Lowland Climate
VL  - 1012
AB  - Coffee is one of the important commodities in Indonesia. The coffee commodity has strategic potential in the development of the community's economy. Over time, coffee production in Indonesia has decreased, the average productivity of coffee in Indonesia is only around 600 kg/ha, while the potential for coffee production per hectare can reach 1000 kg/ha. This research was conducted in the Lampung State Polytechnic Coffee crops Experimental Garden, located in Rajabasa Village, Rajabasa District, Bandar Lampung City, in May-October 2021. the tools and materials used in this study were stationery, camera, raffia, meter, thermometer, hygrometer, lux meter, alti meter, coffee clone BP 936, BP 358, and BP 534. This study used a simple 1-factor randomized block design with treatment of 3 superior coffee clones: P1: BP clone 936, P2: clone BP 358, P3: clone BP 534 which was repeated 6 times so that 18 experimental units were obtained. Observational data that has been obtained will be analyzed using analysis of variance (F test) at the 5% level. If there is a significant difference (F count > F table 5%), it will be continued with the Least Significant Difference (LSD) follow-up test with a level of 5%. Based on the results and discussions that have been obtained, it can be concluded that the lowland conditions produce a different climate with the characteristics of the robusta coffee plant, including relatively high temperature, high humidity and high light intensity, while the most adaptive coffee clones in lowland climates are: clone BP 358. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Enhancing nitrogen removal performance of anammox process after short-term pH and temperature shocks by coupling with iron-carbon micro-electrolysis
VL  - 289
AB  - Nitrogen contamination is regarded as a major threat to terrestrial net productivity and environmental sustainability. Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is a cost-effective and promising technology in wastewater treatment. In this study, the effects of pH/temperature and their short-term shocks on a hybrid system of anammox coupled with iron-carbon micro-electrolysis (IC-ME) were investigated. Results indicated that the hybrid system significantly enhanced the total nitrogen (TN) removal and expanded the stable pH operating range (TN removal efficiencies over 50%) from pH 6.5-8 to pH 5.5-8.5. Free nitrous acid (FNA) in acid environment, when its concentration was higher than 396.36 +/- 5.51 mu g/L, was thought to be one critical degradation inhibitor. After suffering a short-term (one day) pH shock, the hybrid system exhibited the improved performance of both stability and nitrogen removal, mainly because Fe corrosion maintained the pH value by IC-ME. More diverse nitrogen removal processes promoted by IC-ME enhanced the TN removal of hybrid after high temperature shocks. However, the susceptibility and inferior adaptability of anammox bacteria were considered to inhibit the nitrogen removal performance of the hybrid and individual anammox system. Microbial analysis identified Candidatus Kuenenia as the major anammox genus, accounting for 3.61% of the microbial community biomass, and the genus of SM1A02 might be one novel potential strain that help the anammox process.

TI  - Production of renewable diesel from Jatropha curcas oil via pyrolytic-deoxygenation over various multi-wall carbon nanotube-based catalysts
VL  - 142
SP  - 336-349
AB  - Jatropha curcas is a highly toxic plant that produces seed containing viscous oil with productivity (2 ton/ha), it grows in tropical and sub-tropical regions and offer greater adaptability to a wide range of climatic and soil conditions. Its oils have been noted as an important alternative to produce green diesel via deoxygenation reaction. This study, deoxygenation of jatropha curcas oil (JCO) was carried out over NiO–Fe2O3 and NiO–ZnO catalysts that supported onto multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT). It had found that high Fe and Zn dosages were ineffective in deoxygenation and greatest activity was observed on NiO(20) Fe2O3(5)/MWCNT catalyst. Structure-activity correlations revealed that low metal loading, large density of weak + medium acidic sites and strong basic sites play key role in enhancing the catalytic activities and n-(C15+C17) selectivity. Comparing carbon nanostructures and carbon micron size supported NiO-Fe2O3 revealed that green diesel obtained from NiO–Fe2O3/MWCNT catalysed deoxygenation had the highest heating value and the lowest amounts of oxygen content. Thereby, it confirmed the importance of carbon nanostructure as the catalyst support in improving the diesel quality. Considering the high reusability of NiO-Fe2O3/MWCNT (6 consecutive runs) and superior green diesel properties (flash point, cloud properties and cetane index) demonstrated the NiO–Fe2O3/MWCNT catalyst offers great option in producing excellent properties of green diesel for energy sector. © 2020

TI  - Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) breeding to meet the challenge of climate change
VL  - 5
SP  - 471-524
AB  - Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) is a tetraploid wheat species (2n = 28) planted annually on an estimated area of 18 million ha, representing approximately 8-10% of all the wheat cultivated area in the world, and an annual production ranging from 35-40 million mt. Regions of the Mediterranean Basin and North America (i.e. Canada) produce about 60% of world durum wheat production, mainly used for human consumption as pasta, bulgur, couscous and some breads. In general durum wheat is better adapted to high temperatures and to semiarid climates than bread wheat. In spite of its relatively high adaptability to the marginal and drought environments, the production of durum wheat is threatened by the impacts of climate change, and the need for more sustainable development. This chapter provides an update on progress in genetic improvement of durum wheat and on the tools and strategies to maintain productivity and strengthen food security despite increasing water scarcity, higher temperatures, and the emergence of new pests and diseases. These demand changes in the approaches to crop improvement and require implementing novel approaches in gene discovery and plant breeding. Conventional and modern breeding strategies are discussed to integrate new target traits into varieties. Modelling provides a rational approach to identify desirable traits or combination of traits potentially leading to the specification of wheat ideotypes optimized for target environmental and future climatic conditions. The integration of genomics and phenomics is promising to revolutionize plant breeding providing an exceptional opportunity to identify genetic variation that can be employed in durum wheat breeding programs. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

TI  - MaxEnt Modeling to Predict the Current and Future Distribution of Pomatosace filicula under Climate Change Scenarios on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau
VL  - 11
IS  - 5
AB  - As an important Tibetan medicine and a secondary protected plant in China, Pomatosace filicula is endemic to the country and is mainly distributed in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP). How-ever, global climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions might lead to the extinction of P. filicula. To understand the potential spatial distribution of P. filicula in future global warming sce-narios, we used the MaxEnt model to simulate changes in its suitable habitat that would occur by 2050 and 2070 using four representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios and five global climate models. The results showed that the QTP currently contains a suitable habitat for P. filicula and will continue to do so in the future. Under the RCP2.6 scenario, the suitable habitat area would increase by 2050 but shrink slightly by 2070, with an average reduction of 2.7%. However, under the RCP8.5 scenario, the area of unsuitable habitat would expand by an average of 54.65% and 68.20% by 2050 and 2070, respectively. The changes in the area of suitable habitat under the RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 scenarios were similar, with the unsuitable area increasing by approximately 20% by 2050 and 2070. Under these two moderate RCPs, the total suitable area in 2070 would be greater than that in 2050. The top three environmental factors impacting the habitat distribution were altitude, annual precipitation (BIO12) and annual temperature range (BIO7). The cumulative contribution rate of these three factors was as high as 82.8%, indicating that they were the key factors affecting the distribution and adaptability of P. filicula, P. filicula grows well in damp and cold environments. Due to global warming, the QTP will become warmer and drier; thus, the growing area of P. filicula will move toward higher elevations and areas that are humid and cold. These areas are mainly found near the Three-River Region. Future climate change will aggravate the deterioration of the P. filicula habitat and increase the species’ survival risk. This study describes the distribution of P. filicula and provides a basis for the protection of endangered plants in the QTP. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Burrows provide burrowing animals with a place to hibernate, reproduce, and avoid predators and harsh weather conditions and thus have a vital impact on their survival. However, the general physical characteristics and ecological functions of Marmota himalayana burrows as well as whether there are differences in burrow traits under different terrains (e.g., sunny slopes, shady slopes, and flat areas) are not well understood. From July to August 2019 (warm season), we used unmanned aerial vehicles to fly at low altitudes and slow speeds to locate 131 M. himalayana burrows (45 on shaded slopes, 51 on sunny slopes, and 35 on flat areas) in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau region. We then measured the physical characteristics (burrow density, entrance size, first tunnel length, volume, orientation, and plant characteristics near the burrow entrance) of these burrows on site. We found that terrain had a substantial influence on burrow density, orientation, and entrance size and on the angle of the burrow entrance; species richness had a substantial impact on path density and tunnel volume. The physical parameters of the M. himalayana burrows showed that they function to protect the marmots from natural enemies and bad weather, provide good drainage, and maintain a stable microclimate around the entrance. We discuss the ability of burrowing animals (e.g., M. himalayana) to adapt to the external environment based on their burrow characteristics. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The fission product strontium (Sr), after generation in the reactor due to fission of 233U, might exist as SrF2 in the molten fluoride medium of molten salt reactor (MSR) using fluoride carrier salts. The high temperature interactions between the strontium fluoride (SrF2) with the fertile fuel component and thorium fluoride (ThF4) leads to form single ternary compound SrThF6(s). The Gibbs energy of formation is the driving force for formation of any compound. In the present study, standard molar Gibbs energy of formation SrThF6(s) has been determined using an e.m.f. technique using CaF2(s) as solid electrolyte. Using the experimental thermodynamic data, to study the stability domain of SrThF6(s), the chemical potential diagram of Sr-Th-F-O system and ternary phase diagram of Sr-Th-F2 system have been calculated. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

VL  - 38
IS  - 6
SP  - 1085-1095
AB  - Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) may be an important mechanism for marine organisms to acclimate to climate change stressors including ocean warming (OW) and ocean acidification (OA). Conversely, environmental stress experienced by one generation may have detrimental latent effects on subsequent generations. We examined TGP in the embryos and larvae of the pan-tropical sea urchin, Tripneustes gratilla, in response to OA (pH 7.77), OW (+2 °C), or both OA and OW, OAW (+2 °C, pH 7.77) using a parent (F0) generation reared in treatments from the early juvenile to the mature adult, incorporating gonadogenesis and germline differentiation. Embryos and larvae of acclimated parents were reared in all four treatments to the 2-day-old pluteus stage. Larvae from OA and OAW parents were resilient to the effects of acidification, while larvae from OW and OAW parents were more tolerant to warmer temperature (29 °C). Parental acclimation, however, had predominantly negative effects on the size of offspring with reductions in larval arm lengths by as much as 21.4%, while eggs were up to 21.8% smaller in females raised at 29 °C. We highlight the complexity and trade-offs of TGP in this first transgenerational climate change study on a marine macroinvertebrate where the F0 generation was acclimated over their reproductive life. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Comprehensive temporal reprogramming ensures dynamicity of transcriptomic profile for adaptive response in Taxus contorta
VL  - 295
IS  - 6
SP  - 1401-1414
AB  - Plants respond to the environmental perturbations by triggering the dynamic changes within the transcriptome. The assessment of these oscillations within the transcriptome would offer insights into the ecological adaptation of the plants. We evaluated how the transcriptome of Taxus contorta swings under natural conditions to elucidate its adaptive response. Thus, our study provides new insights into the performance of T. contorta under a changing environment during different seasons. The abundance estimation using the RNAseq approach revealed 6727 differentially expressed genes. Comprehensive reprogramming was observed in Taxol biosynthesis, maintenance of redox homeostasis, and generation of effective shield to UV-B, high light intensity, and temperature. Besides differential expression, the alternative splicing (AS) and single nucleotide variations (SNVs) also confer flexibility to the transcriptome of T. contorta. 1936 differentially expressing transcripts were also found to exhibit Differential Exon Usage (DEU) as well as differential SNVs. LC–MS-based untargeted metabolic analysis revealed 7774 ion features, among which around 334 putatively identified metabolites were differentially regulated. Our results showed that the swing and the oscillations of the transcriptome and metabolome of T. contorta ensure adaptability and better survival under changing environment. In addition, varying patterns of AS and SNVs compliment the adaptation provided by differential expression. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Repeated phenotypic selection for cuticular blackness of armyworm larvae decreased stress resistance
VL  - 117
AB  - Armyworm Mythimna separata larvae show changes in cuticle darkening depending on population densities and are roughly categorized into two phenotypes, a pale brown solitary type and black-colored gregarious type. Although the color difference in both larval types is apparent, it remains ambiguous whether any change in physiological traits accompanies the cuticle darkening. To answer this query, we repeated genetic selection of the blackness phenotype over one hundred generations in our laboratory colony and produced a black-colored (BL) strain. Comparison between non-selected control (CTL) and BL strains revealed an increased fecundity and adult life span in the BL strain compared with the CTL strain. In contrast, BL strain larvae were found to be significantly more sensitive to heat stress than those in the CTL strain. Hemolymph reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were higher in the BL strain than in the CTL strain under both non-stress and heat stress conditions. Antioxidant activities of the hemolymph were not significantly different between the two strains under non-stress condition, but the activities increased to higher levels in the CTL strain than those in the BL strain after heat stress. Activities and gene expression levels of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the fat body were significantly higher in CTL strain larvae than in BL strain larvae after heat treatment. Thermal stress tolerance of the offspring of crossings between the two strains showed a tolerance level almost equivalent to the maternal one: the cross between CTL females and BL males produced offspring with the higher tolerance compared with the oppositely crossed offspring. Expression levels of the antioxidant enzyme genes of the former offspring were found to be similar to those of CTL strain. These results indicate a trade-off between reproductive activity and stress resistance: the BL strain had acquired high reproductivity but had lost stress tolerance through repeated genetic selection. Furthermore, the present genetic analyses demonstrated that the phenotype of stress tolerance is derived from the maternal parent. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Mutation, selection, and the prevalence of the Caenorhabditis elegans heat-sensitive mortal germline phenotype
VL  - 12
IS  - 5
AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans strains with the heat-sensitive mortal germline phenotype become progressively sterile over the course of a few tens of generations when maintained at temperatures near the upper range of C. elegans' tolerance. Mortal germline is transgenerationally heritable, and proximately under epigenetic control. Previous studies have suggested that mortal germline presents a relatively large mutational target and that mortal germline is not uncommon in natural populations of C. elegans. The mortal germline phenotype is not monolithic. Some strains exhibit a strong mortal germline phenotype, in which individuals invariably become sterile over a few generations, whereas other strains show a weaker (less penetrant) phenotype in which the onset of sterility is slower and more stochastic. We present results in which we (1) quantify the rate of mutation to the mortal germline phenotype and (2) quantify the frequency of mortal germline in a collection of 95 wild isolates. Over the course of ∼16,000 meioses, we detected one mutation to a strong mortal germline phenotype, resulting in a point estimate of the mutation rate UMrt≈ 6×10-5/genome/generation. We detected no mutations to a weak mortal germline phenotype. Six out of 95 wild isolates have a strong mortal germline phenotype, and although quantification of the weak mortal germline phenotype is inexact, the weak mortal germline phenotype is not rare in nature. We estimate a strength of selection against mutations conferring the strong mortal germline phenotype s¯≈0.1%, similar to selection against mutations affecting competitive fitness. The appreciable frequency of weak mortal germline variants in nature combined with the low mutation rate suggests that mortal germline may be maintained by balancing selection. © The Author(s) 2022.

TI  - Daily standardized antecedent precipitation evapotranspiration index (SAPEI) and its adaptability in Anhui Province
VL  - 27

SP  - 919-928
AB  - Agricultural drought and waterlogging are two of the most compelling problems affecting agricultural productivity and efficiency. At present, most of the widely used drought and waterlogging indices are based on ten-day, monthly, and seasonal scales. Their timeliness and accuracy are still far from the desired levels that would enable a sustainable means of preventing and controlling agricultural drought and waterlogging disasters. Based on the data of 78 meteorological observing stations in Anhui Province, selected as the transitional zone between the North Semi-humid and South Humid climates, a daily standardized antecedent precipitation evapotranspiration index (SAPEI) was constructed by fitting the daily antecedent precipitation evapotranspiration index (APEI) series with a 3-parameter log-logistic distribution. In addition, its feasibility and adaptability were analyzed in representative stations that were selected in different dry and wet zones, namely, North of the Huaihe River, Between the Huaihe River and Yangtze River, and South of the Yangtze River. The results showed that the empirical probability distribution curve of representative stations’ APEI series highly corresponded with the theoretical log-logistic distribution curve. Representative stations’ daily SAPEI curve could describe the changes in farmland water budget in the presence/absence of rain. In the case of the rapid change in drought and flood on June 8 and 28, 2011, SAPEI’s drought and waterlogging grade and change trends were in good agreement with soil moisture in the same period. Spatial distribution of drought, waterlogging frequency, and annual mean values of accumulated index based on winter wheat whole development stage’s SAPEI was primarily distributed latitudinally. These distribution characteristics conformed to the actual distribution of drought and waterlogging in Anhui Province. The 0-value line of annual mean SAPEI (ISAPEI) in the winter wheat whole development stage was located north of the “Between the Huaihe River and Yangtze River” zone and along the eastern and southern foot of the Dabie Mountains. The area covered by negative values was drier and was the main area planted with winter wheat in Anhui Province, and the other area covered by positive values was more humid. In conclusion, the daily-scale SAPEI and its accumulated index could reflect the temporal distribution of precipitation and the impact of daily rainfall amount, and accurately depict the changes in drought and waterlogging and the cumulative effects of drought and waterlogging processes in different regions of Anhui Province. Therefore, SAPEI not only retained the advantages of standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) such as strong regional applicability, dimensionless character, and the ability to reflect the influence of temperature, but also had higher timeliness and sensitivity by modifying the precipitation evapotranspiration index from a monthly or seasonal scale to a weighted cumulative precipitation evapotranspiration index at a daily scale. SAPEI can be used in daily dynamic monitoring and the assessment process of drought and waterlogging in Anhui Province. © 2019, Science Press. All right reserved.

Salinity is an important ecological factor in the environment. It not only affects growth but also survival rate, osmotic pressure, and non-specific enzymes in juveniles of Eniocheir sinensis. To study the salinity adaptability of juvenile E. sinensis in the Yangtze Estuary, the effects of salinity on survival rate, osmotic pressure, and non-specific enzymes of juvenile E. sinensis were studied. Juveniles were added to circular glass fiber cylinders with different salinity levels (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24) and maintained under the following conditions: average water temperature 23-24°C; pH 7.2-7.8; and average DO &gt; 5 mg/L. The survival rate, tissue homogenate supernatant Na+, Cl-, and K+ concentrations, Na+-K+-ATPase activity, oxyhemoglobin content, and the activities of total superoxidase (SOD), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), and phenoloxidase (PO) were analyzed after 3 days of the experiment. The results showed that the salinity 8 experimental group had the highest survival rate and hemocyanin content, which were 89% and (0.253±0.023) mg/mL, respectively, and were significantly higher than those of other experimental groups (P &lt; 0.05) but were minimized in the freshwater and salinity 24 groups. Na+, Cl-, and K+ concentrations, Na+-K+-ATPase activity, and non-specific immune enzyme activity were divided into three stages. Firstly, these indicators decreased significantly with increasing salinity (0-8), gradually increased with higher salinity (8-12), and finally stabilized at the highest salinity (12-24). It had its lowest index values in the salinity 8 experimental group, the concentrations of Na+, Cl- and KK+ were (40.897±1.700) mmol/mL, (8.340±2.130) mmol/mL, and (1.842±0.158) mmol/mL, and the activity of Na+-K+-ATPase was (3.153±0.735) U/mg, and the activities of SOD, AKP, and PO were (129.026±3.496) U/mg, (1.326±0.173) U/mg, and (16.366±0.065) ng/mL, respectively. Together, the results revealed that the juveniles were highly adaptable in low salinity (4-8), whereas fresh water and high salinity water weakened its osmotic regulation and immune defense function. The goals of this study were to reveal the physiological characteristics during feed-bait migration and provide a scientific basis for resource conservation and environmental assessment of juvenile E. sinensis. © 2018 Journal of Fishery Sciences of China.

TI  - Microbial enrichment and multiplexed microfiltration for accelerated detection of Salmonella in spinach
VL  - 35
IS  - 6
AB  - To attain Salmonella detection thresholds in spinach suspensions using enrichment media requires at least 24 hr. Separation and concentration of selected microorganisms via microfiltration and microfugation reduce time for sample preparation, especially when working with large volumes of vegetable suspensions. This facilitates accelerated detection of Salmonella in spinach suspensions, and may contribute to effectively monitoring this pathogen before it reaches the consumer. We report a microfiltration-based protocol for accelerated sample preparation to concentrate and recover ≤1 colony forming unit (CFU) Salmonella/g pathogen-free spinach. Store-bought samples of spinach and a spinach plant subjected to two environmental conditions (temperature and light exposure) during its production were tested. The overall procedure involves extraction with buffer, a short enrichment step, prefiltration using a nylon filter, crossflow hollow fiber microfiltration, and retentate centrifugation to bring microbial cells to detection levels. Based on 1 CFU Salmonella/g frozen spinach, and a Poisson distribution statistical analyses with 99% probability, we calculated that 3 hr of incubation, when followed by microfiltration, is sufficient to reach the 2 log concentration required for Salmonella detection within 7 hr. Longer enrichment times (5 hr or more) is needed for concentrations lower than 1 CFU Salmonella/g of ready to eat spinach. The recovered microbial cells were identified and confirmed as Salmonella using both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and plating methods. Different environmental conditions tested during production did not affect Salmonella viability; this demonstrated the broad adaptability of Salmonella and emphasized the need for methods that enable efficient monitoring of production for the presence of this pathogen. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

TI  - Dendroclimatology of teak indicates prevailing climatic conditions of tropical moist forests in India
VL  - 129
AB  - Among all proxy archives, tree rings are highly promising indicator of ecological and environmental processes due to their high climatic sensitivity, better annual resolution, and large spatial coverage. Seasonal importance of soil moisture dynamics and impact of drought events on tree growth development and carbon sequestration potential in tropical moist forests was assessed using the teak tree ring width index and instrumental climate data from Aizawl, Mizoram. Present analysis suggests that soil moisture during months of the early growing season with low precipitation is crucial for determining the growth of teak trees in the Northeast region of India. Results of the present study reflected the impact of remote atmospheric climate regulation modes such as El Nin similar to oSouthern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Sea surface temperature (SST) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) on site climate. Results indicate that the increasing moisture stresses in the region may cause the survival risk for the other forest vegetation having low adaptability to climate change stresses with the inability to make niche shifts. Increasing the number of tree ring studies linked with eco-physiological parameters of tree growth is recommended to better visualize the level of stresses on the trees in the moist tropical forests. This information will be useful in developing better management plans for biodiversity conservation in the tropical region.

TI  - Predicting the distribution of the invasive species hyptis suaveolens in Nigeria
VL  - 10
IS  - 2
SP  - 98-106
AB  - Hyptis suaveolens is an exotic plant that has become established in Nigeria because it is grows vigorously and produces allelochemicals that adversely affect the growth of adjacent plants. In this study, we predict the distribution of Hyptis suaveolens in Nigeria using a Maximum Entropy modelling approach. Pearson correlations were used to select five bioclimatic variables to which type of soil and altitude were added to give a total of seven environmental variables that were then included in the MaxEnt model. This model predicts that Hyptis suaveolens can colonize 25%, 45% and 25% of the total land area in FCT, Nasarawa and the River States in Nigeria. In addition, Hyptis suaveolens in Nigeria grows mainly in sandy clay and sandy loam soils. Bioclimatic conditions most suitable for this species include temperatures between 26-30 °C, 9-10 hour photoperiod, low altitudes of around 200-800 m and rainfall within the range of 200-800mm. The MaxEnt model indicates that Hyptis suaveolens is currently a threat to the survival of native species of plants in the North Central part of Nigeria. The MaxEnt model further reveals that because of its high adaptability and tolerance of changes in abiotic factors, Hyptis suaveolens is likely to invade a new environment, the humid forest zone in Nigeria. As this species can become very abundant, we recommend that its spread is monitored and controlled, particularly in areas of high suitability. © 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Drought effects on the plasticity in vessel traits of two endemic Magnolia species in the tropical montane cloud forests of eastern Mexico
VL  - 13
IS  - 3
SP  - 331-340
AB  - Aims: We aimed to evaluate how climatic fluctuations influence the plasticity of anatomical vessel traits and the width of annual tree-rings of two relict-endemic Mexican Magnolia species. Notwithstanding, few studies have assessed the drought effect on vessel traits in tropical montane cloud trees of eastern Mexico. Methods: Through digital images of growth rings, we assessed the tree radial growth rate, age of the trees and plasticity in vessel traits regarding climatic fluctuations of the Mexican Magnolia species studied. We compared vessel density, hydraulic diameter and percentage of conductive area in drought years (DY) and non-drought years (NDY) in two Mexican Magnolia species. Important Findings: For the first time, the plasticity that occurs in porous wood vessel traits to long-term climatic fluctuations was analysed for two endangered Magnolia species (Magnolia vovidesii and M. schiedeana) from two tropical montane cloud forests in Mexico. We found that temperature and precipitation were strongly associated with differences in tree-ring width when DY and NDY were compared. Our analyses revealed that a high plasticity in vessel anatomy of diffuse-porous wood was related to temperature and/or water availability for both Magnolia species studied. We concluded that anatomical adaptations to DY resulted in a substantial reduction in vessel traits when compared with NDY, and that the plastic adaptations played an essential role in water transport and safety for the survival of the studied species during stressful long periods. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

VL  - 45

AB  - Estuaries are subject to high environmental variability coupled to tidal salinity shifts. Under restricted freshwater flow and prolonged drought conditions, salinity may exceed natural ranges and thus organisms may experience stressful hypersaline conditions. This study assessed the physiology of a juvenile marine estuarine-dependent species Rhabdosargus holubi (Family: Sparidae) under changing salinity to determine the impact on respiration and survival under shock and acclimatisation exposures. Oxygen consumption was not significantly different in the 2.5 to 45 salinity range and the interaction between temperature and salinity was not significant at the moderate levels tested. This confirmed the strong osmoregulatory capabilities of marine estuarine-dependent R. holubi. However, respiration was impacted at salinities of 55–62.5. The salinity tolerance ranges of R. holubi were expanded beyond those previously observed in the laboratory, to a maximum of 77 when fish were gradually exposed to daily 20% incremental changes. This indicated the ability to adapt to hypersaline conditions that occur gradually in anthropogenically altered estuaries which is an important aspect for management decisions regarding freshwater inputs. The adaptability of Rhabdosargus holubi to hypersaline conditions in estuaries may thereby ensure the maintenance of populations in the short term under certain environmental conditions, such as those currently occurring in a freshwater-scarce South Africa. However, in the long term and at more extreme salinities (> 55), the physiology of R. holubi and similar species may be compromised, thus placing the species at risk. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

TI  - Phenotypic and genomic characterization of a vibrio parahaemolyticus strain causing disease in penaeus vannamei provides insights into its niche adaptation and pathogenic mechanism
VL  - 7
IS  - 5
AB  - The virulence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus is variable depending on its virulence determinants. A V. parahaemolyticus strain, in which the virulence is governed by the pirA and pirB genes, can cause acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) in shrimps. Some V. parahaemolyticus that are non-AHPND strains also cause shrimp diseases and result in huge economic losses, while their patho-genicity and pathogenesis remain unclear. In this study, a non-AHPND V. parahaemolyticus, TJA114, was isolated from diseased Penaeus vannamei associated with a high mortality. To understand its virulence and adaptation to the external environment, whole-genome sequencing of this isolate was conducted, and its phenotypic profiles including pathogenicity, growth characteristics and nutritional requirements were investigated. Shrimps following artificial infection with this isolate presented similar clinical symptoms to the naturally diseased ones and generated obvious pathological lesions. The growth characteristics indicated that the isolate TJA114 could grow well under different salinity (10–55 p.p.t.), temperature (23–37 °C) and pH (6–10) conditions. Phenotype MicroArray results showed that this isolate could utilize a variety of carbon sources, amino acids and a range of substrates to help itself adapt to the high hyperosmotic and alkaline environments. Antimicrobial-susceptibility test showed that it was a multidrug-resistant bacterium. The whole-genomic analysis showed that this V. parahaemolyticus possessed many important functional genes associated with multidrug resistance, stress response, adhesions, haemolysis, putative secreted proteases, dedicated protein secretion systems and a variety of nutritional metabolic mechanisms. These annotated functional genes were confirmed by the phenotypic profiles. The results in this study indicated that this V. parahaemolyticus isolate possesses a high pathogenicity and strong environmental adaptability. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Expansion of the dehydrin gene family in the Pinaceae is associated with considerable structural diversity and drought-responsive expression
VL  - 38
IS  - 3
SP  - 442-456
AB  - Temperatures are expected to increase over the next century in all terrestrial biomes and particularly in boreal forests, where drought-induced mortality has been predicted to rise. Genomics research is helping to develop hypotheses regarding the molecular basis of drought tolerance and recent work proposed that the osmo-protecting dehydrin proteins have undergone a clade-specific expansion in the Pinaceae, a major group of conifer trees. The objectives of this study were to identify all of the putative members of the gene family, trace their evolutionary origin, examine their structural diversity and test for drought-responsive expression. We identified 41 complete dehydrin coding sequences in Picea glauca, which is four times more than most angiosperms studied to date, and more than in pines. Phylogenetic reconstructions indicated that the family has undergone an expansion in conifers, with parallel evolution implicating the sporadic resurgence of certain amino acid sequence motifs, and a major duplication giving rise to a clade specific to the Pinaceae. A variety of plant dehydrin structures were identified with variable numbers of the A-, E-, S- and K-segments and an N-terminal (N1) amino acid motif including assemblages specific to conifers. The expression of several of the spruce dehydrins was tissue preferential under non-stressful conditions or responded to water stress after 7-18 days without watering, reflecting changes in osmotic potential. We found that dehydrins with N1 K2 and N1 AESK2 sequences were the most responsive to the lack of water. Together, the family expansion, drought-responsive expression and structural diversification involving loss and gain of amino acid motifs suggests that subfunctionalization has driven the diversification seen among dehydrin gene duplicates. Our findings clearly indicate that dehydrins represent a large family of candidate genes for drought tolerance in spruces and in other Pinaceae that may underpin adaptability in spatially and temporally variable environments. © The Author 2017.

TI  - Rescue of codon-pair deoptimized respiratory syncytial virus by the emergence of genomes with very large internal deletions that complemented replication
VL  - 118
IS  - 13
AB  - Recoding viral genomes by introducing numerous synonymous but suboptimal codon pairs—called codon-pair deoptimization (CPD)—provides new types of live-attenuated vaccine candidates. The large number of nucleotide changes resulting from CPD should provide genetic stability to the attenuating phenotype, but this has not been rigorously tested. Human respiratory syncytial virus in which the G and F surface glycoprotein ORFs were CPD (called Min B) was temperature-sensitive and highly restricted in vitro. When subjected to selective pressure by serial passage at increasing temperatures, Min B substantially regained expression of F and replication fitness. Whole-genome deep sequencing showed many point mutations scattered across the genome, including one combination of six linked point mutations. However, their reintroduction into Min B provided minimal rescue. Further analysis revealed viral genomes bearing very large internal deletions (LD genomes) that accumulated after only a few passages. The deletions relocated the CPD F gene to the first or second promoter-proximal gene position. LD genomes amplified de novo in Min B–infected cells were encapsidated, expressed high levels of F, and complemented Min B replication in trans. This study provides insight on a variation of the adaptability of a debilitated negative-strand RNA virus, namely the generation of defective minihelper viruses to overcome its restriction. This is in contrast to the common “defective interfering particles” that interfere with the replication of the virus from which they originated. To our knowledge, defective genomes that promote rather than inhibit replication have not been reported before in RNA viruses. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

VL  - 49

AB  - Fish diversification into sympatric ecomorph pairs demonstrates a striking parallelism across a number of taxa in numerous lakes. However, there is a dearth of information on environmental conditions, which may orchestrate divergence processes across generations. Here we explore whether the environmental factors affecting food and reproductive niche distinctions could trigger the divergence of the lacustrine-riverine fish species into two morphs based on kokanee Oncorhynchus nerka of the Lake Kronotskoe. We reveal drastic differences in temperature on the tributary reproduction sites affecting the early ontogeny timing and disrupting the time of lakeward migration of the morphs. The juveniles of the benthivorous morph run into the lake in spring during the food abundance peak on the slope, while the planktivorous kokanee migrates to the lake in the summer when the pelagic zone abounds with zooplankton. The dynamics of this food niches is determined by water temperature dynamics and may be stable for long periods of time, thus making each morph adapting to similar condition throughout generations. We suggest that the pelagic-benthic divergence could be explained by the factors, which are extrinsic for fish, making our results applicable for numerous cases of this microevolutionary pathway all over the Holarctic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Effects of warming and fertilization interacting with intraspecific competition on fine root traits of Picea asperata
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SP  - 147-159
AB  - Aims: Competition, temperature and nutrient are the most important determinants of tree growth in the cold climate on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Although many studies have reported their individual effects on tree growth, little is known about how the interactions of competition with fertilization and temperature affect root growth. We aim to test whether climate warming and fertilization promote competition and to explore the functional strategies of Picea asperata in response to the interactions of these factors. Methods: We conducted a paired experiment including competition and non-competition treatments under elevated temperature (ET) and fertilization. We measured root traits, including the root tip number over the root surface (RTRS), the root branching events over the root surface (RBRS), the specific root length (SRL), the specific root area (SRA), the total fine root length and area (RL and RA), the root tips (RTs) and root branching (RB) events. These root traits are considered to be indicators of plant resource uptake capacity and root growth. The root biomass and the nutrient concentrations in the roots were also determined. Important Findings: The results indicated that ET, fertilization and competition individually enhanced the nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) concentrations in fine roots, but they did not affect fine root biomass or root traits, including RL, RT, RA and RB. However, both temperature and fertilization, as well as their interaction, interacting with competition increased RL, RA, RT, RB and nutrient uptake. In addition, the SRL, SRA, RTRS and RBRS decreased under fertilization, the interaction between temperature and competition decreased SRL and SRA, while the other parameters were not affected by temperature or competition. These results indicate that P. asperata maintains a conservative nutrient strategy in response to competition, climate warming, fertilization and their interactions. Our results improve our understanding of the physiological and ecological adaptability of trees to global change. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - 克氏原螯虾在20世纪初作为重要的水产品引入中国,但因其繁殖能力强、生长迅速、适应性强、喜掘洞穴,对农作物、池埂及农田水利有一定破坏作用,降低入侵地区当地物种多样性,对当地生态系统造成严重危害。因此,研究未来气候情景下克氏原螯虾适生区的变化,可为其监控和管理措施提供关键信息,有效预防和控制其蔓延。本研究基于克氏原螯虾的分布点,应用最大熵(MaxEnt)模型和规则集遗传算法(GARP)模型模拟了当前气候条件下克氏原螯虾在中国的潜在适生区,并预测了2041—2060年和2061—2080年克氏原螯虾在4种气候变化情景下(RCP 2.6、RCP 4.5、RCP 6.0、RCP 8.5)的分布,采用ROC曲线对预测结果进行检验和评价。结果表明: 在当前气候条件下克氏原螯虾集中分布在上海、江苏、浙江、安徽等长江沿岸地区;最冷季平均温度、最冷月最低温度对克氏原螯虾分布影响最大,其次是温度季节性变化、最暖月最高温度和最干月降水量。在未来气候情景下,2061—2080年克氏原螯虾的适生区面积有不同程度的变化,在RCP 2.6和RCP 4.5情景下总适生面积增加,但在RCP 8.5情景下呈先增后减趋势,而在RCP 6.0情景下无明显变化;克氏原螯虾适生区在空间分布上不仅有纬度方向上的扩散,也有向海拔较高地区迁移的趋势。. Procambarus clarkii was introduced into China as an important aquatic product in early 20th century. It has characteristics of high fertility, rapid growth, adaptability and digging burrows, which could cause damage of crops, cropland and facilities, decrease local biodiversity and thus threaten local ecosystem. Thus, predicting the potential distribution of P. clarkii in response to climate change was essential for preventing and monitoring this species. Based on the distribution of P. clarkii, the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) and genetic algorithm for rule-set production (GARP) models were used to predict its distribution in China under current climate and four climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 8.5) in two periods, 2041-2060 and 2061-2080. Then, the modeling results were tested by ROC curves. The results showed that under current climate, the highly suitable region for distribution predicted by the MaxEnt and GARP models were Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui along the Yangtze River. The main environmental variables affecting its distribution were mean temperature of the coldest quarter, minimum temperature of the warmest month, and temperature seasonality, maximum temperature of the warmest month, precipitation of the driest month. Under the future climate scenarios, the suitable area of P. clarkii distribution varied in 2061-2080. The total suitable area of P. clarkii would increase under RCP2.6 and RCP 4.5, whereas under RCP 8.5 the suitable area of P. clarkii would increase, and then decrease. In RCP 6.0, there was no change. The suitable areas of P. clarkii would disperse to different latitude areas and migrate toward high altitude.

TI  - Modelling the potential distribution and shifts of three varieties of Stipa tianschanica in the eastern Eurasian Steppe under multiple climate change scenarios
VL  - 16
AB  - The issue of climatic change and its strong influence on species distributions is currently of great interest in the field of biogeography. In this study, three varieties of Stipa tianschanica (S. tianschanica var. tianschanica, S. tianschanica var. gobica and S. tianschanica var. klemenzii), which are high-quality forage for local rangeland, were selected from the desert steppe of the Mongolian Plateau and Central Asia. Based on high-resolution environmental data for past, current and future climate scenarios, we modelled the suitable habitat in 6 periods for S. tianschanica var. tianschanica, S. tianschanica var. gobica and S. tianschanica var. klemenzii using MaxEnt and GIS technology; evaluated the importance of environmental factors in shaping their distribution; and identified distribution shifts under different climate change scenarios. Our results showed that temperature seasonality (bio04) and precipitation in October and November (pre10, pre11) were the most critical factors shaping the distribution of S. tianschanica var. tianschanica, while precipitation in June, August and December (pre06, pre08 and pre12) were the most critical for shaping the distributions of S. tianschanica var. gobica and S. tianschanica var. klemenzii. The suitable future habitat for the three species tended to increase under the RCP2.6 scenario and to decrease to varying degrees in the desert steppe in the RCP8.5 scenario in 2070 as global warming intensified. Overall, the size of the core distribution area and direction of the core distributional shifts are different for each species over the 6 periods. Our prediction showed that although these three varieties belong to the same species, their survival strategy and adaptability are different when faced with the same climate change scenarios. The projected spatial and temporal patterns of the distribution range shifts for S. tianschanica var. tianschanica, S. tianschanica var. gobica and S. tianschanica var. klemenzii will be useful references in developing desert steppe management and conservation strategies for these three ecologically important varieties.

TI  - Agronomic biofortification of food crops with micronutrients
VL  - 20
SP  - 1383-1387
AB  - Micronutrient malnutrition in human population can be very well strategized by using Agronomic biofortification, which remains a key tool for healthy populations and reduced mortality. The approach related to different micronutrient is reviewed. The efficacy studies of various elements like iron (Fe), iodine (I), colbalt (Co), Zinc (Zn) and Selenium (Se) and its concentration in different parts are also viewed. All the five micronutrients were equally important and contribute for better human health nutrition in food crops. Eventhough some nutrients have their own restrictions in the plant, but due to various factors (like, temperature, climate, time of applications, crop adaptability, etc), few micronutrients have played a significant role in the food nutrition making easier access in the plant edible parts by its applications. Effective studies were carried out widely with Fe, I, Co, Zn and Se, which is found more valuable and highly resourced, against food crops in developing countries. Few among them are closely related to plant - animal interactions (Co and Se), rather than human alone. For Zn, combination of soil and foliar (two applications) were most effective than individual application. It is predominantly efficient when applications were tried in deficient soils, with yield increase and Zn content in grain during harvest. Also tolerance to Zn deficient soils is achieved through genetic studies. It is important to note that foliar application of Zn at the time of mid booting stage or early milking stage is important and effective. Both soil and foliar is found to be effective if Se is applied. When compared sodium selenate is more effective than selenite for soil application. © 2020 Plant Archives. All rights reserved.

SP  - 2941-2956
AB  - The contrasting habitats providing a heterogenous environment are considered to affect morphological traits of Lepidoptera due to their adaptability to various selection pressures under such conditions. The morphological and genetic variability of the butterfly Argynnis paphia (Nymphalidae) were studied with a focus on populations across different environments of the Western Carpathians. Male individuals were collected from five sites differing in elevation, type of bedrock, vegetation and climatic region. Morphometric analyses indicated significant variability in reproductive (genitalia width) and non-reproductive (forewing shape and size) traits. The most significant differences were recorded between the locality Bačová, representing the highest elevation, and other localities. The statistical analyses revealed the correlation of wing morphology with elevation, bedrock type and annual average temperature, while morphological differences of valvae structures were correlated with altitude. We concluded that size and shape of wings but also male genitalia vary among populations of A. paphia from different regions in response to environmental conditions. © 2021, Institute of Zoology, Slovak Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Electricity generation from a biomass cookstove with MPPT power management and passive liquid cooling
VL  - 43
SP  - 162-172
AB  - An electrical power generator for use with biomass cooking stoves has been developed. The design is intended for users in developing countries who lack regular access to electricity. Electricity is generated based on the thermoelectric effect. A bespoke heat collector captures heat from the combustion chamber of the cooking stove and transfers it to a single thermoelectric generator (TEG) module. To maintain a sufficiently high temperature difference across the TEG, heat is dissipated using a passive single phase liquid thermosiphon system. This cooling system eliminates the requirement for mechanical components such as fans or pumps, which are unreliable and draw significant electrical power. In a controlled laboratory setting, a maximum power of 5.8 W has been produced from a single TEG installed into a low cost ceramic cooking stove currently disseminated in large numbers in Malawi, Africa. The TEG power is controlled using a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) conditioning circuit with an estimated efficiency of similar to 70%. The circuit provides a stable 5 V output via a USB connector for charging mobile phones, lights, power banks and other devices. Experiments have shown that the device is capable of performing for extended periods without significant reduction in performance. The magnitude of the power generated by this passive cooling system is observed to be comparable to that delivered by similar TEG-stove systems driven by active cooling. An average power generation of over 4 W was achieved which, including circuit efficiency, provided similar to 10 W.h of useful electrical energy over a 4 h burning interval, which is sufficient for charging low powered electrical appliances. Five prototypes fitted with data measurement and acquisition were deployed to families in rural Malawi in order to evaluate real-life performance of the technology. Initial field-trial results have advocated the viability of the TEG-stove technology for charging low powered electronic devices typically used in developing countries such as Malawi.

TI  - Low-intensity near-infrared light-tunable gold nanorod-incorporated hydrogel actuator system for remotely controlled human–robot interface applications
VL  - 26
AB  - Light-responsive soft actuators have recently drawn attention as the need for lightweight remotely controlled actuator systems with high environmental adaptability and safe human-robot interaction interface characteristics has increased. In this study, we focused on a near-infrared (NIR) light-tunable hydrogel soft actuator system capable of fast and precisely controllable mechanical actuation even under the irradiation of NIR light with low intensity. We designed a bilayer type hydrogel soft actuator consisting of a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) active layer containing gold nanorods (AuNRs) as a photothermal agent and poly(acrylamide) (PAAm) passive layer. AuNRs with an aspect ratio of 4.12 showed the largest longitudinal plasmon resonance absorption peak in the NIR 880 nm range, which was used as a photothermal agent. The AuNR-incorporated PNIPAAm/PAAm hydrogel with a bilayer structure (PNIPAAm-AuNR/PAAm) exhibited more than 70% gel fraction and temperature-sensitive swelling behaviors. In particular, rod-shaped PNIPAAm-AuNR/PAAm hydrogels showed rapid bending deformation by a photothermally induced phase transition of PNIPAAm upon 880 nm laser irradiation, but a PNIPAAm/PAAm bilayer hydrogel without AuNRs did not show a light-induced bending movement. The NIRresponsive bending actuation of the hydrogel can be precisely controlled by cross-linking density, content of photothermal agent, NIR laser intensity, and thickness ratio of the active/passive layer. It was observed that the full bending deformations of the hydrogel into a ring shape through an arc occurred within a minute under NIR irradiation with a lower intensity of less than 1.0 W/cm(2) . Hydrogels showed a cell viability of more than 95% in the biocompatibility test, indicating no significant cytotoxicity. Therefore, these PNIPAAm-AuNR/PAAm hydrogels are promising soft actuator materials that can be controlled by low-intensity NIR irradiation for remotely controlled humanerobot interaction interface applications.

AB  - Despite a significant progress in electrification over the last decade, more than 1 billion people have no access to electricity, and about 3 billion use solid fuel or kerosene for cooking and heating purposes. More than 95 % of them live in sub-Saharan Africa or developing Asia, and around 80 % are situated in rural areas. Conventional approach to power supply such as transmission grid extension is not economical due to high investment and connection costs. Technological progress has shifted down capital costs of renewable off-grid solutions. However, in the most cases, it is not enough to reach feasibility of these solutions due to weak investment conditions and weak purchasing power of the local population in these areas. The choice of business model can have a vital role in bringing electrification and connectivity to rural areas, providing flexibility and adaptability of the technology to the market conditions. Analysis of existing literature on business models for off-grid solutions concludes that the model for rural areas in developing countries should be more service oriented, be scalable to various use case scenarios, should provide good risk balance between customer and provider, and should enable transparency and quality of service. This paper analyses recent developments in off-grid system solutions for sub-Saharan Africa and provides classification of business model innovations. Based on the analysis, the paper proposes an innovative business model for Fusion Grid project, scalable mini-grid integrated with connectivity solution. Feasibility of the project is tested for three different cases, depending on the type of the rural community. Results suggests that combining micro-grid based power supply and internet connection as one service can contribute to a viability of the project, and, furthermore, can contribute to achieving global electrification goal.

TI  - An Assessment of Proso Millet as an Alternative Summer Cereal Crop in the Mediterranean Basin
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
AB  - Proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) is a cereal well known for its ability to be successfully grown under drought and intense heat conditions, thus sustaining food security in arid regions. Considering that a trend of increasing drought severity is expected in the future in Southern Europe, solutions need to be found to enhance the resilience of agroecosystems to the effects of climate change. From this perspective, proso millet re-introduction could represent an interesting tool in reducing water consumption for grain production and in providing a new resource to farmers. The aim of this study was to characterize proso millet adaptability to drought and low-input field conditions in the Mediterranean environment, especially considering water-related traits, such as water use efficiency. Limited water-demanding crops and yield stability can contribute to the resilience of agroecosystems and their adaptation to climate change. A three-year field crop experiment was conducted in northern Italy to assess proso millet’s performance in terms of productivity and water status in rainfed agriculture conditions. It was compared to a conventional irrigated corn, a typical summer cereal of the area. All years of experimentation were characterized by adverse meteorological trends, in the full manifestation of the uncertainties of climate change. Despite such different conditions from an agro-meteorological point of view, proso millet showed, in non-irrigated conditions, stable yield and water use efficiency (on average 0.30 kg/m2 and 1.83 kg/m3, respectively), and good agronomic performance. Proso millet, therefore, seems to offer interesting traits for reintroduction on the European side of the Mediterranean Basin, representing a resource for farmers. Moreover, the shortness of the proso millet life cycle (on average 108 days) allows it to be used as a catch crop in the event of major crop failure, an event becoming more likely in the climate change scenario. Furthermore, the possibility of producing grain while saving water (and other production inputs), even in very hot and dry years, increases the sustainability of agricultural production and the resilience of agroecosystems. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Characterising the biophysical, economic and social impacts of soil carbon sequestration as a greenhouse gas removal technology
VL  - 26

SP  - 1085-1108
AB  - To limit warming to well below 2°C, most scenario projections rely on greenhouse gas removal technologies (GGRTs); one such GGRT uses soil carbon sequestration (SCS) in agricultural land. In addition to their role in mitigating climate change, SCS practices play a role in delivering agroecosystem resilience, climate change adaptability and food security. Environmental heterogeneity and differences in agricultural practices challenge the practical implementation of SCS, and our analysis addresses the associated knowledge gap. Previous assessments have focused on global potentials, but there is a need among policymakers to operationalise SCS. Here, we assess a range of practices already proposed to deliver SCS, and distil these into a subset of specific measures. We provide a multidisciplinary summary of the barriers and potential incentives towards practical implementation of these measures. First, we identify specific practices with potential for both a positive impact on SCS at farm level and an uptake rate compatible with global impact. These focus on: (a) optimising crop primary productivity (e.g. nutrient optimisation, pH management, irrigation); (b) reducing soil disturbance and managing soil physical properties (e.g. improved rotations, minimum till); (c) minimising deliberate removal of C or lateral transport via erosion processes (e.g. support measures, bare fallow reduction); (d) addition of C produced outside the system (e.g. organic manure amendments, biochar addition); (e) provision of additional C inputs within the cropping system (e.g. agroforestry, cover cropping). We then consider economic and non-cost barriers and incentives for land managers implementing these measures, along with the potential externalised impacts of implementation. This offers a framework and reference point for holistic assessment of the impacts of SCS. Finally, we summarise and discuss the ability of extant scientific approaches to quantify the technical potential and externalities of SCS measures, and the barriers and incentives to their implementation in global agricultural systems. © 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Biomass yield, chemical composition and theoretical ethanol yield for different genotypes of energy sorghum cultivated on marginal land in China
VL  - 137
SP  - 221-230
AB  - Energy sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L). Moench] is potentially of great significance for bioethanol production because of its high biomass and wide adaptability. In this study, a field experiment was conducted on a semiarid marginal land in Inner Mongolia (39°10′N, 109°53′E), China, to assess the effects of genotypes with similar growth duration and biomass yield levels on chemical composition and theoretical ethanol yield (TEY) in both leaves and stems of four genotypes each of sweet and biomass sorghum in 2013 and 2014. Among all varieties, no significant variation was observed in the biomass yield of leaf (1.81–2.55 Mg ha−1) and stem (3.73–4.87 Mg ha−1), which was relatively low due to the marginal land with low temperature conditions. By contrast, considerable variation was detected in soluble sugars, ash and hexose contents of leaves and stems among the sweet sorghum varieties over two years. Compared with the sweet type, biomass sorghum varieties exhibited significantly lower soluble sugars content but higher cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin contents in both leaf and stem tissues, resulting in significantly lower hexose and higher pentose contents. Moreover, stems exhibited significantly higher total content of hexose and pentose (725.4 g kg−1) than leaves (642.3 g kg−1) across all varieties, leading to significantly higher TEY of stems than that of leaves. Despite the slightly higher TEY of sweet sorghum, biomass sorghum varieties exhibited particularly stable chemical components and TEY across both experimental years, resulting in greater potential for industrial bioethanol production in this study. Overall, varietal selection was effective in improving the biomass feedstock quality of energy sorghum for biochemical conversion. The findings of this study will help to facilitate industrial bioethanol production from dedicated bioenergy crops. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Sequential fuzzy association rule mining algorithm for plants environment classification using internet of things
VL  - 2199
AB  - Every plants need an environment which is in accordance with its adaptability. However, the environment always changes so that it requires regular analysis to maintain plant fertility. Environmental data such as temperature, humidity from soil and air, rainfall, light intensity can be processed using computer algorithms in the form of a sequential (time series) matrix. The paper proposed a sequential Fuzzy Association Rule Mining (FARM) for plants environment classification using Internet of Things (IoT). FARM is used to extract association rule in form of fuzzy memberships from plant environment data that collected from sensors of IoT. Fuzzy is used to facilitate grouping of sensor data and detect changes in the environment when the degree of membership becomes irrelevant. Fuzzy membership degrees are also mapped based on time series to interpret routine environmental changes. The paper showed results of a FARM algorithm for plant environments and prototypes from IoT circuits. FARM algorithm and IoT evaluated using real time data collecting of Aglaonema costatum (Chinese Evergreen). The results shown the FARM capable to extract relevant fuzzy rules with different parameter of tolerance of dependent. © 2019 Author(s).

SP  - 515-524
AB  - Engagement control of an automatic mechanical transmission clutch during vehicle start-up has important influences on the safety, comfort, service life, energy consumption, and emissions of the vehicle. However, all existing control strategies use single-layer control, which leads to poor temperature adaptability. This paper develops a double-layer control strategy based on an automatic actuator to improve vehicle start-up performance. The governing characteristics of a diesel engine with a variable-speed governor are studied. The working principles and a model of the automatic actuator are described. A simulation of vehicle start-up is constructed and tested. Finally, the double-layer control strategy is verified in an experimental vehicle. The experimental and simulation results show that the double-layer control strategy provides shorter start times, less jerking, and lower friction, thereby demonstrating its effectiveness and practicability. © 2019 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

TI  - Western North American Monarchs: Spiraling into Oblivion or Adapting to a Changing Environment?
VL  - 8

SP  - 19-26
AB  - Monarch butterflies in western North America typically migrate each fall from the Pacific Northwest to overwintering sites in California. Winter 2020/21 saw the lowest number of overwintering western monarch butterflies ever recorded, but was also marked by a winter-breeding population in the San Francisco bay area that appeared to be the largest ever seen. Recoveries of monarchs with wing tags from the Pacific Northwest suggested that many non-reproductive migrants in fall 2020 became reproductive in the San Francisco bay area and did not reach coastal overwintering sites. Mean daily maximum temperatures for San Francisco during fall and winter increased by ~1 °C during the past decade and were 2.5 °C above the 30 year mean during September-October 2020. Warm fall and winter temperatures along with the availability of non-native milkweeds likely caused the increase in winter breeding in winter 2020/21. The outcome of continued winter-breeding in the San Francisco bay area is uncertain. Whether it becomes a sink or source will be dependent on whether winter-breeding monarchs can re-enter their migratory state during spring. However, endemic levels of infection by the protozoan parasite, Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE), are often high in winter-breeding monarchs which can limit migration success. The eventual co-existence of winter-breeding and non-breeding monarch populations in northern and central California is probable, with an optimistic view suggesting that the adaptability of the monarch butterfly will allow it to persist in a changed environment. © 2021 David G James, published by De Gruyter.

TI  - An overview of domestication potential of Barbus altianalis (Boulenger, 1900) in Uganda
VL  - 11
SP  - 31-37
AB  - Domestication of fish is a key strategy for diversification of farmed species to meet consumer's choices and demands as well as conservation of the species for sustainable provision of nutrition benefits and incomes. Initial successful induced spawning of Barbus altianalis was achieved, but there is low adoption attributed to lack of sufficient quality seed. This paper reviews the ecological and social-economic trends, and potential prospects that justify the domestication of this high value indigenous species, and identify gaps that could be addressed to increase seed production for commercialization. Review findings show that due to overexploitation, there is a steady decline of B. altianalis in Ugandan water bodies, with no current record from Lake Victoria where catches had in the past been reported. B. altianalis shows ability to survive in interlacustrine-riverine environments although, the juveniles are largely confined in the river or stream water. Varying levels of adaptability and tolerance to environmental conditions including oxygen and temperature by different age groups occur. The species has a great potential for culture as an omnivorous species with high chances of adapting to varying feeding strategies. Knowledge gaps in size at maturity, appropriate inducing hormones, growth conditions, egg hatchability and larvae weaning were identified as key challenges associated with B. altianalis domestication. Understanding the underlying natural ecological dynamics of B. altianalis will guide further research in the areas mentioned to ensure advancement in domestication so as to meet the rising demand for B. altianalis. This will curtail its overexploitation in the wild and also improve the livelihoods of the communities in the region. © 2018

TI  - Comparison of morphological indexes and the pathogenicity of bursaphelenchus xylophilus in northern and southern China
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
AB  - The pine wood nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus is recognized as a major inva-sive species in many countries and causes widespread mortality in pine trees. Pine wood nematode disease (PWD) has spread northward from southern China to several areas of Liaoning Province, which has temperatures outside of the optimal range for this disease. To determine whether obvious variations in the population adaptability of PWN are involved in its rapid spread from southern to northern China, this study compared the differences in morphology of eight southern strains and eight northern strains and the pathogenicity of the 16 strains to Pinus thunbergii, the pine species that is the most susceptible to PWD in China, and to P. tabuliformis, the main PWN host in northern Liaoning Province. The southern-strain females were smaller than the northern-strain females, ex-cept for strain GD32. The size differences between the males of the different strains were not signif-icant. The difference in pathogenicity between the northern and southern strains to P. tabuliformis was more significant than the difference in their pathogenicity to P. thunbergii. The pathogenicity differentiation among northern strains was lower than that among southern strains, and the northern strains showed stronger pathogenicity to P. tabuliformis. The P. tabuliformis inoculation experiment showed that the pathogenicity of GD32, JS27, FJ14, LN13, and LN06 was significantly higher than that of FJ13. The results suggest that some PWN populations in the southern region, which are better adapted to P. tabuliformis, were likely directly transmitted to the northern region, resulting in the spread of PWD in the northern region. The spread of PWN from the south did not necessarily require a process of adaptation to the host or to the northern climate. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - 黑斑原鮡(Glyptosternum maculatum)是中国唯一的原鮡属鱼类，仅分布在中国境内的西藏雅鲁藏布江水系。 由于过度捕捞、水利工程影响、外来鱼类入侵等原因, 其野生种群数量持续下降, 分布范围逐年缩小，目前处于极 危状态。本研究中黑斑原鮡亲鱼捕自西藏日喀则市谢通门县、拉孜县、昂仁县、萨嘎县 4 个地区的雅鲁藏布江江 段, 采样地海拔分布范围介于 3900~4500 m。2015 年 5 月中旬至 6 月中旬，人工催产雌鱼 79 尾, 自然排卵 7 尾， 解剖雄鱼 15 尾进行授精，得到了黑斑原鮡受精卵约 42208 粒。受精卵为圆形的沉性卵，略显淡黄色，黏性较强。 将受精卵平铺放在特制筛网上，置于微流水的平列槽内进行孵化。观察从受精卵至仔鱼孵化出膜的胚胎发育过程, 统计有效积温。结果显示：黑斑原鮡胚胎发育时序符合硬骨鱼类胚胎发育的一般规律, 分为 8 个阶段, 即受精卵、 胚盘形成、卵裂、囊胚、原肠、神经胚、早期器官形成及孵出阶段。胚孔封闭前就形成了肌节和眼囊, 进入早期 器官形成阶段后依次出现了耳囊、心脏原基、消化道、耳石、眼睛体、胸鳍原基等, 心脏搏动后红细胞也有出现。 整个胚胎发育期间的平均温度约为 13.8°C, 有效积温为 2963.2~3132.4 h°C, 孵化率约为 70%。本研究还发现黑斑 原 胚胎具有双层卵膜的特殊结构, 该结构在成熟卵吸水膨胀后形成, 进入神经胚期完全消失，分析推测这种结构 可能与对环境的适应有关，外层卵膜在卵的传播和孵化过程中可以起到黏附固定和缓冲保护的作用。本研究旨在 深入了解黑斑原鮡胚胎发育的特点及规律, 为黑斑原鮡资源恢复及科学保护提供理论参考。. Glyptosternum maculatum is the only species of Glyptosternum in China and is uniquely endemic to the Yarlung Tsangpo River system. With the rapid dwindling of its populations and gradually shrinking distributions due to overfishing and the impact of water conservancy projects and foreign fish invasion in recent years, it is considered a critically endangered (CR) species by the Red List of Chinese vertebrates (2015). It is the only one of the 77 known Chinese sisorid species to be ranked on this list. In this study, the broodstock were captured in the four Yarlung Zangbo River sections of Shigatse, Tibet, including Xaitongmoin, Lhatse, Ngamring, and Saga. The altitude distribution range of the four sampling sites is approximately 3900-4500 m. From mid-May 2015 to mid-June 2015, 79 females were artificially induced to spawn, another 7 females naturally produced eggs and about 57440 eggs were spawned. At the same time, 15 males were dissected and their testes were broken for use in artificial insemination. Approximately 42208 fertilized eggs of G. maculatum were obtained. The fertilized round, demersal eggs were slightly yellowish with strong viscosity. The fertilized eggs were laid flat on a special sieve net and hatched in a small trough of a running water. In Lahsa, Tibet, the entire embryonic development process from fertilized egg to hatching was observed and the effective accumulated temperature of the embryonic deve lopment was calculated. In the fertilized egg and cleavage stage, the same batch of ferti lized eggs were sampled, observed, photographed and recorded every 30 min. After the cleavage stage, samples were taken every 1 h. At each time point, 10 fertilized eggs were taken and the stages of embryonic development and the period for entry into each were examined by microscopy. More than 50% of the embryos appeared to have corresponding characteristics. It was found that the timing sequence for embryonic development of G. maculatum was consistent with the general rule of teleosts, divided into eight s tages-fertilized egg, blastoderm formation, cleavage, blastula, gastrula, neurula, organogenesis and hatching sta ges-and further subdivided into 28 phases according to the morphological characteristics of each stage. Myomere and optic vesicles were formed before the blastopore and its closure, optic capsules, heart rudiment, digestive tract, otoliths, eye lens, pectoral fin rudim ents formed successively in the organogenesis stage. The red blood cells were found after the heart started beating. Meanwhile, the observation records revealed an average temperature of about 13.8 °C, and the effective accumulated temperature 2963.2-3132.4 h· °C, with a hatching rate of approximately 70%. However, unlike the eggs of the six common fish in the Yarlung Zangbo River, the fertilized eggs had a t wo-layer membrane that formed immediately at the point of water absorption and disappeared completely at the neurula stage. The two-layer egg membrane as a special structure may be responsible for environmental adaptability. The outer membrane may play a role in the adhesion, fixation and buffe r protection in the process of egg transmission and incubation. This study may contribute to understanding the characteristics and laws of G. maculatum, embryonic development and provide a theoretical reference for artificial breeding and scientific protection of the species. © 2018 Journal of Fishery Sciences of China.

TI  - Developmental parameters of a southern mountain pine beetle (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) population reveal potential source of latitudinal differences in generation time
VL  - 151
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-15
AB  - Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins; Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a major disturbance agent in pine (Pinus Linnaeus; Pinaceae) ecosystems of western North America. Adaptation to local climates has resulted in primarily univoltine generation time across a thermally diverse latitudinal gradient. We hypothesised that voltinism patterns have been shaped by selection for slower developmental rates in southern populations inhabiting warmer climates. To investigate traits responsible for latitudinal differences we measured lifestage-specific development of southern mountain pine beetle eggs, larvae, and pupae across a range of temperatures. Developmental rate curves were fit using maximum posterior likelihood estimation with a Bayesian prior to improve fit stability. When compared to previously published data for a northern population, optimal development of southern individuals occurred at higher temperatures, with higher development thresholds, as compared with northern individuals. Observed developmental rates of the southern and northern populations were similar across studied lifestages at 20 °C, and southern lifestages were generally faster at temperature extremes (10 °C, 27 °C). At 25 °C southern fourth instars were significantly slower than northern fourth instars. Our results suggest that evolved traits in the fourth instar and remaining unstudied lifestage, teneral (i.e., preemergent) adult, likely influence latitudinal differences in mountain pine beetle generation time. © 2018 Entomological Society of Canada.

AB  - Precision fertilization is one of the important links in the precision agricultural operation system. In recent years, the demand for precision fertilization in facility greenhouse has become more and more urgent. As such, this paper designs an accurate and practical fertilization on-line monitoring system. The system adopts capacitance conversion chip PCAP01 and SCM STM32F103C8T6 to build a capacitance detection circuit. The effective acquisition of differential capacitance sensor microcapacitor signal output under this system is realized. The response relationship between the mass flow and the sensor capacitance output was studied, and a linear fitting model of fertilization was established. According to the prediction, the model determination coefficient was 0.9997. The experiment shows that the system has good adaptability to ambient temperature. The average measurement error is 1.13%, which meets the technical requirements of flow measurement. The capacitive fertilization online measurement system provides an effective way for the on-line acquisition of fertilization flow. It is of great significance for the implementation of high-precision variable fertilization. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.

SP  - 117-127
AB  - In order to improve the monitoring level of fertilization performance for agricultural machinery by using the dielectric properties of fertilizer, a detection system of fertilizer level was established based on capacitance signal. The calculation formula was analyzed for capacitive level sensor. The plate size of capacitive level sensor was designed through theoretical research and simulation analysis. The effect of temperature on the accuracy of capacitive sensor detection was studied, and three kinds of fertilizers (potassium sulfate (K), diammonium phosphate (P), carbamideurea (N)) were used as test objects. The test results showed that capacitive level sensors had good adaptability to the ambient temperature. The differential capacitance detection value was below 0.29 pF in the temperature range of 5°C~45°C. The system can accurately measure the change of different fertilizer capacitances, and the measurement accuracy reached 0.01 pF. Capacitive sensor has been verified with an accuracy of over 96.9%. The capacitive level sensor can be used as an important basis for measuring the level of fertilizer. © 2020, Asian Association for Agricultural Engineering. All rights reserved.

SP  - 182-189
AB  - Tetrastichus giffardianus is a gregarious koinobiont endoparasitoid of tephritids, including Ceratitis capitata, which is one of the most important fruit pests worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of constant temperatures on the biology and development of the egg-adult period of T. giffardianus in larvae/pupae of C. capitata to construct a fertility life table. The study was carried out in climatic chambers at constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 ± 1°C, 70 ± 10% relative humidity and a photophase of 12 h. Complete egg and larval development occurred only at temperatures of 20, 25, and 30°C. The mean longevity of males and females was inversely proportional to temperature. The time of development of the pre-imaginal period was influenced by temperature and ranged from 41 days at 20°C to 11 days at 25°C. The best T. giffardianus performance occurred at 25°C when the intrinsic rate of increase was 0.21, the mean generation time was 20.43 days, the time required to double the population was 3.33 days, and the finite rate of population increase (?) was 1.23. The results of this study provided information for the establishment of mass rearing and an evaluation of the adaptability of T. giffardianus to different environments, which is necessary for the use of this parasitoid in the biological control of tephritid pests, particularly C. capitata.

TI  - Characteristics and ecological functions of deep-sea viruses
VL  - 64
IS  - 15
SP  - 1598-1609
AB  - Believed to be the most abundant (~1030) biological agents in the ocean, viruses play an important role in microbial metabolism, prokaryotic mortality, and nutrient recycling in marine ecosystems, thereby significantly influencing the geochemical cycles of our planet. The importance of viruses in the surface ocean has been well recognized, however we are just beginning to understand the viral role and the underlying mechanism in the deep ocean. As an essential part of the marine environment, the abyssal ocean has extensive material and energy exchanges with the upper ocean and the deep biosphere, and they constitute an integral whole of the marine ecosystem. With an average depth of approximately 3800 m, the benthic environment is characterized by total darkness, low temperature (&lt;4℃), and high hydrostatic pressure (&gt;10 MPa). The deep-sea inhabited microorganisms, including viruses, are believed to develop unique strategy to survive under multiple extreme environmental stresses. Studies on deep-sea viruses have revealed their abundance, diversity, and important ecological functions. In this review, advances in research on deep-sea viruses are summarized into four parts: general features, relationship between environmental factors and deep-sea viruses, isolation and characterization of representative viruses, and significant influences of the viriobenthos on the physiological and ecological function of deepsea microorganisms. In general, the functions of viruses in the deep-sea environment mainly include two aspects: First, the regulation of material and energy cycle (viral shunt) and the dynamic change in ecosystem composition (balance of microbial communities) modulated by viral lysis; second, the expression of viral metabolic related genes (auxiliary metabolism) and the effect of viruses on host physiological activities (environmental adaptability). The former has been widely recognized, but the influence and molecular mechanism of the latter in the extreme deep-sea environment need to be further investigated. Here, we propose research directions and challenges in this field to undertake in future studies. Notably, the relationship between environmental factors and deep-sea viruses remains poorly understood. A deep-sea viralhost model system must be developed to investigate the underlying regulatory mechanism of gene expression and the interaction between deep-sea viruses and their hosts under extreme environmental conditions. At present, the number of isolated deep-sea viruses is less than 30, which is below 1% of the total number of viruses in the International Virus Classification Database. In terms of classification, most of the isolated deep-sea viruses belong to Caudovirales, and nearly no representatives have been identified yet from other viral orders. Furthermore, deep-sea viruses have been rarely subjected to in-depth study possibly because of very few benthic microorganisms with genetic operating system. In addition to maximizing the use of existing virus-host systems, scholars must focus on isolating other representative deepsea viruses. Although our understanding on viriobenthos is still far from complete, data provided here encourage us to hypothesize that viruses are the key component of the benthic ecosystem and play an indispensable role in the deep ocean and deep biosphere. © 2019, Science Press.

TI  - Provenance variation and seed sourcing for sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) in France
VL  - 79
IS  - 1
AB  - Key message: Sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) provenance variation was assessed in a multisite test based on traits of economic and ecological relevance in France. While climatic drivers generated genetic clines at a range-wide scale, provenance variation in France was mainly shaped by past silvicultural regimes. We developed a multitrait approach to facilitate decision-making for seed sourcing. A set of provenance clusters is proposed, supporting recommendations for plantation programmes. Context: Among broadleaves, sessile oak (Quercus petraea) is likely to spread in the context of current climate change and is increasingly planted in France. Seed sourcing is of the utmost importance for ensuring plantation success and adaptation. The selection of appropriate seed sources is highly challenging when the future climate conditions of plantation areas are uncertain. Aims: We aimed at identifying drivers of provenance variation in Q. petraea and to build provenance clusters based on traits of adaptive and economic value, to ultimately support decision-making in seed sourcing. Methods: We analysed a multisite provenance test established 30 years ago and comprising a large collection of Q. petraea provenances by performing phenotypic assessments of survival, growth, phenology, and stem-quality traits. We analysed climate-trait correlations at a range-wide scale and used multivariate statistics [multivariate mixed models, principal component analysis (PCA)] and classification methods [hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), K-means method] to generate an overall clustering of french provenances. Results: Provenance effects were highly significant regardless of the trait considered, whereas interaction effects between provenance and other experimental sources of variation were minor compared to provenance and environmental variance. There was limited variation between provenances collected in the same forest in comparison to origins of different forests. We found sharp temperature-driven genetic clines for growth and phenology-related traits at a range-wide scale. The multitrait classification approach grouped the French provenances into 11 clusters, with the members of each cluster having similar trait values. Overall, the cluster composition of provenances poorly matched the provenance regions identified on ecological grounds, but rather mirrored the silvicultural regimes implemented in the source stands in the past. Conclusions: Two of the provenance clusters (comprising a total of 34 provenances) were identified as potentially useful sources of reproductive material. We recommend mixing seeds of different provenances from a given cluster to ensure the maintenance of diversity and to enhance adaptability to future climatic conditions. © 2022, The Author(s).

TI  - Improving Post-discharge Practice of Kangaroo Mother Care: Perspectives From Communities in East-Central Uganda
VL  - 10
AB  - Introduction: Kangaroo mother care (KMC) is among the most cost-effective and easily accessible solutions for improving the survival and wellbeing of small newborns. In this study, we examined the barriers and facilitators to continuity of KMC at home following hospital discharge in rural Uganda. Methods: We conducted this study in five districts in east-central Uganda, within six hospitals and at the community level. We used a qualitative approach, with two phases of data collection. Phase 1 comprised in-depth interviews with mothers who practiced KMC with their babies and caretakers who supported them and key informant interviews with health workers, district health office staff, community health workers, and traditional birth attendants. We then conducted group discussions with mothers of small newborns and their caretakers. We held 65 interviews and five group discussions with 133 respondents in total and used a thematic approach to data analysis. Results: In hospital, mothers were sensitized and taught KMC. They were expected to continue practicing it at home with regular returns to the hospital post-discharge. However, mothers practiced KMC for a shorter time at home than in the hospital. Reasons included being overburdened with competing domestic chores that did not allow time for KMC and a lack of community follow-up support by health workers. There were increased psycho-social challenges for mothers, alongside some dangerous practices like placing plastic cans of hot water near the baby to provide warmth. Respondents suggested various ways to improve the KMC experience at home, including the development of a peer-to-peer intervention led by mothers who had successfully done KMC and community follow-up of mothers by qualified health workers and community health workers. Conclusion: Despite wide acceptance of KMC by health workers, challenges to effective implementation persist. Amid the global and national push to scale up KMC, potential difficulties to its adherence post-discharge in a rural, resource-limited setting remain. This study provides insights on KMC implementation and sustainability from the perspectives of key stakeholders, highlighting the need for a holistic approach to KMC that incorporates its adaptability to community settings and contexts.

SP  - 68-75
AB  - Objective To evaluate the habitat adaptability of Dermacentor niveus and D. marginatus, and to provide reference for the prevention and control of the two tick species and their disease transmission. Methods The distribution sites of D. niveus and D. marginatus in Xinjiang from 1980 to 2017 were collected from the distribution and diversity data set of tick species in China, and the distribution sites of the two tick species in Xinjiang from 2017 to 2021 were collected through China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Baidu Academic, PubMed and other databases. Environmental variables were downloaded from the World Meteorological Database. The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model was established with 75% data records as training subset and the remaining 25% as model evaluation subset. The main environmental variables were screened using the “Jackknife” method of MaxEnt model and the R software. MaxEnt species distribution prediction model and ArcGIS spatial analysis method were used to predict the breeding environment distribution of D. niveus and D. marginatus. The model output was presented using ArcMap 10.1, and the characteristics of ecological environment of the two tick species were predicted according to the response curves of bioclimatic variables plotted by MaxEnt model. Results A total of 46 and 64 distribution sites of D. niveus and D. marginatus were found from the screening, respectively, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of the model assessment test subsets of D. niveus and D. marginatus were 0.847 and 0.815, respectively. From the 19 environmental variables, 8 environmental factors were screened out, which affect the survival of D. niveus and D. marginatus. The natural habitat prediction showed that the suitable habitats for D. niveus in Xinjiang were in the Junggar Basin, the Turpan Basin and the Tarim Basin; the suitable habitats for D. marginatus were in the Junggar Mountains, the Tianshan Mountains and the Kunlun Mountains. The areas of non-suitable habitat, low suitable habitat, moderate suitable habitat and high suitable habitat for D. niveus accounted for 35.80%, 29.18%, 10.32% and 24.70% of the total area of Xinjiang; while those for D. marginatus accounted for 33.62%, 17.01%, 17.08% and 32.28%, respectively. By the Jackknife method, the data screening found that precipitation of the driest month (Bio14), seasonal temperature change (Bio4), and mean temperature of the wettest quarter (Bio8) were the main environmental variable factor of D. niveus distribution, while the precipitation of the driest quarter (Bio17), annual precipitation (Bio12) and precipitation of wettest quarter (Bio16) were the main environmental variable factor of the distribution of D. marginatus. The response curve of main environmental variables showed that when the Bio14 was 21 mm, the coefficient of variation of Bio4 was 1 510, and Bio8 was 20 ℃, the existence probability of D. niveus was the highest; when Bio17 was 71 mm, Bio12 was 230 mm and Bio16 was 269 mm, the existence probability of D. marginatus was the highest. Conclusion MaxEnt model established exhibits high prediction precision and accuracy. It was demonstrated that low altitude area was the preferable habitat for D. niveus, whereas the high altitude area was the preferable habitat for D. marginatus. The precipitation in the driest month was the main environmental factor affecting the two tick species; the temperature was the primary environmental variable affecting D. niveus distribution, and precipitation was the primary environmental variable affecting D. marginatus distribution. © 2022, National Institute of Parasitic Diseases.

TI  - Emulsion templated porous funnel from polypropylene waste for efficient oil separation and spillage management
VL  - 650
AB  - A huge surge in waste polypropylene (PP) generation, seen after the outburst of coronavirus, has created additional challenges for plastic waste management, which has been a difficult issue to deal with for the past few decades. A novel approach to create a value-added product out of waste PP from face mask and sack is reported here in which an emulsion templated, sacrificial 3D printed porous funnel was developed for efficient oil-water separation. A hitherto unexplored water-in-oil emulsion of PP was formulated for this purpose which was used as a template to create the porous samples. Emulsion templated porous samples showed mesoporous morphology and a specific surface area of more than 170 m2/g, as confirmed by BET and SAXS analysis. A high oil adsorption capacity of 7.5 g/g of the porous sample was observed for petrol which was found to be comparable with a commercial nonwoven PP absorbent pad (8.8 g/g). A 3D printed funnel was fabricated via sacrificial templating, and it was used for the separation of oil (petrol) from contaminated water. The separation efficiency of 99.8% for petrol/water mixture was obtained without any decline in performance, hydrophobicity, and structural integrity of the funnel for ten cycles of use. The approach used in this research can further be extended at a scaled-up level to attain commercial viability of the process and may additionally be used for plastic waste other than PP. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Farmers’ beliefs and concerns about climate change: An assessment from southern Saudi Arabia
VL  - 10
IS  - 7

AB  - Climate change constitutes a major threat to agricultural production, food security, and natural resource management. Saudi Arabia is particularly susceptible to increasing temperatures and extreme climatic events, such as arid weather and drought. The purpose of this study is to assess farmers’ beliefs and concerns as regards climate change. Extensive interviews were conducted with 164 farmers in the Jazan region. Results revealed that 89.6% of the farmers believed that climate change is due to human activities and 93.3% believed that it is because of natural change. Seventy-five percent of the farmers were concerned about insects and 73% about the prevalence of weeds on their farms. Findings of cluster analysis revealed that farmers who are more likely to believe in climate change are more in agreement with the role of extension services in capacity building. Farmers’ beliefs about climate change were significantly influenced by membership of agricultural cooperatives, access to loans, use of extension services, age, farm size, and level of soil fertility. Access to loans was the only significant factor to explain the differences in farmers’ concerns. These results suggest the need for capacity‐building activities targeted at improving farmers’ adaptability to manage climate variability. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

VL  - 626
SP  - 99-108
AB  - Short-lived herbaceous plants provide a useful model to rapidly reveal how multiple generations of plants in natural plant communities of sensitive desert ecosystems will be affected by N deposition. We monitored dynamic responses of community structure, richness, evenness, density and biomass of herbaceous plants to experimental N addition (2:1 NH4 +:NO3 − added at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6 and 24 g N m− 2 a− 1) in three seasons in each of three years in the Gurbantunggut desert, a typical temperate desert of central Asia. We found clear rate-dependent and season-dependent effects of N deposition on each of these variables, in most cases becoming more obvious through time. N addition reduced plant richness, leading to a loss of about half of the species after three generations in the highest N application level. Evenness and density were relatively insensitive to all but the greatest levels of N addition for two generations, but negative effects emerged in the third generation. Biomass, both above and below ground, was non-linearly affected by N deposition. Low and intermediate levels of N deposition often increased biomass, whereas the highest level suppressed biomass. Stimulatory effects of intermediate N addition disappeared in the third generation. All of these responses are strongly interrelated in a cascade of changes. Notably, changes in biomass due to N deposition were mediated by declines in richness and evenness, and other changes in community structure, rather than solely being the direct outcome of release from limitation. The interrelationships between N deposition and the different plant community attributes change not only seasonally, but also progressively change through time. These temporal changes appear to be largely independent of interannual or seasonal climatic conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 3
SP  - 249-259
AB  - Most monarchs (Danaus plexippus plexippus) overwinter in the volcanic mountains of central Mexico clustering in oyamel fir (Abies religiosa) forests described as a hot-water bottle, blanket, and umbrella that maintain a microclimate warm enough for the butterflies not to freeze, but cool enough to save lipids for northward migration. In the mid-1990s butterflies covered 21 ha of forest, but by 2017-18 the population had dropped more than 80% and the butterflies covered only 2.5 ha, less than half the minimum population size to be out of the danger of migratory collapse. As monarchs spread throughout North America over multiple summer generations, they lay eggs exclusively on milkweed (Asclepias spp.). Monarchs are threatened by milkweed loss, pesticides, logging, and climate change. The monarch is a symbol of conservation and cooperation and people are working across sectors and national boundaries to protect this familiar and beloved butterfly for future generations. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

VL  - 36
IS  - 7
SP  - 1782-1795
AB  - The magnitude of climate change has been greatest in the Arctic, accelerating climate-induced shifts in phenology, but wildlife responses vary. Variation may be due to the relative importance of phenotypic plasticity or phenotypic selection. Here, we examine and contrast the environmental drivers of plasticity in breeding phenology of two circumpolar seabirds at their receding summer range limit using unique datasets of marked individuals covering 25 and 30 years. Based on prior knowledge of the local ecosystems, we predicted that climate would generate opposing patterns of plasticity in the two populations. Laying phenology of kittiwakes in the Gulf of Alaska was associated with a large-scale climate oscillation (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) while the Arctic-breeding murres adjusted laying to sea-ice conditions. Kittiwakes laid earlier after experiencing colder climate about 2 years prior and laying dates did not advance over the study, but murres laid earlier when warmer climate led to earlier spring sea-ice break-up, and murre laying dates advanced by 1 week since 1990. Selection favoured earlier laying in both species. Both populations adjusted breeding phenology to environmental variation, but we anticipate opposing effects on phenology with continued climate change. Ice-constrained species can likely adapt to some extent because plasticity can provide the necessary shift to this physical barrier, although individuals were only able to adjust by ~1 week while ice conditions advanced by over a month. In more temperate regions, where phenology is driven by bottom-up effects, plasticity and selection counteract one another leading to limited adaptability. We provide insights into the likely adjustments by Arctic marine animals to an increasingly warmer and ice-less summer.

SP  - 1-22
AB  - Soil health management is a prime concern to ensure agricultural sustainability. Dwindling soil fertility as well as declining soil health is one of the great challenges of the present time to feed the world population. Injudicious use of chemical fertilizers may negatively affect soil health. Further, chemical fertilizer production is associated with release of greenhouse gases to atmosphere and thus, pollutes the environment. In the present context of climate change and global warming, legumes can be considered for mitigation of ill effects of climate change and improving soil health. Legumes are versatile crops, having a huge potential to produce protein-rich grains, fix nitrogen biologically and enrich beneficial microbes in soil. Some legumes are capable to solubilize the unavailable phosphate by exudating organic acids from their roots. Legumes can facilitate rebuilding of soil organic matter and restrict pests and pathogens when incorporated in crop rotation. Besides, legumes are known for weed suppression and check erosion as cover crops. As green and brown manures, legumes add a sizeable quantity of biomass and nutrients to the soil. In cropping system, legumes fit well because of wider diversity and adaptability. The multifaceted benefits of legumes are prominent either in multiple cropping or intercropping, and thus, can be considered as an inevitable choice for soil health management in the journey towards sustainable agriculture. © 2022 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Thriving populations with low genetic diversity in giant clam species, Tridacna maxima and Tridacna noae, at Dongsha Atoll, South China Sea
VL  - 24
SP  - 278-287
AB  - Giant clams provide valuable functions to the coral reefs and traditional fisheries in the South China Sea (SCS), but many populations face escalating threats of overexploitation and habitat loss. To provide critical biodiversity data for development of protection and sustainable utilisation strategies, we examine the status of wild tridacnine population at Dongsha Atoll, the largest northernmost atoll of the SCS. This study also examines the genetic patterns of Tridacna maxima and Tridacna noae, based on partial mitochondrial COI gene sequences. We found four species at Dongsha Atoll with an overall density of 3.14 per 100 m(2). Over-harvesting may have depleted populations of T. squamosa and Hippopus hippopus, and they may no longer be reproductively viable. Populations of T. maxima and T. noae appear to be thriving and replenished by recruits, but species showed low levels of mitochondrial genetic diversity that could reduce its adaptability and may become further impacted by exploitation and global warming. Haplotype networks for T. maxima and T. noae showed strong significant population structuring consistent with contemporary geographic boundaries: Dongsha Atoll, Taiwan and Philippines-likely established by the intrusion of the Kuroshio Current. Given the contrasting species status and genetic diversity, conservation strategies need to be tailored to increase success of these efforts. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Immobilized Droplet Arrays in Thermosetting Oil for Dynamic Proteolytic Assays of Single Cells
VL  - 13
IS  - 5
SP  - 6081-6090
AB  - Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in tumor progression. The study of dynamic MMPs activity at the single-cell level can dissect tumor heterogeneity in the time domain and facilitate finding out more efficient clinical solutions for tumor treatment. Due to the fluidity of the carrier oil, the existing droplet-based methods for single-cell MMP analysis rarely have the capability to track proteolytic assays in droplets continuously. Therefore, we describe a thermosetting oil for real-time monitoring of MMP assays in droplets, which can immobilize droplets by transforming into solid after droplet generation. The solidification of this oil can be accomplished in 33 min at 37 °C, basing on the hydrosilation of vinyl silicone oil and hydrosilicone oil without other inducers (e.g. UV, Ca2+). Through monitoring the MMP assays of single cells, the reaction rates can be calculated according to real-time fluorescent curves, showing significant cell heterogeneity in MMP activity. Moreover, the dynamic MMP activity reveals that some of the A549 cells transiently secrete MMP. In conclusion, the thermosetting oil enables immobilize droplets to achieve real-time monitoring of single-cell proteolytic activity without impairing the flexibility of droplet microfluidics and has a potential in other cell-based assays for providing dynamic information at high resolutions. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

TI  - Identifying the full spectrum of climatic signals controlling a tree species' growth and adaptation to climate change
VL  - 130
AB  - Identifying the key climatic parameters controlling a tree species’ growth in a given environment can improve our understanding of the species’ adaptability to climate change. However, this can be significantly affected by the detection and analytical methodologies used, at least for water-limited ecosystems. To address this issue, we tested together for the first time the five key methods widely applied for detecting climatic drivers of tree growth. The test was applied on the growth dynamics of Pinus pinea L. (the last ca. 130 years) and for evaluating its climatic sensitivity (the last ca. 60 years), under contrasting climatic conditions, from sites in Italy and Greece. As predictors, we selected a high number of seasonal, annual, and multi-annual climate integration periods (626 variables in total for precipitation and SPEI) through running correlation analysis. Methods that retain low-frequency variability and persistence of past climatic signals in radial growth (ABD, RCS, and raw BAI) revealed that long-term precipitation accumulated over 3–6 years was the key driver for P. pinea growth in the wettest sites. These signals probably appeared because of the cumulative effects of past years’ rainfall in determining water table levels. They would have been missed if low-frequency climate and growth variability were not considered, how it happens using standardized BAI and TRW. In the driest site, productivity was low and explained by 1–2 years precipitation signals, suggesting that mostly moisture stored in topsoil from more recent rainfall sustained P. pinea growth, a typical shallow-rooted species. Thus, the loss in root contact with the declining water table may explain the higher vulnerability to drought stress at its dry-end distribution range, particularly under low precipitation. A further drop in water table levels, driven by global warming, will most likely increase such vulnerability. Hence, conservation efforts will require maintaining a stable water table, prohibiting groundwater overexploitation at P. pinea habitats. Reducing competition from other deeper rooted tree species, better adapted to drought and fire, may further benefit the species’ conservation status. © 2021

AB  - To develop a system for the mass production of Protaetia brevitarsis larvae (Pbl), this study analyzed the oviposition characteristics of third instar Pbl through successive rearing and cold treatments. In the first generation, females laid 50 eggs each on average, and spawned higher numbers of eggs for the first 5 days but then fewer after this. However, all of the 2 nd -generation females that were produced through the successive rearing of eggs from the 1 st generation did not spawn. When test insects (TI) were raised at 32°C, their mean ± SE pupal period and emergence rate were 28.4 ± 1.9 days and 87%, respectively. However, most individuals raised in cold treatments (5°C and − 5°C) without a pre-cooling period did not survive. Individuals exposed to a pre-cooling period, however, had a 7–10 days longer pupal period than those raised at 32°C, and their emergence rate (90%) was slightly higher. Different cold treatment temperatures (0°C, 3°C, or 5°C) and periods (30 or 60 days) were tested in further experiments. The experimental group kept for 30 days at 0°C and 3°C had the shortest pupal period of all, and emergence rates exceeded 90% in most groups. With respect to the number of eggs spawned by the second generation females after cold treatments, the experimental groups held in cold treatments at 5°C for 30 and 60 days were found to spawn the most eggs. Consequently, the experimental group kept at 5°C for 30 days was the most effective set of conditions tested during the entire breeding period. © 2018 The Entomological Society of Korea and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - The plant community is the product of the interaction between plants and the environment, and the interaction process is associated with changes in community structure and species diversity. Exploring the distribution of forest communities, species diversity patterns, and their relationship with environmental factors is important for protecting forest stability and biodiversity. Quantitative analysis is an important approach in research on community classification and sorting and can profoundly reveal the ecological relationship between plant communities and environmental factors. The study of species diversity patterns can reflect the ecological characteristics of plant communities and their adaptability to environment change. The Korean pine broadleaved forest (KBF) is the local climax vegetation and mainly distributed in northeast China. It has a complex forest structure and rich biodiversity and is very important in maintaining the regional biodiversity. Therefore, it is vital to conduct a case study regarding community classification, ordination, and species diversity patterns in broadleaved Korean pine forests. In recent years, many studies regarding KBF have been conducted from various perspectives, but forest community classification, sorting, and comparison research using quantitative ecology is still lacking. Along a latitudinal gradient, we investigated the forest community structure with 40 plots (20 m × 20 m). Then, forest community classification, ordination, and comparison of species diversity were conducted using the methods of MRT (multiple regression tree), CCA (correspondence analysis), and comparison of species diversity indexes. The results showed that the MRT classified the forest communities into four types by relating different aspects of species composition to environmental data: ( I) Abies fabri-Pinus koraiensis Association, ( II) Quercus mongolica-Acer mono-Pinus koraiensis Association, (III) Fraxinus mandshurica-Acer tegmentosum-Pinus koraiensis Association, (IV) Carpinus cordata-Betula costata-Pinus koraiensis Association. Species composition and diversity of forest communities differed greatly among the four types. The richness and species diversity index of Carpinus cordata-Betula costata-Pinus koraiensis Association were significantly higher than that of the Abies fabri Craib-Pinus koraiensis Association. The results of CCA were consistent with the forest community classification from MRT. It clearly reflected the distribution range of various community types and the relationships between community distribution and environmental factors. The Abies fabri-Pinus koraiensis Association corresponded to colder habitat, whereas the Carpinus cordata-Betula costata-Pinus koraiensis Association corresponded to warmer and wetter habitat. The Quercus mongolica-Acer mono-Pinus koraiensis Association tended to be in habitats with fertile soil. The distribution of the Fraxinus mandshurica-Acer tegmentosum-Pinus koraiensis Association had no special preference for environmental conditions. Temperature and precipitation were the main environmental factors affecting the distribution pattern of forest communities, whereas soil nutrients had smaller effects. These results help to more thoroughly understand the space distribution pattern and ecological characteristics of the forest community. They also provide thecorresponding theoretical basis for the management and protection of broadleaved Korean pine forests in the future. © 2019 Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica.

TI  - Conceptual framework of smart fertilization management for oil palm tree based on IOT and deep learning
VL  - 842
AB  - Oil palm trees contribute economic income to the national and community by generating various types of productions. This will cause an expansion of the area for the plantation of oil palm seeds, then contributes to the stability in distributing good quality oil to accommodate the growing population. Furthermore, degradation occurs when the planting of oil palm trees increases rapidly, especially the occurrence of uncontrolled oil palm cultivation. The degradation can cause loss of soil nutrients due to soil erosion. The lack of macronutrients, Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) and Magnesium (Mg) on oil palm tree may impact on its growth which includes the quality of crops. Traditional approach to detect macronutrients, can also lead to some improper control in turn leads results in reduction in yield. The existing system has given limited information of dataset and slower classification performance due to limited functions. With the adaptability of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, oil palm tree growth data and fertilization management can be utilizing effortlessly and effectively. The context of conceptual framework comprises the IoT technologies, image processing, machine learning and deep learning which focuses on environmental factors that affecting the young oil palm tree growth that involve temperature, humidity, soil moisture content, light and nutrient. Thus, a study of IoT, machine learning and deep learning for smart fertilization management of oil palm trees is suggested helping and raise the efficiency of oil palm trees management in Malaysia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - The Growth of Kapur Tanduk (Dryobalanops lanceolata Burck.) on Different Levels of Canopy Opening and Fertilization
VL  - 394
AB  - Critical land rehabilitation efforts in the forests areas are important activities to be undertaken. Dipterocarpaceae is a potential species to be developed in the restoration of degraded forest areas, one of which is Kapur Tanduk (Dryobalanops lanceolata Burck.). This study aims to determine the influence of canopy opening factor, dose of manure, and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, slope, and soil conditions) to the growth of D. lanceolata in research plots (KHDTK Haurbentes, West Java). The results showed that the different levels of canopy opening (71.34%, 37.91%) and the dose of manure (0, 2, 4 kg / planting hole) have no significant effect either single or interaction both to the increase in diameter and height of D. lanceolata. The Different levels of canopy opening in both areas resulted that different responses in the early days of growth, the degree of opening of 71.24% (open area) had a good response to the diameter growth while at the level of opening of 37.91% (under the shade) had high growth rate of plants. Thus, until the age of 6 months D. lanceolata has a good adaptability to the degree of canopy opening in between 37-72%. The environmental conditions in the research plots in KHDTK Haurbentes are suitable with the characteristics of the growing species so it can support the growth of D. lanceolata. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Cold atmospheric helium plasma induces apoptosis by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
VL  - 10

SP  - 243-257
AB  - Cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAPP) has been proposed as a novel method for anticancer therapy. This field gained much interest in the last decade, with biological applications such as wound healing, bacterial sterilization, and cancer treatment. However, the mechanism at the basis of plasma-cell interaction remains unclear. Here, we studied the effect of helium (He) gas CAPP on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in vitro. CAPP treatment was performed under different treatment time conditions: 1, 3, and 5 min. Results showed that CAPP treatment induces cell death in OSCC cells in a dose-dependent manner. He-CAPP also induces cell death and G1 cell cycle arrest associated with the ATM/P53 pathway. Furthermore, CAPP activates the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway by enhancing Bax expression and of the Bcl-2 protein suppression. Hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2) generation increased immediately after He plasma treatment but reached basal level after 3 h. Further studies showed that CAPP increases intracellular ROS and RNS and reverts after a long period of plasma treatment. Taken together, these results indicated that He-CAPP induces cell death and cell cycle arrest and activates mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) in OSCC cells. Our study provides deep understanding of He-CAPP’s effect on OSCC cells. We suggest that CAPP could be a potential therapeutic and clinical research tool for oral cancer treatment. © 2020 by Begell House,.

AB  - Knowledge on correlations between environmental factors and genome divergence between populations of marine species is crucial for sustainable management of fisheries and wild populations. The edible cockle (Cerastoderma edule) is a marine bivalve distributed along the Northeast Atlantic coast of Europe and is an important resource from both commercial and ecological perspectives. We performed a population genomics screening using 2b-RAD genotyping on 9309 SNPs localized in the cockle's genome on a sample of 536 specimens pertaining to 14 beds in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean to analyse the genetic structure with regard to environmental variables. Larval dispersal modelling considering species behaviour and interannual/interseasonal variation in ocean conditions was carried out as an essential background to which compare genetic information. Cockle populations in the Northeast Atlantic displayed low but significant geographical differentiation between populations (FST = 0.0240; p &lt; 0.001), albeit not across generations. We identified 742 and 36 outlier SNPs related to divergent and balancing selection in all the geographical scenarios inspected, and sea temperature and salinity were the main environmental correlates suggested. Highly significant linkage disequilibrium was detected at specific genomic regions against the very low values observed across the whole genome. Two main genetic groups were identified, northwards and southwards of French Brittany. Larval dispersal modelling suggested a barrier for larval dispersal linked to the Ushant front that could explain these two genetic clusters. Further genetic subdivision was observed using outlier loci and considering larval advection. The northern group was divided into the Irish/Celtic Seas and the English Channel/North Sea, while the southern group was divided into three subgroups. This information represents the baseline for the management of cockles, designing conservation strategies, founding broodstock for depleted beds and producing suitable seed for aquaculture production. © 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Establishing potential habitats of Mytilopsis sallei with Maxent niche model
VL  - 31

SP  - 1357-1364
AB  - Mytilopsis sallei, an invasive alien species, has strong reproductive ability and high adaptability. It can severely endanger biodiversity of intertidal ecosystem after invasion. The intertidal zones and oyster breeding areas in some coastal areas of Guangdong Province have been severely invaded by M. sallei. To examine the potential habitat of M. sallei in China, we established a potential habitat prediction model of M. sallei using Maxent and ArcGIS method for China and global scales. The model was verified by the method of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis and field investigation. The results showed that M. sallei could distribute with high probability in the area between North and South America, South India in Asia, Sri Lanka, the south coast of the Yangtze River in China, and in Van Dimen Bay of the southern hemisphere. In China, M. sallei mainly distributed in coastal provinces south of Shanghai. The main environmental factors affecting the suitable distribution areas for M. sallei were water vapor pressure, temperature, and solar radiation. After ROC detection, the AUC values of both the training and testing sets were 0.996, indicating that the prediction reached an excellent level. Our results provide theoretical basis for the risk assessment and management of M. sallei, and complement the potential habitat prediction of invasive species in China. © 2020, Science Press.

VL  - 18
IS  - 1
SP  - 31-38
AB  - Transgenic mosquitoes are being developed as novel components of area-wide approaches to vector-borne disease control. Best practice is to develop these in phases, beginning with laboratory studies, before moving to field testing and inclusion in control programs, to ensure safety and prevent costly field testing of unsuitable strains. The process of identifying and developing good candidate strains requires maintenance of transgenic colonies over many generations in containment facilities. By working in disease endemic countries with target vector populations, laboratory strains may be developed and selected for properties that will enhance intended control efficacy in the next phase, while avoiding traits that introduce unnecessary risks. Candidate strains aiming toward field use must consistently achieve established performance criteria, throughout the process of scaling up from small study colonies to production of sufficient numbers for field testing and possible open release. Maintenance of a consistent quality can be demonstrated by a set of insect quality and insectary operating indicators, measured over time at predetermined intervals. These indicators: inform comparability of studies using various candidate strains at different times and locations; provide evidence of conformity relevant to compliance with terms of approval for regulated use; and can be used to validate some assumptions related to risk assessments covering the contained phase and for release into the environment. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.

AB  - This study has been conducted in a pomegranate orchard in Tarsus, Mersin Province between 2008-2010 and 2012-2013. In this study, the sum of effective temperatures based on a degree-day (DD) model was determined to be successful for the scheduling control of honeydew moth [Cryptoblabes gnidiella (Mill.,1867) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae)]. For this purpose, phenological stages, sex pheromone traps, the sum of effective temperatures (ETS), egg hatching time and fruit control were used. ETS values based on the DD model were 80 DD for hanging time of sex pheromone traps, 250 DD for first generation for egg hatching period, 800 DD for the second generation, 1375 DD for the third generation, 1930 DD for the fourth generation, and 2500 DD for fifth generation. However, the first generation of C. gnidiella, which had lower population having come from overwintering places, and fifth generation, which emerged at after harvest, should be monitored regularly so that control applications will be more beneficial. © 2018 Entomological Society of Turkey.

VL  - 32

SP  - 3920-3929
AB  - Vegetation is a key to improving and protecting a new tropical coral island terrestrial ecosystem. Because of their superior ability in adapting poor soil structure and fertility, conserving soil and water and improving the living environment, warm-season turfgrass are considered as important pioneer plants and frequently applied in vegetation construction on tropical coral islands. However, few studies had evaluated the growth of these turfgrass and how these turfgrass influence the soil microbial communities on tropical coral islands. In this study, we conducted a greenhouse experiment and assessed the performance, soil properties and rhizosphere bacterial communities of five typical warm-season turfgrasses species (i.e., Paspalum vaginatium, Paspalum notatum, Cynodon dactylon, Zoysia tenuifolia, and Stenotaphrum helferi) grown on tropical coral sand. Results showed that C. dactylon was superior in the adaptability and turf performance among the studied species, with a turf establishment time of 34 days and a turf quality score of 6.83. Richness of bacterial species and nitrifying bacteria in its rhizosphere soil planted with C. dactylon were also much higher than with other species. The speed of turf establishment was positively correlated with rhizosphere soil bacterial species richness. Our findings indicated that C. dactylon could be a potentially suitable candidate species for vegetation restoration and soil bacterial community conservation on tropical coral islands. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Key message: Maize Outer cell layer 4 (ocl4) encodes an HD-ZIP IV transcription factor required for robust male fertility and 21-nt phasiRNA biogenesis. ocl4 fertility is favored in warm conditions, and phasiRNAs are partially restored. Abstract: Environment-sensitive male-sterile plants have been described before and can result from different molecular mechanisms and biological processes, but putative environment-conditioned, transgenerational rescue of their male fertility is a rather new mystery. Here, we report a derivative line of the male-sterile outer cell layer 4 (ocl4) mutant of maize, in which fertility was restored and perpetuated over several generations. Conditioned fertile ocl4 anthers exhibit the anatomical abnormality of a partially duplicated endothecial layer, just like their sterile counterparts. We profiled the dynamics of phased, small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) during pre-meiotic development in fully sterile and various grades of semi-fertile ocl4 anthers. The conditioned fertile anthers accumulated significantly higher 21-nt phasiRNAs compared to ocl4 sterile samples, suggesting a partial restoration of phasiRNAs in conditioned fertility. We found that the biogenesis of 21-nt phasiRNAs is largely dependent on Ocl4 at three key steps: (1) production of PHAS precursor transcripts, (2) expression of miR2118 that modulates precursor processing, and (3) accumulation of 21-nt phasiRNAs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Tryptamine intoxications and fatalities are increasing, although these novel psychoactive substances (NPS) are not controlled in most countries. There are few data on the metabolic pathways and enzymes involved in tryptamine biotransformation. 4-acetoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (4-AcO-DiPT) is a synthetic tryptamine related to 4-hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (4-OH-DiPT), 4-acetyloxy-N,N-dipropyltryptamine (4-AcO-DPT), and 4-acetoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (4-AcO-DMT). The aim of this study was to determine the best 4-AcO-DiPT metabolites to identify 4-AcO-DiPT consumption through human hepatocyte metabolism and high-resolution mass spectrometry. 4-AcO-DiPT metabolites were predicted in silico with GLORYx freeware to assist in metabolite identification. 4-AcO-DiPT was incubated with 10-donor-pooled human hepatocytes and sample analysis was performed with reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) in positive- and negative-ion modes. Software-assisted LC-HRMS/MS raw data mining was performed. A total of 47 phase I and II metabolites were predicted, and six metabolites were identified after 3 h incubation following ester hydrolysis, O-glucuronidation, O-sulfation, N-oxidation, and N-dealkylation. All second-generation metabolites were derived from the only first-generation metabolite detected after ester hydrolysis (4-OH-DiPT). The metabolite with the second-most-intense signal was 4-OH-iPT-sulfate followed by 4-OH-DiPT-glucuronide, indicating that glucuronidation and sulfation are common in this tryptamine’s metabolic pathway. 4-OH-DiPT, 4-OH-iPT, and 4-OH-DiPT-N-oxide are suggested as optimal biomarkers to identify 4-AcO-DiPT consumption. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Genome-wide identification of fatty acid synthesis genes, fatty acid profiles, and life parameters in two freshwater water flea Daphnia magna strains
VL  - 262
AB  - The freshwater water flea Daphnia magna is a planktonic animal belonging to the Cladocera. To evaluate differences between two D. magna strains (KIT and NIES) in terms of life parameters and fatty acid profiles, we examined several endpoints. In the D. magna KIT strain, the numbers of total and cumulative offspring were lower at 23 °C and higher at 14 °C than in the D. magna NIES strain. However, at 14 °C, the D. magna KIT strain showed an increased lifespan. Although the n-3/n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) ratio was always decreased at a low temperature, the PUFA ratio in the KIT strain had a higher value on day 3 than the NIES strain, which gave it higher adaptability to low temperature. In addition, we identified the elongation of very long chain fatty acids (elovl) and fatty acid desaturase (fad) genes, which are involved in fatty acid biosynthesis pathways, in the genomes of both D. magna KIT and NIES. The Elovl and Fad genes in both D. magna strains were highly conserved, including tandem duplicated Elovl 1/7 genes. This study provides new information about the molecular basis for the difference in temperature sensitivity between two strains of D. magna. © 2022

TI  - Research progress of biogas slurry resourceful treatment by membrane distillation
VL  - 37
IS  - 8
SP  - 259-268
AB  - Biogas slurry can account for more than 80% of the total mass of anaerobic digestates in biogas production. A large amount of biogas slurry has posed a great challenge on the carrying capacity of farmland and transportation cost. Particularly, returning to the farmland cannot completely consume such a great amount of incurred biogas slurry in a large-scale plant. The resourceful treatment is widely expected to reduce the volume of biogas slurry, and the potential threat to the agro-ecological environment for high value-added resource recovery in the sustainable development of the agricultural circular economy. For instance, membrane distillation serves as an important branch of membrane separation available for the resourceful treatment of biogas slurry in recent years. Excellent performance of membrane distillation has been achieved, including strong adaptability, rapid ammonia removal, as well as less membrane fouling and foaming. However, the high heat consumption and low flux have confined to the more efficient application of membrane distillation, compared with other technologies of membrane separation. In this study, a special process of membrane distillation was firstly introduced to systematically review the ammonia nitrogen and water recovery from biogas slurry. Water can normally be recovered from the acidified biogas slurry, while the nutrients were retained, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the concentration phase. The water recovery can also be promoted, because the acidified biogas slurry can be utilized to suppress the ammonia volatilization, while relieving the membrane fouling. Typical reverse and forward osmosis concentrated the biogas slurry up to about 5 times than before, meaning that about 20% concentrated biogas slurry was left. The thermal-driven membrane distillation can even be used for the resourceful treatment of concentrated biogas slurry after reverse osmosis, where little biogas slurry was left. Nevertheless, membrane distillation presented a relatively low water flux for water recovery, compared with the typical reverse osmosis. Conversely, ammonia can be recovered from the biogas slurry, and then serve as ammonium fertilizer or aqueous ammonia solution for CO2 absorption. Consequently, the resulting biogas slurry was more suitable for agricultural utilization after ammonia removal. To date, membrane distillation behaved the highest ammonia recovery ratio of about 99%, compared with the reverse and forward osmosis. Meanwhile, the membrane used for ammonia recovery was a benefit to control the greenhouse gas emission. In addition, the multi-stage and multi-effect membrane distillation was introduced to reduce heat consumption. The reason is that the huge heat consumption can inevitably result in the high operation cost for the treatment of biogas slurry in a single membrane distillation. The heat consumption for water recovery was reduced from 2 000-3 500 kW•h/m3 to 100-200 kW•h/m3. Finally, the feasibility of membrane distillation was briefly evaluated for the biogas slurry treatment in a large-scale plant. The treatment cost of biogas slurry can even be much lower than that of a typical pressure-derived membrane process, where the heat and power were used from the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) in a biogas plant. Membrane distillation can efficiently realize resource recovery of biogas slurry in a facile, cost-saving, and environment-friendly way. Specifically, the cost of membrane distillation for biogas slurry was basically consistent with that of reverse osmosis. Consequently, membrane distillation was suitable for the treatment of high organic load or high residual concentration of biogas slurry after reverse osmosis, without any supplement of external heat source in a biogas plant. © 2021, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

TI  - Spatial-temporal variations of benthic macroalgae and their responses to variations in the environment in the artificial reef zones of Laoshan Bay
VL  - 25
IS  - 3
SP  - 642-653
AB  - Benthic macroalgae are highly productive and increase biodiversity through the provision of a habitat for marine organisms and act as spawning, nursery, and feeding grounds for an extensive range of marine fauna. As a dominant habitat-former on temperate rocky coastlines, benthic macroalgae are important fundamental species in the temperate marine climate owing to their high productivity and extensive distribution. However, the loss of benthic macroalgal habitats has been widespread along the rocky coastlines owing to various perturbations, including climate change, species invasion, sedimentation increase, and anthropogenic stress. The establishment of artificial reefs have been proven an efficient approach for the recovery of the benthic macroalgae ecosystem. For the past three decades, the habitats of benthic macroalgae in Laoshan Bay of Qingdao have been destroyed by anthropogenic activities such as mariculture and fisheries. To mitigate the habitat losses of benthic macroalgae and restore the spawning grounds, artificial rocky reefs were deployed in two coastal areas, Huangshankou, which has high levels of wave motion and Sanmuqian, which has low levels of wave motion, between 2009 and 2010. After the deployment of artificial reefs, the marine habitats underwent a long-term and dynamic process prior to the formation of stable ecosystems. The inter-month variation and distributional pattern of benthic macroalgal communities were a reflection of the self-adaption of the ecosystem to the changing conditions. To study the community characteristics, inter-monthly variation, and response to the environmental factors of benthic macroalgae in the artificial reef zones, the horizontal and vertical distribution of the benthic macroalgae in two artificial reef zones were investigated between May and September 2015. Wave motion indexes between the two artificial reef zones showed extremely significant differences, whereas similar conditions were found among different wave depths in the same artificial reef zones. The temperature range between May and November showed significant variation, whereas no significant difference was found between artificial reef zones at same the time. A total of 26 species of 21 genera, belonging to three phyla were found; among these, 15 species belonged to Rhodophyta, 7 species belonged to Phaeophyta, and 4 species belonged to Chlorophyta, which accounted for 57.69%, 26.92%, and 15.38% of the total, respectively. The replacement of benthic macroalgal species in different months displayed significant differences: Desmarestia viridis, Chrysymenia wrightii, and Gracilaria textorii were the predominant species during spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. The species diversity indices of benthic macroalgae increased at first and decreased subsequently, whereas the indices in Sanmuqian reef zone were generally higher than those in Huangshankou Reef zone. Differences in the species diversity indices and the dominant species in different months were mainly caused by temperature variations and different temperature adaptability of macroalgal species. Redundancy analysis further proved that temperature was the key influential factor in the monthly replacement of benthic macroalgae and contributed to 37.64% of the variation, whereas wave motion and depth were the key influencing factors in the horizontal and vertical distribution of benthic macroalgae and accounted for 26.54% and 19.13% of the variation, respectively. The results indicated that the artificial reefs provided efficient substrates for benthic macroalgae in Laoshan Bay. The benthic macroalgal communities showed relative stable seasonal perturbation in the artificial reefs, which reach maturity and have the ability to withstand the external disturbances 5 years after deployment of the artificial reefs. © 2018 Journal of Fishery Sciences of China.

VL  - 48

SP  - 6673-6694
AB  - Background: Barley is one of the major cereal crops, which can provide a significant source of genes for stress tolerance due to its high diversity and adaptability. Metabolite traits are considered to be significant for adaptation of barley to heat stress. Methods and results: In the present study, genetic relationships between 120 barley genotypes were determined with 50 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 26 inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers under heat stress and non-stress conditions. Moreover, genetic diversity of barley accessions was investigated using the studied markers covering 7 chromosomes of barley. Results: In general, 153 and 85 polymorphic alleles were detected for SSR and ISSR and number of the observed polymorphic allele varied between 2–9 and 2–6, with an average of 3.26 and 3.26 alleles per locus, respectively. Markers of Bmag0223, GBMS180/180, HVM7, ISSR22, ISSR25, and ISSR48 were the most informative due to their high polymorphism information content value demonstrating that putative techniques utilized in this research can be powerful and valuable tools in breeding program of barley. Association analysis was performed between 9 important traits and SSR and ISSR markers using four statistical models. The results revealed that the model containing both population structure (Q) and general similarity in genetic background arising from shared kinship (K) factors reduced false positive associations between markers and phenotypes. Conclusions: According to the results, some of markers related to more than one trait under normal conditions (ISSR31-2, HVM62, and GBMS180/180) and heat stress conditions (ISSR20-5, EBmac635, HVM14, and ISSR37-3) were determined, which can be considered to be the most interesting candidates for further studies and simultaneously will provide a useful target for the future breeding programs, such as marker-assisted selection (MAS). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

VL  - 12
IS  - 8
AB  - Tuta absoluta is one of the most significant invasive pests affecting tomato plants world-wide. RT-qPCR has emerged as one of the most sensitive and accurate methods for detecting gene expression data. The screening of stable internal reference genes is the most critical step for studying the molecular mechanisms of environmental adaptability. The stable reference genes expressed in T. absoluta under specific experimental conditions have not yet been clarified. In this study, seven candidate reference genes (RPL27, RPS13, RPS15, EF1-α, TUB, TBP, and β-actin) and their optimal numbers were evaluated under biotic (developmental stages and adult tissues) and abiotic (insecticide, temperature, and plant VOC) conditions using four software programs. Our results identified the following reference genes and numbers as optimal: three genes (EF1-α, RPS13, and RPL27) for different developmental stages (egg, larva, pupa, unmated adult), two genes (RPS13 and TBP) for adult tissues (antenna, head, thorax, abdomen, leg), two genes (TBP and RPS13) for insecticides (Bacillus thuringiensis, chlorpyrifos, abamectin-aminomethyl, and chlorantraniliprole), two genes (RPL27 and TUB) for temperature-induced stresses (0, 25, and 40◦C), and two genes (RPS13 and TUB) for VOC-induced stresses (nonanal, α-phellandrene, and tomato leaves). Our results provide a reference for selecting appropriate reference genes for further study of the functional genes of T. absoluta under different experimental conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Environmental adaptability of fish eggs in Bohai Bay assessed using habitat suitability index method
VL  - 28
IS  - 12
SP  - 1568-1575
AB  - As a spawning ground for many fish species, Bohai Bay plays a significant role in maintaining sustainable inshore fish stocks in Bohai and the Yellow Sea. In recent decades, the loss or fragmentation of fish habitats has been taking place in Bohai Bay as a result of exogenous interference factors, such as human activity and climate change. An understanding of the distribution pattern of fish eggs is urgently needed to protect fish recruitment. However, a comprehensive insight into how fish eggs are distributed in Bohai Bay is still lacking. To better understand how environmental conditions affect the distribution of fish eggs in Bohai Bay, an integrated habitat suitability index (HSI) model, including three physical and chemical environmental variables, sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), and seawater pH, was developed in this study. Meanwhile, three empirical HSI algorithms (geometric mean method; minimum method; continued product method, CPM) were performed to select the best algorithm. The data used for analysis comes from independent trawl surveys, applying standardized sampling protocols from 2014 to 2018. The results showed that (1) the fish eggs in Bohai Bay were mainly distributed in areas where the ranges of SST, SSS, and pH are 21.6−24.8 ℃, 30.07−32.60, and 8.03−8.21, respectively. (2) The SI of each environmental variable varies by month. (3) CPM was the optimal HSI model for fish eggs in Bohai Bay based on the evaluation criteria of Akaike information criterion. (4) In May, the HSI model shows an acceptable performance. In June and July, there may be potential unconsidered factors that dominate the distribution of fish eggs under suitable SST, SSS, and pH conditions. This study enhances our understanding of the relationships between fish eggs and different environmental factors. Moreover, the models built can be used to detect potential spawning grounds for fish in Bohai Bay. These findings may increase awareness among researchers and policymakers. A more comprehensive survey and scientific site layout will be helpful to gain a deeper understanding in the future. © 2021 Journal of Fishery Sciences of China. All Rights Reserved.

TI  - Effects of interrow grass planting on soil quality characteristics in jujube orchard in the extremely arid areas of southern Xinjiang
VL  - 37
IS  - 8
SP  - 1184-1195
AB  - 【Objective】Jujube is one of the important fruits and has a long history of planting in China. The superior natural conditions with ample light and heat resources, rare precipitation, long duration of sunshine, long frost-free period, large diurnal temperature difference, few pests and diseases, no industrial pollution, and adequate soils are very suitable for the growth and development of jujube in southern Xinjiang. In the past decades, jujube has been introduced and cultivated in many northwest regions due to its excellent ecological adaptability, high production and popularity in domestic market. Jujube industry therefore plays an important role in rural economy, farmers' income and in eliminating poverty and achieving prosperity in the poverty areas in southern Xinjiang. In 2018, the planting area of jujube reached 4×105 hm2 with a production of 2.4 million tons. It has become an important pillar industry in local rural areas. It is well known that soil organic matters and nutrients are fundamental for sustainable orchard production. However, poor soil quality and water shortage are the adverse factors, and traditional orchard soil management with clear tillage has led to a series of ecological and environmental problems such as soil water decrease, soil property deterioration, surface roughness, soil erosion, pesticide use increase, environmental pollution, loss of biodiversity and weakening of system resistance in a long run, which leads to reduce agricultural productivity and decrease economic benefit, and restrict the sustainable development of horticulture industry. Currently, inter-row planting grass is a recommended soil management practice in orchards. It improves soil physical and chemical properties, reduces soil water evaporation, increases soil organic matter content, maintains soil nutrient balance, ameliorates orchard ecological environment, and effectively solves the potential negative effect due to long-term clean tillage in orchard. However, there has been limited investigation on the influence of artificially planted grass on soil quality in extremely arid areas of southern Xinjiang. In order to provide theoretical and practical basis for orchard soil-water management technique, the effects of inter-row planting white clover (Trifolium repens), bluegrass (Poa annua) and clear tillage on soil physical-chemical properties in a jujube orchard were studied in the extreme arid area.【Methods】The experiment was conducted in a jujube orchard with three treatments: inter-row planting white clover (Trifolium repens) or bluegrass (Poa annua), and the clean tillage (CK). The grasses were planted in the spring of 2016. The average sowing volume was 15-22.5 kg •hm-2, with mowing twice a year. In the third year after successive grass planting, soil samples were taken at different layers from 0 to 60 cm using the five-point method from March to September 2018. We tried to minimize the disturbance of soil samples during the collection and transport processes. The soil physical-chemical properties including soil bulk density, porosity, water-holding capacity and nutrient content were measured.【Results】Interrow grass planting could reduce soil bulk density, increase soil water content and porosity, change soil particle composition and significantly improve the physical structure of soil, especially in 40 cm soil layer. Interrow grass planting enhanced the water-holding capacity of soil, and reduced the optimal lower limit of water content and irrigation quota. The soil water holding capacity, available water content and water retention function were improved significantly. The maximum capacity, capillary capacity, field capacity and soil saturated water content, soil absorbed water content, soil retained water content in grass treatment within 60 cm were increased by 4.02%, 3.54%, 3.49% and 8.42 mm, 0.96 mm, 9.42 mm compared to CK, respectively, and the optimal lower limit of water content and irrigation quota decreased by 2.37 mm, 3.84 mm, respectively. Interrow grass planting enhanced soil infiltration capacity. The irrigation water could rapidly infiltrate into soil, reduce runoff and improve the utilization of soil water. The soil initial permeability rate, steady permeability rate, average permeability rate and permeability coefficient in grass treatments within 60 cm were increased by 0.73 mm• min-1, 0.29 mm• min-1, 0.32 mm• min-1, and 0.10 mm• min-1 compared to CK, respectively. Interrow grass planting improved the soil quality. The soil organic matter and available N, P, K content were increased by 4.10 g•kg-1, 18.48 mg•kg-1, 49.58 mg•kg-1, 61.12 mg•kg-1 compared to CK, respectively. White clover was better than bluegrass in improving soil quality. 【Conclusion】Interrow grass planting can significantly improve soil physical-chemical properties, and improve soil quality. The effect of planting clover was much better in orchard, southern Xinjiang. © 2020, Office of Journal of Fruit Science. All right reserved.

AB  - Morpho-functional changes in reproductive organs of bulls due to the influence of continental climate with cold winters and hot summers can repress reproductive function (I.M. Donnik et al., 2005). It requires a deep knowledge of immunobiological, hormonal and biochemical mechanisms regulating the reproductive function in animals, with regard to their adaptability to various environmental and farming conditions (I.M. Donnik et al., 2015). Here, we compared for the first time the autoimmune state of domestic- and foreign-bred Holstein bull sires aged 3 to 9 years (n = 101) which were housed in two ecologically different regions, the Moscow Province (Head Center for Reproduction of Farm Animals) and the Sverdlov Province (Uralplemcenter, Regional Information and Selection Center). Autoimmunity detected by sperm immobilization test was unidentified in 69 % and 83 % of bull sires from the Sverdlov Region and the Moscow Province, respectively. The percentages of bulls with a high titer (> 1:8) of sperm immobilization comprised 3 % and 8 % in the Sverdlov Region and the Moscow Region, respectively. At the titers of approximately 1:4, the autoimmune anti-sperm state of the animals was reversible and easily restored following recommended technologies during two cycles of spermatogenesis. A comparatively high titer was recorded during more intense exploitation of bulls. The Holstein bulls of different origin also differed in susceptibility to developing the autoimmune anti-sperm response. The sires of the Canadian selection were more susceptible, while the lowest-level autoimmunity was characteristic of the Holland bulls. Endogenous hormone levels correlated with the autoimmunity: in case of the titer elevation, the endogenous hormone concentrations decreased, but unequally, i.e. by 38 % and 46 % for testosterone and estradiol, respectively. The variations in correlation between testosterone and estradiol could reach 49 %. The percentage of animals with the titers of 1:4 to 1:8 was higher among the young bull sires aged 28 months, while the anti-sperm antibodies were not revealed or autoimmunity was weakly expressed in the mature bulls aged 35 months, with the titers of 0 to 1:2. Therefore, the young bulls at the start of their intensive use are more susceptible to various impacts as compared to the pubertal sires. © 2018 Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

TI  - Simulation of the potential distribution of the glacier based on maximum entropy model in the tianshan mountains, china
VL  - 13
IS  - 11
AB  - Under the background of global climate change, the variation in the spatial distribution and ice volume of mountain glaciers have a profound influence on regional economic development and ecological security. The development of glaciers is like biological succession; when climate change approaches or exceeds the threshold of suitable conditions for glacier development, it will lead to changes in potential distribution pattern. Therefore, from the perspective of the “biological” characteristics of glaciers, it is a beneficial exploration and attempt in the field of glaciology to explore its potential distribution law with the help of the niche model. The maximum entropy model (Max-Ent) can explain the environmental conditions suitable for the survival of things by analyzing the mathematical characteristics and distribution laws of samples in space. According to glacier samples and the geographical environment data screened by correlation analysis and iterative calculation, the potential distribution pattern of Tianshan glaciers in China in reference years (1970–2000) was simulated by MaxEnt. This paper describes the contribution of geographical environmental factors to distribution of glaciers in Tianshan Mountains, quantifies the threshold range of factors affecting the suitable habitat of glaciers, and predicts the area variation and distribution pattern of glaciers under different climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP5-8.5) in the future (2040–2060, 2080–2100). The results show that the MaxEnt model has good adaptability to simulate the distribution of glaciers. The spatial heterogeneity of potential distribution of glaciers is caused by the spatio-temporal differences of hydrothermal combination and topographic conditions. Among the environmental variables, precipitation during the wettest month, altitude, annual mean temperature, and temperature seasonality have more significant effects on the potential distribution of glaciers. There is significant spatial heterogeneity in the potential distribution of glaciers in different watersheds, altitudes, and aspects. From the forecast results of glacier in various climatic scenarios in the future, about 18.16–27.62% of the total reference year glacier area are in an alternating change of melting and accumulation, among which few glaciers are increasing, but this has not changed the overall retreat trend of glaciers in the study area. Under the low emission scenario, the glacier area of the Tianshan Mountains in China decreased by 18.18% and 23.73% respectively in the middle and end of the 21st century compared with the reference years and decreased by 20.04% and 27.63%, respectively, under the high emission scenario, which showed that the extent of glacier retreat is more intense under the high emission scenario. Our study offers momentous theoretical value and practical significance for enriching and expanding the theories and analytical methods of the glacier change. © 2021 by the authors.

TI  - Design and Experiment of Disc Ejection Type Paddy Field Side Deep Fertilization Device
VL  - 52
IS  - 6

AB  - In order to ensure the operation efficiency of lateral deep fertilization in paddy field and improve the fertilization uniformity of lateral deep fertilization device, combined with the agronomic requirements of lateral deep fertilization of rice in cold region, a disc ejection type lateral deep fertilization device was designed, its working principle was expounded, and the key components, disc ejection type fertilizer discharger and air delivery system, were analyzed. Kinematics model of fertilizer discharging process was established, and the rotating speed of fertilizer discharge disc was an important factor affecting fertilization performance. The best work of fertilizer discharging disc was 10~60 r/min by EDEM virtual simulation test. The fertilization performance experiment of lateral deep fertilization device was carried out. The results showed that the consistency of discharge amount and stability of fertilization met the national operation standard of fertilization machinery. Taking the effective working length of fertilizer tank as a factor, the average value of fertilization amount, coefficient of variation of fertilization uniformity and total fertilization amount as indicators, the single factor experiment was carried out. The results showed that when the density of fertilizer was 1.15 g/cm3 and the effective working length of fertilizer tank was adjusted between 5 mm and 20 mm, the total fertilization amount was varied from 137 kg/hm2 to 921 kg/hm2, and the coefficient of variation of fertilization uniformity of lateral deep fertilization device was ranged from 5.96% to 12.77%. Compared with the straight-grooved wheel type and the inclined-grooved wheel type side-deep fertilization device, it was concluded that the disc ejection type side-deep fertilization device effectively improved the uniformity of fertilization, and there was no fertilizer crushing phenomenon in long-term operation under the premise of meeting the requirements of fertilization amount. Four special fertilizers with different densities were selected to verify the fertilizer adjustment performance of the fertilizer application device. The experimental results showed that the designed device had good adaptability to commonly used special fertilizers, and the obtained curves of effective working length of fertilizer tank and total fertilizer application with density of 0.85~1.40 g/cm3 can be directly applied to field operations, which had important reference value for debugging and application of machines and tools and actual production operations. © 2021, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

TI  - Integration of artificial intelligence methods and life cycle assessment to predict energy output and environmental impacts of paddy production
VL  - 631
SP  - 1279-1294
AB  - Prediction of agricultural energy output and environmental impacts play important role in energy management and conservation of environment as it can help us to evaluate agricultural energy efficiency, conduct crops production system commissioning, and detect and diagnose faults of crop production system. Agricultural energy output and environmental impacts can be readily predicted by artificial intelligence (AI), owing to the ease of use and adaptability to seek optimal solutions in a rapid manner as well as the use of historical data to predict future agricultural energy use pattern under constraints. This paper conducts energy output and environmental impact prediction of paddy production in Guilan province, Iran based on two AI methods, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The amounts of energy input and output are 51,585.61 MJ kg−1 and 66,112.94 MJ kg−1, respectively, in paddy production. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate environmental impacts of paddy production. Results show that, in paddy production, in-farm emission is a hotspot in global warming, acidification and eutrophication impact categories. ANN model with 12-6-8-1 structure is selected as the best one for predicting energy output. The correlation coefficient (R) varies from 0.524 to 0.999 in training for energy input and environmental impacts in ANN models. ANFIS model is developed based on a hybrid learning algorithm, with R for predicting output energy being 0.860 and, for environmental impacts, varying from 0.944 to 0.997. Results indicate that the multi-level ANFIS is a useful tool to managers for large-scale planning in forecasting energy output and environmental indices of agricultural production systems owing to its higher speed of computation processes compared to ANN model, despite ANN's higher accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 266
AB  - Elevation of temperature and CO2 levels within the world's aquatic environments is expected to cause numerous physiological challenges to their inhabitants. While effects on marine ecosystems have been well studied, freshwater ecosystems have rarely been examined using a dual-stressor approach leaving our understanding of its inhabitants upon these challenges unclear. We aimed to identify the affects of elevated temperature and hypercapnia in isolation and in combination on the metabolic and acid-base regulatory processes of a freshwater crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. Crayfish were exposed to freshwater conditions that may be prevalent by the year 2100 and metabolic responses were determined after 14-days of exposure. In addition, changes in branchial mRNA expression of acid-base linked transporters were investigated. Interactions between exposure conditions influenced extracellular pH as well as the nitrogen physiology and routine metabolic rate of the crayfish. Crayfish exposed to individual and combined elevations in temperature and/or hypercapnia maintained an extracellular pH similar to that of control crayfish. Dual-stressor exposed crayfish seem to elevate the importance of ammonium as an excretable acid-equivalent based on an overall increase in the branchial mRNA expression of transporters related to ammonia excretion including the Na+/K+-ATPase, Rhesus-protein, and the V-type H+-ATPase. Overall, hypercapnia and dual-stressor conditions caused a metabolic depression that may have long-lasting consequences such as limited locomotion, growth, and reproduction. Future generations of crayfish given the chance to adapt over several generations may ameliorate these consequences. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

VL  - 11
IS  - 3
SP  - 1-18
AB  - Insects represent a valuable and sustainable alternative ingredient for aquafeed formulation. However, insect-based diets have often highlighted controversial results in different fish species, especially when high inclusion levels were used. Several studies have demonstrated that nutritional programming through parental feeding may allow the production of fish better adapted to use sub-optimal aquafeed ingredients. To date, this approach has never been explored on insect-based diets. In the present study, five experimental diets characterized by increasing fish meal substitution levels with full-fat Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens; BSF) prepupae meal (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) were used to investigate the effects of programming via broodstock nutrition on F1 zebrafish larvae development. The responses of offspring were assayed through biometric, gas chromatographic, histological, and molecular analyses. The results evidenced that the same BSF-based diets provided to adults were able to affect F1 zebrafish larvae fatty acid composition without impairing growth performances, hepatic lipid accumulation and gut health. Groups challenged with higher BSF inclusion with respect to fish meal (50%, 75% and 100%) showed a significant downregulation of stress response markers and a positive modulation of inflammatory cytokines gene expression. The present study evidences that nutritional programming through parental feeding may make it possible to extend the fish meal substitution level with BSF prepupae meal in the diet up to almost 100% without incurring the well-known negative side effects of BSF-based diets. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The effects of temperature and absence of a host plant on the population dynamics of the sheath nematode, Hemicycliophora conida, were studied under glasshouse conditions. Regarding temperature, population dynamics of H. conida on tomato 'Moneymaker' were monitored weekly over a period of 12 weeks. In the first experiment, with an average temperature of 21.4 degrees C. population growth of H. conida continuously increased over time from an initial density of 106 nematodes (100 ml soil)(-1) to a final density of 820 nematodes (100 ml soil)(-1), resulting in a reproduction rate of 7.7. The time required to complete one generation was 6.5 weeks or 598 temperature degree days at 8 degrees C base temperature (TDD8). A second experiment showed that the development of IL conida on tomato was faster at 22.1 degrees C than at 19.0 degrees C. At 22.1 degrees C, one generation was completed after 6 weeks (= 588 TDD8) compared to 8 weeks (=634 TDD8) at 19.0 degrees C. The higher temperature also resulted in a higher reproduction rate (93 at 22.1 degrees C vs 7.8 at 19.0 degrees C). In the absence of a host plant, the population density of H. conida decreased over time. However, this natural decline was less pronounced than for the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla. In the first experiment, the population density of H. conida decreased within 18 weeks by 89.5%, while M. hapla was already no longer detectable 12 weeks after inoculation. In the second experiment. H. conida decreased by 98.2% within 16 weeks compared to 99.98% for M. hapla.

TI  - Modern state of the population of the european anchovy engraulis encrasicolus (L.) (Pisces: Engraulidae) wintering off the coast of the eastern Crimea and the North Caucasus
VL  - 4
IS  - 3
SP  - 56-68
AB  - European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus L.) is one of the most abundant fish species in the Sea of Azov - Black Sea basin. Anchovy is the main commercial species in the region. In recent decades the share of anchovy catch has reached 80-85 %. The species is represented by two forms - Black Sea anchovy and Sea of Azov anchovy. One of the most important aims of modern research is to assess the state of anchovy population and to forecast its possible changes under the influence of various natural and anthropogenic factors. The results of studying the long-term (2010/11-2017/18) dynamics of the length-age structure and the intraspecific composition of anchovy wintering off the coast of the Eastern Crimea and the North Caucasus are presented. Totally 138 fish samples from trawl catches of fishing vessels were studied. Standard length of 44 202 specimens was measured with accuracy of 0.1 cm. The age of 1162 specimens was determined. Length-age key was compiled. The intraspecific identification of European anchovy was determined using otolith index (method of Skazkina). As indicators of the length-age structure, the average length and average age, distribution (number ratio of representatives of different length groups and age classes) were studied. Positive trends of the average length and the average age of anchovy were found, reflecting an increase of the proportion of large (> 9.5 cm) individuals in the population - three yearlings (2+) and four yearlings (3+). In the long-term plan the average length of the anchovy increased from 8.06 to 9.09 cm. At the same time the relative number of small (< 7.5 cm) individuals decreased almost 4 times (from 22.5 to 5.7 %), and the share of large individuals increased almost 6 times (from 5.7 to 33 %). The average age increased from 1.64 to 1.98 year. On the one hand, it was due to a nearly 3-fold reduction (from 7.1 to 2.6 %) in the relative number of young-of-the-year individuals (0+) and 1.5-fold reduction (from 72.6 to 47.7 %) of yearlings (1+). On the other hand, it was due to 2.4- and 4.3-fold increase in the relative number of three yearlings (2+) and four yearlings (3+), respectively. The appearance of abundant year class in 2013, 2014 and 2015 was the immediate reason of these changes. The intraspecific determination of the anchovy was found, Sea of Azov and Black Sea forms were identified. In the long-term plan their quantitative redistribution was shown. So, in 2010/11-2013/14 Sea of Azov form dominated in mixed wintering aggregations. Its average share was 58.5 %, with the share varying from 55 to 63 %. Average share of Black Sea form did not exceed 41.5 %, with the share varying from 37 to 45 %. However, in 2014/15 the number ratio of Sea of Azov and Black Sea forms changed to the opposite - with Black Sea anchovy dominating. Its share increased to 53 %, and in subsequent years ranged from 52 to 63 %, with average value of 56 %. The results obtained are in full accordance with the hypothesis of intraspecific structure reorganization of anchovy because of the change in climatic conditions (general regional warming). Earlier we suggested this hypothesis based on the results of research of long-term (1999-2010) structure dynamics of anchovy wintering off the western coast of Crimea. According to this hypothesis, in 1999-2004 Sea of Azov anchovy dominated in wintering aggregations with average share 66.7 % of the total number, with the share varying from 56 to 87 % in different years. The average share of Black Sea anchovy in that period did not exceed 33.3 %, with the share varying from 13 to 44 % in different years. In 2005 the ratio of two forms changed to the opposite. Black Sea anchovy dominated. In 2005-2010 its share was 76.7 % on average, varying in different years from 57 to 88 %. Apparently, the reorganization of the anchovy intraspecific structure should be considered as ecological adaptation of this species, ensuring more perfect adaptability to changing environmental conditions, in particular, to the water temperature. Sea of Azov anchovy and Black Sea anchovy are “temperature races”. Sea of Azov anchovy is resistant to lower reproductive temperature, Black Sea anchovy - to higher one. From the standpoint of the occurred changes in the length-age structure, the current state of anchovy population can be considered as quite good. However, taking into account the sharp decline of relative number of young-of-the-year individuals (0+) in 2016 and 2017, significant rejuvenescence of the population, and consequently anchovy length decrease should be expected in the nearest future. © 2019 Kovalevsky Institute of Marine Biological Research, RAS.

TI  - Biodegradation of endocrine disruptor Bisphenol A by Pseudomonas putida strain YC-AE1 isolated from polluted soil, Guangdong, China
VL  - 20
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Bisphenol A is an important organic chemical as an intermediate, final and inert ingredient in manufacturing of many important products like polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resins, flame retardants, food-drink packaging coating, and other. BPA is an endocrine disruptor compound that mimics the function of estrogen causing damage to reproductive organs. Bacterial degradation has been consider as a cost effective and eco-friendly method for BPA degradation compared with physical and chemical methods. This study aimed to isolate and identify bacterial strain capable to degrade and tolerate high concentrations of this pollutant, studying the factors affecting the degradation process and study the degradation mechanism of this strain. Results: YC-AE1 is a Gram negative bacterial strain isolated from soil and identified as Pseudomonas putida by 16S rRNA gene sequence and BIOLOG identification system. This strain found to have a high capacity to degrade the endocrine disruptor Bisphenol A (BPA). Response surface methodology using central composite design was used to statistically optimize the environmental factors during BPA degradation and the results obtained by significant model were 7.2, 30 °C and 2.5% for optimum initial pH, temperature and inoculum size, respectively. Prolonged incubation period with low NaCl concentration improve the biodegradation of BPA. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed high coefficient of determination, R 2 and Adj-R 2 which were 0.9979 and 0.9935, respectively. Substrate analysis found that, strain YC-AE1 could degrade a wide variety of bisphenol A-related pollutants such as bisphenol B, bisphenol F, bisphenol S, Dibutyl phthalate, Diethylhexyl phthalate and Diethyl phthalate in varying proportion. Pseudomonas putida YC-AE1 showed high ability to degrade a wide range of BPA concentrations (0.5-1000 mg l-1) with completely degradation for 500 mg l-1 within 72 h. Metabolic intermediates detected in this study by HPLC-MS were identified as 4,4-dihydroxy-alpha-methylstilbene, p-hydroxybenzaldeyde, p-hydroxyacetophenone, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, 4-hydroxyphenacyl alcohol, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol, 1,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol and 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) propanoate. Conclusions: This study reports Pseudomonas putida YC-AE1 as BPA biodegrader with high performance in degradation and tolerance to high BPA concentration. It exhibited strong degradation capacity and prominent adaptability towards a wide range of environmental conditions. Moreover, it degrades BPA in a short time via two different degradation pathways. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Experimental evolution can be a useful tool for testing the impact of environmental factors on adaptive changes in populations, and this approach is being increasingly used to understand the potential for evolutionary responses in populations under changing climates. However, selective factors will often be more complex in natural populations than in laboratory environments and produce different patterns of adaptive differentiation. Here we test the ability of laboratory experimental evolution under different temperature cycles to reproduce well-known patterns of clinal variation in Drosophila melanogaster. Six fluctuating thermal regimes mimicking the natural temperature conditions along the east coast of Australia were initiated. Contrary to expectations, on the basis of field patterns there was no evidence for adaptation to thermal regimes as reflected by changes in cold and heat resistance after 1-3 years of laboratory natural selection. While laboratory evolution led to changes in starvation resistance, development time, and body size, patterns were not consistent with those seen in natural populations. These findings highlight the complexity of factors affecting trait evolution in natural populations and indicate that caution is required when inferring likely evolutionary responses from the outcome of experimental evolution studies. © 2015 by The University of Chicago.

AB  - The ability to respond evolutionarily to increasing temperatures is important for survival of ectotherms in a changing climate. Recent studies suggest that upper thermal limits may be evolutionary constrained. We address this hypothesis in a laboratory evolution experiment, encompassing ecologically relevant thermal regimes. To examine the potential for species to respond to climate change, we exposed replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster to increasing temperatures (0.3 °C every generation) for 20 generations, whereas corresponding replicate control populations were held at benign thermal conditions throughout the experiment. We hypothesized that replicate populations exposed to increasing temperatures would show increased resistance to warm and dry environments compared with replicate control populations. Contrasting replicate populations held at the two thermal regimes showed (i) an increase in desiccation resistance and a decline in heat knock-down resistance in replicate populations exposed to increasing temperatures, (ii) similar egg-to-adult viability and fecundity in replicate populations from the two thermal regimes, when assessed at high stressful temperatures and (iii) no difference in nucleotide diversity between thermal regimes. The limited scope for adaptive evolutionary responses shown in this study highlights the challenges faced by ectotherms under climate change. © 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

VL  - 43

AB  - There are an increasing number of studies documenting effects of global warming on the distribution and ecology of a wide variety of organisms. However, much less is known about evolutionary responses in species to increasing temperature. As a result, thermal microevolution is often ignored when making predictions about the impact of global warming on the distribution of organisms and the composition of communities. We investigated the ability of 2 large-bodied Daphnia species, D. magna and D. pulex, to genetically respond to increased temperature under semi-natural conditions. Daphnia populations were exposed for 6 mo to different temperature treatments in large outdoor mesocosms that simulated small pond systems. The selection experiment was followed by a common garden experiment in which we quantified thermal microevolution in important life history traits. Intrinsic growth rate did not respond to thermal selection. Instead, we observed an effect of selection temperature on size at maturity, indicating that Daphnia may genetically adapt to increased temperature within one growing season. In a previous laboratory study on thermal microevolution using single-species cultures of D. magna, we documented the opposite pattern with thermal microevolution in intrinsic growth rate but not in size at maturity. These observations suggest that the ecological context (semi-natural conditions compared to single species cultures) is very important in determining with which traits species adapt to global warming. © Inter-Research 2010.

VL  - 216

SP  - 4542-4548
AB  - Temperature is a key environmental factor affecting almost all aspects of life history in ectotherms. Theory predicts that they grow faster, reach smaller sizes and produce smaller offspring when temperature increases. In addition, temperature changes, through their effects on metabolism, may also influence the expression of alternative reproductive phenotypes (ARPs) in ectotherms. Although many studies have investigated the phenotypic plasticity of life history traits in relation to temperature change, little is known about how those traits and phenotypic plasticity may evolve together. In our study we subjected bulb mites (non-model, soil organisms that normally experience rather stable thermal conditions) to experimental evolution in two temperature treatments: control (24°C) and elevated (28°C). After 18 generations, we measured adult body size, egg size and development time of both treatments at control as well as at elevated temperatures (test temperatures). Thus, we were able to detect genetic changes (the effects of selection temperature) and environmental effects (the effects of test temperature). We also observed the ARP expression throughout the experimental evolution. Our results revealed quite complex patterns of life history in traits response to temperature. Mites developed faster and reached smaller sizes at increased temperature, but evolutionary responses to increased temperature were not always parallel to the observed phenotypic plasticity. Additionally, despite smaller body sizes, females laid larger eggs at higher temperature. This effect was more pronounced in animals evolving at elevated temperature. Evolution at increased temperature also affected ARP expression, with the proportion of armored fighters decreasing from generation to generation. We propose that this could be the consequence of temperature sensitivity of the cost-to-benefits ratio of expressing ARPs. © 2013. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - Rapid evolutionary adaptation has the potential to rescue from extinction populations experiencing environmental changes. Little is known, however, about the impact of short-term environmental fluctuations during long-term environmental deterioration, an intrinsic property of realistic environmental changes. Temporary environmental amelioration arising from such fluctuations could either facilitate evolutionary rescue by allowing population recovery (a positive demographic effect) or impede it by relaxing selection for beneficial mutations required for future survival (a negative population genetic effect). We address this uncertainty in an experiment with populations of a bacteriophage virus that evolved under deteriorating conditions (gradually increasing temperature). Periodic environmental amelioration (short periods of reduced temperature) caused demographic recovery during the early phase of the experiment, but ultimately reduced the frequency of evolutionary rescue. These experimental results suggest that environmental fluctuations could reduce the potential of evolutionary rescue. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.

VL  - 7

AB  - We integrated the evidence for evolutionary and plastic trait changes in situ in response to climate change in freshwater invertebrates (aquatic insects and zooplankton). The synthesis on the trait changes in response to the expected reductions in hydroperiod and increases in salinity indicated little evidence for adaptive, plastic, and genetic trait changes and for local adaptation. With respect to responses to temperature, there are many studies on temporal trait changes in phenology and body size in the wild that are believed to be driven by temperature increases, but there is a general lack of rigorous demonstration whether these trait changes are genetically based, adaptive, and causally driven by climate change. Current proof for genetic trait changes under climate change in freshwater invertebrates stems from a limited set of common garden experiments replicated in time. Experimental thermal evolution experiments and common garden warming experiments associated with space-for-time substitutions along latitudinal gradients indicate that besides genetic changes, also phenotypic plasticity and evolution of plasticity are likely to contribute to the observed phenotypic changes under climate change in aquatic invertebrates. Apart from plastic and genetic thermal adjustments, also genetic photoperiod adjustments are widespread and may even dominate the observed phenological shifts. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - φX174 was developed as a model system for experimental studies of evolution because of its small genome size and ease of cultivation. It has been used extensively to address statistical questions about the dynamics of adaptive evolution. Molecular changes seen during experimental evolution of φX174 under a variety of conditions were compiled from 10 experiments comprising 58 lineages, where whole genomes were sequenced. A total of 667 substitutions was seen. Parallel evolution was rampant, with over 50 per cent of substitutions occurring at sites with three or more events. Comparisons of experimentally evolved sites to variation seen among wild phage suggest that at least some of the adaptive mechanisms seen in the laboratory are relevant to adaptation in nature. Elucidation of these mechanisms is aided by the availability of capsid and pro-capsid structures for φX174 and builds on years of genetic studies of the phage life history.

AB  - Natural selection alters the distribution of a trait in a population and indirectly alters the distribution of genetically correlated traits. Long-standing models of thermal adaptation assume that trade-offs exist between fitness at different temperatures; however, experimental evolution often fails to reveal such trade-offs. Here, we show that adaptation to benign temperatures in experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster resulted in correlated responses at the boundaries of the thermal niche. Specifically, adaptation to fluctuating temperatures (16-25°C) decreased tolerance of extreme heat. Surprisingly, flies adapted to a constant temperature of 25°C had greater cold tolerance than did flies adapted to other thermal conditions, including a constant temperature of 16°C. As our populations were never exposed to extreme temperatures during selection, divergence of thermal tolerance likely reflects indirect selection of standing genetic variation via linkage or pleiotropy. We found no relationship between heat and cold tolerances in these populations. Our results show that the thermal niche evolves by direct and indirect selection, in ways that are more complicated than assumed by theoretical models. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - The changes in species' geographical distribution demanded by climate change are often critically limited by the availability of key interacting species. In such cases, species' persistence will depend on the rapid evolution of biotic interactions. Understanding evolutionary limits to such adaptation is therefore crucial for predicting biological responses to environmental change. The recent poleward range expansion of the UK brown argus butterfly has been associated with a shift in female preference from its main host plant, rockrose (Cistaceae), onto Geraniaceae host plants throughout its new distribution. Using reciprocal transplants onto natural host plants across the UK range, we demonstrate reduced fitness of females from recently colonised Geraniaceae-dominated habitat when moved to ancestral rockrose habitats. By contrast, individuals from ancestral rockrose habitats show no reduction in fitness on Geraniaceae. Climate-driven range expansion in this species is therefore associated with the rapid evolution of biotic interactions and a significant loss of adaptive variation. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.

AB  - Many organisms can acclimate to new environments through phenotypic plasticity, a complex trait that can be heritable, subject to selection, and evolve. However, the rate and genetic basis of plasticity evolution remain largely unknown. We experimentally evolved outbred populations of the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei under an acute heat shock during early larval development. When raised in a nonstressful environment, ancestral populations were highly sensitive to a 36.8° heat shock and exhibited high mortality. However, initial exposure to a nonlethal high temperature environment resulted in significantly reduced mortality during heat shock (hormesis). Lines selected for heat shock resistance rapidly evolved the capacity to withstand heat shock in the native environment without any initial exposure to high temperatures, and early exposure to high temperatures did not lead to further increases in heat resistance. This loss of plasticity would appear to have resulted from the genetic assimilation of the heat induction response in the noninducing environment. However, analyses of transcriptional variation via RNA-sequencing from the selected populations revealed no global changes in gene regulation correlated with the observed changes in heat stress resistance. Instead, assays of the phenotypic response across a broader range of temperatures revealed that the induced plasticity was not fixed across environments, but rather the threshold for the response was shifted to higher temperatures over evolutionary time. These results demonstrate that apparent genetic assimilation can result from shifting thresholds of induction across environments and that analysis of the broader environmental context is critically important for understanding the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. © 2014 Sikkink et al.

AB  - Anthropogenic perturbations almost inevitably alter the selective pressures acting on organisms, either directly through artificial selection, or indirectly by changing natural selection. Impacted populations must respond to these anthropogenic selective pressures by evolving life histories that are more fit to the newly selected, composite adaptive landscape that results from the combination of anthropogenic and natural selection. This response is the subject of the present article. First, basic theory of selection and response to selection is recalled, then a specific focus on three major sources of anthropogenic selection (harvesting, habitat fragmentation and temperature increase) is provided, and finally how improving our predictions of human-induced evolution will require accounting for interactions between rapid evolution and ecological change, the so-called eco-evolutionary feedback loop, is examined. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - It remains to be determined experimentally whether increasing fitness is related to positive selection, while stationary fitness is related to neutral evolution. Long-term laboratory evolution in Escherichia coli was performed under conditions of thermal stress under defined laboratory conditions. The complete cell growth data showed common continuous fitness recovery to every 2°C or 4°C stepwise temperature upshift, finally resulting in an evolved E. coli strain with an improved upper temperature limit as high as 45.9°C after 523 days of serial transfer, equivalent to 7,560 generations, in minimal medium. Two-phase fitness dynamics, a rapid growth recovery phase followed by a gradual increasing growth phase, was clearly observed at diverse temperatures throughout the entire evolutionary process. Whole-genome sequence analysis revealed the transition from positive to neutral in mutation fixation, accompanied with a considerable escalation of spontaneous substitution rate in the late fitness recovery phase. It suggested that continually increasing fitness not always resulted in the reduction of genetic diversity due to the sequential takeovers by fit mutants, but caused the accumulation of a considerable number of mutations that facilitated the neutral evolution. © 2010 Kishimoto et al.

AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts an average global temperature increase of 1.8-4.0 °C by 2100. Tropical ectotherms are expected to be particularly sensitive to this temperature increase because they live close to their thermal limits. We investigated the phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary response of sperm traits in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) to increased temperatures after 6, 18, and 24 months. Guppies with evolution temperatures of 25 °C (control) or 28 °C were reared in either 25 or 28 °C in a 2 × 2 common garden design. The plastic response to increased temperature was a decreased sperm length, velocity, and path linearity. The evolutionary response was a subsequent increase in sperm length, resulting in complete compensation after just 6 months (at most four generations) in 28 °C water. Sperm velocity and linearity showed no sign of evolution even after 24 months. This study provides evidence that some reproductive traits can respond via rapid evolution to the temperature increase associated with climate change. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - How will organisms respond to climate change? The rapid changes in global climate are expected to impose strong directional selection on fitness-related traits. A major open question then is the potential for adaptive evolutionary change under these shifting climates. At the most basic level, evolutionary change requires the presence of heritable variation and natural selection. Because organismal tolerances of high temperature place an upper bound on responding to temperature change, there has been a surge of research effort on the evolutionary potential of upper thermal tolerance traits. Here, I review the available evidence on heritable variation in upper thermal tolerance traits, adopting a biogeographic perspective to understand how heritability of tolerance varies across space. Specifically, I use meta-analytical models to explore the relationship between upper thermal tolerance heritability and environmental variability in temperature. I also explore how variation in the methods used to obtain these thermal tolerance heritabilities influences the estimation of heritable variation in tolerance. I conclude by discussing the implications of a positive relationship between thermal tolerance heritability and environmental variability in temperature and how this might influence responses to future changes in climate. © 2016 New York Academy of Sciences.

VL  - 20

SP  - 943-955
AB  - Distinctive survival strategies, specialized in regulation and in quality control, were observed in thermal adaptive evolution with a laboratory Escherichia coli strain. The two specialists carried a single mutation either within rpoH or upstream of groESL, which led to the activated global regulation by sigma factor 32 or an increased amount of GroEL/ES chaperonins, respectively. Although both specialists succeeded in thermal adaptation, the common winner of the evolution was the specialist in quality control, that is, the strategy of chaperonin-mediated protein folding. To understand this evolutionary consequence, multilevel analyses of cellular status, for example, transcriptome, protein and growth fitness, were carried out. The specialist in quality control showed less change in transcriptional reorganization responding to temperature increase, which was consistent with the finding of that the two specialists showed the biased expression of molecular chaperones. Such repressed changes in gene expression seemed to be advantageous for long-term sustainability because a specific increase in chaperonins not only facilitated the folding of essential gene products but also saved cost in gene expression compared with the overall transcriptional increase induced by rpoH regulation. Functional specialization offered two strategies for successful thermal adaptation, whereas the evolutionary advantageous was more at the points of cost-saving in gene expression and the essentiality in protein folding. © 2015 the Molecular Biology Society of Japan and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

TI  - Coupled ARTP and ALE strategy to improve anaerobic cell growth and succinic acid production by Escherichia coli
VL  - 91

SP  - 711-717
AB  - BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli AFP111, a facultative anaerobic strain, shows a very low cell growth and succinic acid production rate in minimal medium during exclusively anaerobic fermentation. Therefore, atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) and adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) strategies were adopted to improve cell growth and succinic acid production under anaerobic conditions. RESULTS: A mutant, BER208, was obtained by ARTP and ALE used successively. When cultured in a 3L stirred bioreactor, the specific growth rate of BER208 was increased 3.12-fold compared with AFP111. Also, it consumed 40gL-1 glucose and produced 27.9gL-1 succinic acid with a glucose utilization rate of 0.54gL-1h-1 and succinic acid productivity of 0.38gL-1h-1, which were 3.7-fold and 2.5-fold higher than those of the original strain. Further investigation showed that the activities of glucokinase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK) were increased 3.3-fold and 16-fold in the mutant compared with the original strain. CONCLUSION: The combined strategy of ARTP and ALE was an effective approach to obtain mutants with improved performance. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.

VL  - 121

AB  - Metabolism constitutes a fundamental property of all organisms. Metabolic rate is commonly described to scale as a power function of body size and exponentially with temperature, thereby treating the effects of body size and temperature independently. Mounting evidence shows that the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass itself depends on temperature. Across-species analyses in fishes suggest that the mass-scaling exponent decreases with increasing temperature. However, whether this relationship holds at the within-species level has rarely been tested. Here, we re-analyse data on the metabolic rates of four freshwater fish species, two coregonids and two cyprinids, that cover wide ranges of body masses and their naturally experienced temperatures. We show that the standard metabolic rate of the coregonids is best fit when accounting for a linear temperature dependence of the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass, whereas a constant mass-scaling exponent is supported in case of the cyprinids. Our study shows that phenotypic responses to temperature can result in temperature-dependent scaling relationships at the species level and that these responses differ between taxa. Together with previous findings, these results indicate that evolutionarily adaptive and phenotypically plastic responses to temperature affect the scaling of metabolic rate with body mass in fishes. © 2011 The Authors.

VL  - 215

SP  - 934-947
AB  - As the air temperature of the Earth rises, ecological relationships within a community might shift, in part due to differences in the thermal physiology of species. Prediction of these shifts - an urgent task for ecologists - will be complicated if thermal tolerance itself can rapidly evolve. Here, we employ a mechanistic approach to predict the potential for rapid evolution of thermal tolerance in the intertidal limpet Lottia gigantea. Using biophysical principles to predict body temperature as a function of the state of the environment, and an environmental bootstrap procedure to predict how the environment fluctuates through time, we create hypothetical time-series of limpet body temperatures, which are in turn used as a test platform for a mechanistic evolutionary model of thermal tolerance. Our simulations suggest that environmentally driven stochastic variation of L.?gigantea body temperature results in rapid evolution of a substantial ?safety margin': the average lethal limit is 5-7°C above the average annual maximum temperature. This predicted safety margin approximately matches that found in nature, and once established is sufficient, in our simulations, to allow some limpet populations to survive a drastic, century-long increase in air temperature. By contrast, in the absence of environmental stochasticity, the safety margin is dramatically reduced. We suggest that the risk of exceeding the safety margin, rather than the absolute value of the safety margin, plays an underappreciated role in the evolution of thermal tolerance. Our predictions are based on a simple, hypothetical, allelic model that connects genetics to thermal physiology. To move beyond this simple model - and thereby potentially to predict differential evolution among populations and among species - will require significant advances in our ability to translate the details of thermal histories into physiological and population-genetic consequences. © 2012.

AB  - The selective past of populations is presumed to affect the levels of phenotypic plasticity. Experimental evolution at constant temperatures is generally expected to lead to a decreased level of plasticity due to presumed costs associated with phenotypic plasticity when not needed. In this study, we investigated the effect of experimental evolution in constant, predictable and unpredictable daily fluctuating temperature regimes on the levels of phenotype plasticity in several life history and stress resistance traits in Drosophila simulans. Contrary to the expectation, evolution in the different regimes did not affect the levels of plasticity in any of the traits investigated even though the populations from the different thermal regimes had evolved different stress resistance and fitness trait means. Although costs associated with phenotypic plasticity are known, our results suggest that the maintenance of phenotypic plasticity might come at low and negligible costs, and thus, the potential of phenotypic plasticity to evolve in populations exposed to different environmental conditions might be limited. © 2015 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

SP  - 3600-3609
AB  - Phenotypic selection is widely accepted as the primary cause of adaptive evolution in natural populations, but selection on complex functional properties linking physiology, behavior, and morphology has been rarely quantified. In ectotherms, correlational selection on thermal physiology, thermoregulatory behavior, and energy metabolism is of special interest because of their potential coadaptation. We quantified phenotypic selection on thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance (sprint speed), thermal preferences, and resting metabolic rate in captive populations of an ectothermic vertebrate, the common lizard, Zootoca vivipara. No correlational selection between thermal sensitivity of performance, thermoregulatory behavior, and energy metabolism was found. A combination of high body mass and resting metabolic rate was positively correlated with survival and negatively correlated with fecundity. Thus, different mechanisms underlie selection on metabolism in lizards with small body mass than in lizards with high body mass. In addition, lizards that selected the near average preferred body temperature grew faster that their congeners. This is one of the few studies that quantifies significant correlational selection on a proxy of energy expenditure and stabilizing selection on thermoregulatory behavior. The annual survival and total fecundity of common lizards were significantly influenced by correlational selection acting on body mass and resting metabolic rate, but with opposite directions for the two life history traits. © 2015 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Analysis of trait mean and variability versus temperature in trematode cercariae: Is there scope for adaptation to global warming?
VL  - 44
IS  - 6
SP  - 403-413
AB  - The potential of species for evolutionary adaptation in the context of global climate change has recently come under scrutiny. Estimates of phenotypic variation in biological traits may prove valuable for identifying species, or groups of species, with greater or lower potential for evolutionary adaptation, as this variation, when heritable, represents the basis for natural selection. Assuming that measures of trait variability reflect the evolutionary potential of these traits, we conducted an analysis across trematode species to determine the potential of these parasites as a group to adapt to increasing temperatures. Firstly, we assessed how the mean number of infective stages (cercariae) emerging from infected snail hosts as well as the survival and infectivity of cercariae are related to temperature. Secondly and importantly in the context of evolutionary potential, we assessed how coefficients of variation for these traits are related to temperature, in both cases controlling for other factors such as habitat, acclimatisation, latitude and type of target host. With increasing temperature, an optimum curve was found for mean output and mean infectivity, and a linear decrease for survival of cercariae. For coefficients of variation, temperature was only an important predictor in the case of cercarial output, where results indicated that there is, however, no evidence for limited trait variation at the higher temperature range. No directional trend was found for either variation of survival or infectivity. These results, characterising general patterns among trematodes, suggest that all three traits considered may have potential to change through adaptive evolution.

TI  - Adaptation of Escherichia coli to long-term serial passage in complex medium: Evidence of parallel evolution
VL  - 2
IS  - 2
AB  - Experimental evolution of bacterial populations in the laboratory has led to identification of several themes, including parallel evolution of populations adapting to carbon starvation, heat stress, and pH stress. However, most of these experiments study growth in defined and/or constant environments. We hypothesized that while there would likely continue to be parallelism in more complex and changing environments, there would also be more variation in what types of mutations would benefit the cells. In order to test our hypothesis, we serially passaged Escherichia coli in a complex medium (Luria-Bertani broth) throughout the five phases of bacterial growth. This passaging scheme allowed cells to experience a wide variety of stresses, including nutrient limitation, oxidative stress, and pH variation, and therefore allowed them to adapt to several conditions. After every ∼30 generations of growth, for a total of ∼300 generations, we compared both the growth phenotypes and genotypes of aged populations to the parent population. After as few as 30 generations, populations exhibit changes in growth phenotype and accumulate potentially adaptive mutations. There were many genes with mutant alleles in different populations, indicating potential parallel evolution. We examined 8 of these alleles by constructing the point mutations in the parental genetic background and competed those cells with the parent population; five of these alleles were found to be adaptive. The variety and swiftness of adaptive mutations arising in the populations indicate that the cells are adapting to a complex set of stresses, while the parallel nature of several of the mutations indicates that this behavior may be generalized to bacterial evolution.

AB  - Global climate is changing rapidly, and the degree to which natural populations respond genetically to these changes is key to predicting ecological responses. So far, no study has documented evolutionary changes in the thermal tolerance of natural populations as a response to recent temperature increase. Here, we demonstrate genetic change in the capacity of the water flea Daphnia to tolerate higher temperatures using both a selection experiment and the reconstruction of evolution over a period of forty years derived from a layered dormant egg bank. We observed a genetic increase in thermal tolerance in response to a two-year ambient +4 °C selection treatment and in the genotypes of natural populations from the 1960s and 2000s hatched from lake sediments. This demonstrates that natural populations have evolved increased tolerance to higher temperatures, probably associated with the increased frequency of heat waves over the past decades, and possess the capacity to evolve increased tolerance to future warming. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - Molecular Clock of Neutral Mutations in a Fitness-Increasing Evolutionary Process
VL  - 11
IS  - 7
AB  - The molecular clock of neutral mutations, which represents linear mutation fixation over generations, is theoretically explained by genetic drift in fitness-steady evolution or hitchhiking in adaptive evolution. The present study is the first experimental demonstration for the molecular clock of neutral mutations in a fitness-increasing evolutionary process. The dynamics of genome mutation fixation in the thermal adaptive evolution of Escherichia coli were evaluated in a prolonged evolution experiment in duplicated lineages. The cells from the continuously fitness-increasing evolutionary process were subjected to genome sequencing and analyzed at both the population and single-colony levels. Although the dynamics of genome mutation fixation were complicated by the combination of the stochastic appearance of adaptive mutations and clonal interference, the mutation fixation in the population was simply linear over generations. Each genome in the population accumulated 1.6 synonymous and 3.1 non-synonymous neutral mutations, on average, by the spontaneous mutation accumulation rate, while only a single genome in the population occasionally acquired an adaptive mutation. The neutral mutations that preexisted on the single genome hitchhiked on the domination of the adaptive mutation. The successive fixation processes of the 128 mutations demonstrated that hitchhiking and not genetic drift were responsible for the coincidence of the spontaneous mutation accumulation rate in the genome with the fixation rate of neutral mutations in the population. The molecular clock of neutral mutations to the fitness-increasing evolution suggests that the numerous neutral mutations observed in molecular phylogenetic trees may not always have been fixed in fitness-steady evolution but in adaptive evolution. © 2015 Kishimoto et al.

AB  - Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) has often been argued to be a physiological defense against obesity, but no empirical proof of its effectiveness in limiting human body weight gain is available. We here propose an immune explanation of DIT - i.e., that it results from the coevolution of host and gut microbiota (especially Firmicutes) that ferment ingested food and proliferate, causing periodic, vagally mediated increases in thermogenesis aimed at curtailing their expansion. Because of this evolutionary adaptive significance related to the immune system, DIT is not effective as an "adaptation" to maintain a certain body mass. Were DIT an effective adaptation to prevent obesity, the current obesity epidemic might not have occurred. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Animal fertilization is governed by the interaction (binding) of proteins on the surfaces of sperm and egg. In many examples presented herein, fertilization proteins evolve rapidly and show the signature of positive selection (adaptive evolution). This review describes the molecular evolution of fertilization proteins in sea urchins, abalone, and oysters, animals with external fertilization that broadcast their gametes into seawater. Theories regarding the selective forces responsible for the rapid evolution driven by positive selection seen in many fertilization proteins are discussed. This strong selection acting on divergence of interacting fertilization proteins might lead to prezygotic reproductive isolation and be a significant factor in the speciation process. Since only a fraction of all eggs are fertilized and only an infinitesimal fraction of male gametes succeed in fertilizing an egg, gametes are obviously a category of entities subjected to intense selection. It is curious that this is never mentioned in the literature dealing with selection, perhaps becausewe know so little about fitness differences among gametes.

TI  - Multivariate analysis of adaptive capacity for upper thermal limits in Drosophila simulans
VL  - 26
IS  - 4
SP  - 800-809
AB  - Thermal tolerance is an important factor influencing the distribution of ectotherms, but our understanding of the ability of species to evolve different thermal limits is limited. Based on univariate measures of adaptive capacity, it has recently been suggested that species may have limited evolutionary potential to extend their upper thermal limits under ramping temperature conditions that better reflect heat stress in nature. To test these findings more broadly, we used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to estimate the multivariate evolutionary potential for upper thermal limits in Drosophila simulans. We assessed heat tolerance using static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays. Our analyses revealed significant evolutionary potential for all three measures of heat tolerance. Additive genetic variances were significantly different from zero for all three traits. Our G matrix analysis revealed that all three traits would contribute to a response to selection for increased heat tolerance. Significant additive genetic covariances and additive genetic correlations between static basal and hardened heat-knockdown time, marginally nonsignificant between static basal and ramping heat-knockdown time, indicate that direct and correlated responses to selection for increased upper thermal limits are possible. Thus, combinations of all three traits will contribute to the evolution of upper thermal limits in response to selection imposed by a warming climate. Reliance on univariate estimates of evolutionary potential may not provide accurate insight into the ability of organisms to evolve upper thermal limits in nature. © 2013 The Authors.

TI  - Variation in life-history traits and their plasticities to elevational transplantation among seed families suggests potential for adaptative evolution of 15 tropical plant species to climate change
VL  - 102
IS  - 8
SP  - 1371-1379
AB  - • Premise of the study: Because not all plant species will be able to move in response to global warming, adaptive evolution matters largely for plant persistence. As prerequisites for adaptive evolution, genetic variation in and selection on phenotypic traits are needed, but these aspects have not been studied in tropical species. We studied how plants respond to transplantation to different elevations on Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, and whether there is quantitative genetic (among-seed family) variation in and selection on life-history traits and their phenotypic plasticity to the different environments. • Methods: We reciprocally transplanted seed families of 15 common tropical, herbaceous species of the montane and savanna vegetation zone at Mt. Kilimanjaro to a watered experimental garden in the montane (1450 m) and in the savanna (880 m) zone at the mountain's slope and measured performance, reproductive, and phenological traits. • Results: Plants generally performed worse in the savanna garden, indicating that the savanna climate was more stressful and thus that plants may suffer from future climate warming. We found significant quantitative genetic variation in all measured performance and reproductive traits in both gardens and for several measures of phenotypic plasticity in response to elevational transplantation. Moreover, we found positive selection on traits at low and intermediate trait values levelling to neutral or negative selection at high values. • Conclusions: We conclude that common plants at Mt. Kilimanjaro express quantitative genetic variation in fitness-relevant traits and in their plasticities, suggesting potential to adapt evolutionarily to future climate warming and increased temperature variability. © 2015 Botanical Society of America

AB  - The evolutionary potential of any given population is of fundamental importance for its longer term prospects. Modern land-use practices often result in small and isolated populations, increasing the risk of extinction through reduced genetic diversity as a consequence of inbreeding or drift. Such genetic erosion may also interfere with a population's evolutionary potential. In this study, we investigate the consequences of inbreeding on evolutionary potential (the ability to increase cold resistance) in a laboratory population of the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana. To explore constraints on evolution, we applied artificial selection to chill-coma recovery time, starting from three levels of inbreeding (outbred control, one or two full-sibling matings). Ten generations of selection produced highly divergent phenotypes, with the lines selected for increased cold tolerance showing about 28% shorter recovery times after cold exposure relative to unselected controls. Correlated responses to selection in 10 different life-history and stress-resistance traits were essentially absent. Inbred lines showed a weaker response to selection, indicating reduced evolutionary potential and thereby constraints on evolution. Inbreeding depression was still measurable in some traits after the course of selection. Traits more closely related to fitness showed a clear fitness rebound, suggesting a trait-specific impact of purging. Our findings have important implications for the longer term survival of small populations in fragmented landscapes. © 2012 The Author(s). Evolution © 2012 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

VL  - 92
SP  - 181-192
AB  - Despite the recent focus on phylogenetic niche conservatism in macroevolutionary studies, many clades have diversified widely along multiple niche dimensions. The factors underlying lineage-specific niche lability are still not well understood. We examined morphological and climate niche evolution in Montiaceae (Caryophyllales), an ecologically variable plant lineage distributed primarily along the mountain chains of the western Americas. Montiaceae inhabit a broader range of temperatures than their relatives, with an increase in the evolutionary rate of temperature niche diversification at the node subtending this clade. Within Montiaceae, life history is highly labile and significantly correlated with temperature, with perennials consistently occurring in cooler environments. This elevated evolutionary lability facilitated repeated shifts between habitats as new environments were created by post-Eocene orogenic events and aridification in the western Americas. The shifts between annual and perennial forms are elaborations of an underlying rosette body plan in most cases, and may involve simple alterations in biomass allocation. Montiaceae stand as another clear counterexample to phylogenetic niche conservatism, and demonstrate a mechanism by which pronounced ecological shifts may occur frequently and rapidly among closely related species. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Meiosis evolves: Adaptation to external and internal environments
VL  - 208
IS  - 2
SP  - 306-323
AB  - Meiosis is essential for the fertility of most eukaryotes and its structures and progression are conserved across kingdoms. Yet many of its core proteins show evidence of rapid or adaptive evolution. What drives the evolution of meiosis proteins? How can constrained meiotic processes be modified in response to challenges without compromising their essential functions? In surveying the literature, we found evidence of two especially potent challenges to meiotic chromosome segregation that probably necessitate adaptive evolutionary responses: whole-genome duplication and abiotic environment, especially temperature. Evolutionary solutions to both kinds of challenge are likely to involve modification of homologous recombination and synapsis, probably via adjustments of core structural components important in meiosis I. Synthesizing these findings with broader patterns of meiosis gene evolution suggests that the structural components of meiosis coevolve as adaptive modules that may change in primary sequence and function while maintaining three-dimensional structures and protein interactions. The often sharp divergence of these genes among species probably reflects periodic modification of entire multiprotein complexes driven by genomic or environmental changes. We suggest that the pressures that cause meiosis to evolve to maintain fertility may cause pleiotropic alterations of global crossover rates. We highlight several important areas for future research. © 2015 New Phytologist Trust.

TI  - Thermal tolerance in the keystone species Daphnia magna—a candidate gene and an outlier analysis approach
VL  - 26

SP  - 2291-2305
AB  - Changes in temperature have occurred throughout Earth's history. However, current warming trends exacerbated by human activities impose severe and rapid loss of biodiversity. Although understanding the mechanisms orchestrating organismal response to climate change is important, remarkably few studies document their role in nature. This is because only few systems enable the combined analysis of genetic and plastic responses to environmental change over long time spans. Here, we characterize genetic and plastic responses to temperature increase in the aquatic keystone grazer Daphnia magna combining a candidate gene and an outlier analysis approach. We capitalize on the short generation time of our species, facilitating experimental evolution, and the production of dormant eggs enabling the analysis of long-term response to environmental change through a resurrection ecology approach. We quantify plasticity in the expression of 35 candidate genes in D. magna populations resurrected from a lake that experienced changes in average temperature over the past century and from experimental populations differing in thermal tolerance isolated from a selection experiment. By measuring expression in multiple genotypes from each of these populations in control and heat treatments, we assess plastic responses to extreme temperature events. By measuring evolutionary changes in gene expression between warm- and cold-adapted populations, we assess evolutionary response to temperature changes. Evolutionary response to temperature increase is also assessed via an outlier analysis using EST-linked microsatellite loci. This study provides the first insights into the role of plasticity and genetic adaptation in orchestrating adaptive responses to environmental change in D. magna. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The extent to which global change will impact the long-term persistence of species depends on their evolutionary potential to adapt to future conditions. While the number of studies that estimate the standing levels of adaptive genetic variation in populations under predicted global change scenarios is growing all the time, few studies have considered multiple environments simultaneously and even fewer have considered evolutionary potential in multivariate context. Because conditions will not be constant, adaptation to climate change is fundamentally a multivariate process so viewing genetic variances and covariances over multivariate space will always be more informative than relying on bivariate genetic correlations between traits. A multivariate approach to understanding the evolutionary capacity to cope with global change is necessary to avoid misestimating adaptive genetic variation in the dimensions in which selection will act. We assessed the evolutionary capacity of the larval stage of the marine polychaete Galeolaria caespitosa to adapt to warmer water temperatures. Galeolaria is an important habitat-forming species in Australia, and its earlier life-history stages tend to be more susceptible to stress. We used a powerful quantitative genetics design that assessed the impacts of three temperatures on subsequent survival across over 30 000 embryos across 204 unique families. We found adaptive genetic variation in the two cooler temperatures in our study, but none in the warmest temperature. Based on these results, we would have concluded that this species has very little capacity to evolve to the warmest temperature. However, when we explored genetic variation in multivariate space, we found evidence that larval survival has the potential to evolve even in the warmest temperatures via correlated responses to selection across thermal environments. Future studies should take a multivariate approach to estimating evolutionary capacity to cope with global change lest they misestimate a species' true adaptive potential. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

VL  - 160
IS  - 2
SP  - 147-155
AB  - Adaptation to new environments is an important issue for invasive species as colonization depends on evolvability in their new distribution range. Here, we considered the case of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci MEAM 1 (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), a pest that has recently invaded Colombia and where thermal adaptation has been proposed to explain its colonizing ability. An experimental evolution study was conducted to assess the evolutionary potential of B. tabaci in relation to its upper thermal limits, to explain its rapid adaptation during post-invasion periods. Selection for hardening capacity was conducted in four whitefly populations. We measured thermal responses in relation to fitness components (survival, fecundity, and viability) for 5–7 generations under a strong selection regime. Heat hardening responded rapidly in both sexes. This was expressed as an increase in survival, but not in fecundity or viability. These results suggest that thermal responses for heat hardening are not correlated and evolve independently. Increased survival after few generations of selection points to high adaptive potential in this insect, which leads to rapid post-invasion adaptation. Our study can help to predict population responses to environmental change and explain the colonizing ability of this pest. © 2016 The Netherlands Entomological Society.

TI  - Altitudinal divergence in maternal thermoregulatory behaviour may be driven by differences in selection on offspring survival in a viviparous lizard
VL  - 65
IS  - 8
SP  - 2313-2324
AB  - Plastic responses to temperature during embryonic development are common in ectotherms, but their evolutionary relevance is poorly understood. Using a combination of field and laboratory approaches, we demonstrate altitudinal divergence in the strength of effects of maternal thermal opportunity on offspring birth date and body mass in a live-bearing lizard (Niveoscincus ocellatus). Poor thermal opportunity decreased birth weight at low altitudes where selection on body mass was negligible. In contrast, there was no effect of maternal thermal opportunity on body mass at high altitudes where natural selection favored heavy offspring. The weaker effect of poor maternal thermal opportunity on offspring development at high altitude was accompanied by a more active thermoregulation and higher body temperature in highland females. This may suggest that passive effects of temperature on embryonic development have resulted in evolution of adaptive behavioral compensation for poor thermal opportunity at high altitudes, but that direct effects of maternal thermal environment are maintained at low altitudes because they are not selected against. More generally, we suggest that phenotypic effects of maternal thermal opportunity or incubation temperature in reptiles will most commonly reflect weak selection for canalization or selection on maternal strategies rather than adaptive plasticity to match postnatal environments. © 2011 The Author(s).

VL  - 69

SP  - 803-814
AB  - To cope with the increasing and less-predictable temperature forecasts under climate change, many terrestrial ectotherms will have to migrate or rely on adaptation through plastic or evolutionary means. Studies suggest that some ectotherms have a limited potential to change their upper thermal limits via evolutionary shifts, but research has mostly focused on adult life stages under laboratory conditions. Here we use replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster and a nested half-sib/full-sib quantitative genetic design to estimate heritabilities and genetic variance components for egg-to-adult viability under both laboratory and seminatural field conditions, encompassing cold, benign, and hot temperatures in two separate populations. The results demonstrated temperature-specific heritabilities and additive genetic variances for egg-to-adult viability. Heritabilities and genetic variances were higher under cold and benign compared to hot temperatures when tested under controlled laboratory conditions. Tendencies toward lower evolutionary potential at higher temperatures were also observed under seminatural conditions although the results were less clear in the field setting. Overall the results suggest that ectotherms that already experience temperatures close to their upper thermal tolerance limits have a restricted capacity to adapt to higher temperatures by evolutionary means. © 2015 The Author(s).

AB  - Climate change is imposing intensified and novel selection pressures on organisms by altering abiotic and biotic environmental conditions on Earth, but studies demonstrating genetic adaptation to climate change mediated selection are still scarce. Evidence is accumulating to indicate that both genetic and ecological constrains may often limit populations' abilities to adapt to large scale effects of climate warming. These constraints may predispose many organisms to respond to climate change with range shifts and phenotypic plasticity, rather than through evolutionary adaptation. In general, broad conclusions about the role of evolutionary adaptation in mitigating climate change induced fitness loss in the wild are as yet difficult to make.

AB  - Organisms tend to decrease in size with increasing temperature by phenotypic plasticity (the temperature-size rule; ectotherms) and/or genetically (Bergmann’s rule; all organisms). In this study, the evolutionary response of body size to temperature was examined in the cyclically parthenogenetic rotifer Brachionus plicatilis. Our aim was to investigate whether this species, already known to decrease in size with increasing temperature by phenotypic plasticity, presents a similar pattern at the genetic level. We exposed a multiclonal mixture of B. plicatilis to experimental evolution at low and high temperature and monitored body size weekly. Within a month, we observed a smaller size at higher temperature, as compared to body size at lower temperature. The pattern was consistent for the size of both mature females and eggs; rotifers kept at high temperature evolved to be on average 14% (after 2 weeks) and 3% (after 3 weeks) smaller than the ones kept at low temperature (10 and 5% in the case of eggs, respectively). We therefore found that B. plicatilis is genetically programmed to adjust its body size-to-environmental temperature. © 2017, The Author(s).

VL  - 27

SP  - 1975-1989
AB  - Theory predicts the emergence of generalists in variable environments and antagonistic pleiotropy to favour specialists in constant environments, but empirical data seldom support such generalist-specialist trade-offs. We selected for generalists and specialists in the dung fly Sepsis punctum (Diptera: Sepsidae) under conditions that we predicted would reveal antagonistic pleiotropy and multivariate trade-offs underlying thermal reaction norms for juvenile development. We performed replicated laboratory evolution using four treatments: adaptation at a hot (31 °C) or a cold (15 °C) temperature, or under regimes fluctuating between these temperatures, either within or between generations. After 20 generations, we assessed parental effects and genetic responses of thermal reaction norms for three correlated life-history traits: size at maturity, juvenile growth rate and juvenile survival. We find evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy for performance at hot and cold temperatures, and a temperature-mediated trade-off between juvenile survival and size at maturity, suggesting that trade-offs associated with environmental tolerance can arise via intensified evolutionary compromises between genetically correlated traits. However, despite this antagonistic pleiotropy, we found no support for the evolution of increased thermal tolerance breadth at the expense of reduced maximal performance, suggesting low genetic variance in the generalist-specialist dimension. © 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

AB  - Laboratory selection in thermal regimes that differed in the amplitude and the predictability of daily fluctuations had a marked effect on stress resistance and life history traits in Drosophila simulans. The observed evolutionary changes are expected to be the result of both direct and correlated responses to selection. Thus, a given trait might not evolve independently from other traits because of genetic correlations among these traits. Moreover, different test environments can induce novel genetic correlations because of the activation of environmentally dependent genes. To test whether and how genetic correlations among stress resistance and life history traits constrain evolutionary adaptation, we used three populations of D. simulans selected for 20 generations in constant, predictable and unpredictable daily fluctuating thermal regimes and tested each of these selected populations in the same three thermal regimes. We explored the relationship between genetic correlations between traits and the evolutionary potential of D. simulans by comparing genetic correlation matrices in flies selected and tested in different thermal test regimes. We observed genetic correlations mainly between productivity, body size, starvation and desiccation tolerance, suggesting that adaptation to the three thermal regimes was affected by correlations between these traits. We also found that the correlations between some traits such as body size and productivity or starvation tolerance and productivity were determined by test regime rather than selection regime that is expected to limit genetic adaptation to thermal regimes in these traits. The results of this study suggest that several traits and several environments are needed to explore adaptive responses, as genetic and environmentally induced correlations between traits as results obtained in one environment cannot be used to predict the response of the same population in another environment. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

TI  - Long-term dynamics of adaptive evolution in a globally important phytoplankton species to ocean acidification
VL  - 2
IS  - 7
AB  - Marine phytoplankton may adapt to ocean change, such as acidification or warming, because of their large population sizes and short generation times. Long-term adaptation to novel environments is a dynamic process, and phenotypic change can take place thousands of generations after exposure to novel conditions. We conducted a long-term evolution experiment (4 years = 2100 generations), starting with a single clone of the abundant and widespread coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi exposed to three different CO2 levels simulating ocean acidification (OA). Growth rates as a proxy for Darwinian fitness increased only moderately under both levels of OA [+3.4% and +4.8%, respectively, at 1100 and 2200 matm partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2)] relative to control treatments (ambient CO2, 400 matm). Long-term adaptation to OA was complex, and initial phenotypic responses of ecologically important traits were later reverted. The biogeochemically important trait of calcification, in particular, that had initially been restored within the first year of evolution was later reduced to levels lower than the performance of nonadapted populations under OA. Calcification was not constitutively lost but returned to control treatment levels when high CO2–adapted isolates were transferred back to present-day control CO2 conditions. Selection under elevated CO2 exacerbated a general decrease of cell sizes under long-term laboratory evolution. Our results show that phytoplankton may evolve complex phenotypic plasticity that can affect biogeochemically important traits, such as calcification. Adaptive evolution may play out over longer time scales (&gt;1 year) in an unforeseen way under future ocean conditions that cannot be predicted from initial adaptation responses. © 2016 The Authors.

VL  - 278

AB  - Anthropogenic factors, including climate warming, are increasing the incidence and prevalence of infectious diseases worldwide. Infectious diseases caused by pathogenic parasites can have severe impacts on host survival, thereby altering the selection regime and inducing evolutionary responses in their hosts. Knowledge about such evolutionary consequences in natural populations is critical to mitigate potential ecological and economic effects. However, studies on pathogen-induced trait changes are scarce and the pace of evolutionary change is largely unknown, particularly in vertebrates. Here, we use a time series from long-term monitoring of perch to estimate temporal trends in the maturation schedule before and after a severe pathogen outbreak. We show that the disease induced a phenotypic change from a previously increasing to a decreasing size at maturation, the most important life-history transition in animals. Evolutionary rates imposed by the pathogen were high and comparable to those reported for populations exposed to intense human harvesting. Pathogens thus represent highly potent drivers of adaptive phenotypic evolution in vertebrates. © 2010 The Royal Society.

TI  - Latitudinal and voltinism compensation shape thermal reaction norms for growth rate
VL  - 20
IS  - 14
SP  - 2929-2941
AB  - Latitudinal variation in thermal reaction norms of key fitness traits may inform about the response of populations to climate warming, yet their adaptive nature and evolutionary potential are poorly known. We assessed the contribution of quantitative genetic, neutral genetic and environmental effects to thermal reaction norms of growth rate for populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans. Among populations, reaction norms differed primarily in elevation, suggesting that time constraints associated with shorter growth seasons in univoltine, high-latitude as well as multivoltine, low-latitude populations selected for faster growth rates. Phenotypic divergence among populations is consistent with selection rather than drift as Q ST was greater than F ST in all cases. Q ST estimates increased with experimental temperature and were influenced by genotype by environment interactions. Substantial additive genetic variation for growth rate in all populations suggests that evolution of trait means in different environments is not constrained. Heritability of growth rates was higher at high temperature, driven by increased genetic rather than environmental variance. While environment-specific nonadditive effects also may contribute to heritability differences among temperatures, maternal effects did not play a significant role (where these could be accounted for). Genotype by environment interactions strongly influenced the adaptive potential of populations, and our results suggest the potential for microevolution of thermal reaction norms in each of the studied populations. In summary, the observed latitudinal pattern in growth rates is adaptive and results from a combination of latitudinal and voltinism compensation. Combined with the evolutionary potential of thermal reaction norms, this may affect populations' ability to respond to future climate warming. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Climate change in the oceans: Evolutionary versus phenotypically plastic responses of marine animals and plants
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
SP  - 104-122
AB  - I summarize marine studies on plastic versus adaptive responses to global change. Due to the lack of time series, this review focuses largely on the potential for adaptive evolution in marine animals and plants. The approaches were mainly synchronic comparisons of phenotypically divergent populations, substituting spatial contrasts in temperature or CO2 environments for temporal changes, or in assessments of adaptive genetic diversity within populations for traits important under global change. The available literature is biased towards gastropods, crustaceans, cnidarians and macroalgae. Focal traits were mostly environmental tolerances, which correspond to phenotypic buffering, a plasticity type that maintains a functional phenotype despite external disturbance. Almost all studies address coastal species that are already today exposed to fluctuations in temperature, pH and oxygen levels. Recommendations for future research include (i) initiation and analyses of observational and experimental temporal studies encompassing diverse phenotypic traits (including diapausing cues, dispersal traits, reproductive timing, morphology) (ii) quantification of nongenetic trans-generational effects along with components of additive genetic variance (iii) adaptive changes in microbe-host associations under the holobiont model in response to global change (iv) evolution of plasticity patterns under increasingly fluctuating environments and extreme conditions and (v) joint consideration of demography and evolutionary adaptation in evolutionary rescue approaches. © 2013 The Authors.

TI  - Use of adaptive laboratory evolution to discover key mutations enabling rapid growth of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 on glucose minimal medium
VL  - 81
IS  - 1
SP  - 17-30
AB  - Adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) has emerged as an effective tool for scientific discovery and addressing biotechnological needs. Much of ALE's utility is derived from reproducibly obtained fitness increases. Identifying causal genetic changes and their combinatorial effects is challenging and time-consuming. Understanding how these genetic changes enable increased fitness can be difficult. A series of approaches that address these challenges was developed and demonstrated using Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 on glucose minimal media at 37°C. By keeping E. coli in constant substrate excess and exponential growth, fitness increases up to 1.6-fold were obtained compared to the wild type. These increases are comparable to previously reported maximum growth rates in similar conditions but were obtained over a shorter time frame. Across the eight replicate ALE experiments performed, causal mutations were identified using three approaches: identifying mutations in the same gene/region across replicate experiments, sequencing strains before and after computationally determined fitness jumps, and allelic replacement coupled with targeted ALE of reconstructed strains. Three genetic regions were most often mutated: the global transcription gene rpoB, an 82-bp deletion between the metabolic pyrE gene and rph, and an IS element between the DNA structural gene hns and tdk. Model-derived classification of gene expression revealed a number of processes important for increased growth that were missed using a gene classification system alone. The methods described here represent a powerful combination of technologies to increase the speed and efficiency of ALE studies. The identified mutations can be examined as genetic parts for increasing growth rate in a desired strain and for understanding rapid growth phenotypes. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

TI  - Adaptation to climate change: trade-offs among responses to multiple stressors in an intertidal crustacean
VL  - 9
IS  - 9
SP  - 1147-1155
AB  - Trade-offs may influence both physiological and evolutionary responses to co-occurring stressors, but their effects on both plastic and adaptive responses to climate change are poorly understood. To test for genetic and physiological trade-offs incurred in tolerating multiple stressors, we hybridized two populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus that were divergent for both heat and salinity tolerance. Starting in the F2 generation, we selected for increased tolerance of heat, low salinity, and high salinity in replicate lines. After five generations of selection, heat-selected lines had greater heat tolerance but lower fecundity, indicating an energetic cost to tolerance. Lines selected for increased salinity tolerance did not show evidence of adaptation to their respective environments; however, hypo-osmotic selection lines showed substantial loss of tolerance to hyperosmotic stress. Neither of the salinity selection regimes resulted in diminished heat tolerance at ambient salinity; however, simultaneous exposure to heat and hypo-osmotic stress led to decreased heat tolerance, implying a physiological trade-off in tolerance to the two stressors. When we quantified the transcriptomic response to heat and salinity stress via RNA sequencing, we observed little overlap in the stress responses, suggesting the observed synergistic effects of heat and salinity stress were driven by competing energetic demands, rather than shared stress response pathways. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Experimental evolution reveals habitat-specific fitness dynamics among Wolbachia clades in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 23
IS  - 4
SP  - 802-814
AB  - The diversity and infection dynamics of the endosymbiont Wolbachia can be influenced by many factors, such as transmission rate, cytoplasmic incompatibility, environment, selection and genetic drift. The interplay of these factors in natural populations can result in heterogeneous infection patterns with substantial differences between populations and strains. The causes of these heterogeneities are not yet understood, partly due to the complexity of natural environments. We present experimental evolution as a new approach to study Wolbachia infection dynamics in replicate populations exposed to a controlled environment. A natural Drosophila melanogaster population infected with strains of Wolbachia belonging to different clades evolved in two laboratory environments (hot and cold) for 1.5 years. In both treatments, the rate of Wolbachia infection increased until fixation. In the hot environment, the relative frequency of different Wolbachia clades remained stable over 37 generations. In the cold environment, however, we observed marked changes in the composition of the Wolbachia population: within 15 generations, one Wolbachia clade increased more than 50% in frequency, whereas the other two clades decreased in frequency, resulting in the loss of one clade. The frequency change was highly reproducible not only among replicates, but also when flies that evolved for 42 generations in the hot environment were transferred to the cold environment. These results document how environmental factors can affect the composition of Wolbachia in D. melanogaster. The high reproducibility of the pattern suggests that experimental evolution studies can efficiently determine the functional basis of habitat-specific fitness among Wolbachia strains. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Adaptive phenotypic response to climate enabled by epigenetics in a K-strategy species, the fish Leucoraja ocellata (Rajidae)
VL  - 3
IS  - 10
AB  - The relative importance of genetic versus epigenetic changes in adaptive evolution is a hotly debated topic, with studies showing that some species appear to be able to adapt rapidly without significant genetic change. Epigenetic mechanisms may be particularly important for the evolutionary potential of species with long maturation times and low reproductive potential (‘K-strategists’), particularly when faced with rapidly changing environmental conditions. Here we study the transcriptome of two populations of the winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata), a typical ‘K-strategist’, in Atlantic Canada; an endemic population in the southern Gulf of St Lawrence and a large population on the Scotian Shelf. The endemic population has been able to adapt to a 10°C higher water temperature over short evolutionary time (7000 years), dramatically reducing its body size (by 45%) significantly below the minimum maturation size of Scotian Shelf and other populations of winter skate, as well as exhibiting other adaptations in life history and physiology. We demonstrate that the adaptive response to selection has an epigenetic basis, cataloguing 3653 changes in gene expression thatmay have enabled this species to rapidly respond to the novel environment. We argue that the epigenetic augmentation of species evolutionary potential (its regulation though gene expression) can enable K-strategists to survive and adapt to different environments, and thismechanism may be particularly important for the persistence of sharks, skates and rays in the light of future climate change. © 2016 The Authors.

VL  - 44

SP  - 1001-1008
AB  - Hybrids have often been labelled evolutionary dead-ends due to their lower fertility and viability. However, there is growing awareness that hybridisation between different species may play a constructive role in animal evolution as a means to create variability. Thus, hybridisation and introgression may contribute to adaptive evolution, for example with regards to natural antagonists (parasites, predators, competitors) and adaptation to local environmental conditions. Here we investigated whether parasite intensity contributes to the continuous recreation of hybrids in 74 natural populations of Melanopsis, a complex of freshwater snails with three species. We also examined, under laboratory conditions, whether hybrids and their parental taxa differ in their tolerance of low and high temperatures and salinity levels. Infections were consistently less prevalent in males than in females, and lower in snails from deeper habitats. Infection prevalence in hybrids was significantly lower than in the parental taxa. Low hybrid infection rates could not be explained by sediment type, snail density or geographic distribution of the sampling sites. Interestingly, infected hybrid snails did not show signs of parasite-induced gigantism, whereas all parental taxa did. We found that hybrids mostly coped with extreme temperatures and salinity levels as well as their parental taxa did. Taken together, our results suggest that Melanopsis hybrids perform better in the presence of parasites and environmental stress. This may explain the widespread and long-term occurrence of Melanopsis hybrids as evidenced by paleontological and biogeographic data. Hybridisation may be an adaptive host strategy, reducing infection rates and resisting gigantism. (C) 2014 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ecology and sexual selection: Evolution of wing pigmentation in calopterygid damselflies in relation to latitude, sexual dimorphism, and speciation
VL  - 182
IS  - 5
SP  - E174-E195
AB  - Our knowledge about how the environment influences sexual selection regimes and how ecology and sexual selection interact is still limited. We performed an integrative study of wing pigmentation in calopterygid damselflies, combining phylogenetic comparative analyses, field observations and experiments. We investigated the evolutionary consequences of wing pigmentation for sexual dimorphism, speciation, and extinction and addressed the possible thermoregulatory benefits of pigmentation. First, we reconstructed ancestral states of male and female phenotypes and traced the evolutionary change of wing pigmentation. Clear wings are the ancestral state and that pigmentation dimorphism is derived, suggesting that sexual selection results in sexual dimorphism. We further demonstrate that pigmentation elevates speciation and extinction rates. We also document a significant biogeographic association with pigmented species primarily occupying northern temperate regions with cooler climates. Field observations and experiments on two temperate sympatric species suggest a link between pigmentation, thermoregulation, and sexual selection, although body temperature is also affected by other phenotypic traits such as body mass, microhabitat selection, and thermoregulatory behaviors. Taken together, our results suggest an important role for wing pigmentation in sexual selection in males and in speciation. Wing pigmentation might not increase ecological adaptation and species longevity, and its primary function is in sexual signaling and species recognition. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

VL  - 68
SP  - 55-62
AB  - Low developmental temperatures cause ectotherms to retard growth, postpone maturation, and emerge at either larger or smaller adult size. In this study, we explored how these thermal responses evolved, focusing on their genetic basis. We applied a full diallel breeding design on inbred lines of the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. To assess the proportional contributions of genetic and non-genetic effects, each genotype, a unique combination of parental haplotypes, was reared from an egg to imago at five developmental temperatures. Faster development of females vs. males was associated with comparatively larger body masses of females (pupae and imago). In contrast, the rapid development caused by warmer environments resulted in smaller beetles (pupae and imago), but there were significant differences in this trait among genotypes. Independent effects of parental haplotypes played the major role in explaining the variance of body mass, but interactive effects of parental haplotypes explained most of the variance in developmental length. Genotypes responded to the thermal environment in a markedly uniform way. Nevertheless, we found the low statistically significant variance in the slopes of thermal reaction norms for body mass and developmental, which was mainly driven by the interactive effects of parental haplotypes. Overall, the thermal plasticity of T. castaneum follows the most common pattern among ectotherms, the so-called temperature-size rule. Detection of the low genetic variance in the shape of this response supports the idea that thermal developmental plasticity remains under a strong selective pressure in ectotherms. © 2017

VL  - 115

SP  - 509-516
AB  - A population's potential for rapid evolutionary adaptation can be estimated from the amount of genetic variation in fitness-related traits. Inshore populations of the mustard hill coral (Porites astreoides) have been shown to be more tolerant to thermal stress than offshore populations, but it is unclear whether this difference is due to long-term physiological acclimatization or genetic adaptation. Here, we evaluated variation in growth rate and survival among 38 families of juvenile recruits of P. astreoides spawned by colonies originating from inshore and offshore locations. Recruits were reared in a common garden for 5 weeks and then subjected to two thermal treatments (28and 31 °C) for 2.5 weeks. The most significant effects were detected during the first 5 weeks, before thermal stress was applied: 27-30% of variance in growth and 94% of variance in recruit survival was attributable to parental effects. Genotyping of eight microsatellite loci indicated that the high early mortality of some of the recruit families was not due to higher inbreeding. Post treatment, parental effects diminished such that only 10-15% of variance in growth rate was explained, which most likely reflects the dissipation of maternal effects. However, offshore-origin recruits still grew significantly less under elevated temperature compared with inshore-origin recruits. These differences observed in naive juvenile corals suggest that population-level variation in fitness in response to different thermal environments has a genetic basis and could represent raw material for natural selection in times of climate change. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - Rising ocean temperatures will alter the productivity and composition of marine phytoplankton communities, thereby affecting global biogeochemical cycles. Predicting the effects of future ocean warming on biogeochemical cycles depends critically on understanding how existing global temperature variation affects phytoplankton. Here we show that variation in phytoplankton temperature optima over 150 degrees of latitude is well explained by a gradient in mean ocean temperature. An eco-evolutionary model predicts a similar relationship, suggesting that this pattern is the result of evolutionary adaptation. Using mechanistic species distribution models, we find that rising temperatures this century will cause poleward shifts in species' thermal niches and a sharp decline in tropical phytoplankton diversity in the absence of an evolutionary response.

VL  - 71

AB  - Mechanistic trade-offs between traits under selection can shape and constrain evolutionary adaptation to environmental stressors. However, our knowledge of the quantitative and qualitative overlap in the molecular machinery among stress tolerance traits is highly restricted by the challenges of comparing and interpreting data between separate studies and laboratories, as well as to extrapolating between different levels of biological organization. We investigated the expression of the constitutive proteome (833 proteins) of 35 Drosophila melanogaster replicate populations artificially selected for increased resistance to six different environmental stressors. The evolved proteomes were significantly differentiated from replicated control lines. A targeted analysis of the constitutive proteomes revealed a regime-specific selection response among heat-shock proteins, which provides evidence that selection also adjusts the constitutive expression of these molecular chaperones. Although the selection response in some proteins was regime specific, the results were dominated by evidence for a “common stress response.” With the exception of high temperature survival, we found no evidence for negative correlations between environmental stress resistance traits, meaning that evolutionary adaptation is not constrained by mechanistic trade-offs in regulation of functional important proteins. Instead, standing genetic variation and genetic trade-offs outside regulatory domains likely constrain the evolutionary responses in natural populations. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - We study evolutionary canalization using a spin-glass model with replica theory, where spins and their interactions are dynamic variables whose configurations correspond to phenotypes and genotypes, respectively. The spins are updated under temperature T S, and the genotypes evolve under temperature T J, according to the evolutionary fitness. It is found that adaptation occurs at T S&lt;T RS S, and a replica symmetric phase emerges at T RSB S&lt;T S&lt;T RS S. The replica symmetric phase implies canalization, and replica symmetry breaking at lower temperatures indicates loss of robustness. Copyright © EPLA, 2012.

AB  - The thermal biology of obligatory aquatic salamanders (e.g., Amphiumidae) is largely unknown. We therefore investigated thermal selection and temperature preference in the fully aquatic salamander, Amphiuma tridactylum. In a laboratory thermal gradient, A. tridactylum selected a mean water temperature of 26.3° C (SE = 0.29, n = 15, range = 24.3 to 27.9). We also investigated potential influences of body size on thermal selection and found no significant relationship between thermal selection and snout-vent length or body mass. The preferred selected temperature is higher than the preferred temperatures reported for other obligatory aquatic salamanders, a difference that may reflect A. tridactylum's southern distribution in the U.S. We collected water and air temperatures at a site representative of A. tridactylum habitat to estimate when preferred temperature may be seasonally available in the field. Maximum water temperatures exceeded 25° C and thus would support activity of A. tridactylum near its preferred temperature during May to August. © 2011. Clifford L. Fontenot, Jr. All rights reserved.

TI  - Rapid Adaptation of a Daphnia magna Population to Metal Stress Is Associated with Heterozygote Excess
VL  - 49
IS  - 15
SP  - 9298-9307
AB  - Although natural populations can harbor evolutionary potential to adapt genetically to chemical stress, it is often thought that natural selection leads to a general reduction of genetic diversity and involves costs. Here, a 10 week microevolution experiment was conducted with a genetically diverse and representative sample of one natural Daphnia magna population that was exposed to copper and zinc. Both Cu- and Zn-selected populations developed a significantly higher metal tolerance (i.e., genetic adaptation), indicated by higher reproduction probabilities of clonal lines in Cu and Zn exposures than observed for the original and control populations. The complete recovery of the population densities after 10 weeks of Zn selection (following an initial decrease of 74%) illustrates an example of evolutionary rescue. Microsatellite genotyping revealed a decrease in clonal diversity but no change in allelic richness, and showed an excess in heterozygosity in the Cu- and Zn-selected populations compared to the control and original populations. The excess heterozygosity in metal-selected populations that we observed has important consequences for risk assessment, as it contributes to the maintenance of a higher allelic diversity under multigenerational chemical exposure. This study is, to our knowledge, the first report of an increase in heterozygosity following multigenerational exposure to metal stress, despite a decline in clonal diversity. In a follow-up study with the Zn-selected populations, we observed no effect of Zn selection on the tolerance to heat and cyanobacteria. However, we observed higher tolerance to Cd in the Zn-selected than in the original and control populations if the 20% effective concentration of Cd was considered (cross-tolerance). Our results suggest only limited costs of adaptation but future research is needed to evaluate the adaptive potential of metal-selected populations to novel stressors and to determine to what extent increased heterozygosity is preserved after genetic recombination following periods of sexual reproduction.

VL  - 163
IS  - 4
AB  - Adaptation to thermal conditions in intertidal ectotherms involves tolerating and surviving frequent and often extreme variations in environmental temperatures. Modulation of gene expression plays an important role in the adaptive evolution of thermal tolerance. To understand such patterns, we investigated the thermal tolerance among three Asian populations (from Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Singapore) of the marine littorinid snail Echinolittorina malaccana and examined gene expression profiles in these populations before, during, and after heat stress using an Illumina RNAsequencing platform. Analysis of transcriptomic changes between different conditions revealed that a proportion of the differentially expressed genes showed similar expression profiles across all three populations, including many classic molecular chaperones such as HSP70 and HSP90 that may constitute the core of the thermal stress response machinery in marine snails. Meanwhile, population-specific transcriptomic responses to heat stress were also detected. A few genes in particular showed more analogous expression profiles in the more thermally tolerant Hong Kong and Singapore populations, and these genes are likely to contribute, at least in part, to the enhanced thermal tolerance of these populations. We argue that repression of a subset of metabolic genes including several cytochrome P450 gene family members, to minimize energy expenditure and control reactive oxygen species turnover, may underpin the enhanced thermal resistance in these two populations. As such, these findings offer new insights into how marine snails cope with thermal stress and their potential evolutionary trajectory toward adapting to a warming climate. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016

SP  - 82-93
AB  - Sex determination is a critical developmental decision with major ecological and evolutionary consequences, yet a large variety of sex determination mechanisms exist and we have a poor understanding of how they evolve. Theoretical and empirical work suggest that compensatory adaptations to mutations in genes involved in sex determination may play a role in the evolution of these pathways. Here, we directly address this problem using experimental evolution in Caenorhabditis eleganslines fixed for a pair of mutations in two key sex-determining genes that jointly render sex determination temperature-sensitive and cause intersexual (but still weakly to moderately fertile) phenotypes at intermediate temperatures. After 50 generations, evolved lines clearly recovered toward wild-type phenotypes. However, changes in transcript levels of key sex-determining genes in evolved lines cannot explain their partially (or in some cases, nearly completely) rescued phenotypes, implying that wild-type phenotypes can be restored independently of the transcriptional effects of these mutations. Our findings highlight the microevolutionary flexibility of sex determination pathways and suggest that compensatory adaptation to mutations can elicit novel and unpredictable evolutionary trajectories in these pathways, mirroring the phylogenetic diversity, and macroevolutionary dynamics of sex determination mechanisms. © 2011 The Author(s).

VL  - 26
IS  - 12
SP  - 2721-2728
AB  - Biotic invasions provide a natural experiment in evolution: when invasive species colonize new ranges, they may evolve new clines in traits in response to environmental gradients. Yet it is not clear how rapidly such patterns can evolve and whether they are consistent between regions. We compare four populations of the invasive cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae) from North America and Japan, independently colonized by P. rapae 150 years ago and 300 years ago, respectively. On each continent, we employed a northern and southern population to compare the effects of latitude on body mass, development rate and immune function. For each population, we used a split-sibling family design in which siblings were reared at either warm (26.7 °C) or cool (20 °C) temperatures to determine reaction norms for each trait. Latitudinal patterns in development time were similar between the two continents. In contrast, there were strong geographical differences in reaction norms for body size, but no consistent effects of latitude; there were no detectable effects of latitude or continent on immune function. These results imply that some life history traits respond consistently to selection along climatic gradients, whereas other traits may respond to local environmental factors, or not at all. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Trade-off between thermal sensitivity, hypoxia tolerance and growth in fish
VL  - 38
IS  - 2
SP  - 98-106
AB  - One outcome of contemporary climate trends is that the involvement of hypoxia and heat tolerance in determining individual fitness will increase in many fish populations. Large fish are believed to be more tolerant to hypoxia than small fish (Nilsson and Östlund-Nilsson, 2008) whereas thermal sensitivity is thought to decrease with body size (Clark et al., 2008). To better understand the bases of inter-individual variation in environmental adaptation performance, the current study examined hypoxia and heat tolerance in a fast growing (FGS; 288.3 ±14.4. g, 26.04±0.49. cm) and a slow growing (SGS; 119.95±6.41. g; 20.98±0.41. cm) strain of 1-year old rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). This examination was conducted using two standardized challenge tests aimed at assessing individual incipient lethal oxygen saturation and incipient upper lethal temperature. Results to these tests were then cross-correlated with swim tests during which individual basal and active metabolic rate values were also measured. Measurements of permeabilized ventricular myofibers oxygen consumption were also conducted, as well as various organ-to-body-mass ratios. Experimental data showed that FGS was more hypoxia tolerant than SGS (13.4 to 16.7% air sat versus 14.7 to 18.9% air sat respectively). On the other hand, FGS was found less tolerant to heat than SGS (24.7-27.6 °C versus 28.5 to 29.7 °C respectively). Adding to the body size effect, another source of inter-individual variation in environmental tolerance was found. Residual analysis highlighted that whereas none of the individual morphometric and energetic traits correlated with hypoxia tolerance, permeabilized ventricular myofibers maximal oxygen consumption correlated well with individual tolerance to heat. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Extreme weather events follow latitudinal patterns and are increasing due to climate change. To persist, natural populations must adapt to the increased occurrence of heat waves. Hypothesis: Heat tolerance is higher at lower latitudes and in smaller animals. Animals show evolutionary potential for heat tolerance. Organism: The water flea, Daphnia magna, a common species in bodies of fresh water. Methods: Set up a common-garden experiment using six populations spread across three latitudes in Western Europe, thereby creating a latitudinal gradient in local temperatures. Measure CTmax, the temperature above which animals lose motor function. Results: Thermal tolerance increased with increasing local temperatures. Body size, which was smaller at the southern latitude, negatively affected heat tolerance. Heat tolerance showed genetic variation within latitudes. Conclusions: Daphnia magna possesses the evolutionary potential to increase its heat tolerance if temperatures warm. Its heat tolerance shows latitudinal adaptation to local temperatures. A parallel pattern in body size magnifies the latitudinal pattern in heat tolerance. © 2014 Aurora N. Geerts.

VL  - 56
IS  - 1
SP  - 73-84
AB  - Thermal performance curves enable physiological constraints to be incorporated in predictions of biological responses to shifts in mean temperature. But do thermal performance curves adequately capture the biological impacts of thermal extremes? Organisms incur physiological damage during exposure to extremes, and also mount active compensatory responses leading to acclimatization, both of which alter thermal performance curves and determine the impact that current and future extremes have on organismal performance and fitness. Thus, these sub-lethal responses to extreme temperatures potentially shape evolution of thermal performance curves. We applied a quantitative genetic model and found that beneficial acclimatization and cumulative damage alter the extent to which thermal performance curves evolve in response to thermal extremes. The impacts of extremes on the evolution of thermal performance curves are reduced if extremes cause substantial mortality or otherwise reduce fitness differences among individuals. Further empirical research will be required to understand how responses to extremes aggregate through time and vary across life stages and processes. Such research will enable incorporating passive and active responses to sub-lethal stress when predicting the impacts of thermal extremes. © The Author 2016.

TI  - Rapid evolution of increased vulnerability to an insecticide at the expansion front in a poleward-moving damselfly
VL  - 9
IS  - 3
SP  - 450-461
AB  - Many species are too slow to track their poleward-moving climate niche under global warming. Pesticide exposure may contribute to this by reducing population growth and impairing flight ability. Moreover, edge populations at the moving range front may be more vulnerable to pesticides because of the rapid evolution of traits to enhance their rate of spread that shunt energy away from detoxification and repair. We exposed replicated edge and core populations of the poleward-moving damselfly Coenagrion scitulum to the pesticide esfenvalerate at low and high densities. Exposure to esfenvalerate had strong negative effects on survival, growth rate, and development time in the larval stage and negatively affected flight-related adult traits (mass at emergence, flight muscle mass, and fat content) across metamorphosis. Pesticide effects did not differ between edge and core populations, except that at the high concentration the pesticide-induced mortality was 17% stronger in edge populations. Pesticide exposure may therefore slow down the range expansion by lowering population growth rates, especially because edge populations suffered a higher mortality, and by negatively affecting dispersal ability by impairing flight-related traits. These results emphasize the need for direct conservation efforts toward leading-edge populations for facilitating future range shifts under global warming. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Is there plasticity in developmental instability? The effect of daily thermal fluctuations in an ectotherm
VL  - 7
IS  - 24
SP  - 10567-10574
AB  - Diversified bet-hedging (DBH) by production of within-genotype phenotypic variance may evolve to maximize fitness in stochastic environments. Bet-hedging is generally associated with parental effects, but phenotypic variation may also develop throughout life via developmental instability (DI). This opens for the possibility of a within-generation mechanism creating DBH during the lifetime of individuals. If so, DI could in fact be a plastic trait itself; if a fluctuating environment indicates uncertainty about future conditions, sensing such fluctuations could trigger DI as a DBH response. However, this possibility has received little empirical attention. Here, we test whether fluctuating environments may elicit such a response in the clonally reproducing crustacean Daphnia magna. Specifically, we exposed genetically identical individuals to two environments of different thermal stability (stable vs. pronounced daily realistic temperature fluctuations) and tested for effects on DI in body mass and metabolic rate shortly before maturation. Furthermore, we also estimated the genetic variation in DI. Interestingly, fluctuating temperatures did not affect body mass, but metabolic rate decreased. We found no evidence for plasticity in DI in response to environmental fluctuations. The lack of plasticity was common to all genotypes, and for both traits studied. However, we found considerable evolvability for DI, which implies a general evolutionary potential for DBH under selection for increased phenotypic variance. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Delayed effects of chlorpyrifos across metamorphosis on dispersal-related traits in a poleward moving damselfly
VL  - 218
SP  - 634-643
AB  - How exposure to contaminants may interfere with the widespread poleward range expansions under global warming is largely unknown. Pesticide exposure may negatively affect traits shaping the speed of range expansion, including traits related to population growth rate and dispersal-related traits. Moreover, rapid evolution of growth rates during poleward range expansions may come at a cost of a reduced investment in detoxification and repair thereby increasing the vulnerability to contaminants at expanding range fronts. We tested effects of a sublethal concentration of the widespread pesticide chlorpyrifos on traits related to range expansion in replicated edge and core populations of the poleward moving damselfly Coenagrion scitulum reared at low and high food levels in a common garden experiment. Food limitation in the larval stage had strong negative effects both in the larval stage and across metamorphosis in the adult stage. Exposure to chlorpyrifos during the larval stage did not affect larval traits but caused delayed effects across metamorphosis by increasing the incidence of wing malformations during metamorphosis and by reducing a key component of the adult immune response. There was some support for an evolutionary trade-off scenario as the faster growing edge larvae suffered a higher mortality during metamorphosis. Instead, there was no clear support for the faster growing edge larvae being more vulnerable to chlorpyrifos. Our data indicate that sublethal delayed effects of pesticide exposure, partly in association with the rapid evolution of faster growth rates, may slow down range expansions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is now generally acknowledged that climate change has wide-ranging biological consequences, potentially leading to impacts on biodiversity. Environmental factors can have diverse and often strong effects on reproduction, with obvious ramifications for population fitness. Nevertheless, reproductive traits are often neglected in conservation considerations. Focusing on animals, recent progress in sexual selection and sexual conflict research suggests that reproductive costs may pose an underestimated hurdle during rapid climate change, potentially lowering adaptive potential and increasing extinction risk of certain populations. Nevertheless, regime shifts may have both negative and positive effects on reproduction, so it is important to acquire detailed experimental data. We hence present an overview of the literature reporting short-term reproductive consequences of exposure to different environmental factors. From the enormous diversity of findings, we conclude that climate change research could benefit greatly from more coordinated efforts incorporating evolutionary approaches in order to obtain cross-comparable data on how individual and population reproductive fitness respond in the long term. Therefore, we propose ideas and methods concerning future efforts dealing with reproductive consequences of climate change, in particular by highlighting the advantages of multi-generational experimental evolution experiments. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

TI  - Laboratory selection for increased longevity in Drosophila melanogaster reduces field performance
VL  - 48
IS  - 11
SP  - 1189-1195
AB  - Drosophila melanogaster is frequently used in ageing studies to elucidate which mechanisms determine the onset and progress of senescence. Lines selected for increased longevity have often been shown to perform as well as or superior to control lines in life history, stress resistance and behavioural traits when tested in the laboratory. Functional senescence in longevity selected lines has also been shown to occur at a slower rate. However, it is known that performance in a controlled laboratory setting is not necessarily representative of performance in nature. In this study the effect of ageing, environmental temperature and longevity selection on performance in the field was tested. Flies from longevity selected and control lines of different ages (2, 5, 10 and 15 days) were released in an environment free of natural food sources. Control flies were tested at low, intermediate and high temperatures, while longevity selected flies were tested at the intermediate temperature only. The ability of flies to locate and reach a food source was tested. Flies of intermediate age were generally better at locating resources than both younger and older flies, where hot and cold environments accelerate the senescent decline in performance. Control lines were better able to locate a resource compared to longevity selected lines of the same age, suggesting that longevity comes at a cost in early life field fitness, supporting the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of ageing.

TI  - Costs and benefits of larval jumping behaviour of Bathyplectes anurus
VL  - 103
IS  - 1
AB  - Bathyplectes anurus, a parasitoid of the alfalfa weevils, forms a cocoon in the late larval stage and exhibits jumping behaviour. Adaptive significance and costs of the cocoon jumping have not been thoroughly studied. We hypothesised that jumping has the fitness benefits of enabling habitat selection by avoiding unfavourable environments. We conducted laboratory experiments, which demonstrated that jumping frequencies increased in the presence of light, with greater magnitudes of temperature increase and at lower relative humidity. In addition, when B. anurus individuals were allowed to freely jump in an arena with a light gradient, more cocoons were found in the shady area, suggesting microhabitat selection. In a field experiment, mortality of cocoons placed in the sun was significantly higher than for cocoons placed in the shade. B. anurus cocoons respond to environmental stress by jumping, resulting in habitat selection. In the presence of potential predators (ants), jumping frequencies were higher than in the control (no ant) arenas, though jumping frequencies decreased after direct contact with the predators. Body mass of B. anurus cocoons induced to jump significantly decreased over time than cocoons that did not jump, suggesting a cost to jumping. We discuss the benefits and costs of jumping behaviour and potential evolutionary advantages of this peculiar trait, which is present in a limited number of species. © 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

VL  - 5

AB  - We report evidence of adaptive evolution in juvenile development time on a decadal timescale for the cinnabar moth Tyria jacobaeae (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) colonizing new habitats and hosts from the Willamette Valley to the Coast Range and Cascades Mountains in Oregon. Four lines of evidence reveal shorter egg to pupa juvenile development times evolved in the mountains, where cooler temperatures shorten the growing season: (i) field observations showed that the mountain populations have shorter phenological development; (ii) a common garden experiment revealed genetic determination of phenotypic differences in juvenile development time between Willamette Valley and mountain populations correlated with the growing season; (iii) a laboratory experiment rearing offspring from parental crosses within and between Willamette Valley and Cascades populations demonstrated polygenic inheritance, high heritability, and genetic determination of phenotypic differences in development times; and (iv) statistical tests that exclude random processes (founder effect, genetic drift) in favor of natural selection as explanations for observed differences in phenology. These results support the hypothesis that rapid adaptation to the cooler mountain climate occurred in populations established from populations in the warmer valley climate. Our findings should motivate regulators to require evaluation of evolutionary potential of candidate biological control organisms prior to release. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Mild stresses are known to retard progressive decline in survival with age. The process wherein mild stresses exhibit a beneficial role is termed hormesis. The two mild stresses which are gaining interest in the present scenario of aging research are repeated mild heat shock (RMHS) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). Our interest was to know how the unique laboratory-evolved short- and long-lived cytoraces of nasuta-albomicans complex of Drosophila would respond to these stresses. Differential response by these cytoraces to RMHS and HDACi was observed. The lifespan of short-lived cytoraces, SL-1 and SL-2, extended more remarkably than other races in response to both RMHS and HDACi, whereas two of the long-lived cytoraces, LL-1 and LL-2, have not shown significant response to HDACi, even though they showed mild response to RMHS. The LL-3 and LL-4 cytoraces have not behaved similarly for all the three hormesis treatments as LL-1 and LL-2 cytoraces. These findings specify that there is a race-specific response developed in each system, and the reason we predict for such plasticity would be their genetic background. These cytoraces which evolved through hybridization have unique genome introgression and recombination, through which they might have acquired a race specific aging pathways, which in turn, played a crucial role in their differential response to stresses. © 2011 Unione Zoologica Italiana.

VL  - 37

SP  - 1012-1021
AB  - While geographic trait variation along environmental clines is widespread, associated patterns in sexual selection remain largely unexplored. Geographic patterns in sexual selection may be expected if 1) phenotypes vary geographically and sexual selection is dependent on the local phenotypes in the population, and if 2) sexual selection is influenced by geographically structured environmental conditions. We quantified geographic variation in flight-related traits and flight performance in mated and unmated males and tested for geographic variation in sexual selection on these traits in the poleward range-expanding damselfly Coenagrion scitulum across a set of eleven core and edge populations ordered along thermal gradients in the larval and in the adult stage. We found little support for trait differentiation between core and edge populations, instead we found considerable geographic trait variation along the larval and adult thermal gradients. As expected under time constraints, body mass decreased with shorter larval growth seasons. Lower temperatures during the adult flight period were associated with a higher body mass, a higher flight speed and a higher fat content; these traits likely evolved to buffer flight ability at suboptimal temperatures and to optimize starvation resistance. Across the large geographic scale, we found a consistent higher flight duration in mated males. Instead, sexual selection for higher fat content was stronger in populations with lower adult flight temperatures and sexual selection for lower body mass acted only in edge populations. Our results indicate sexual selection on flight performance to be consistent over a large geographic scale and this despite the clear geographic patterns in sexual selection on the underlying morphological traits. Our results highlight that to fully understand the fitness implications of geographically changing trait patterns, researchers should consider the entire phenotype-performance-fitness axis and incorporate effects of geographically structured life-stage specific environmental conditions on this axis. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Increased survival and prolonged longevity mainly contribute to the temperature-adaptive evolutionary strategy in invasive Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) middle East Asia Minor 1
VL  - 14
AB  - With increasing global climate change, analyses of stress-inducing conditions have important significance in ecological adaptation and the biological distribution of species. To reveal the difference in temperature-adaptive strategy between Turpan and Beijing populations of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) Middle East Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) under high-temperature stress conditions, we compared thermal tolerance and life history traits between Beijing and Turpan populations of MEAM1 after exposure to different heat shock treatments for different times. The experimental design reflected the nature of heat stress conditions suffered by MEAM1. The results showed that eggs, red-eyed pupae, and adults of the Turpan population were more heat tolerant than those of the Beijing population under the same stress conditions. Additionally, it was found that longevity and F1 adult survival rate were significantly higher in the Turpan population than in the Beijing population after heat shock stress, but egg number and F1 female ratio were not significantly different between Turpan population and Beijing population. Overall, it was suggested that heat tolerance and longevity traits were the most relevant for climate characteristics and not reproductive traits, and improved heat tolerance and prolonged longevity were important adaptive strategies that helped MEAM1 to survive in harsh high-temperature conditions such as Turpan arid desert climate. The present results provided further insight into the modes of heat tolerance and the ways in which survival and longevity traits respond to environmental selection pressures. © The Author 2014.

TI  - Adaptive evolution of Thermotoga maritima reveals plasticity of the ABC transporter network
VL  - 81
IS  - 16
SP  - 5477-5485
AB  - Thermotoga maritima is a hyperthermophilic anaerobe that utilizes a vast network of ABC transporters to efficiently metabolize a variety of carbon sources to produce hydrogen. For unknown reasons, this organism does not metabolize glucose as readily as it does glucose di-and polysaccharides. The leading hypothesis implicates the thermolability of glucose at the physiological temperatures at which T. maritima lives. After a 25-day laboratory evolution, phenotypes were observed with growth rates up to 1.4 times higher than and glucose utilization rates exceeding 50% those of the wild type. Genome resequencing revealed mutations in evolved cultures related to glucose-responsive ABC transporters. The native glucose ABC transporter, GluEFK, has more abundant transcripts either as a result of gene duplication-amplification or through mutations to the operator sequence regulating this operon. Conversely, BglEFGKL, a transporter of beta-glucosides, is substantially downregulated due to a nonsense mutation to the solute binding protein or due to a deletion of the upstream promoter. Analysis of the ABC2 uptake porter families for carbohydrate and peptide transport revealed that the solute binding protein, often among the transcripts detected at the highest levels, is predominantly downregulated in the evolved cultures, while the membrane-spanning domain and nucleotide binding components are less varied. Similar trends were observed in evolved strains grown on glycerol, a substrate that is not dependent on ABC transporters. Therefore, improved growth on glucose is achieved through mutations favoring GluEFK expression over BglEFGKL, and in lieu of carbon catabolite repression, the ABC transporter network is modulated to achieve improved growth fitness. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

VL  - 32
IS  - 1
SP  - 24-31
AB  - The main stems of large rivers throughout the world have been highly modified with little consideration for effects on fishes that rely on these areas to complete their life histories. Particularly important is the ability of riverine habitats to provide foraging opportunities for young fish.We explored how temperature, flow, and food availability influenced diet content, prey selection (Strauss's linear selectivity index), and energy condition of age-0 shovelnose sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorynchus and pallid sturgeon S. albus in major habitat areas (e.g., islands, channel borders, wing dikes, and side channels) of the middle Mississippi River during spring (March-May) and summer (June-August) 2008. Standardized diet mass (dry mass standardized for fish body mass) of the age-0 sturgeon peaked at about 19 °C and at a flow velocity of 0.5 m/s. Although potential prey taxa were diverse, the diets for age-0 sturgeon of all sizes were dominated by mayflies (Ephemeroptera) and midge larvae (Chironomidae) across all habitats. As age-0 sturgeon grew, the relative energy return per habitat appeared to diverge; island tips upstream of the main channel and channel border areas behind wing dikes provided higher gains in standardized diet mass than other habitats. No differences in energy condition (kJ/g) occurred among habitats, although large (51-200 mm total length [TL]) age-0 sturgeon had higher energy densities than their small (≤50 mm TL) counterparts. Enhancement of areas with flow and substrates that facilitate the production and availability of midges and mayflies (e.g., instream island complexes) is critical for the recruitment of age-0 Scaphirhynchus sturgeon in large rivers. © American Fisheries Society 2012.

TI  - Temperature-dependent sex determination under rapid anthropogenic environmental change: Evolution at a turtle's pace?
VL  - 107
IS  - 1
SP  - 61-70
AB  - Organisms become adapted to their environment by evolving through natural selection, a process that generally transpires over many generations. Currently, anthropogenically driven environmental changes are occurring orders of magnitude faster than they did prior to human influence, which could potentially outpace the ability of some organisms to adapt. Here, we focus on traits associated with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), a classic polyphenism, in a model turtle species to address the evolutionary potential of species with TSD to respond to rapid climate change. We show, first, that sex-ratio outcomes in species with TSD are sensitive to climatic variation. We then identify the evolutionary potential, in terms of heritability, of TSD and quantify the evolutionary potential of 3 key traits involved in TSD: pivotal temperature, maternal nest-site choice, and nesting phenology. We find that these traits display different patterns of adaptive potential: pivotal temperature exhibits moderate heritable variation, whereas nestsite choice and nesting phenology, with considerable phenotypic plasticity, have only modest evolutionary potential to alter sex ratios. Therefore, the most likely response of species with TSD to anthropogenically induced climate change may be a combination of microevolution in thermal sensitivity of the sex-determining pathway and of plasticity in maternal nesting behavior. © The American Genetic Association. 2015.

TI  - Phenotypic shifts in urban areas in the tropical lizard Anolis cristatellus
VL  - 70
IS  - 5
SP  - 1009-1022
AB  - Urbanization is an increasingly important dimension of global change, and urban areas likely impose significant natural selection on the species that reside within them. Although many species of plants and animals can survive in urban areas, so far relatively little research has investigated whether such populations have adapted (in an evolutionary sense) to their newfound milieu. Even less of this work has taken place in tropical regions, many of which have experienced dramatic growth and intensification of urbanization in recent decades. In the present study, we focus on the neotropical lizard, Anolis cristatellus. We tested whether lizard ecology and morphology differ between urban and natural areas in three of the most populous municipalities on the island of Puerto Rico. We found that environmental conditions including temperature, humidity, and substrate availability differ dramatically between neighboring urban and natural areas. We also found that lizards in urban areas use artificial substrates a large proportion of the time, and that these substrates tend to be broader than substrates in natural forest. Finally, our morphological data showed that lizards in urban areas have longer limbs relative to their body size, as well as more subdigital scales called lamellae, when compared to lizards from nearby forested habitats. This shift in phenotype is exactly in the direction predicted based on habitat differences between our urban and natural study sites, combined with our results on how substrates are being used by lizards in these areas. Findings from a common-garden rearing experiment using individuals from one of our three pairs of populations provide evidence that trait differences between urban and natural sites may be genetically based. Taken together, our data suggest that anoles in urban areas are under significant differential natural selection and may be evolutionarily adapting to their human-modified environments. © 2016, Society for the Study of Evolution..

AB  - Chill-coma recovery (CCR) is an important trait for thermal adaptation in insects. Multiple phenotypes could be affected by selection on CCR if the trait is genetically correlated with other adaptive traits. To test for heritable (co-)variation in CCR, we examined direct and correlated responses to bi-directional selection on CCR. Drosophila buzzatii Patterson & Wheeler (Diptera: Drosophilidae) was artificially selected for decreased and increased recovery time following exposure to 0 °C. After 18 selected generations, the selection response in CCR was significant but qualitatively asymmetric, with replicated lines for slow CCR showing the highest response. Knockdown resistance to high temperature was not affected by CCR selection. Starvation resistance in the adult fly showed no clear pattern of correlated responses to CCR selection. Selection on CCR had no impact on developmental time and body size. Chill-coma recovery shows no apparent genetic trade-offs with any of the multiple traits included in this study. These results are largely consistent with recent studies on clines in D. buzzatii, which showed that CCR is not across-population correlated with other clinally varying traits of thermal adaptation. Cold adaptation may evolve toward increased cold resistance independent of upper thermal limits. © 2010 The Netherlands Entomological Society.

AB  - Knockdown resistance to high temperature (KRHT) is a genetically variable trait for thermal adaptation in insects. Selection for KRHT may affect a number of fitness components as well as resistance to several forms of environmental stress To test for heritable (co)-variation in KRHT, we examined direct and correlated responses to bi-directional selection on this trait in Drosophila buzzatii Replicated lines were artificially selected for decreased and increased KRHT After 12 generations of artificial selection, lines diverged significantly for high KRHT only. Starvation resistance increased in two lines that strongly responded to selection for high KRHT, and these two lines also showed relatively longer chill-coma recovery time Developmental time and body size showed no correlated responses to KRHT-selection These results suggest that KRHT is a heritable trait that can evolve towards increased thermotolerance with no genetic trade-offs associated to starvation resistance, developmental time and body size.

AB  - The major goal of evolutionary thermal biology is to understand how variation in temperature shapes phenotypic evolution. Comparing thermal reaction norms among populations from different thermal environments allows us to gain insights into the evolutionary mechanisms underlying thermal adaptation. Here, we have examined thermal adaptation in six wild populations of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) from markedly different natural environments by analyzing thermal reaction norms for fecundity, thorax length, wing area, and ovariole number under ecologically realistic fluctuating temperature regimes in the laboratory. Contrary to expectation, we found only minor differences in the thermal optima for fecundity among populations. Differentiation among populations was mainly due to differences in absolute (and partly also relative) thermal fecundity performance. Despite significant variation among populations in the absolute values of morphological traits, we observed only minor differentiation in their reaction norms. Overall, the thermal reaction norms for all traits examined were remarkably similar among different populations. Our results therefore suggest that thermal adaptation in D. melanogaster predominantly involves evolutionary changes in absolute trait values rather than in aspects of thermal reaction norms. © 2013 The Author(s).

VL  - 11

AB  - Novel biotic or abiotic conditions can cause invasive species to evolve rapidly in their newly invaded habitats and are important factors when predicting species invasions. Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have a relatively long invasion history in Western Europe, whereas quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) began spreading about a decade ago. In a previous invasion to North America, quagga mussels repeatedly colonized stratified lakes at greater depth than zebra mussels. It would be important to know if the same invasion pattern is expected to repeat in Western Europe, as the quagga are expected to reach deep stratified lakes in the near future. This might require quagga mussels to be more tolerant of the low oxygen conditions at depth than zebra mussels. Therefore, using a fully factorial design, we tested survival of different zebra and quagga mussel populations from Western Europe at four oxygen levels (6%, 33%, 66% and 90%) and two temperature regimes (11°C and 18°C). Surprisingly, survival differences among oxygen and temperature treatments depended more on population origin than on species identity. This finding suggests that populations have undergone rapid and convergent adaptation to local conditions after invasion, in particular to low oxygen. We also found that population-by-environment interactions were more variable among quagga than zebra mussel populations. Our results suggest that rapid evolutionary adaptation to low oxygen conditions needs to be considered when predicting the further spread of zebra and quagga mussels. © 2016 REABIC.

VL  - 47

AB  - Purpose: Fresh catfish (Clarias gariepinus) is highly perishable. This paper aims to investigate the drying characteristics and quality of body-mass dehydrated catfish to determine the effective dehydration parameters for preservation. Design/methodology/approach: Brine concentration (3-9 per cent), brining time (30-90 min) and drying temperature (90-130°C) interacted using the response surface methodology. Preliminary experiments were conducted to select treatments. Moisture content and ratio and drying rate were determined and fitted into five thin-layer drying models; the goodness of fit was evaluated by average grade ranking of the regression parameters. Proximate compositions and microbial load of dehydrated catfish were determined using standard methods. Findings: Treatments with 110°C gave initial higher drying rate (0.034-0.043 kg H2O/kg solid/h) and shorter drying time (20-21 h). Drying occurred at two falling rate periods. Midilli model ranked first in fitting the drying data. It explained up to 99.6-99.7 per cent of the total variations in the independent variables with low values of error terms; RMSE was 0.02131-0.01794 and χ2 was 0.00037-0.00043, indicating good predictive quality. Processing parameters positively and significantly (p &lt; 0.05) influenced the proximate compositions of dehydrated catfish. Treatment: 6 per cent brine, 90 min and 110°C presented the most effective dehydration parameters for quality preservation of body-mass catfish. Practical implications: The dehydration technique used in this study could enhance nutritive quality and storage stability of body-mass dehydrated catfish that could serve as a useful and convenient tool for commercial application. Social implications: Hygienically processed dehydrated catfish of good quality could be used as a source of nutrients to ameliorate malnutrition and reduce post-harvest losses of catfish. Originality/value: The effective processing parameters established is an important step to harness the high nutrients and economic values embedded in catfish. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.

TI  - Distribution and ecophysiology of calanoid copepods in relation to the oxygen minimum zone in the eastern tropical atlantic
VL  - 8
IS  - 11
AB  - Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) affect distribution patterns, community structure and metabolic processes of marine organisms. Due to the prominent role of zooplankton, especially copepods, in the marine carbon cycle and the predicted intensification and expansion of OMZs, it is essential to understand the effects of hypoxia on zooplankton distribution and ecophysiology. For this study, calanoid copepods were sampled from different depths (0-1800 m) at eight stations in the eastern tropical Atlantic (3°47'N to 18°S) during three expeditions in 2010 and 2011. Their horizontal and vertical distribution was determined and related to the extent and intensity of the OMZ, which increased from north to south with minimum O2 concentrations (12.7 μmol kg-1) in the southern Angola Gyre. Calanoid copepod abundance was highest in the northeastern Angola Basin and decreased towards equatorial regions as well as with increasing depth. Maximum copepod biodiversity was observed in the deep waters of the central Angola Basin. Respiration rates and enzyme activities were measured to reveal species-specific physiological adaptations. Enzyme activities of the electron transport system (ETS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) served as proxies for aerobic and anaerobic metabolic activity, respectively. Mass-specific respiration rates and ETS activities decreased with depth of occurrence, consistent with vertical changes in copepod body mass and ambient temperature. Copepods of the families Eucalanidae and Metridinidae dominated within the OMZ. Several of these species showed adaptive characteristics such as lower metabolic rates, additional anaerobic activity and diel vertical migration that enable them to successfully inhabit hypoxic zones. © 2013 Teuber et al.

TI  - Thermal adaptation of cellular membranes in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 28
IS  - 4
SP  - 886-894
AB  - Summary: Changes in temperature disrupt the fluidity of cellular membranes, which can negatively impact membrane integrity and cellular processes. Many ectotherms, including Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen), adjust the glycerophospholipid composition of their membranes to restore optimal fluidity when temperatures change, a type of trait plasticity termed homeoviscous adaptation. Existing data suggest that plasticity in the relative abundances of the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) underlies cellular adaptation to temporal variability in the thermal environment. For example, laboratory populations of D. melanogaster evolved in the presence of temporally variable temperatures have greater developmental plasticity of the ratio of PE to PC (PE/PC) and greater fecundity than do populations evolved at constant temperatures. Here, we extend this work to natural populations of D. melanogaster by evaluating thermal plasticity of glycerophospholipid composition at different life stages, in genotypes isolated from Vermont, Indiana and North Carolina, USA. We also quantify the covariance between developmental and adult (reversible) plasticity, and between adult responses of the membrane to cool and warm thermal shifts. As predicted by physiological models of homeoviscous adaptation, flies from all populations decrease PE/PC and the degree of lipid unsaturation in response to warm temperatures. Furthermore, these populations have diverged in their degree of membrane plasticity. Flies from the most variable thermal environment (Vermont, USA) decrease PE/PC to a greater extent than do other populations when developed at a warm temperature, a pattern that matches our previous observation in laboratory-evolved populations. We also find that developmental plasticity and adult plasticity of PE/PC covary across genotypes, but that adult responses to cool and warm thermal shifts do not. When combined with our previous observations of laboratory-evolved populations, our findings implicate developmental plasticity of PE/PC as a mechanism of thermal adaptation in temporally variable environments. While little is known about the genetic bases of plastic responses to temperature, our observations suggest that both environmentally sensitive and environmentally specific alleles contribute to thermal adaptation of membranes and that costs of plasticity may arise when the adult environment differs from that experienced during development. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Adaptation to fluctuating environments in a selection experiment with Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 7
IS  - 11
SP  - 3796-3807
AB  - A fundamental question in life-history evolution is how organisms cope with fluctuating environments, including variation between stressful and benign conditions. For short-lived organisms, environments commonly vary between generations. Using a novel experimental design, we exposed wild-derived Drosophila melanogaster to three different selection regimes: one where generations alternated between starvation and benign conditions, and starvation was always preceded by early exposure to cold; another where starvation and benign conditions alternated in the same way, but cold shock sometimes preceded starvation and sometimes benign conditions; and a third where conditions were always benign. Using six replicate populations per selection regime, we found that selected flies increased their starvation resistance, most strongly for the regime where cold and starvation were reliably combined, and this occurred without decreased fecundity or extended developmental time. The selected flies became stress resistant, displayed a pronounced increase in early life food intake and resource storage. In contrast to previous experiments selecting for increased starvation resistance in D. melanogaster, we did not find increased storage of lipids as the main response, but instead that, in particular for females, storage of carbohydrates was more pronounced. We argue that faster mobilization of carbohydrates is advantageous in fluctuating environments and conclude that the phenotype that evolved in our experiment corresponds to a compromise between the requirements of stressful and benign environments. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Selection and inheritance of developmental variants of Propylea dissecta under thermal stress conditions
VL  - 69
SP  - 275-280
AB  - The present study aims to understand the influence of two thermal extremes (15 degrees C and 35 degrees C) as thermal stressors on the selected line of developmental variants (slow and fast developers) in Propylea dissecta and to compare it with the response at the optimal temperature (27 degrees C). The ratio of slow and fast developers within an egg batch differed with thermal extremes irrespective of Fl and F15 generations. Adult body mass got depressed after selection for control slow developers at 15 degrees C while it got enhanced for selected fast developers at 35 degrees C. More selected slow developers were found at low temperature and more selected fast developers at high temperature. Selection probably favours the enhancement of immature survival and emergence ratio which was found to be highest for selected fast developers at 35 degrees C and selected slow developers at 15 degrees C. Population level disparity on thermal confliction was observed in ladybird post selection over several generations. Therefore, we put forward that exposure thermal extremes over a long duration, causes an adaptive differentiation in thermal responses of slow and fast developers.

TI  - Loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) offspring size does not vary with maternal alternative foraging behaviors: support for their phenotypic plasticity
VL  - 162
IS  - 8
SP  - 1567-1578
AB  - Revealing the causes and consequences of differential habitat use among previously untrackable species will help advance our understanding of how organisms have survived and adapted during their evolutionary histories. Among loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting on one Japanese beach, small females tend to forage on planktonic prey in oceanic waters (depth >200 m) as the juveniles do, while large females tend to forage on benthic prey in neritic waters (depth <200 m). These alternative foraging behaviors are presumably maintained by a strategy depending on growth conditions during oceanic early life, and each tactic would be consistently used throughout the adult stage. To verify whether the morphology of emerged hatchlings varies with maternal alternative foraging behaviors, the clutches of similar egg characteristics derived from oceanic and neritic foragers were incubated in a common beach area (30°24′N, 130°26′E), Yakushima Island, Japan, 2014. There were no significant differences in straight carapace length and width and body mass of emerged hatchlings between the two foraging groups, which were classified based on stable isotope ratios, suggesting that the development process of hatchling tissue from yolk and albumen is genetically similar between the two groups. Egg size and mass significantly increased with female body size only in neritic foragers that laid larger clutches than oceanic foragers, whereas hatchling size and mass significantly increased with egg mass in both groups. This suggested that larger females produced larger hatchlings within neritic foragers, and indeed, there was a significant positive correlation in body size between females and hatchlings only within neritic foragers. However, significant negative correlations between the number of eggs reburied per nest and emergence success that might explain the above phenomenon were not found in either oceanic or neritic foragers. Effects of a seasonal rise in ambient temperature on embryonic development and hatchling morphology were also similar between the two foraging groups, implying their genetic similarity in thermal response, consistent with their phenotypic plasticity. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Biochemical adaptation to ocean acidification
VL  - 218
IS  - 12
SP  - 1946-1955
AB  - The change in oceanic carbonate chemistry due to increased atmospheric PCO2 has caused pH to decline in marine surface waters, a phenomenon known as ocean acidification (OA). The effects of OA on organisms have been shown to be widespread among diverse taxa from a wide range of habitats. The majority of studies of organismal response to OA are in short-term exposures to future levels of PCO2. From such studies, much information has been gathered on plastic responses organisms may make in the future that are beneficial or harmful to fitness. Relatively few studies have examined whether organisms can adapt to negative-fitness consequences of plastic responses to OA. We outline major approaches that have been used to study the adaptive potential for organisms to OA, which include comparative studies and experimental evolution. Organisms that inhabit a range of pH environments (e.g. pH gradients at volcanic CO2 seeps or in upwelling zones) have great potential for studies that identify adaptive shifts that have occurred through evolution. Comparative studies have advanced our understanding of adaptation to OA by linking whole-organism responses with cellular mechanisms. Such optimization of function provides a link between genetic variation and adaptive evolution in tuning optimal function of rate-limiting cellular processes in different pH conditions. For example, in experimental evolution studies of organisms with short generation times (e.g. phytoplankton), hundreds of generations of growth under future conditions has resulted in fixed differences in gene expression related to acid-base regulation. However, biochemical mechanisms for adaptive responses to OA have yet to be fully characterized, and are likely to be more complex than simply changes in gene expression or protein modification. Finally, we present a hypothesis regarding an unexplored area for biochemical adaptation to ocean acidification. In this hypothesis, proteins and membranes exposed to the external environment, such as epithelial tissues, may be susceptible to changes in external pH. Such biochemical systems could be adapted to a reduced pH environment by adjustment of weak bonds in an analogous fashion to biochemical adaptation to temperature. Whether such biochemical adaptation to OA exists remains to be discovered. © 2015. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

VL  - 3

SP  - 1163-1172
AB  - Functional plant traits are likely to adapt under the sustained pressure imposed by environmental changes through natural selection. Employing Brassica napus as a model, a multi-generational study was performed to investigate the potential trajectories of selection at elevated [CO2] in two different temperature regimes. To reveal phenotypic divergence at the manipulated [CO2] and temperature conditions, a full-factorial natural selection regime was established in a phytotron environment over the range of four generations. It is demonstrated that a directional response to selection at elevated [CO2] led to higher quantities of reproductive output over the range of investigated generations independent of the applied temperature regime. The increase in seed yield caused an increase in aboveground biomass. This suggests quantitative changes in the functions of carbon sequestration of plants subjected to increased levels of CO2 over the generational range investigated. The results of this study suggest that phenotypic divergence of plants selected under elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration may drive the future functions of plant productivity to be different from projections that do not incorporate selection responses of plants. This study accentuates the importance of phenotypic responses across multiple generations in relation to our understanding of biogeochemical dynamics of future ecosystems. Furthermore, the positive selection response of reproductive output under increased [CO2] may ameliorate depressions in plant reproductive fitness caused by higher temperatures in situations where both factors co-occur. © 2013 The Authors.

TI  - Adaptive evolution and inherent tolerance to extreme thermal environments
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Background. When introduced to novel environments, the ability for a species to survive and rapidly proliferate corresponds with its adaptive potential. Of the many factors that can yield an environment inhospitable to foreign species, phenotypic response to variation in the thermal climate has been observed within a wide variety of species. Experimental evolution studies using bacteriophage model systems have been able to elucidate mutations, which may correspond with the ability of phage to survive modest increases/decreases in the temperature of their environment. Results. Phage X174 was subjected to both elevated (50°C) and extreme (70°C+) temperatures for anywhere from a few hours to days. While no decline in the phage's fitness was detected when it was exposed to 50°C for a few hours, more extreme temperatures significantly impaired the phage; isolates that survived these heat treatments included the acquisition of several mutations within structural genes. As was expected, long-term treatment of elevated and extreme temperatures, ranging from 50-75°C, reduced the survival rate even more. Isolates which survived the initial treatment at 70°C for 24 or 48 hours exhibited a significantly greater tolerance to subsequent heat treatments. Conclusions. Using the model organism X174, we have been able to study adaptive evolution on the molecular level under extreme thermal changes in the environment, which to-date had yet to be thoroughly examined. Under both acute and extended thermal selection, we were able to observe mutations that occurred in response to excessive external pressures independent of concurrently evolving hosts. Even though its host cannot tolerate extreme temperatures such as the ones tested here, this study confirms that X174 is capable of survival. © 2010 Cox et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Locomotor activity of Drosophila melanogaster in high temperature environments: Plastic and evolutionary responses
VL  - 43
IS  - 1
SP  - 127-134
AB  - Regular exposure to a given stressor poses selective pressure towards increased resistance. In high temperature environments this can be mediated through physiological and biochemical adjustments that lead to increased resistance to heat coma. Such adjustments may influence complex traits such as locomotor activity through cascading effects. Alternatively, changes in locomotor activity may change the exposure to the stressor and, thereby, the importance of the physiological and biochemical adjustments. In this experiment we analysed how selection for heat shock resistance may affect locomotor activity at high temperatures in Drosophila melanogaster. We compared 2 lines selected for heat shock (HS) and cold shock (CS) resistance at 4 constant high temperatures (28 to 38°C). We also tested the importance of heat shock protein (Hsp) expression by comparing locomotor activity at the same temperatures of a heat-sensitive mutant line (Hsf0), where the heat shock factor (Hsf) is non-functional at high temperatures, with that of a rescued mutant line (Hsf+) with a functional Hsf re-inserted. At moderately stressful temperatures (28 and 34°C), flies from the Hsf0 line were more active than flies from the Hsf+ line, whereas this was reversed at higher temperatures. In the selection lines, the CS flies were more active at 28°C but this was reversed at 34 and 36°C, whereas no difference was observed at the most stressful temperature (38°C). This suggests that the lines selected for increased cold tolerance were more stressed at moderately high temperatures and, therefore, more active in the attempt to escape the stress, whereas at higher temperatures, their locomotor activity was more compromised than in flies from the lines selected for increased heat resistance. © Inter-Research 2010.

TI  - Relative contributions of neutral and non-neutral genetic differentiation to inform conservation of steelhead trout across highly variable landscapes
VL  - 7
IS  - 6
SP  - 682-701
AB  - Mounting evidence of climatic effects on riverine environments and adaptive responses of fishes have elicited growing conservation concerns. Measures to rectify population declines include assessment of local extinction risk, population ecology, viability, and genetic differentiation. While conservation planning has been largely informed by neutral genetic structure, there has been a dearth of critical information regarding the role of non-neutral or functional genetic variation. We evaluated genetic variation among steelhead trout of the Columbia River Basin, which supports diverse populations distributed among dynamic landscapes. We categorized 188 SNP loci as either putatively neutral or candidates for divergent selection (non-neutral) using a multitest association approach. Neutral variation distinguished lineages and defined broad-scale population structure consistent with previous studies, but fine-scale resolution was also detected at levels not previously observed. Within distinct coastal and inland lineages, we identified nine and 22 candidate loci commonly associated with precipitation or temperature variables and putatively under divergent selection. Observed patterns of non-neutral variation suggest overall climate is likely to shape local adaptation (e.g., potential rapid evolution) of steelhead trout in the Columbia River region. Broad geographic patterns of neutral and non-neutral variation demonstrated here can be used to accommodate priorities for regional management and inform long-term conservation of this species. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Indirect genetic effects underlie oxygen-limited thermal tolerance within a coastal population of chinook salmon
VL  - 281
IS  - 1789
AB  - With global temperatures projected to surpass the limits of thermal tolerance for many species, evaluating the heritable variation underlying thermal tolerance is critical for understanding the potential for adaptation to climate change. We examined the evolutionary potential of thermal tolerance within a population of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) by conducting a full-factorial breeding design and measuring the thermal performance of cardiac function and the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of offspring from each family. Additive genetic variation in offspring phenotype was mostly negligible, although these direct genetic effects explained 53% of the variation in resting heart rate (fH). Conversely, maternal effects had a significant influence on resting fH, scope for fH, cardiac arrhythmia temperature and CTmax. These maternal effects were associated with egg size, as indicated by strong relationships between the mean egg diameter of mothers and offspring thermal tolerance. Because egg size can be highly heritable in chinook salmon, our finding indicates that the maternal effects of egg size constitute an indirect genetic effect contributing to thermal tolerance. Such indirect genetic effects could accelerate evolutionary responses to the selection imposed by rising temperatures and could contribute to the population-specific thermal tolerance that has recently been uncovered among Pacific salmon populations. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

VL  - 25

SP  - 1564-1575
AB  - Temperature changes in the environment, which realistically include environmental fluctuations, can create both plastic and evolutionary responses of traits. Sexes might differ in either or both of these responses for homologous traits, which in turn has consequences for sexual dimorphism and its evolution. Here, we investigate both immediate changes in and the evolution of sexual dimorphism in response to a changing environment (with and without fluctuations) using the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We investigate sex differences in plasticity and also the genetic architecture of body mass and developmental time dimorphism to test two existing hypotheses on sex differences in plasticity (adaptive canalization hypothesis and condition dependence hypothesis). We found a decreased sexual size dimorphism in higher temperature and that females responded more plastically than males, supporting the condition dependence hypothesis. However, selection in a fluctuating environment altered sex-specific patterns of genetic and environmental variation, indicating support for the adaptive canalization hypothesis. Genetic correlations between sexes (r MF) were affected by fluctuating selection, suggesting facilitated independent evolution of the sexes. Thus, the selective past of a population is highly important for the understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of sexual dimorphism. © 2012 The Authors.

VL  - 9

SP  - 101-114
AB  - This paper proposes the application of the covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) evolution strategy for the identification of building envelope materials hygrothermal properties. All material properties are estimated on the basis of local temperature and relative humidity measurements, by solving the inverse heat and moisture transfer problem. The applicability of the identification procedure is demonstrated in two stages: first, a numerical benchmark is developed and used as to show the potential identification accuracy, justify the choice for a Tikhonov regularization term in the fitness evaluation, and propose a method for its appropriate tuning. Then, the procedure is applied on the basis of experimental measurements from an instrumented test cell, and compared to the experimental characterization of the observed material. Results show that an accurate estimation of all hygrothermal properties of a building material is feasible, if the objective function of the inverse problem is carefully defined. © 2015 International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA).

TI  - Outcrossing and the maintenance of males within C. elegans populations
VL  - 101
SP  - S62-S74
AB  - Caenorhabditis elegans is an androdioecious nematode with both hermaphrodites and males. Although males can potentially play an important role in avoiding inbreeding and facilitating adaptation, their existence is evolutionarily problematic because they do not directly generate offspring in the way that hermaphrodites do. This review explores how genetic, population genomic, and experimental evolution approaches are being used to address the role of males and outcrossing within C. elegans. Although theory suggests that inbreeding depression and male mating ability should be the primary determinants of male frequency, this has yet to be convincingly confirmed experimentally. Genomic analysis of natural populations finds that outcrossing occurs at low, but not negligible levels, and that observed patterns of linkage disequilibrium consistent with strong selfing may instead be generated by natural selection against outcrossed progeny. Recent experimental evolution studies suggest that males can be maintained at fairly high levels if populations are initiated with sufficient genetic variation and/or subjected to strong natural selection via a change in the environment. For example, as reported here, populations adapting to novel laboratory rearing and temperature regimes maintain males at frequencies from 5% to 40%. Laboratory and field results still await full reconciliation, which may be facilitated by identifying the loci underlying among-strain differences in mating system dynamics. © 2010 The American Genetic Association.

TI  - Expression of heat shock protein 90 genes during early development and infection in Megalobrama amblycephala and evidence for adaptive evolution in teleost
VL  - 41
IS  - 4
SP  - 683-693
AB  - Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) are highly conserved molecular chaperones, playing a pivotal role in cellular progress. In this study, we reported the characterization of the Hsp90 alpha and Hsp90 beta genes in Megalobrama amblycephala, the expression profiling during early development, in various healthy tissues and in response to bacterial infection, and the assessment of their adaptive evolution. The Hsp90 alpha cDNA contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 2193 bp encoding 731 amino acids and the Hsp90 beta cDNA has an ORF of 2184 bp encoding 728 amino acids. Using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, the mRNA of both Hsp90a and Hsp90 beta reached the highest level at 15th day post-hatch. Using qRT-PCR and Western blot, both Hsp90 alpha and Hsp90 beta were widely expressed in various healthy tissues and significantly higher in blood than in other tissues. Expression of both Hsp90 alpha and Hsp90 beta were up-regulated upon bacterial infection and reached the peak level at 4 h post infection. Site model analysis indicated that one positive selection site (T717) in Hsp90 alpha was found, while no positive selection site was observed in Hsp90 beta. Branch-site model test showed that there were adaptively evolutionary evidences in the branches of Salmoniformes and Gasterosteiformes for Hsp90 alpha gene, and in the branch of Salmoniformes for Hsp90 beta gene.

TI  - Thermal plasticity of body size and cell size in snails from two subspecies of Cornu aspersum
VL  - 82
IS  - 2
SP  - 235-243
AB  - Many ectotherms grow more slowly but mature at a larger size in colder environments, according to the pattern called the temperature-size rule. Thermal variation of cell size is suspected to be inherent in the origin of this pattern, but empirical testing of this hypothesis has been conducted in only a few taxa. In the laboratory, we reared two subspecies of the land snail Cornu aspersum (formerly Helix aspersa), C. a. aspersum and C. a. maximum, at two thermal regimes (15 and 20 °C), aiming to examine the relationship between cell size and adult mass across temperatures. The warmer environment led to larger adult mass in both taxa, contrary to the temperature-size rule. Using histological techniques, we found that snails grown at the warmer temperature produced heavier shells, smaller muscle and epithelial cells, but larger hepatopancreatic cells and nuclei. These results strongly suggest that the temperature-size rule for body size cannot be explained by a simple consequence of thermal sensitivity of cell size. Focusing on the patterns between the two taxa, we found that aspersum grew more slowly, with faster metabolic rates and smaller mass at the end of the experiment, when compared with maximum, regardless of temperature. The subspecies aspersum evolved larger muscular and epithelial cells than maximum, but both had a similar size of hepatopancreatic cells and a similar shell mass. Interestingly, when compared across a range of small body masses, aspersum had a heavier hepatopancreas than maximum. We propose that the evolutionary divergence between the two subspecies might involve a trade-off between growth and hepatopancreatic functions, but not a trade-off caused by the costs of shell production and maintenance of cell membranes. © 2015 The Author.

TI  - Contrasted thermal regimes do not influence digestion and growth rates in a snake from a temperate climate
VL  - 83
IS  - 6
SP  - 924-931
AB  - Temperature influences almost all life-history traits. For a period of 3 mo, we placed four groups of snakes under four contrasted thermal treatments: (1) a natural regime (NR), based on daily variations (24-h cycle); (2) an accelerated regime (AR), where the thermoperiod fluctuated rapidly (12-h cycle); (3) a slow regime (SR; 48-h cycle); and (4) a cool stable regime (ZR; no fluctuation). The mean temperature, set at 23°C, was identical for the four groups. For the first three groups (NR, AR, SR), ambient temperature fluctuated between 18°C and 28°C. Relative humidity and photoperiod were constant. We recorded feeding success, digestion efficiency, growth rate, activity, and ecdysis events. Differences between groups were expected because of varied exposure to the optimal temperatures, most notably in the ZR group, where the preferred body temperature for digestion (∼30°C) would not be reached. Surprisingly, there was no significant effect of the experimental treatment on feeding rate, digestion, body mass increase, and growth rate. Our results do not conform to the paradigm stipulating that maximal body temperature selected by ectotherms necessarily corresponds to the most efficient for resource assimilation and that temperature fluctuations are essential. We propose that increasing the digestive tract's performance through bodytemperature elevation trades off against elevated (parasite) energy expenditure from the rest of the body. The main advantage of high body temperatures would be to reduce the amount of time necessary to assimilate prey rather than to improve the net mass gain during digestion. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

VL  - 30

SP  - 2034-2038
AB  - Tail autotomy is an effective anti-predator strategy adopted by many lizards, but can induce the decrease of their body mass and the changes in their energy balance, giving effects on their locomotor ability and body temperature adjustment. In this paper, a common lizard (Lacerta vivipara) population was collected from Xiaoxing' an Mountains in Heilongjiang Province of Northeast China in May 2006 to examine the effects of tail loss on the L. vivipara locomotor ability and selected body temperature. At experimental temperature 30°C and 24°C, the tail loss of L. vivipara resulted in an obvious reduction in its locomotor performances. More specifically, the frequency of stopping locomotion increased whereas the maximum distance of continuous locomotion and the sprint speed decreased. To some extent, the effects of tail loss, experimental temperature, and sex on the locomotor ability of L. vivipara were independently. Tail loss was the main factor affecting the locomotor ability, but had little effects on the selected body temperature.

TI  - First and second law efficiencies in the cooking process of eggplant using a solar cooker box-type
VL  - 582
AB  - In this work an experimental procedure and the determination of first and second law efficiencies for the cooking process of eggplant using a solar cooker box-type are shown. The eggplant was modelled as cylinder. In the experimental process a NI Compact Field Point was used as acquisition data system which allows measure temperatures in simultaneous form. The temperatures evolution was defined using thermocouples located at water, surface and central point of the eggplant. After to measure the evolution temperatures in a solar cooker thermodynamics principles were applied to determine the first and second laws. The results obtained indicates what is the numerical difference between the first and second laws in the cooking process of eggplant. The results allow to understand how the inlet energy that impacts on solar cooker is converted in energy useful in the cooking process of eggplant. This work be used in future designs of solar cookers. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A synthesis of research on the responses of terrestrial biota (1095 effect sizes) to industrial pollution (206 point emission sources) was conducted to reveal regional and global patterns from small-scale observational studies. A meta-analysis, in combination with other statistical methods, showed that the effects of pollution depend on characteristics of the specific polluter (type, amount of emission, duration of impact on biota), the affected organism (trophic group, life history), the level at which the response was measured (organism, population, community), and the environment (biome, climate). In spite of high heterogeneity in responses, we have detected several general patterns. We suggest that the development of evolutionary adaptations to pollution is a common phenomenon and that the harmful effects of pollution on terrestrial ecosystems are likely to increase as the climate warms. We argue that community- and ecosystem-level responses to pollution should be explored directly, rather than deduced from organism-level studies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although firmly grounded in metabolic biochemistry, the study of energy metabolism has gone well beyond this discipline and become integrative and comparative as well as ecological and evolutionary in scope. At the cellular level, ATP is hydrolyzed by energy-expending processes and resynthesized by pathways in bioenergetics. A significant development in the study of bioenergetics is the realization that fluxes through pathways as well as metabolic rates in cells, tissues, organs, and whole organisms are "system properties." Therefore, studies of energy metabolism have become, increasingly, experiments in systems biology. A significant challenge continues to be the integration of phenomena over multiple levels of organization. Body mass and temperature are said to account for most of the variation in metabolic rates found in nature. A mechanistic foundation for the understanding of these patterns is outlined. It is emphasized that evolution, leading to adaptation to diverse lifestyles and environments, has resulted in a tremendous amount of deviation from popularly accepted scaling "rules." This is especially so in the deep sea which constitutes most of the biosphere. © 2012 American Physiological Society.

TI  - The transgenerational effects of heat stress in the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei are negative and rapidly eliminated under direct selection for increased stress resistance in larvae
VL  - 104
IS  - 6
SP  - 438-446
AB  - Parents encountering stress environments can influence the phenotype of their offspring in a form of transgenerational phenotypic plasticity that has the potential to be adaptive if offspring are thereby better able to deal with future stressors. Here, we test for the existence of anticipatory parental effects in the heat stress response in the highly polymorphic nematode Caenorhabditis remanei. Rather providing an anticipatory response, parents subject to a prior heat stress actually produce offspring that are less able to survive a severe heat shock. Selection on heat shock resistance within the larvae via experimental evolution leads to a loss of sensitivity (robustness) to environmental variation during both the parental and larval periods. Whole genome transcriptional analysis of both ancestor and selected lines shows that there is weak correspondence between genetic pathways induced via temperature shifts during parental and larval periods. Parental effects can evolve very rapidly via selection acting directly on offspring. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Greenlandic Inuit show genetic signatures of diet and climate adaptation
VL  - 349
IS  - 6254
SP  - 1343-1347
AB  - The indigenous people of Greenland, the Inuit, have lived for a long time in the extreme conditions of the Arctic, including low annual temperatures, and with a specialized diet rich in protein and fatty acids, particularly omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). A scan of Inuit genomes for signatures of adaptation revealed signals at several loci, with the strongest signal located in a cluster of fatty acid desaturases that determine PUFA levels. The selected alleles are associated with multiple metabolic and anthropometric phenotypes and have large effect sizes for weight and height, with the effect on height replicated in Europeans. By analyzing membrane lipids, we found that the selected alleles modulate fatty acid composition, which may affect the regulation of growth hormones. Thus, the Inuit have genetic and physiological adaptations to a diet rich in PUFAs.

TI  - Plastic and evolutionary responses to heat stress in a temperate dung fly: Negative correlation between basal and induced heat tolerance?
VL  - 29
IS  - 5
SP  - 900-915
AB  - Extreme weather events such as heat waves are becoming more frequent and intense. Populations can cope with elevated heat stress by evolving higher basal heat tolerance (evolutionary response) and/or stronger induced heat tolerance (plastic response). However, there is ongoing debate about whether basal and induced heat tolerance are negatively correlated and whether adaptive potential in heat tolerance is sufficient under ongoing climate warming. To evaluate the evolutionary potential of basal and induced heat tolerance, we performed experimental evolution on a temperate source population of the dung fly Sepsis punctum. Offspring of flies adapted to three thermal selection regimes (Hot, Cold and Reference) were subjected to acute heat stress after having been exposed to either a hot-acclimation or non-acclimation pretreatment. As different traits may respond differently to temperature stress, several physiological and life history traits were assessed. Condition dependence of the response was evaluated by exposing juveniles to different levels of developmental (food restriction/rearing density) stress. Heat knockdown times were highest, whereas acclimation effects were lowest in the Hot selection regime, indicating a negative association between basal and induced heat tolerance. However, survival, adult longevity, fecundity and fertility did not show such a pattern. Acclimation had positive effects in heat-shocked flies, but in the absence of heat stress hot-acclimated flies had reduced life spans relative to non-acclimated ones, thereby revealing a potential cost of acclimation. Moreover, body size positively affected heat tolerance and unstressed individuals were less prone to heat stress than stressed flies, offering support for energetic costs associated with heat tolerance. Overall, our results indicate that heat tolerance of temperate insects can evolve under rising temperatures, but this response could be limited by a negative relationship between basal and induced thermotolerance, and may involve some but not other fitness-related traits. © 2016 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.

AB  - Pinnipeds have to cope with the thermoregulatory demands of their amphibious lifestyle. As they are effectively insulated against heat loss in water by their blubber, they have to bypass the blubber for heat dissipation while staying ashore. In previous studies thermal windows on the body of captive phocid seals have been described as areas of heat dissipation in air. In this study we used infrared thermography (IRT) to examine thermal windows in seals hauling out as well as in training situations, where the first refers to a voluntary and the latter to an induced stay on shore. Furthermore we provide an IRT-based estimate of heat loss through thermal windows in pinnipeds. Hauling out seals developed thermal windows within a few minutes irrespective of environmental conditions. By contrast, seals staying on shore on a trainer's command did not develop thermal windows at all. The calculation of heat loss through thermal windows resulted in considerable values in air, but above all in water, which is energetically disadvantageous as it takes up to four minutes to close thermal windows in water. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

VL  - 36

SP  - 1476-1487
AB  - We evaluate the potential for decapod larvae to develop under temporally limited daily access to food across a broad thermal range. Larvae of the European lobster Homarus gammarus and velvet swimming crab Necora puber were successfully reared to juvenile and megalopa stages, respectively, at four temperatures (range 15-24°C) under both permanent (24 h) and limited (4 h) daily access to prey. Survival was high in both species with no consistent effect of food limitation. Larvae developed faster with increasing temperature. Model selection indicated that limited access to food in N. puber slowed development from zoea III onwards by 10-25% depending on stage and temperature. Food limitation slowed development of H. gammarus in zoea III and stage IV by 6-30%, with significant interactions of food × temperature. Dry mass, carbon and nitrogen content of H. gammarus all decreased with temperature and were lower under limited access to food. Decapod larvae of the tested species show a high potential to survive and develop with a temporally patchy food resource, although a longer development and smaller body mass at the time of settlement may lead to fitness costs. © The Author 2014.

TI  - High temperature and bacteriophages can indirectly select for bacterial pathogenicity in environmental reservoirs
VL  - 6
IS  - 3
AB  - The coincidental evolution hypothesis predicts that traits connected to bacterial pathogenicity could be indirectly selected outside the host as a correlated response to abiotic environmental conditions or different biotic species interactions. To investigate this, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, Serratia marcescens, was cultured in the absence and presence of the lytic bacteriophage PPV (Podoviridae) at 25°C and 37°C for four weeks (N = 5). At the end, we measured changes in bacterial phage-resistance and potential virulence traits, and determined the pathogenicity of all bacterial selection lines in the Parasemia plantaginis insect model in vivo. Selection at 37°C increased bacterial motility and pathogenicity but only in the absence of phages. Exposure to phages increased the phage-resistance of bacteria, and this was costly in terms of decreased maximum population size in the absence of phages. However, this small-magnitude growth cost was not greater with bacteria that had evolved in high temperature regime, and no trade-off was found between phage-resistance and growth rate. As a result, phages constrained the evolution of a temperature-mediated increase in bacterial pathogenicity presumably by preferably infecting the highly motile and virulent bacteria. In more general perspective, our results suggest that the traits connected to bacterial pathogenicity could be indirectly selected as a correlated response by abiotic and biotic factors in environmental reservoirs. © 2011 Friman et al.

TI  - Geographic variation in body form of prehistoric Jomon males in the Japanese archipelago: Its ecogeographic implications
VL  - 149
IS  - 1
SP  - 125-135
AB  - Diversity of human body size and shape is often biogeographically interpreted in association with climatic conditions. According to Bergmann's and Allen's rules, populations in regions with a cold climate are expected to display an overall larger body and smaller/shorter extremities than those in warm/hot environments. In the present study, the skeletal limb size and proportions of prehistoric Jomon hunter-gatherers, who extensively inhabited subarctic to subtropical areas in the ancient Japanese archipelago, were examined to evaluate whether or not the inter-regional differences follow such ecogeographic patterns. Results showed that the Jomon intralimb proportions including relative distal limb lengths did not differ significantly among five regions from northern Hokkaido to the southern Okinawa Islands. This suggests a limited co-variability of the intralimb proportions with climate, particularly within genealogically close populations. In contrast, femoral head breadth (associated with body mass) and skeletal limb lengths were found to be significantly and positively correlated with latitude, suggesting a north-south geographical cline in the body size. This gradient therefore comprehensively conforms to Bergmann's rule, and may stem from multiple potential factors such as phylogenetic constraints, microevolutionary adaptation to climatic/geographic conditions during the Jomon period, and nutritional and physiological response during ontogeny. Specifically, the remarkably small-bodied Jomon in the Okinawa Islands can also be explained as an adjustment to subtropical and insular environments. Thus, the findings obtained in this study indicate that Jomon people, while maintaining fundamental intralimb proportions, displayed body size variation in concert with ambient surroundings.

TI  - Assessment of abdominal skin temperature change in premature newborns with NEC compared to healthy controls
VL  - 37
SP  - 191-194
AB  - Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is a painful, invasive, and rapidly progressive disease of the intestine primarily affecting premature newborns, with a mortality rate between 15-30% and no reliable methods of prevention. Current diagnostic tests do not always detect early signs of the disease. We used infrared (IR) thermal imaging to assess the abdominal surface temperature of healthy babies and those with NEC. Thermal sequences were obtained of babies taken out of the incubator and the temperature evolution post-thermal stress was monitored. Regression analysis indicates a slower decrease of superficial abdominal temperature in the NEC group, which we attribute to increased heat from inflamed bowel. We also show that differentiation between NEC and healthy babies is possible. Based on features derived from superficial abdominal temperatures, a linear classifier was trained on an optimal subset of features determined through genetic search. Results indicate a correct classification rate greater than 90 that IR imaging provides additional information that could help diagnose NEC sooner. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - A role for the cell-wall protein silacidin in cell size of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana
VL  - 11
IS  - 11
SP  - 2452-2464
AB  - Diatoms contribute 20% of global primary production and form the basis of many marine food webs. Although their species diversity correlates with broad diversity in cell size, there is also an intraspecific cell-size plasticity owing to sexual reproduction and varying environmental conditions. However, despite the ecological significance of the diatom cell size for food-web structure and global biogeochemical cycles, our knowledge about genes underpinning the size of diatom cells remains elusive. Here, a combination of reverse genetics, experimental evolution and comparative RNA-sequencing analyses enabled us to identify a previously unknown genetic control of cell size in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. In particular, the targeted deregulation of the expression of the cell-wall protein silacidin caused a significant increase in valve diameter. Remarkably, the natural downregulation of the silacidin gene transcript due to experimental evolution under low temperature also correlated with cell-size increase. Our data give first evidence for a genetically controlled regulation of cell size in T. pseudonana and possibly other centric diatoms as they also encode the silacidin gene in their genomes. © 2017 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.

TI  - Complex Genotype by Environment interactions and changing genetic architectures across thermal environments in the Australian field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Biologists studying adaptation under sexual selection have spent considerable effort assessing the relative importance of two groups of models, which hinge on the idea that females gain indirect benefits via mate discrimination. These are the good genes and genetic compatibility models. Quantitative genetic studies have advanced our understanding of these models by enabling assessment of whether the genetic architectures underlying focal phenotypes are congruent with either model. In this context, good genes models require underlying additive genetic variance, while compatibility models require non-additive variance. Currently, we know very little about how the expression of genotypes comprised of distinct parental haplotypes, or how levels and types of genetic variance underlying key phenotypes, change across environments. Such knowledge is important, however, because genotype-environment interactions can have major implications on the potential for evolutionary responses to selection. Results: We used a full diallel breeding design to screen for complex genotype-environment interactions, and genetic architectures underlying key morphological traits, across two thermal environments (the lab standard 27°C, and the cooler 23°C) in the Australian field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus. In males, complex three-way interactions between sire and dam parental haplotypes and the rearing environment accounted for up to 23 per cent of the scaled phenotypic variance in the traits we measured (body mass, pronotum width and testes mass), and each trait harboured significant additive genetic variance in the standard temperature (27°C) only. In females, these three-way interactions were less important, with interactions between the paternal haplotype and rearing environment accounting for about ten per cent of the phenotypic variance (in body mass, pronotum width and ovary mass). Of the female traits measured, only ovary mass for crickets reared at the cooler temperature (23°C), exhibited significant levels of additive genetic variance. Conclusions: Our results show that the genetics underlying phenotypic expression can be complex, context-dependent and different in each of the sexes. We discuss the implications of these results, particularly in terms of the evolutionary processes that hinge on good and compatible genes models. © 2011 Nystrand et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

VL  - 64

SP  - 334-340
AB  - We introduce a global data bank on body composition of aquatic organisms that is available at http://www.thomas-brey.de/science/virtualhandbook. It covers ratios between body mass (wet, dry, ash free dry mass), body composition (protein, lipid, carbohydrate), macro-elements (C, N, P) and energy content (J).Sofar, data for 3158 different taxa (animals, plants, bacteria) were collected from 725 different sources. The principal purpose of the data bank is mining for conversion factors, as necessary in ecological studies that require a common energetic currency. The data bank can be used to explore general ecological principles, too: among all animals, carnivorous swimmers have the highest energy density, presumably an across-taxon selection for propulsion power and handling force. Plants and animals do not only differ in their C/N and C/P ratios, but these ratios change with temperature in opposite directions. In plants, C/N and C/P increase with temperature, most likely a response to the higher levels of N and P in polar waters. In animals C/N and C/P decrease with temperature, an indicator for selection towards lower activity and larger lipid stores in polar animals. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Rapid evolution in response to increased temperature maintains population viability despite genetic erosion in a tropical ectotherm
VL  - 28

SP  - 141-155
AB  - Climate change is predicted to increase the average global air temperature by up to 4.0 °C by the end of the century. This increased temperature could have negative effects on many life history traits that are closely linked to fitness. Many species will therefore have to adapt to the warmer environment, but life history traits often have limited additive genetic variance. Here, we investigated population demographics and the evolutionary response of life history traits, as well as genetic diversity in guppies (Poecilia reticulata), in response to an experimentally increased temperature. There were fewer successful pregnancies, smaller brood sizes, and males matured earlier at a higher temperature as compared to control populations. However, there was no sign of an evolutionary response in these traits after 24 months of exposure to the increased temperature. We also found that population size, brood survivorship, sex ratio, and male length at maturity were unaffected by the increased temperature. Genetic diversity decreased rapidly in the increased temperature populations at a rate equivalent to an effective population size of only one quarter of the controls, revealing a clear signature of selection in response to increased temperature. This genetic erosion, however, could hamper the adaptive potential of the populations to other environmental changes associated with climate change. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

VL  - 159

SP  - 242-246
AB  - Global climate change is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity; one of the most important effects is the increase in the mean earth surface temperature. However, another but poorly studied main characteristic of global change appears to be an increase in temperature variability. Most of the current analyses of global change have focused on mean values, paying less attention to the role of the fluctuations of environmental variables. We experimentally tested the effects of environmental temperature variability on characteristics associated to the fitness (body mass balance, growth rate, and survival), metabolic rate (VCO2) and molecular traits (heat shock protein expression, Hsp70), in an ectotherm, the terrestrial woodlouse Porcellio laevis. Our general hypotheses are that higher values of thermal amplitude may directly affect life-history traits, increasing metabolic cost and stress responses. At first, results supported our hypotheses showing a diversity of responses among characters to the experimental thermal treatments. We emphasize that knowledge about the cellular and physiological mechanisms by which animals cope with environmental changes is essential to understand the impact of mean climatic change and variability. Also, we consider that the studies that only incorporate only mean temperatures to predict the life-history, ecological and evolutionary impact of global temperature changes present important problems to predict the diversity of responses of the organism. This is because the analysis ignores the complexity and details of the molecular and physiological processes by which animals cope with environmental variability, as well as the life-history and demographic consequences of such variability.

TI  - Contemporary divergence in early life history in grayling (Thymallus thymallus)
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Following colonization of new habitats and subsequent selection, adaptation to environmental conditions might be expected to be rapid. In a mountain lake in Norway, Lesjaskogsvatnet, more than 20 distinct spawning demes of grayling have been established since the lake was colonized, some 20-25 generations ago. The demes spawn in tributaries consistently exhibiting either colder or warmer temperature conditions during spawning in spring and subsequent early development during early summer. In order to explore the degree of temperature-related divergence in early development, a multi-temperature common-garden experiment was performed on embryos from four different demes experiencing different spring temperatures. Results: Early developmental characters were measured to test if individuals from the four demes respond differently to the treatment temperatures. There was clear evidence of among-deme differences (genotype - environment interactions) in larval growth and yolk-to-body-size conversion efficiency. Under the cold treatment regime, larval growth rates were highest for individuals belonging to cold streams. Individuals from warm streams had the highest yolk-consumption rate under cold conditions. As a consequence, yolk-to-body-mass conversion efficiency was highest for cold-deme individuals under cold conditions. As we observed response parallelism between individuals from demes belonging to similar thermal groups for these traits, some of the differentiation seems likely to result from local adaptation. Conclusion: The observed differences in length at age during early larval development most likely have a genetic component, even though both directional and random processes are likely to have influenced evolutionary change in the demes under study. © 2011 Thomassen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

VL  - 5
AB  - Microbes can respond quickly to environmental disturbances through adaptation. However, processes determining the constraints on this adaptation are not well understood. One process that could affect the rate of adaptation to environmental perturbations is genetic robustness, the ability to maintain phenotype despite mutation. Genetic robustness has been theoretically linked to evolvability but rarely tested empirically using evolving populations. We used populations of the RNA bacteriophage φ6 previously characterized as differing in robustness, and passaged them through a repeated environmental disturbance: periodic 45°C heat shock. The robust populations evolved faster to withstand the disturbance, relative to the less robust (brittle) populations. The robust populations also achieved relatively greater thermotolerance by the end of the experimental evolution. Sequencing revealed that thermotolerance occurred via a key mutation in gene P5 (viral lysis protein), previously shown to be associated with heat shock survival in the virus. Whereas this identical mutation fixed in all of the independently evolving robust populations, it was absent in some brittle populations, which instead fixed a less beneficial mutation. We concluded that robust populations adapted faster to the environmental change, and more easily accessed mutations of large benefit. Our study shows that genetic robustness can play a role in determining the relative ability for microbes to adapt to changing environments. © 2014 Goldhill, Lee, Williams and Turner.

TI  - Altruism, religion, and self-enhancement in a framework of ad hoc evolutionary adaptation
SP  - 225-244
AB  - We review evolutionary explanations for three major puzzles of the human mind: altruism, religiosity, and self-enhancement. Human altruism reaches beyond reciprocity or close-kin care readily explained by game theory and genetic kin selection. Group selection is widely seen as too weak to lead to substantial altruism as it struggles to contain selfishness favored by within-group selection. Yet, reciprocity and punishment leverage the effectiveness of altruism within a group, and genuine altruism is testified to be weak, leaving scope for explanation even by a force as weak as group selection. Moralistic religious culture appears tightly linked to altruism, yet the fitness advantage of a defector within a religious society makes it difficult to conceive religion or related genetic predisposition as an evolutionarily stable strategy. Self-enhancement has direct links to altruism and religiosity, leading to warm-glow altruistic contributions and increased receptiveness to comforting narratives of heavenly justice. Suggested intrapersonal and interpersonal benefits of self-enhancement do not detail how the trait should be competitive against more direct behavioral adjustments that yield similar personal benefits but avoid the fitness costs of misperception. We explain religion and bias as imperfect ad hoc evolutionary adaptations rather than perfect evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS). The scant time available for fine-tuning the mind since the emergence of higher cognitive capabilities means near-perfect traits were unlikely to emerge. Instead, the extraordinary evolutionary pressure induced by the rapidly evolving environment favored a broad range of genetic novelties despite extra costs. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

VL  - 26
IS  - 9
SP  - 2008-2020
AB  - In Drosophila, female hydrocarbons are known to be involved in premating isolation between different species and pheromonal races. The role of male-specific hydrocarbon polymorphism is not as well documented. The dominant cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) in male D. melanogaster is usually 7-tricosene (7-T), with the exception of African populations, in which 7-pentacosene (7-P) is dominant. Here, we took advantage of a population from the Comoro Islands (Com), in which males fell on a continuum of low to high levels of 7-T, to perform temperature selection and selection on CHCs' profiles. We conducted several experiments on the selected Com males to study the plasticity of their CHCs in response to temperature shift, their role in resistance to desiccation and in sexual selection. We then compared the results obtained for selected lines to those from three common laboratory strains with different and homogenous hydrocarbon profiles: CS, Cot and Tai. Temperature selection modified the CHC profiles of the Com males in few generations of selection. We showed that the 7-P/7-T ratio depends on temperature with generally more 7-P at higher temperatures and observed a relationship between chain length and resistance to desiccation in both temperature- and phenotypically selected Com lines. There was partial sexual isolation between the flies with clear-cut phenotypes within the phenotypically selected lines and the laboratory strains. These results indicate that the dominant male pheromones are under environmental selection and may have played a role in reproductive isolation. © 2013 The Authors.

VL  - 46

AB  - Background: Loss and fragmentation of Neotropical primates’ habitat can alter the health and individual adaptation. Physiological parameters reflect health status and individuals responses to the habitat conditions. Methods: We captured six wild adult females and six adult males of Alouatta pigra to evaluate their physical condition (body mass, respiratory and heart rate, and rectal temperature), hematology and blood chemistry on fragmentation habitat condition at southeastern Mexico. Results: The males weighed more than females, but the female’ temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate were higher. Low values of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cells suggest some degree of anemia in these howler monkeys. Low levels of the total protein, albumin, albumin/globulin Ratio, and low levels of blood urea nitrogen suggest that howler monkeys could have protein and carbohydrate deficiencies. Conclusions: Howler monkeys living under the highly degraded conditions at Balancán, Tabasco, could be showing adaptability by modifying their physiology, hematology, and blood chemistry in response to the conditions of their fragmented landscape. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

TI  - Metabolic enzyme activities of abyssal and hadal fishes: pressure effects and a re-evaluation of depth-related changes
VL  - 125
SP  - 135-146
AB  - Metabolic enzyme activities of muscle tissue have been useful and widely-applied indicators of whole animal metabolic capacity, particularly in inaccessible systems such as the deep sea. Previous studies have been conducted at atmospheric pressure, regardless of organism habitat depth. However, maximum reaction rates of some of these enzymes are pressure dependent, complicating the use of metabolic enzyme activities as proxies of metabolic rates. Here, we show pressure-related rate changes in lactate and malate dehydrogenase (LDH, MDH) and pyruvate kinase (PK) in six fish species (2 hadal, 2 abyssal, 2 shallow). LDH maximal reaction rates decreased with pressure for the two shallow species, but, in contrast to previous findings, it increased for the four deep species, suggesting evolutionary changes in LDH reaction volumes. MDH maximal reaction rates increased with pressure in all species (up to 51±10% at 60 MPa), including the tide pool snailfish, Liparis florae (activity increase at 60 MPa 44±9%), suggesting an inherent negative volume change of the reaction. PK was inhibited by pressure in all species tested, including the hadal liparids (up to 34±3% at 60 MPa), suggesting a positive volume change during the reaction. The addition of 400 mM TMAO counteracted this inhibition at both 0.5 and 2.0 mM ADP concentrations for the hadal liparid, Notoliparis kermadecensis. We revisit depth-related trends in metabolic enzyme activities according to these pressure-related rate changes and new data from seven abyssal and hadal species from the Kermadec and Mariana trenches. Results show that, with abyssal and hadal species, pressure-related rate changes are another variable to be considered in the use of enzyme activities as proxies for metabolic rate, in addition to factors such as temperature and body mass. Intraspecific increases in tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes with depth of capture, independent of body mass, in two hadal snailfishes suggest improved nutritional condition for individuals deeper in the hadal zone, likely related to food availability. These new data inform the discussion of factors controlling metabolism in the deep sea, including the visual interactions hypothesis and extend published trends to the planet's deepest-living fishes. © 2017 The Authors

VL  - 7

AB  - Genetic variation evolves during postglacial range expansion of a species and is important for adapting to varied environmental conditions. It is crucial for the future survival of a species. We investigate the nuclear DNA sequence variation to provide evidence of postglacial range expansion of Musa basjoo var. formosana, a wild banana species, and test for adaptive evolution of amplified fragment length polymorphic (AFLP) loci underlying local adaptation in association with environmental variables. Postglacial range expansion was suggested by phylogeographical analyses based on sequence variation of the second intron of copper zinc superoxide dismutase 2 gene. Two glacial refugia were inferred by the average F ST parameter (mean F ST of a population against the remaining populations). Using variation partitioning by redundancy analysis, we found a significant amount of explained AFLP variation attributed to environmental and spatially-structured environmental effects. By combining genome scan methods and multiple univariate logistic regression, four AFLP loci were found to be strongly associated with environmental variables, including temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, wet days, and surface coverage activity representing vegetation greenness. These environmental variables may have played various roles as ecological drivers for adaptive evolution of M. basjoo var. formosana during range expansion after the last glacial maximum. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - In variable environments, selection should favor generalists that maintain fitness across a range of conditions. However, costs of adaptation may generate fitness trade-offs and lead to some compromise between specialization and generalization that maximizes fitness. Here, we evaluate the evolution of specialization and generalization in 20 populations of Drosophila melanogaster experimentally evolved in constant and variable thermal environments for 3 years. We developed genotypes from each population at two temperatures after which we measured fecundity across eight temperatures. We predicted that constant environments would select for thermal specialists and that variable environments would select for thermal generalists. Contrary to our predictions, specialists and generalists did not evolve in constant and spatially variable environments, respectively. However, temporal variation produced a type of generalist that has rarely been considered by theoretical models of developmental plasticity. Specifically, genotypes from the temporally variable selective environment were more fecund across all temperatures than were genotypes from other environments. These patterns suggest certain allelic effects and should inspire new directions for modeling adaptation to fluctuating environments. © 2013 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

AB  - Changes in the environment are expected to induce changes in the quantitative genetic variation, which influences the ability of a population to adapt to environmental change. Furthermore, environmental changes are not constant in time, but fluctuate. Here, we investigate the effect of rapid, continuous and/or fluctuating temperature changes in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, using an evolution experiment followed by a split-brood experiment. In line with expectations, individuals responded in a plastic way and had an overall higher potential to respond to selection after a rapid change in the environment. After selection in an environment with increasing temperature, plasticity remained unchanged (or decreased) and environmental variation decreased, especially when fluctuations were added; these results were unexpected. As expected, the genetic variation decreased after fluctuating selection. Our results suggest that fluctuations in the environment have major impact on the response of a population to environmental change; in a highly variable environment with low predictability, a plastic response might not be beneficial and the response is genetically and environmentally canalized resulting in a low potential to respond to selection and low environmental sensitivity. Interestingly, we found greater variation for phenotypic plasticity after selection, suggesting that the potential for plasticity to evolve is facilitated after exposure to environmental fluctuations. Our study highlights that environmental fluctuations should be considered when investigating the response of a population to environmental change. © 2012 The Authors.

VL  - 6

AB  - Disasters happen with increasing frequency, resulting in greater devastation, due to global warming. This happens all over the world, particularly in the Global South. Risk reduction and adaptation to climate change are vital strategies for ensuring safety, wellbeing, and perhaps survival, for millions of people. Decades of studies in the social sciences have led to the realization that disasters are more a product of structural inequality, and socially constructed vulnerability, than they are purely “natural” hazards. This is particularly evident when it comes to the age-old disaster of famine. While this suggests that risk reduction and adaptation strategies must be fused with radical politics, the United Nations’ joint policy concept of disaster risk reduction/climate change adaptation nevertheless seems firmly tied to the hegemonic world order of capitalist modernity. An alternative solution to climate change disasters would be a more radical, revolutionary set of projects, that I term radical risk reduction and revolutionary adaptation. © 2013 Institute for Human Geography.

TI  - Molecular structure of lipopolysaccharides of cold-adapted bacteria
SP  - 285-303
AB  - Cold-adapted Gram-negative bacteria inhabit snow, ice water, and frozen grounds and are perfectly adapted to live at very low temperatures. They have evolved several adaptation strategies, some of which concern the cellular membrane. Bacterial outer membrane, that functions as a selective barrier allowing the influx of nutrients and confers protection to the cell, is also considered a primary sensor of the cold. It is well known that one of the main responses to cold concerning the cell membrane is the increment of fluidity and the upregulation of genes encoding for proteins and membrane transporters. In this context, also the lipopolysaccharides, macromolecules constituting approximately 75% of the outer surface, may be modified in their structure in response to the conditions prevailing in the environment. In this chapter, for the first time, the role played by lipopolysaccharides structures in response to cold adaptation is analyzed. Some structural features of the lipopolysaccharides are modified as a consequence of living at low temperatures, thus confirming that all the outer membrane components are involved in adaptation and survival molecular mechanisms.

AB  - Salinity tolerance, energy metabolism, buoyancy, and passive sinking and swimming speeds have been studied for comparative assessment of the adaptive potential of two species of cyclopoid copepods in the Black Sea, the native Oithona similis and new invader Oithona davisae. Both species were considered marine euryhaline copepods, but the range of salinity tolerance of O. davisae was much broader (5–55‰). The energy metabolism, locomotor activity, mean body mass density, and speed of passive sinking at the same temperature were significantly higher in O. davisae than in O. similis. The relationship between the physiological and behavioral parameters and ecological characteristics of the species are discussed. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

TI  - Potential for adaptive evolution at species range margins: Contrasting interactions between red coral populations and their environment in a changing ocean
VL  - 5
IS  - 6
SP  - 1178-1192
AB  - Studying population-by-environment interactions (PEIs) at species range margins offers the opportunity to characterize the responses of populations facing an extreme regime of selection, as expected due to global change. Nevertheless, the importance of these marginal populations as putative reservoirs of adaptive genetic variation has scarcely been considered in conservation biology. This is particularly true in marine ecosystems for which the deep refugia hypothesis proposes that disturbed shallow and marginal populations of a given species can be replenished by mesophotic ones. This hypothesis therefore assumes that identical PEIs exist between populations, neglecting the potential for adaptation at species range margins. Here, we combine reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments with population genetics analyses to decipher the PEIs in the red coral, Corallium rubrum. Our analyses reveal partially contrasting PEIs between shallow and mesophotic populations separated by approximately one hundred meters, suggesting that red coral populations may potentially be locally adapted to their environment. Based on the effective population size and connectivity analyses, we posit that genetic drift may be more important than gene flow in the adaptation of the red coral. We further investigate how adaptive divergence could impact population viability in the context of warming and demonstrate differential phenotypic buffering capacities against thermal stress. Our study questions the relevance of the deep refugia hypothesis and highlights the conservation value of marginal populations as a putative reservoir of adaptive genetic polymorphism. In marine conservation, the deep-refugia hypothesis proposes that disturbed shallow and marginal populations of a given species can be replenished by mesophotic populations. Combining reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments with population genetics analyses we question the relevance of this hypothesis in the red coral, Corallium rubrum. Our study highlights the conservation value of marginal populations as a putative reservoir of adaptive genetic polymorphism. © 2015 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Systematics, functional morphology and distribution of a bivalve (Apachecorbula muriatica gen. et sp. nov.) from the rim of the 'Valdivia Deep' brine pool in the Red Sea
VL  - 95
IS  - 3
SP  - 523-535
AB  - The deep brine pools of the Red Sea comprise extreme, inhospitable habitats yet house microbial communities that potentially may fuel adjacent fauna. We here describe a novel bivalve from a deep-sea (1525 m) brine pool in the Red Sea, where conditions of high salinity, lowered pH, partial anoxia and high temperatures are prevalent. Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) footage showed that the bivalves were present in a narrow (20 cm) band along the rim of the brine pool, suggesting that it is not only tolerant of such extreme conditions but is also limited to them. The bivalve is a member of the Corbulidae and named Apachecorbula muriatica gen. et sp. nov. The shell is atypical of the family in being modioliform and thin. The semi-infaunal habit is seen in ROV images and reflected in the anatomy by the lack of siphons. The ctenidia are large and typical of a suspension feeding bivalve, but the absence of 'guard cilia' and the greatly reduced labial palps suggest that it is non-selective as a response to low food availability. It is proposed that the low body mass observed is a consequence of the extreme habitat and low food availability. It is postulated that the observed morphology of Apachecorbula is a result of paedomorphosis driven by the effects of the extreme environment on growth but is in part mitigated by the absence of high predation pressures. © Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 2014.

VL  - 169

SP  - 353-360
AB  - For most ectotherms, increasing the rearing temperature reduces the final (adult) body size, producing a negative slope for the thermal reaction norm. Recent studies show that this relationship may be reversed under conditions of low resource quality, producing a positive slope for the thermal reaction norm. If populations or species differ in the degree of evolutionary adaptation to a resource, how does this differential adaptation alter their thermal reaction norms? We used a common garden experiment with the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, to address this question. We examined the thermal reaction norms for body size of two populations of M. sexta that differ in their evolutionary exposures to an atypical, low-quality resource (devil's claw; Proboscidea louisianica), but have comparable exposures to a typical, high-quality resource (tobacco; Nicotiana tabacum). Both populations had increased mean larval mortalities and development times when reared on devil's claw compared with tobacco, but the magnitudes of these increases differed between populations. Both populations had similar, negatively sloped thermal reaction norms on the typical, high-quality resource (tobacco), but had divergent, non-negative thermal reaction norms on the atypical, low-quality resource (devil's claw): the population with the longer evolutionary history of exposure to the atypical resource exhibited a flat (rather than positive) reaction norm. These results suggest that population differences in host plant adaptation can predictably influence the slopes of thermal reaction norms. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Environmental fluctuations can select for generalism, which is also hypothesized to increase organisms' ability to invade novel environments. Here, we show that across a range of temperatures, opportunistic bacterial pathogen Serratia marcescens that evolved in fluctuating temperature (daily variation between 24°C and 38°C, mean 31°C) outperforms the strains that evolved in constant temperature (31°C). The growth advantage was also evident in novel environments in the presence of parasitic viruses and predatory protozoans, but less clear in the presence of stressful chemicals. Adaptation to fluctuating temperature also led to reduced virulence in Drosophila melanogaster host, which suggests that generalism can still be costly in terms of reduced fitness in other ecological contexts. While supporting the hypothesis that evolution of generalism is coupled with tolerance to several novel environments, our results also suggest that thermal fluctuations driven by the climate change could affect both species' invasiveness and virulence. © 2013 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

TI  - Extreme temperatures in the adult stage shape delayed effects of larval pesticide stress: A comparison between latitudes
VL  - 148
SP  - 74-82
AB  - Global warming and pesticide pollution are major threats for aquatic biodiversity. Yet, how pesticide effects are influenced by the increased frequency of extreme temperatures under global warming and how local thermal adaptation may mitigate these effects is unknown. We therefore investigated the combined impact of larval chlorpyrifos exposure, larval food stress and adult heat exposure on a set of fitness-related traits in replicated low- and high-latitude populations of the damselfly Ischnura elegans. Larval pesticide exposure resulted in lighter adults with a higher water content, lower fat content, higher Hsp70 levels and a lower immune function (PO activity). Heat exposure reduced water content, mass, fat content and flying ability. Importantly, both stressors interacted across metamorphosis: adult heat exposure lowered the reduction of fat content, and generated a stronger decrease in PO activity in pesticide-exposed animals. Larval pesticide exposure and larval food stress also reduced the defense response to the adult heat stress in terms of increased Hsp70 levels. In line with strong life history differences in the unstressed control situation, high-latitude animals were less sensitive to food stress (body mass and water content), but more sensitive to pesticide stress (development time and PO activity) and heat exposure (PO activity and Hsp70 levels). While low-latitude adults could better withstand the extreme temperature as suggested by the weaker increase in Hsp70, heat exposure similarly affected the delayed effects of larval pesticide exposure at both latitudes. Our study highlighted two key findings relevant for ecological risk assessment under global warming. Firstly, the delayed effects of larval pesticide exposure on adult damselflies depended upon subsequent adult heat exposure, indicating that larval pesticide stress and adult heat stress interacted across metamorphosis. Secondly, low- and high-latitude animals responded differently to the imposed stressors, highlighting that intraspecific evolution along natural thermal gradients may shape sensitivity to pesticides.

VL  - 259

AB  - Forecasts of rapid climate change raise the question how quickly species can evolutionarily adapt to future climates. The adaptability of forest trees to environmental changes is generally promoted by high levels of genetic diversity and gene flow, but it can also be slowed down by long generation times and low mortality of established trees. Here, we investigate the adaptation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Silver birch (Betula pendula) to climate change induced prolongation of the thermal growing season. We use quantitative genetic individual-based simulations to disentangle the relative roles of mortality, dispersal ability and maturation age for the speed of adaptation. The simulations predict that after 100 years of climate change, the genotypic growth period length of both species will lag more than 50% behind the climatically determined optimum. This lag is reduced by increased mortality of established trees, whereas earlier maturation and higher dispersal ability had comparatively minor effects. The evolutionary lag behind environmental change shown in our simulations stresses the importance of accounting for evolutionary processes in forecasts of the future dynamics and productivity of forests. Sensitivity of the adaptation speed to mortality suggests that species experiencing high mortality rates as well as populations subject to regular disturbances such as storms or fires might be the quickest to adapt to a warming climate.

VL  - 181

SP  - 607-619
AB  - Current climate change affects the competitive ability and reproductive success of many species, leading to local extinctions, adjustment to novel local conditions by phenotypic plasticity or rapid adaptation, or tracking their optima through range shifts. However, many species have limited ability to expand to suitable areas. Altitudinal gradients, with abrupt changes in abiotic conditions over short distances, represent “natural experiments” for the evaluation of ecological and evolutionary responses under scenarios of climate change. Nothofagus pumilio is the tree species which dominates as pure stands the montane forests of Patagonia. We evaluated the adaptive value of variation in quantitative traits of N. pumilio under contrasting conditions of the altitudinal gradient with a long-term reciprocal transplant experimental design. While high-elevation plants show little response in plant, leaf, and phenological traits to the experimental trials, low-elevation ones show greater plasticity in their responses to changing environments, particularly at high elevation. Our results suggest a relatively reduced potential for evolutionary adaptation of high-elevation genotypes, and a greater evolutionary potential of low-elevation ones. Under global warming scenarios of forest upslope migration, high-elevation variants may be outperformed by low-elevation ones during this process, leading to the local extinction and/or replacement of these genotypes. These results challenge previous models and predictions expected under global warming for altitudinal gradients, on which the leading edge is considered to be the upper treeline forests. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Higher rates of sex evolve during adaptation to more complex environments
VL  - 114
IS  - 3
SP  - 534-539
AB  - A leading hypothesis for the evolutionary maintenance of sexual reproduction proposes that sex is advantageous because it facilitates adaptation. Changes in the environment stimulate adaptation but not all changes are equivalent; a change may occur along one or multiple environmental dimensions. In two evolution experiments with the facultatively sexual rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus, we test how environmental complexity affects the evolution of sex by adapting replicate populations to various environments that differ from the original along one, two, or three environmental dimensions. Three different estimates of fitness (growth, lifetime reproduction, and population density) confirmed that populations adapted to their new environment. Growth measures revealed an intriguing cost of complex adaptations: populations that adapted to more complex environments lost greater amounts of fitness in the original environment. Furthermore, both experiments showed that B. calyciflorus became more sexual when adapting to a greater number of environmental dimensions. Common garden experiments confirmed that observed changes in sex were heritable. As environments in nature are inherently complex these findings help explain why sex is maintained in natural populations.

AB  - Rapid evolution has rarely been assessed in biological control systems despite the similarity with biological invasions, which are widely used as model systems. We assessed post-introduction climatic adaptation in a population of Longitarsus jacobaeae, a biological control agent of Jacobaea vulgaris, which originated from a low-elevation site in Italy and was introduced in the USA to a high-elevation site (Mt. Hood, Oregon) in the early 1980s. Life-history characteristics of beetle populations from Mt. Hood, from two low-elevation sites in Oregon (Italian origin) and from a high-elevation site from Switzerland were compared in common gardens. The performance of low- and high-elevation populations at a low- and a high-elevation site was evaluated using reciprocal transplants. The results revealed significant changes in aestival diapause and shifts in phenology in the Mt. Hood population, compared with the low-elevation populations. We found increased performance of the Mt. Hood population in its home environment compared with the low-elevation populations that it originated from. The results indicate that the beetles at Mt. Hood have adapted to the cooler conditions by life-history changes that conform to predictions based on theory and the phenology of the cold-adapted Swiss beetles. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Effects of basin-forming impacts on the thermal evolution and magnetic field of Mars
VL  - 478
SP  - 192-202
AB  - The youngest of the giant impact basins on Mars are either weakly magnetized or completely demagnetized, indicating that a global magnetic field was not present at the time those basins formed. Eight basins are sufficiently large that the impact heating associated with their formation could have penetrated below the core-mantle boundary (CMB). Here we investigate the thermal evolution of the martian interior and the fate of the global magnetic field using 3D mantle convection models coupled to a parameterized 1D core thermal evolution model. We find that the survival of the impact-induced temperature anomalies in the upper mantle is strongly controlled by the mantle viscosity. Impact heating from subsequent impacts can accumulate in stiffer mantles faster than it can be advected away, resulting in a thermal blanket that insulates an entire hemisphere. The impact heating in the core will halt dynamo activity, at least temporarily. If the mantle is initially cold, and the core initially superheated, dynamo activity may resume as quickly as a few Myr after each impact. However unless the lower mantle has either a low viscosity or a high thermal conductivity, this restored dynamo will last for only a few hundred Myr after the end of the sequence of impacts. Thus, we find that the longevity of the magnetic field is more strongly controlled by the lower mantle properties and relatively insensitive to the impact induced temperature anomalies in the upper mantle.

AB  - Preservation of diatoms in sediments of the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean through geological time has been highly variable. The North Atlantic Ocean and the Nordic Seas were a region of high productivity of biogenic silica until the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciations during the late Miocene. Later, fluctuating Pleistocene climatic conditions had a major impact on diatom productivity in the high-latitude North Atlantic. During interglacials, high diatom productivity took place in the North Atlantic, whereas glacial stages are often barren of diatoms due to the expansion of sea-ice cover. Diatom species show rapid evolution through time and therefore are an excellent biostratigraphic tool in this area. The high diversity of diatoms in polar and Arctic environments also makes them one of the foremost tools available for paleoclimatic reconstructions. They have been used for inferences of the former positions of the sea-ice margin and oceanic fronts, as well as for inferring the distribution of water masses and to provide quantitative estimates of past sea-surface temperatures (SSTs). These SST estimates are particularly being exploited for reconstructing the regional surface ocean conditions during the Holocene. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Genetic architecture of metabolic rate: Environment specific epistasis between mitochondrial and nuclear genes in an insect
VL  - 64
IS  - 12
SP  - 3354-3363
AB  - The extent to which mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation is involved in adaptive evolutionary change is currently being reevaluated. In particular, emerging evidence suggests that mtDNA genes coevolve with the nuclear genes with which they interact to form the energy producing enzyme complexes in the mitochondria. This suggests that intergenomic epistasis between mitochondrial and nuclear genes may affect whole-organism metabolic phenotypes. Here, we use crossed combinations of mitochondrial and nuclear lineages of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus and assay metabolic rate under two different temperature regimes. Metabolic rate was affected by an interaction between the mitochondrial and nuclear lineages and the temperature regime. Sequence data suggests that mitochondrial genetic variation has a role in determining the outcome of this interaction. Our genetic dissection of metabolic rate reveals a high level of complexity, encompassing genetic interactions over two genomes, and genotype × genotype × environment interactions. The evolutionary implications of these results are twofold. First, because metabolic rate is at the root of life histories, our results provide insights into the complexity of life-history evolution in general, and thermal adaptation in particular. Second, our results suggest a mechanism that could contribute to the maintenance of nonneutral mtDNA polymorphism. © 2010 The Author(s). Evolution © 2010 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

VL  - 65

AB  - A changing climate is expected to have profound effects on many aspects of ectotherm biology. We report on a decade-long study of free-ranging sand lizards (Lacerta agilis), exposed to an increasing mean mating season temperature and with known operational sex ratios. We assessed year-to-year variation in sexual selection on body size and postcopulatory sperm competition and cryptic female choice. Higher temperature was not linked to strength of sexual selection on body mass, but operational sex ratio (more males) did increase the strength of sexual selection on body size. Elevated temperature increased mating rate and number of sires per clutch with positive effects on offspring fitness. In years when the "quality" of a female's partners was more variable (in standard errors of a male sexual ornament), clutches showed less multiple paternity. This agrees with prior laboratory trials in which females exercised stronger cryptic female choice when male quality varied more. An increased number of sires contributing to within-clutch paternity decreased the risk of having malformed offspring. Ultimately, such variation may contribute to highly dynamic and shifting selection mosaics in the wild, with potential implications for the evolutionary ecology of mating systems and population responses to rapidly changing environmental conditions. © 2010 The Author(s).

VL  - 214
IS  - 10
SP  - 1740-1747
AB  - Sperm count evolution is driven by sexual selection, with an added role of selection on gamete resource allocation for hermaphrodite spermatogenesis. However, self-fertilization by hermaphrodites retards sexual selection and results in the evolution of reduced investment in sperm or pollen. In contrast to reproduction limited by female gametes (Bateman's Principle), self-fertilizing Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites exhibit sperm-limited reproduction. Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites are thought to experience a fitness trade-off between lifetime fecundity and generation time: Longer sperm production decreases the risk of self-sperm depletion, but at the same time delays the onset of selfing and thus increases egg-toegg generation time. Theory predicts that shorter larval development will favor lower sperm counts and longer development will favor more sperm. To investigate how developmental trajectories affect the evolution of sperm production, we performed experimental evolution by directly competing alleles controlling hermaphrodite sperm count, conducted under different environmental conditions that alter development time. Results are partially consistent with theory: Rapid larval development generally favored alleles encoding production of few sperm. However, we identify some previously unrecognized simplifications of the theory and its application to our experimental system. In addition, we evaluated the generality of sperm limitation in C. elegans. Although optimal growth conditions yield sperm limitation, non-optimal conditions induce oocyte limitation, suggesting that this species might conform to Bateman's Principle under many natural settings. These findings demonstrate how developmental trajectories can shape the fitness landscape for the evolution of reproduction and sperm traits, even without sexual selection. © 2011.

VL  - 11

AB  - Genomic time series data generated by evolve-and-resequence (E&R) experiments offer a powerful window into the mechanisms that drive evolution. However, standard population genetic inference procedures do not account for sampling serially over time, and new methods are needed to make full use of modern experimental evolution data. To address this problem, we develop a Gaussian process approximation to the multi-locus Wright-Fisher process with selection over a time course of tens of generations. The mean and covariance structure of the Gaussian process are obtained by computing the corresponding moments in discrete-time Wright-Fisher models conditioned on the presence of a linked selected site. This enables our method to account for the effects of linkage and selection, both along the genome and across sampled time points, in an approximate but principled manner. We first use simulated data to demonstrate the power of our method to correctly detect, locate and estimate the fitness of a selected allele from among several linked sites. We study how this power changes for different values of selection strength, initial haplotypic diversity, population size, sampling frequency, experimental duration, number of replicates, and sequencing coverage depth. In addition to providing quantitative estimates of selection parameters from experimental evolution data, our model can be used by practitioners to design E&R experiments with requisite power. We also explore how our likelihood-based approach can be used to infer other model parameters, including effective population size and recombination rate. Then, we apply our method to analyze genome-wide data from a real E&R experiment designed to study the adaptation of D. melanogaster to a new laboratory environment with alternating cold and hot temperatures. © 2015 Terhorst et al.

AB  - We analyzed a mathematical model of in vitro evolution conducted by repetition of mutagenesis and selection processes. The selection process consists of the selective enrichment and subsequent sampling as follows: each mutant with fitness W is amplified by the Boltzmann factor exp(rW/k(B)T(the)), where the fitness W is defined as the negative Gibbs free energy (-Delta G) in a reaction of the phenotypic molecules and r is the round number of the selective enrichment; then, an arbitrary mutant is randomly chosen from the resulting mutant population and it becomes a new parent in the next generation. As a result, we found that the evolutionary dynamics is described in a mathematical framework similar to thermodynamics: the "evolution constant" k(E) and "evolutionary temperature" T-evo play key roles similar to the Boltzmann constant k(B) and thermodynamic temperature T-the, respectively. In the stationary state of the evolutionary dynamics, the attractor of the fitness is in inverse proportion to k(E)T(evo). Furthermore, beyond the mathematical analogy, we obtained a biophysical connection between evolutionary dynamics and thermodynamics. Particularly, we found that T-evo and T-the are connected by k(E)T(evo) approximate to k(B)T(the)/2r. These results suggest that we can predict the fitness value in the stationary state by the thermodynamic temperature T-the in the experimental setup. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 28
IS  - 6
SP  - 1482-1493
AB  - Our study addresses the role of non-genetic and genetic inheritance in shaping the adaptive potential of populations under a warming ocean scenario. We used a combined experimental approach [transgenerational plasticity (TGP) and quantitative genetics] to partition the relative contribution of maternal vs. paternal (additive genetic) effects to offspring body size (a key component of fitness), and investigated a potential physiological mechanism (mitochondrial respiration capacities) underlying whole-organism growth/size responses. In very early stages of growth (up to 30 days), offspring body size of marine sticklebacks benefited from maternal TGP: offspring of mothers acclimated to 17 °C were larger when reared at 17 °C, and offspring of mothers acclimated to 21 °C were larger when reared at 21 °C. The benefits of maternal TGP on body size were stronger and persisted longer (up to 60 days) for offspring reared in the warmer (21 °C) environment, suggesting that maternal effects will be highly relevant for climate change scenarios in this system. Mitochondrial respiration capacities measured on mature offspring (F1 adults) matched the pattern of TGP for juvenile body size, providing an intuitive mechanistic basis for the maternal acclimation persisting into adulthood. Size differences between temperatures seen at early growth stages remained in the F1 adults, linking offspring body size to maternal inheritance of mitochondria. Lower maternal variance components in the warmer environment were mostly driven by mothers acclimated to ambient (colder) conditions, further supporting our tenet that maternal effects were stronger at elevated temperature. Importantly, all parent-offspring temperature combination groups showed genotype × environment (G × E) interactions, suggesting that reaction norms have the potential to evolve. To summarize, TGP and G × E interactions work in concert to mediate impacts of ocean warming on metabolic capacity and early growth of marine sticklebacks. TGP can buffer short-term detrimental effects of climate warming and may buy time for genetic adaptation to catch up, therefore markedly contributing to the evolutionary potential and persistence of populations under climate change. © 2014 British Ecological Society.

VL  - 70
IS  - 2
SP  - 456-464
AB  - Tropical and subtropical species represent the majority of biodiversity. These species are predicted to lack the capacity to evolve higher thermal limits in response to selection imposed by climatic change. However, these assessments have relied on indirect estimates of adaptive capacity, using conditions that do not reflect environmental changes projected under climate change. Using a paternal half-sib full-sib breeding design, we estimated the additive genetic variance and narrow-sense heritability for adult upper thermal limits in two rainforest-restricted species of Drosophila reared under two thermal regimes, reflecting increases in seasonal temperature projected for the Wet Tropics of Australia and under standard laboratory conditions (constant 25°C). Estimates of additive genetic variation and narrow-sense heritability for adult heat tolerance were significantly different from zero in both species under projected summer, but not winter or constant, thermal regimes. In contrast, significant broad-sense genetic variation was apparent in all thermal regimes for egg-to-adult viability. Environment-dependent changes in the expression of genetic variation for adult upper thermal limits suggest that predicting adaptive responses to climate change will be difficult. Estimating adaptive capacity under conditions that do not reflect future environmental conditions may provide limited insight into evolutionary responses to climate change. © 2016, Society for the Study of Evolution.

TI  - Winter wren populations show adaptation to local climate
VL  - 3
IS  - 6
AB  - Most studies of evolutionary responses to climate change have focused on phenological responses to warming, and provide only weak evidence for evolutionary adaptation. This could be because phenological changes are more weakly linked to fitness than more direct mechanisms of climate change impacts, such as selective mortality during extreme weather events which have immediate fitness consequences for the individuals involved. Studies examining these other mechanisms may be more likely to show evidence for evolutionary adaptation. To test this, we quantify regional population responses of a small resident passerine (winter wren Troglodytes troglodytes) to a measure of winter severity (number of frost days). Annual population growth rate was consistently negatively correlated with this measure, but the point at which different populations achieved stability (λ = 1) varied across regions and was closely correlated with the historic average number of frost days, providing strong evidence for local adaptation. Despite this, regional variation in abundance remained negatively related to the regional mean number of winter frost days, potentially as a result of a time-lag in the rate of evolutionary response to climate change. As expected from Bergmann's rule, individual wrens were heavier in colder regions, suggesting that local adaptation may be mediated through body size. However, there was no evidence for selective mortality of small individuals in cold years, with annual variation in mean body size uncorrelated with the number of winter frost days, so the extent to which local adaptation occurs through changes in body size, or another mechanism remains uncertain. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Rapid evolution of larval life history, adult immune function and flight muscles in a poleward-moving damselfly
VL  - 27
IS  - 1
SP  - 141-152
AB  - Although a growing number of studies have documented the evolution of adult dispersal-related traits at the range edge of poleward-expanding species, we know little about evolutionary changes in immune function or traits expressed by nondispersing larvae. We investigated differentiation in larval (growth and development) and adult traits (immune function and flight-related traits) between replicated core and edge populations of the poleward-moving damselfly Coenagrion scitulum. These traits were measured on individuals reared in a common garden experiment at two different food levels, as allocation trade-offs may be easier to detect under energy shortage. Edge individuals had a faster larval life history (growth and development rates), a higher adult immune function and a nearly significant higher relative flight muscle mass. Most of the differentiation between core and edge populations remained and edge populations had a higher relative flight muscle mass when corrected for latitude-specific thermal regimes, and hence could likely be attributed to the range expansion process per se. We here for the first time document a higher immune function in individuals at the expansion front of a poleward-expanding species and documented the rarely investigated evolution of faster life histories during range expansion. The rapid multivariate evolution in these ecological relevant traits between edge and core populations is expected to translate into changed ecological interactions and therefore has the potential to generate novel eco-evolutionary dynamics at the expansion front. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Body temperature, thermal dependence of locomotor performance, compensatory growth, and the immunity of hatchling red-eared turtles and Chinese pond turtles
VL  - 36
IS  - 21
SP  - 7014-7022
AB  - Invasion by alien species has become a major problem that threatens the security of our ecological environment. It is one of the three major environmental problems in the world today. Preventing alien invasions has become a focus for both government and public sectors, and a focal topic within academic circles. Of the many of invasive species, the Red-eared turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) poses a particularly serious threat. As one of the 100 most dangerous invasive species in the world, Red-eared turtles have caused irreversible effects on the ecosystems they invade. Previous studies have shown that the Red-eared turtle is able to cause such extensive damage because of its ability to adapt to its environment. Some of their physiological and behavioral indicators show an advantage, but there is still insufficient data to explain their competitive advantage overall. This paper examines the body temperature, dependence of locomotion on temperature, compensatory growth, and the immunity of hatchling Red-eared turtles and Chinese pond turtles (Chinemys reevesii). We found that Red-eared turtles could significantly influence the thermoregulatory behavior of the Chinese pond turtle. The Redeared turtle exhibited a wider range of body temperatures and thermal tolerance, better locomotor performance, and innate immunity in comparison to its counterpart; indicating a more stable compensatory growth mechanism. When exposed to a thermal gradient, Red-eared turtles that were bred together with Chinese pond turtles selected lower body temperatures and had larger coefficient of variation of body temperatures than those bred separately. The upper (CTMax) and lower (CTMin) limits of thermal tolerance were 41. 2 °C and 3. 6 °C for the Red-eared turtle, and 37. 2 °C and 4. 5 °C for the Chinese pond turtle, respectively. We therefore concluded that Red-eared turtles have an advantage in the thermal resource competition in a polyculture environment. The locomotor performance of the two species was measured when the body temperature was held at three different levels: 20, 28 °C and 36 °C. Sprint speed and maximal distance increased with body temperature of both species and the locomotor performance of the Red-eared turtle was better than that of the Chinese pond turtle when compared at the same body temperature. Therefore, the Red-eared turtle exhibited better movement potential and likely has more advantages in the field during competition for food and predator evasion. Compensatory growth was observed in the two turtles following starvation. The change in body mass of the two species increased evenly under the five-day starvation treatment. Body mass increased more rapidly in the Red-eared turtle than in the Chinese pond turtle when subjected to the 10-day-long starvation treatment and more slowly when under the 15-day starvation treatment. The coefficient of variation for body mass was larger in the Chinese pond turtle than in the Red-eared turtle. Both species showed immunoreactivity to phytohemagglutinin; with the immunoreactivity of the Red-eared turtle taking six hours to reach its maximum level-significantly faster than that of the Chinese pond turtle. These results indicate that the Red-eared turtle can adapt to new environments quickly and therefore threaten the native turtles as an alien species. This adaption could be ascribed to the potential advantages in their locomotor and physiological characteristics. © 2016 Ecological Society of China. All rights reserved.

TI  - Does selection on increased cold tolerance in the adult stage confer resistance throughout development?
VL  - 25
IS  - 8
SP  - 1650-1657
AB  - Artificial selection is a powerful approach to unravel constraints on genetic adaptation. Although it has been frequently used to reveal genetic trade-offs among different fitness-related traits, only a few studies have targeted genetic correlations across developmental stages. Here, we test whether selection on increased cold tolerance in the adult stage increases cold resistance throughout ontogeny in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. We used lines selected for decreased chill-coma recovery time and corresponding controls, which had originally been set up from three levels of inbreeding (outbred control, one or two full-sib matings). Four generations after having terminated selection, a response to selection was found in 1-day-old butterflies (the age at which selection took place). Older adults showed a very similar although weaker response. Nevertheless, cold resistance did not increase in either egg, larval or pupal stage in the selection lines but was even lower compared to control lines for eggs and young larvae. These findings suggest a cost of increased adult cold tolerance, presumably reducing resource availability for offspring provisioning and thereby stress tolerance during development, which may substantially affect evolutionary trajectories. © 2012 The Authors.

VL  - 19

AB  - Based on the sensitivity of species to ongoing climate change, and numerous challenges they face tracking suitable conditions, there is growing interest in species' capacity to adapt to climatic stress. Here, we develop and apply a new generic modelling approach (AdaptR) that incorporates adaptive capacity through physiological limits, phenotypic plasticity, evolutionary adaptation and dispersal into a species distribution modelling framework. Using AdaptR to predict change in the distribution of 17 species of Australian fruit flies (Drosophilidae), we show that accounting for adaptive capacity reduces projected range losses by up to 33% by 2105. We identify where local adaptation is likely to occur and apply sensitivity analyses to identify the critical factors of interest when parameters are uncertain. Our study suggests some species could be less vulnerable than previously thought, and indicates that spatiotemporal adaptive models could help improve management interventions that support increased species' resilience to climate change. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS

TI  - Adaptive evolution of duplicated hsp17 genes in wild barley from microclimatically divergent sites of Israel
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SP  - 1220-1232
AB  - Gene duplication is a major evolutionary driving force for establishing new gene functions. However, very little is known about the involvement of the structural divergence of recent duplicated genes in local adaptation. We evaluated the nucleotide variation of recent duplicated pair copies of the hsp17 locus for small heat shock proteins, namely, the older copy hsp17a and the younger copy hsp17b. Forty wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum) genotypes from 7 climatically divergent sites of "Evolution Canyon" I, Mount Carmel, Israel, were investigated for the sequence diversity of their hsp17 copies. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the hsp17 locus and found 150 SNPs of hsp17a and 135 SNPs of hsp17b in the coding region. Total amino acid substitutions were present at 43 positions of hsp17a and 35 positions of hsp17b among the 7 populations. The genetic divergence and haplotype diversity were significantly different among the populations. The diversity was also correlated with microclimatic interslope divergence factors in the canyon. The natural microclimatic selection appears to adaptively diversify the duplicated copies of hsp17 of wild barley between the opposite warmer and cooler slopes, suggesting that the recent duplication of stress-responsive genes were subjected to adaptive evolution. The gene duplication and the resulting functional divergence enable plants to have better fitness in local climate change. © FUNPEC-RP.

VL  - 75

AB  - High variability of cells size is used selectively for reproduction of working bees and drones. A decrease in both distance between cells and cells size themselves causes similar effects to body mass and morphometric traits of developing individuals. Adaptation of honey bees to living in shelters has led to their becoming tolerant to hypoxia. Improvement of ethological and physiological mechanisms of thermal regulation is associated with limitation of ecological valence and acquiring of stenothermic features by breed. Optimal thermal conditions for breed are limited by the interval 33-34.5 degrees C. Deviations of temperature by 3-4 degrees C beyond this range have minimum lethal effect at embryonic stage of development and medium effect at the stage of pre-pupa and pupa. Developing at the low bound of the vital range leads to increasing, while developing at the upper bound--to decreasing of body mass, mandibular and hypopharyngeal glands, as well as other organs, which, later, affects the variability of these traits during the adult stage of development. Eliminative and teratogenic efficiency of ecological factors that affect a breed is most often manifested in underdevelopment of wings. However, their size (in case of wing laminas formation). is characterized by relatively low variability and size-dependent asymmetry. Asymmetry variability of wings and other pair organs is expressed through realignment of size excess from right- to left-side one with respect to their increase. Selective elimination by those traits whose emerging probability increases as developmental conditions deviate from the optimal ones promotes restrictions on individual variability. Physiological mechanisms that facilitate adaptability enhancement under conditions of increasing anthropogenic contamination of eivironment and trophic substrates consumed by honey bees, arrear to be toxicants accumulation in rectum and crops' ability to absorb contaminants from nectar in course of its processing to honey.

TI  - Conversion of the chill susceptible fruit fly larva (Drosophila melanogaster) to a freeze tolerant organism
VL  - 109
IS  - 9
SP  - 3270-3274
AB  - Among vertebrates, only a few species of amphibians and reptiles tolerate the formation of ice crystals in their body fluids. Freeze tolerance is much more widespread in invertebrates, especially in overwintering insects. Evolutionary adaptations for freeze tolerance are considered to be highly complex. Here we show that surprisingly simple laboratory manipulations can change the chill susceptible insect to the freeze tolerant one. Larvae of Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly of tropical origin with a weak innate capacity to tolerate mild chilling, can survive when approximately 50% of their body water freezes. To achieve this goal, synergy of two fundamental prerequisites is required: (i) shutdown of larval development by exposing larvae to low temperatures (dormancy) and (ii) incorporating the free amino acid proline in tissues by feeding larvae a proline-augmented diet (cryopreservation).

VL  - 6

SP  - 7991-7996
AB  - Recent theory predicts that the sizes of cells will evolve according to fluctuations in body temperature. Smaller cells speed metabolism during periods of warming but require more energy to maintain and repair. To evaluate this theory, we studied the evolution of cell size in populations of Drosophila melanogaster held at either a constant temperature (16°C or 25°C) or fluctuating temperatures (16 and 25°C). Populations that evolved at fluctuating temperatures or a constant 25°C developed smaller thoraxes, wings, and cells than did flies exposed to a constant 16°C. The cells of flies from fluctuating environments were intermediate in size to those of flies from constant environments. Most genetic variation in cell size was independent of variation in wing size, suggesting that cell size was a target of selection. These evolutionary patterns accord with patterns of developmental plasticity documented previously. Future studies should focus on the mechanisms that underlie the selective advantage of small cells at high or fluctuating temperatures. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Effect of fast mold surface temperature evolution on iPP part morphology gradients
VL  - 1713
AB  - The control of mold surface temperature is an important factor that affects the sample surface morphology as well as the structural gradients (orientation crystal size, and type) as well as cooling stresses. The frozen layer thickness formed during the filling stage also has a very significant effect on the flow resistance and thus on the resulting pressure drop and flow length in thin wall parts. The possibility to have a hot mold during filling and a quick cooling soon afterward is a significant process enhancement particularly for specialized applications such as micro injection molding and for the reproduction of micro structured surfaces. Up to now, several methods (electromagnetic, infrared, hot vapor fleshing etc,) were tried to achieve fast temperature evolution of the mold. Unfortunately, all these methods require a complex balance between thermal and mechanical problems, equipment cost, energy consumption, safety, molding cycle time and part quality achievable. In this work, a thin electrical resistance was designed and used to generate a fast and confined temperature variation on mold surface (by joule effect). Since the whole temperature evolution can take place in a few seconds, one can couple the advantages of a high surface temperature during filling with the advantages of a low mold temperature, fast cooling and low heating dissipation. Some experiments were performed with a commercial iPP resin. The effects of the surface temperature and of the heating time (under constant electric power) on surface finishing and on the final morphology (thickness and structure of the different layers) are explored and discussed. © 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.

TI  - Differences in life history characteristics among three sympatric evolutionary species of the Rotaria rotatoria complex
VL  - 31
IS  - 3
SP  - 351-360
AB  - The Bdelloidea rotifer, a kind of asexually microscopic invertebrate, is the largest Metazoan group that reproduces only through parthenogenesis. Here the potential evolutionary species composition was analyzed using a coalescent approach to infer independently evolving entities from a phylogenetic tree obtained from cytochrome oxidase I sequences. Three clones (HX4, HX8 and HX19) of Bdelloidea Rotaria rotatoria were selected to be the representatives of three sympatric putative cryptic taxa for detecting the effects of temperature (24, 28 and 32 ℃) on their life history traits. The results showed that the responses of life table parameters to increasing temperature were different among the three evolving entities. Evolutionary species, temperatures and their interaction significantly affected all life history parameters except that evolutionary species did not significantly affect the durations of post-reproductive period and mean lifespan. In addition, the interaction of evolutionary species and temperatures did not significantly affect the durations of post-reproductive period, offspring production or net reproductive rate. No matter what the evolutionary species was, the age-specific survival curves tended to decrease earlier and more quickly, and the peak of age-specific fecundity curves appeared earlier with increasing temperature. The three potential cryptic R. rotatoria taxa adopted variable life history strategies, low reproduction and high survivorship at low temperature, as well as high reproduction and low survivorship at high temperature. The similar adaptation abilities of HX4, HX8 and HX19 to water temperatures could be the best explanation for their coexistence in the subtropical shallow pond at a high temperature. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

VL  - 114
SP  - 387-396
AB  - The investigation was carried out in typical wintertime (January 2016) of China. Relationships between health discomforts, which includes physiological effects to the nervous system, digestive system, respiratory system, skin and mucous membranes, and temperature steps were analyzed with the adjustment of subjects' anthropometric information. The Odds Ratio (OR) was applied to evaluate the possibility of suffering from certain kinds of discomforts for different groups of people in comparison to the control group. If the OR is higher than 1.0 (P < 0.05), it indicates that the focused group is more vulnerable than the control group. Results show that people in cold winter regions suffered higher risk (OR: 1335-2.044) of several discomforts than those in warm winter areas. For hot summer and cold winter region, air-conditioning usage intensified discomforts (OR >1) since the rates of 8 kinds of discomforts for people who use air-conditioning both at their offices and homes were significant higher than the control group (people use air-conditioning neither in their homes nor offices) with OR ranging from 1.455 to 2.276. Adaptability also has significant impact on human discomforts, showing as people whose residential period are less than 10 years have higher relative risks in several discomforts than people living here for more than 10 years (OR varying from 1.342 to 1.954), especially the psychological and nervous system effects. Body mass index, gender and age are also remarkable factors associated with human discomforts in winter. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction. Body temperature influences all aspects of the physiology and ecology of insects and indeed of all other ectotherms (Cossins and Bowler, 1987; Chown and Nicolson, 2004; Angilletta, 2009). Extreme low or high temperatures are physiologically damaging or even lethal, but temperatures well within those critical limits have profound effects on performance and fitness. Not surprisingly, an insect's thermal sensitivity plays a key role in its behavior, ecology and fitness. Here I review several consequences of insect adaptation to low temperature. My focus is largely on organismal and population-level consequences. I take a macrophysiological approach (Chown et al., 2004) and focus on four key issues: some are classical, but others have only recently received attention: (a) Do optimal and critical temperatures correlate inversely with latitude, indicating that high-latitude species have adapted evolutionarily to low temperatures? (b) Are high-latitude species, which live in seasonal environments, physiologically adapted to a broader range of temperatures than are low-latitude species? (c) Do species with low optimal temperatures have the same maximal rates of population growth as do species with high optimal temperatures, as might occur if biochemical adaptation compensates fully for the thermodynamically depressing effects of low temperature? (d) Are cold-adapted, high-latitude species at greater risk from climate warming than are warm-adapted, low-latitude species, as might be expected given the faster rate of climate warming at high latitudes? © Cambridge University Press 2010.

TI  - Transcriptome sequencing as a platform to elucidate molecular components of the diapause response in the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus
VL  - 38
IS  - 2
SP  - 173-181
AB  - Diapause has long been recognized as a crucial ecological adaptation to spatio-temporal environmental variation. More recently, rapid evolution of the diapause response has been implicated in response to contemporary global warming and during the range expansion of invasive species. Although the molecular regulation of diapause remains largely unresolved, rapidly emerging next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provide exciting opportunities for addressing this longstanding question. In the present study, a new assembly from life-history stages relevant to diapause in the Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus (Skuse) is reported, along with unique methods for the analysis of NGS data and transcriptome assembly. A digital normalization procedure that significantly reduces the computational resources required for transcriptome assembly is evaluated. Additionally, a method for protein reference-based and genomic reference-based merged assembly of 454 and Illumina reads is described. Finally, a gene ontology analysis is presented, which creates a platform for identifying the physiological processes associated with diapause. Taken together, these methods provide valuable tools for analyzing the transcriptional underpinnings of many complex phenotypes, including diapause, and provide a basis for determining the molecular regulation of diapause in Ae. albopictus. © 2013 The Royal Entomological Society.

AB  - An assembly of gypsum boards fixed along their centre to a steel stud with a cavity between its two facings has been subjected to the standard fire of ISO 834. A model was developed to simulate the temperature evolution in the assembly measured at different distances from the fireside. Using measured thermal properties as functions of temperature, in combination with models taking into account radiation and convection in the wall cavity as well as mass transfer inside the gypsum boards led to a fairly good reproduction of the measured data. The fire tests were stopped immediately after the exposed gypsum layer showed ablation, which happened shortly after 60 min of exposition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The presented model includes algorithms for random powder layer generation, electron beam energy absorption, evaporation, capillarity and wetting, meltpool dynamics, its temperature evolution and face centered cubic grain solidification. The model is first validated against the experimental findings of single track electron beam melting and solidification of a baseplate and then applied to simulate the grain structure produced during AM. Influence of the hatching strategy on grain structure is presented as well as stray grain formation resulting from partially molten powder particles. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Genetic and thermal effects on the latitudinal variation in the timing of fin development of a fish Oryzias latipes
VL  - 36
IS  - 6
SP  - 306-311
AB  - Heterochrony, an evolutionary change in developmental processes, is one of the major proximate causes of morphological diversity of organisms. It has been reported in the medaka Oryzias latipes that higher-latitude larvae have a genetic tendency to complete fin ray formation at larger body sizes, which results in relatively shorter anal and dorsal fins in adults. However, this latitudinal, heterochronic variation in fin length in the wild may be partially explained by latitudinal differences in thermal environments, if temperatures affect the timing of fin ray formation. Common-environment experiments revealed that the body size at which fin pterygiophore (a basal skeleton of fin rays) formation was completed was larger in higher-latitude larvae than in lower-latitude larvae at all temperatures examined, supporting the proposal that fin ray formation of the former is genetically delayed. However, phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature was also evident; lower temperatures caused delayed fin ray formation until a larger body size had been achieved in both high- and low-latitude larvae. These observations suggest that habitat temperatures also contribute to the latitudinal difference in the timing of fin development, magnifying phenotypic variation in fin length across latitudes. We discuss reasons for this positive covariance between genetic and environmental effects on the latitudinal, heterochronic variation, from the viewpoint of local adaptation and evolution of phenotypic plasticity.

TI  - ACTN3 Allele Frequency in Humans Covaries with Global Latitudinal Gradient
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
AB  - A premature stop codon in ACTN3 resulting in α-actinin-3 deficiency (the ACTN3 577XX genotype) is common in humans and reduces strength, muscle mass, and fast-twitch fiber diameter, but increases the metabolic efficiency of skeletal muscle. Linkage disequilibrium data suggest that the ACTN3 R577X allele has undergone positive selection during human evolution. The allele has been hypothesized to be adaptive in environments with scarce resources where efficient muscle metabolism would be selected. Here we test this hypothesis by using recently developed comparative methods that account for evolutionary relatedness and gene flow among populations. We find evidence that the ACTN3 577XX genotype evolved in association with the global latitudinal gradient. Our results suggest that environmental variables related to latitudinal variation, such as species richness and mean annual temperature, may have influenced the adaptive evolution of ACTN3 577XX during recent human history. © 2013 Friedlander et al.

TI  - Does increased heat resistance result in higher susceptibility to predation? A test using Drosophila melanogaster selection and hardening
VL  - 30
IS  - 6
SP  - 1153-1164
AB  - Heat resistance of ectotherms can be increased both by plasticity and evolution, but these effects may have trade-offs resulting from biotic interactions. Here, we test for predation costs in Drosophila melanogaster populations with altered heat resistance produced by adult hardening and directional selection for increased heat resistance. In addition, we also tested for genetic trade-offs by testing heat resistance in lines that have evolved under increased predation risk. We show that while 35/37 °C hardening increases heat resistance as expected, it does not increase predation risk from jumping spiders or mantids; in fact, there was an indication that survival may have increased under predation following a triple 37 °C compared to a single 35 °C hardening treatment. Flies that survived a 39 °C selection cycle showed lower survival under predation, suggesting a predation cost of exposure to a more severe heat stress. There was, however, no correlated response to selection because survival did not differ between control and selected lines after selection was relaxed for one or two generations. In addition, lines selected for increased predation risk did not differ in heat resistance. Our findings suggest independent evolutionary responses to predation and heat as measured in laboratory assays, and no costs of heat hardening on susceptibility to predation. © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Determining the limits of microbial life at subzero temperatures
SP  - 21-38
AB  - Determining the low-temperature limit of life is a challenge complicated by the reduced availability of liquid water as water freezes and by the low rates of diffusion and reaction brought on by low temperatures. And yet, many microorganisms are able to grow at temperatures of -2 °C to 4 °C and many also survive much lower temperatures of -80 °C to -196 °C. A variety of approaches for determining the low-temperature limit of life are examined in this chapter and relevant data are reported. Theoretical approaches investigate the presence of liquid water at temperatures below 0 °C as well as universal laws of biology which may inform the low-temperature limits of life. Both reductionist and holistic experimental approaches reveal the known limits of cellular components, processes, and whole cells with multiple lines of evidence suggesting that cell reproduction occurs down to temperatures of -20 °C. Finally, observational studies of microorganisms in low-temperature environments of the polar regions expose how the low-temperature limit of life is entangled with other factors (perhaps inextricably) and that time at low temperatures may limit evolution and cold adaptation of terrestrial life.

VL  - 17

SP  - 123-132
AB  - Because biological invasions can be swift and are rarely examined immediately and/or followed over time, spatial genetic diversity analyses grounded in a well-developed body of theory are often used to reconstruct historical patterns of expansion. Unfortunately, the role of selection in shaping and potentially disrupting such reconstructions has seldom been examined. The mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus is a temperate, cold-adapted species native to northern Japan that has recently established populations on the island of Hawaii. We used variation at seven microsatellite loci and one mitochondrial locus to examine Hawaiian populations collected in 2004, shortly after its first detection, and then in 2010–2011. Samples were collected along an elevational/temperature gradient, ranging from sea level to 1,200 m. Specimens collected near sea level in 2004 from the earliest detected population exhibited high genetic diversity. Contrary to expectations that diversity would decrease outward from the point of introduction, in 2010–2011 high elevation populations had the greatest genetic diversity, while low elevation populations (including those with high diversity in 2004) now had lower diversity and were significantly differentiated from each other, suggesting severe bottlenecks. We hypothesize that differential survival across temperatures at high versus low elevations has subverted the expected genetic signature of an expanding population. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

VL  - 65
IS  - 4
SP  - 2009-2017
AB  - To enhance the ε-poly-l-lysine (ε-PL) productivity of Streptomyces sp. FEEL-1, a novel breeding strategy of atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis with streptomycin resistance screening was developed. After three rounds of recursive breeding, one strain designated AS3-14 was selected with a ε-PL yield of 2.91 g/L in shake-flask fermentation, which was elevated by 66.3 % compared to that of the parent strain FEEL-1. Subsequent batch and fed-batch fermentation was performed in a 5 L fermenter, and 8.2 g/L and 41.2 g/L ε-PL productions were achieved, which were 49.1 % and 68.1 % higher, respectively, than those of the parent strain. Analysis of enzyme activities indicated that key enzymes, e.g., hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, citrate synthase and aspartate kinase, were more active in the mutant AS3-14 than in FEEL-1, which might explain the enhanced ε-PL productivity. The results of amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis indicated that the genomic DNA of AS3-14 became more variable after ARTP mutagenesis. Therefore, ARTP combined with streptomycin resistance is an efficient breeding approach for the rapid evolution of ε-PL-producing Streptomyces strains. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg and the University of Milan.

VL  - 2

AB  - Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are characterized by the presence of activating mutations in the KIT/PDGFRA gene and resistance to conventional cytotoxics. The development of targeted small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib and sunitinib have brought about a paradigm shift in the management of GIST. Primary and secondary GIST mutations influence response and resistance to kinase inhibition and are central to the understanding of this disease. In the last decade we have witnessed a rapid evolution in the treatment of GIST. This review summarizes the approved systemic therapies in advanced GIST, highlights the ongoing experimental strategies employed in imatinib/sunitinib-refractory disease, as well as the adjuvant and preoperative use of imatinib in this malignancy.

AB  - In the Rhône-Alpes, a number of projects are underway which are aimed at determining the choice of forage species and forage grass mixtures that are better adapted to global warming and climate change. Mediterranean varieties of cocksfoot and tall fescue were compared to their temperate counterparts. Mediterranean varieties of tall fescue, providing a highly perennial cover, allow for earlier availability of grass (before periods of hydric deficit). Multi-species mixtures and tall legumes (alfalfa, sainfoin) significantly boost productivity. One mixture in particular, known as Saint- Marcellin, proved to be highly perennial in spite of significant episodes of drought. The advantages of Mediterranean tall fescue in multi-species mixtures for meadowland and pastureland need to be verified. © 2018 Association Francaise pour la Production Fourragere.All Rights Reserved.

VL  - 8
IS  - 4
SP  - 363-372
AB  - Recent anthropogenic eutrophication has meant that host plants of nettle-feeding insects became quasi-omnipresent in fertile regions of Western Europe. However, host plant resource quality - in terms of microclimate and nutritional value - may vary considerably between the 'original' forest habitat and 'recent' agricultural habitat. Here, we compared development in both environmental settings using a split-brood design, so as to explore to what extent larval survival and adult morphology in the nettle-feeding butterfly Aglais urticae are influenced by the anthropogenic environment. Nettles along field margins had higher C/N ratios and provided warmer microclimates to larvae. Larvae developed 20% faster and tended to improve their survival rates, on the agricultural land compared to woodland. Our split-brood approach indicated plastic responses within families, but also family effects in the phenotypic responses. Adult males and females had darker wing pigmentation in the drier and warmer agricultural environment, which contrasts with the thermal melanism hypothesis. Developmental plasticity in response to this microclimatically different and more variable habitat was associated with a broader phenotypic parameter space for the species. Both habitat expansion and developmental plasticity are likely contributors to the ecological and evolutionary success of these nettle-feeding insects in anthropogenic environments under high nitrogen load. © 2015 The Authors.

TI  - Potential for adaptation to climate change: Family-level variation in fitness-related traits and their responses to heat waves in a snail population
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
AB  - Background On-going global climate change poses a serious threat for natural populations unless they are able to evolutionarily adapt to changing environmental conditions (e.g. increasing average temperatures, occurrence of extreme weather events). A prerequisite for evolutionary change is within-population heritable genetic variation in traits subject to selection. In relation to climate change, mainly phenological traits as well as heat and desiccation resistance have been examined for such variation. Therefore, it is important to investigate adaptive potential under climate change conditions across a broader range of traits. This is especially true for life-history traits and defences against natural enemies (e.g. parasites) since they influence organisms' fitness both directly and through species interactions. We examined the adaptive potential of fitness-related traits and their responses to heat waves in a population of a freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. We estimated family-level variation and covariation in life history (size, reproduction) and constitutive immune defence traits [haemocyte concentration, phenoloxidase (PO)-like activity, antibacterial activity of haemolymph] in snails experimentally exposed to typical (15 °C) and heat wave (25 °C) temperatures. We also assessed variation in the reaction norms of these traits between the treatments. Results We found that at the heat wave temperature, snails were larger and reproduced more, while their immune defence was reduced. Snails showed high family-level variation in all examined traits within both temperature treatments. The only negative genetic correlation (between reproduction and antibacterial activity) appeared at the high temperature. However, we found no family-level variation in the responses of most examined traits to the experimental heat wave (i.e. largely parallel reaction norms between the treatments). Only the reduction of PO-like activity when exposed to the high temperature showed family-level variation, suggesting that the cost of heat waves may be lower for some families and could evolve under selection. Conclusion Our results suggest that there is genetic potential for adaptation within both thermal environments and that trait evolution may not be strongly affected by trade-offs between them. However, rare differences in thermal reaction norms across families indicate limited evolutionary potential in the responses of snails to changing temperatures during extreme weather events. © Copyright 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - Extreme climatic events can substantially affect organismal performance and Darwinian fitness. In April 2011, a strong heat wave struck extensive geographical areas of the world, including Western Europe. At that time, we happened to resume and extend a long-term time series of seasonal genetic data in the widespread fly Drosophila subobscura, which provided a unique opportunity to quantify the intensity of the genetic perturbation caused by the heat wave. We show that the spring 2011 genetic constitution of the populations transiently shifted to summer-like frequencies, and that the magnitude of the genetic anomaly quantitatively matched the temperature anomaly. The results provide compelling evidence that direct effects of rising temperature are driving adaptive evolutionary shifts, and also suggest a strong genetic resilience in this species.

AB  - Analyses of Sahel regional and country-specific rainfall and temperature time series derived from a fixed subset of stations show the well-documented large-scale decreasing trend in rainfall that occurred between 1970 and 2000 and also, an increasing trend in summertime maximum and wintertime minimum temperatures. The evolution of summertime mean maximum temperature is almost opposite to that of rainfall, and a significant correlation is observed between the evolution of this quantity and millet yields, in comparison with correlation with summertime rainfall. It appears that quantifying future vulnerability of the Sahel zone to climate change is rather difficult because climate models have not in general shown yet a satisfactory reproduction of the observed climate variability of this area. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Thermal-stress selection can affect multiple fitness components including mating success. Reproductive success is one of the most inclusive measures of overall fitness, and mating success is a major component of reproduction. However, almost no attention has been spent to test how mating success can be affected by thermal-stress selection. In this study, we examine the mating success in the cactophilic Drosophila buzzatii Patterson & Wheeler (Diptera: Drosophilidae) derived from two natural populations that nearly represent the ends of an altitudinal cline for heat knock-down resistance. Furthermore, we extended the analysis using laboratory lines artificially selected for high and low heat knock-down resistance. Mating success at high temperature was found to be higher in the lowland than the highland population after a heat pre-treatment. Moreover, individuals selected for heat knock-down resistance showed higher mating success at high temperature than did individuals selected for low knock-down resistance. These results indicate that adaptation to thermal stress can confer an advantage on fitness-related traits including mating success and highlight the benefits of earlier heat exposure as an adaptive plastic response affecting mating success under stress of higher temperature.

TI  - Comparative analysis of transcriptomes in rhizophoraceae provides insights into the origin and adaptive evolution of mangrove plants in intertidal environments
VL  - 8
AB  - Mangroves are woody plants that grow at the interface between land and sea in tropical and subtropical latitudes, where they exist in conditions of high salinity, extreme tides, strong winds, high temperatures, and muddy, anaerobic soils. Rhizophoraceae is a key mangrove family, with highly developed morphological and physiological adaptations to extreme conditions. It is an ideal system for the study of the origin and adaptive evolution of mangrove plants. In this study, we characterized and comprehensively compared the transcriptomes of four mangrove species, from all four mangrove genera, as well as their closest terrestrial relative in Rhizophoraceae, using RNA-Seq. We obtained 41,936–48,845 unigenes with N50 values of 982–1,185 bp and 61.42–69.48% annotated for the five species in Rhizophoraceae. Orthology annotations of Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and Clusters of Orthologous Groups revealed overall similarities in the transcriptome profiles among the five species, whereas enrichment analysis identified remarkable genomic characteristics that are conserved across the four mangrove species but differ from their terrestrial relative. Based on 1,816 identified orthologs, phylogeny analysis and divergence time estimation revealeda single origin for mangrove species in Rhizophoraceae, which divergedfromthe terrestrial lineage ∼56.4 million years ago (Mya), suggesting that the transgression during the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum may have been responsible for the entry of the mangrove lineage of Rhizophoraceae into intertidal environments. Evidence showed that the ancestor of Rhizophoraceae may have experienced a whole genome duplication event ∼74.6 Mya, which may have increased the adaptability and survival chances of Rhizophoraceae during and following the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction. The analysis of positive selection identified 10 positively selected genes from the ancestor branch of Rhizophoraceae mangroves, which were mainly associated with stress response, embryo development, and regulation of gene expression. Positive selection of these genes may be crucial for increasing the capability of stress tolerance (i.e., defense against salt and oxidative stress) and development of adaptive traits (i.e., vivipary) of Rhizophoraceae mangroves, and thus plays an important role in their adaptation to the stressful intertidal environments. © 2017 Guo, Wu, Zhang, Yang, Hu, Shi, Jian, Shi and Huang.

TI  - Genome differentiation of Drosophila melanogaster from a microclimate contrast in Evolution Canyon, Israel
VL  - 110

SP  - 21059-21064
AB  - The opposite slopes of "Evolution Canyon" in Israel have served as a natural model system of adaptation to a microclimate contrast. Long-term studies of Drosophila melanogaster populations inhabiting the canyon have exhibited significant interslope divergence in thermal and drought stress resistance, candidate genes, mobile elements, habitat choice, mating discrimination, and wing-shape variation, all despite close physical proximity of the contrasting habitats, as well as substantial interslope migration. To examine patterns of genetic differentiation at the genome-wide level, we used high coverage sequencing of the flies' genomes. A total of 572 genes were significantly different in allele frequency between the slopes, 106 out of which were associated with 74 significantly overrepresented gene ontology (GO) terms, particularly so with response to stimulus and developmental and reproductive processes, thus corroborating previous observations of interslope divergence in stress response, life history, and mating functions. There were at least 37 chromosomal "islands" of interslope divergence and low sequence polymorphism, plausible signatures of selective sweeps, more abundant in flies derived from one (north-facing) of the slopes. Positive correlation between local recombination rate and the level of nucleotide polymorphism was also found.

VL  - 26
IS  - 3
SP  - 591-609
AB  - Daphnia is a widespread freshwater zooplankton species, which is both a classic and emerging new model for research in ecological physiology, ecotoxicology and evolutionary biology of adaptation to novel environments. Heat tolerance in Daphnia is known to depend both upon evolutionary history of a genotype and on individuals' acclimation to elevated temperature and to correlate with the level of haemoglobin expression. We demonstrate the existence of north-south gradient of heat tolerance in North American D. pulex, which is not associated with any parallel changes in haemoglobin expression. Geographically distinct clones differ in the way their haemoglobin expression changes due to acclimation to a sub-stressful (28°C) temperature, but these changes are not correlated with the latitude of clones' origin. Likewise, the effect of acclimation to sub-stressful temperature is independent from, and cannot be fully explained by, haemoglobin expression changes during acclimation. The degree of oxidative damage to haemoglobin, measured as the ratio of absorbance at 540:576 nm at the acclimation temperature, is a strong predictor of 28°C-acclimated Daphnia survival during an acute heat exposure. The comparison of haemoglobin expression in resistant and tolerant clones acclimated to different temperatures indicates that tolerant clones exhibit canalization of haemoglobin expression, possessing a high level of haemoglobin even at non-stressful temperatures. We discuss the evolutionary biology of adaptation and acclimation to elevated temperatures in an ecologically important component of freshwater ecosystems in the context of global climate change. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Failure of organisms to adapt to sudden environmental changes may lead to extinction. The type of mating system, by affecting fertility and the strength of sexual selection, may have a major impact on a population's chances to adapt and survive. Here, we use experimental evolution in bulb mites (Rhizoglyphus robini) to examine the effects of the mating system on population performance under environmental change. We demonstrate that populations in which monogamy was enforced suffered a dramatic fitness decline when evolving at an increased temperature, whereas the negative effects of change in a thermal environment were alleviated in polygamous populations. Strikingly, within 17 generations, all monogamous populations experiencing higher temperature went extinct, whereas all polygamous populations survived. Our results show that the mating system may have dramatic effects on the risk of extinction under environmental change. © 2012 The Royal Society.

VL  - 57
IS  - 5
SP  - 614-619
AB  - Adults of the cabbage beetle Colaphellus bowringi display a summer diapause in response to the exposure of their larvae to long photoperiods. In the present study, the inheritance of the photoperiodic response controlling summer diapause in C. bowringi by crossing a high diapause strain (D strain) with a laboratory selected nondiapause strain (N strain) was investigated under different photoperiods at 22, 25 and 28 degrees C. The beetles in both reciprocal crosses and backcrosses showed a clear short-day response for the induction of diapause at all temperatures, similar to that of the D strain, suggesting that photoperiodic response of this beetle is heritable. The diapause incidences in the progeny from all the crosses under LD 15:9 or LD 12:12 at 25 degrees C suggest that genetic and genetic-environmental interactions are involved in diapause induction. The incidence of diapauses in F-1 progeny was significantly lower than that in the D x D strain but significantly higher than that in the N x N strain, indicating that the diapause capability is inherited in an incomplete dominant manner. The incidence of diapause was greater among the offspring of hybrid females when those females had a D strain mother or grandmother rather than a N strain mother or grandmother, indicating that maternal effects on diapause induction are stronger than paternal effects. The laboratory selected nondiapause strain also showed a short-day photoperiodic response at a low temperature of 22 degrees C, indicating that the photoperiodic photoreceptor and photoperiodic clock still function in the nondiapause strain.

TI  - Life in the fat lane: seasonal regulation of insulin sensitivity, food intake, and adipose biology in brown bears
VL  - 187
IS  - 4
SP  - 649-676
AB  - Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos horribilis) have evolved remarkable metabolic adaptations including enormous fat accumulation during the active season followed by fasting during hibernation. However, these fluctuations in body mass do not cause the same harmful effects associated with obesity in humans. To better understand these seasonal transitions, we performed insulin and glucose tolerance tests in captive grizzly bears, characterized the annual profiles of circulating adipokines, and tested the anorectic effects of centrally administered leptin at different times of the year. We also used bear gluteal adipocyte cultures to test insulin and beta-adrenergic sensitivity in vitro. Bears were insulin resistant during hibernation but were sensitive during the spring and fall active periods. Hibernating bears remained euglycemic, possibly due to hyperinsulinemia and hyperglucagonemia. Adipokine concentrations were relatively low throughout the active season but peaked in mid-October prior to hibernation when fat content was greatest. Serum glycerol was highest during hibernation, indicating ongoing lipolysis. Centrally administered leptin reduced food intake in October, but not in August, revealing seasonal variation in the brain’s sensitivity to its anorectic effects. This was supported by strong phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 labeling within the hypothalamus of hibernating bears; labeling virtually disappeared in active bears. Adipocytes collected during hibernation were insulin resistant when cultured with hibernation serum but became sensitive when cultured with active season serum. Heat treatment of active serum blocked much of this action. Clarifying the cellular mechanisms responsible for the physiology of hibernating bears may inform new treatments for metabolic disorders. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Selection and evolutionary potential of spring arrival phenology in males and females of a migratory songbird
VL  - 28
IS  - 5
SP  - 1024-1038
AB  - The timing of annual life-history events affects survival and reproduction of all organisms. A changing environment can perturb phenological adaptations and an important question is if populations can evolve fast enough to track the environmental changes. Yet, little is known about selection and evolutionary potential of traits determining the timing of crucial annual events. Migratory species, which travel between different climatic regions, are particularly affected by global environmental changes. To increase our understanding of evolutionary potential and selection of timing traits, we investigated the quantitative genetics of arrival date at the breeding ground using a multigenerational pedigree of a natural great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus) population. We found significant heritability of 16.4% for arrival date and directional selection for earlier arrival in both sexes acting through reproductive success, but not through lifespan. Mean arrival date advanced with 6 days over 20 years, which is in exact accordance with our predicted evolutionary response based on the breeder's equation. However, this phenotypic change is unlikely to be caused by microevolution, because selection seems mainly to act on the nongenetic component of the trait. Furthermore, demographical changes could also not account for the advancing arrival date. Instead, a strong correlation between spring temperatures and population mean arrival date suggests that phenotypic plasticity best explains the advancement of arrival date in our study population. Our study dissects the evolutionary and environmental forces that shape timing traits and thereby increases knowledge of how populations cope with rapidly changing environments. © 2015 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Simple versus complex models of trait evolution and stasis as a response to environmental change
VL  - 112
IS  - 16
SP  - 4885-4890
AB  - Previous analyses of evolutionary patterns, or modes, in fossil lineages have focused overwhelmingly on three simple models: stasis, random walks, and directional evolution. Here we use likelihood methods to fit an expanded set of evolutionary models to a large compilation of ancestor-descendant series of populations from the fossil record. In addition to the standard three models, we assess more complex models with punctuations and shifts from one evolutionary mode to another. As in previous studies, we find that stasis is common in the fossil record, as is a strict version of stasis that entails no real evolutionary changes. Incidence of directional evolution is relatively low (13%), but higher than in previous studies because our analytical approach can more sensitively detect noisy trends. Complex evolutionary models are often favored, overwhelmingly so for sequences comprising many samples. This finding is consistent with evolutionary dynamics that are, in reality, more complex than any of the models we consider. Furthermore, the timing of shifts in evolutionary dynamics varies among traits measured from the same series. Finally, we use our empirical collection of evolutionary sequences and a long and highly resolved proxy for global climate to inform simulations in which traits adaptively track temperature changes over time. When realistically calibrated, we find that this simple model can reproduce important aspects of our paleontological results. We conclude that observed paleontological patterns, including the prevalence of stasis, need not be inconsistent with adaptive evolution, even in the face of unstable physical environments. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Thermal reaction norms can surmount evolutionary constraints: comparative evidence across leaf beetle species
VL  - 6
IS  - 14
SP  - 4670-4683
AB  - One of the leitmotifs of the ecophysiological research on ectotherms is the variation and evolution of thermal reaction norms for biological rates. This long-standing issue is crucial both for our understanding of life-history diversification and for predicting the phenology of economically important species. A number of properties of the organism's thermal phenotype have been identified as potential constraints on the evolution of the rate–temperature relationship. This comparative study addresses several such constraints by testing whether the actual interspecific variation of thermal reaction norms across nearly hundred leaf beetle species agrees with the expected patterns. The results show that developmental rate and its temperature-dependent parameters are similar in closely related species and that the variation pattern depends on the taxonomic scale, the thermal reaction norms being mostly parallel for the representatives of distant subclades but intersecting more often farther down the phylogenetic tree. The parallel shift disagrees with the putative ubiquity of a positive slope–threshold relationship, whereby thermal reaction norms should normally intersect, and even more contradicts with the common-intersection hypothesis. The ability to develop in cooler conditions is not traded off at higher temperatures, which is an exception to the “warmer is better” principle. A comparison of high- and low-quality data indicates that some of these discrepancies with earlier findings may stem from a likely presence of noise in previous analyses, which may have affected the variation patterns observed. Overall, the failure to support the universality of the predicted patterns suggests that the evolution of thermal reaction norms in leaf beetles has largely overcome the hypothesized constraints. © 2016 The Author.

TI  - Rapid adaptive evolution of photoperiodic response during invasion and range expansion across a climatic gradient
VL  - 179
IS  - 4
SP  - 490-500
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of adaptation to spatiotemporal environmental variation is a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology. This issue also has important implications for anticipating biological responses to contemporary climate warming and determining the processes by which invasive species are able to spread rapidly across broad geographic ranges. Here, we compare data from a historical study of latitudinal variation in photoperiodic response among Japanese and U.S. populations of the invasive Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus with contemporary data obtained using comparable methods. Our results demonstrated rapid adaptive evolution of the photoperiodic response during invasion and range expansion across ~15° of latitude in the United States. In contrast to the photoperiodic response, size-based morphological traits implicated in climatic adaptation in a wide range of other insects did not show evidence of adaptive variation in Ae. albopictus across either the U.S. (invasive) or Japanese (native) range. These results show that photoperiodism has been an important adaptation to climatic variation across the U.S. range of Ae. albopictus and, in conjunction with previous studies, strongly implicate the photoperiodic control of seasonal development as a critical evolutionary response to ongoing contemporary climate change. These results also emphasize that photoperiodism warrants increased attention in studies of the evolution of invasive species. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - Analysis of the erythropoietin of a Tibetan Plateau schizothoracine fish (Gymnocypris dobula) reveals enhanced cytoprotection function in hypoxic environments
VL  - 16
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone that plays a principal regulatory role in erythropoiesis and initiates cell homeostatic responses to environmental challenges. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a natural laboratory for hypoxia adaptation. Gymnocypris dobula is a highly specialized plateau schizothoracine fish that is restricted to &gt; 4500 m high-altitude freshwater rivers and ponds in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The role of EPO in the adaptation of schizothoracine fish to hypoxia is unknown. Results: The EPO and EPO receptor genes from G. dobula and four other schizothoracine fish from various altitudinal habitats were characterized. Schizothoracine EPOs are predicted to possess 2-3 N-glycosylation (NGS) sites, 4-5 casein kinase II phosphorylation (CK2) sites, 1-2 protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation sites, and four conserved cysteine residues within four helical domains, with variations in the numbers of NGS and CK2 sites in G. dobula. PAML analysis indicated a d N/d S value (ω) = 1.112 in the G. dobula lineage, and a few amino acids potentially under lineage-specific positive selection were detected within the G. dobula EPO. Similarly, EPO receptors of the two high-altitude schizothoracines (G. dobula and Ptychobarbus kaznakovi), were found to be statistically on the border of positive selection using the branch-site model (P-value = 0.096), and some amino acids located in the ligand-binding domain and the fibronectin type III domain were identified as potentially positive selection sites. Tissue EPO expression profiling based on transcriptome sequencing of three schizothoracines (G. dobula, Schizothorax nukiangensis Tsao, and Schizothorax prenanti) showed significant upregulation of EPO expression in the brain and less significantly in the gill of G. dobula. The elevated expression together with the rapid evolution of the EPO gene in G. dobula suggested a possible role for EPO in adaptation to hypoxia. To test this hypothesis, Gd-EPO and Sp-EPO were cloned into an expression vector and transfected into the cultured cell line 293 T. Significantly higher cell viability was observed in cells transfected with Gd-EPO than cells harboring Sp-EPO when challenged by hypoxia. Conclusion: The deduced EPO proteins of the schizothoracine fish contain characteristic structures and important domains similar to EPOs from other taxa. The presence of potentially positive selection sites in both EPO and EPOR in G. dobula suggest possible adaptive evolution in the ligand-receptor binding activity of the EPO signaling cascade in G. dobula. Functional study indicated that the EPO from high-altitude schizothoracine species demonstrated features of hypoxic adaptation by reducing toxic effects or improving cell survival when expressed in cultured cells, providing evidence of molecular adaptation to hypoxic conditions in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. © 2016 Xu et al.

VL  - 65
IS  - 10
SP  - 2830-2842
AB  - Variation in female reproductive morphology may play a decisive role in reproductive isolation by affecting the relative fertilization success of alternative male phenotypes. Yet, knowledge of how environmental variation may influence the development of the female reproductive tract and thus alter the arena of postcopulatory sexual selection is limited. Yellow dung fly females possess either three or four sperm storage compartments, a polymorphism with documented influence on sperm precedence. We performed a quantitative genetics study including 12 populations reared at three developmental temperatures complemented by extensive field data to show that warm developmental temperatures increase the frequency of females with four compartments, revealing striking hidden genetic variation for the polymorphism. Systematic genetic differentiation in growth rate and spermathecal number along latitude, and phenotypic covariance between the traits across temperature treatments suggest that the genetic architecture underlying the polymorphism is shaped by selection on metabolic rate. Our findings illustrate how temperature can modulate the preconditions for sexual selection by differentially exposing novel variation in reproductive morphology. This implies that environmental change may substantially alter the dynamics of sexual selection. We further discuss how temperature-dependent developmental plasticity may have contributed to observed rapid evolutionary transitions in spermathecal morphology. © 2011 The Author(s).

TI  - Detrimental influence on performance of high temperature incubation in a tropical reptile: Is cooler better in the tropics?
VL  - 171
IS  - 1
SP  - 83-91
AB  - Global temperatures have risen over the last century, and are forecast to continue rising. Ectotherms may be particularly sensitive to changes in thermal regimes, and tropical ectotherms are more likely than temperate species to be influenced by changes in environmental temperature, because they may have evolved narrow thermal tolerances. Keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii) are tropical, oviparous reptiles. To quantify the effects of temperature on the morphology and physiology of hatchling keelbacks, clutches laid by wild-caught females were split and incubated at three temperatures, reflecting the average minimum, overall average and average maximum temperatures recorded at our study site. Upon hatching, the performance of neonates was examined at all three incubation temperatures in a randomized order over consecutive days. Hatchlings from the 'hot' treatment had slower burst swim speeds and swam fewer laps than hatchlings from the cooler incubation temperatures in all three test temperatures, indicating a low thermal optimum for incubation of this tropical species. There were no significant interactions between test temperature and incubation temperature across performance variables, suggesting phenotypic differences caused by incubation temperature did not acclimate this species to post-hatching conditions. Thus, keelback embryos appear evolutionarily adapted to development at cooler temperatures (relative to what is available in their habitat). The considerable reduction in hatchling viability and performance associated with a 3. 5 °C increase in incubation temperature, suggests climate change may have significant population-level effects on this species. However, the offspring of three mothers exposed to the hottest incubation temperature were apparently resilient to high temperature, suggesting that this species may respond to selection imposed by thermal regime. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Life history trade-offs, the intensity of competition, and coexistence in novel and evolving communities under climate change
VL  - 372
IS  - 1712
AB  - The consequences of climate change for local biodiversity are little understood in process or mechanism, but these changes are likely to reflect both changing regional species pools and changing competitive interactions. Previous empirical work largely supports the idea that competition will intensify under climate change, promoting competitive exclusions and local extinctions, while theory and conceptual work indicate that relaxed competition may in fact buffer communities from biodiversity losses that are typically witnessed at broader spatial scales. In this review, we apply life history theory to understand the conditions under which these alternative scenarios may play out in the context of a range-shifting biota undergoing rapid evolutionary and environmental change, and at both leading-edge and trailing-edge communities. We conclude that, in general, warming temperatures are likely to reduce life history variation among competitors, intensifying competition in both established and novel communities. However, longer growing seasons, severe environmental stress and increased climatic variability associated with climate change may buffer these communities against intensified competition. The role of life history plasticity and evolution has been previously underappreciated in community ecology, but may hold the key to understanding changing species interactions and local biodiversity under changing climates.

TI  - Rna chaperones buffer deleterious mutations in E. Coli
VL  - 2015
IS  - 4
AB  - Both proteins and RNAs can misfold into non-functional conformations. Protein chaperones promote native folding of nascent polypeptides and re-folding of misfolded species, thereby buffering mutations that compromise protein structure and function. Here we show that RNA chaperones can also act as mutation buffers that enhance organismal fitness. Using competition assays, we demonstrate that overexpression of select RNA chaperones, including three DEAD box RNA helicases (CsdA, SrmB, RhlB) and the cold shock protein CspA, improves fitness of two independently evolved E. coli mutator strains that have accumulated deleterious mutations during short- and long-term laboratory evolution. We identify strain-specific mutations that are deleterious and subject to buffering when introduced individually into the ancestral genotype. For DEAD box RNA helicases we show that buffering requires helicase activity, implicating RNA structural remodelling in the buffering process. Our results suggest that RNA chaperones might play a fundamental role in RNA evolution and evolvability. © 2015 eLife Sciences Publications Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 61
SP  - 149-156
AB  - Ultrasound-stimulated IR thermography, thanks to its large-area imaging capability, high test productivity and safety, is a powerful tool for the inspection of cracks in heavy aluminum structures. In thick aluminum parts, the most important defect detection parameters are the differential temperature signal and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which typically reach their maximums at shortly (under 1 s) after the beginning of the ultrasonic excitation. In the IR inspection of non-metals, the ultrasonic excitation may be relatively long, while in the case of highly-conductive aluminum, short-pulse (burst) stimulation (from 0.4 to 1 s) is sufficient The crack detectability can be improved by evaluating temperature images at the times when maximum SNR values occur. Further enhancement of test results can be achieved by applying some data processing algorithms which can be 1D, i.e. applied to temperature evolutions in time, or 20, i.e. applied to spatial coordinates, or a single image.

VL  - 67
SP  - 519-541
AB  - Are viruses more biologically successful than cellular life? Here we examine many ways of gauging biological success, including numerical abundance, environmental tolerance, type biodiversity, reproductive potential, and widespread impact on other organisms. We especially focus on successful ability to evolutionarily adapt in the face of environmental change. Viruses are often challenged by dynamic environments, such as host immune function and evolved resistance as well as abiotic fluctuations in temperature, moisture, and other stressors that reduce virion stability. Despite these challenges, our experimental evolution studies show that viruses can often readily adapt, and novel virus emergence in humans and other hosts is increasingly problematic. We additionally consider whether viruses are advantaged in evolvability-the capacity to evolve-and in avoidance of extinction. On the basis of these different ways of gauging biological success, we conclude that viruses are the most successful inhabitants of the biosphere. © Copyright ©2013 by Annual Reviews.

TI  - Does incubation temperature fluctuation influence hatchling phenotypes in reptiles? A test using parthenogenetic geckos
VL  - 83
IS  - 4
SP  - 597-607
AB  - Many lineages of parthenogenetic organisms have persisted through significant environmental change despite the constraints imposed by their fixed genotype and limited evolutionary potential. The ability of parthenogens to occur sympatrically with sexual relatives may in part be due to phenotypic plasticity in their responses to their environment, especially with respect to incubation temperature-a maternally selected trait. Here we measured the incubation temperatures selected by two lineages of triploid parthenogenic geckos in the Heteronotia binoei complex by allowing them to deposit clutches along a thermal gradient. The average nest temperature selected was 28.4 degrees C, with no significant differences between parthenogenic races or individual clones. To investigate the effect of nest-temperature variability on physiological and morphological traits, we incubated eggs from different races at one of four incubation regimes (32 degrees +/- 0 degrees, +/-3 degrees, +/-5 degrees, or +/-9 degrees C). Embryos incubated at constant 32 degrees C developed faster than embryos reared under increasing extremes of diel temperature fluctuation (+/-3 degrees, +/-5 degrees C), and incubation at 32 degrees +/- 9 degrees C was unsuccessful. Incubation regime had no effect on the body size, preferred substrate temperature, or mass-specific (V) over dotO(2) of hatchlings.. However, parthenogenic race had a significant effect on egg mass, tail length, snout-to-vent length, total length, and (V) over dotO(2) We conclude that developmental traits are strongly influenced by clonal genotypes in this parthenogenic complex but are well buffered against fluctuations in incubation temperature.

TI  - Lack of supercooling evolution related to winter severity in a lizard
VL  - 53
SP  - 72-79
AB  - As organisms move into higher latitudes, they may evolve physiological mechanisms to survive in harsher climates. One such mechanism is supercooling, the capacity to survive at subzero temperatures without freezing. While interspecific comparisons reveal greater thermal tolerances at higher latitudes in insects and vertebrates, evidence for intraspecific evolution in supercooling related to latitude is only evident in insects. We measured the supercooling points of lizards from 12 populations reared from hatch in common laboratory conditions to test for evolved differences in supercooling related to winter. Results indicate that winter harshness (depth or length) cannot explain supercooling points regardless of how data are analyzed, which suggests that populations have not evolved greater supercooling capacity. While our results are consistent with the idea that thermal physiology is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates, we cannot reject several alternatives including the possibility that lizards are able to behaviorally avoid the extreme temperatures that would select for thermal evolution.

VL  - 29

SP  - 847-856
AB  - This study reports mortality under laboratory conditions in unselected controls and 2 lines of juvenile Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas previously selected for their high or low survival in the field during the summer period. Oysters were also deployed in field conditions, and mortality between both conditions was then compared. In the laboratory, mortality was observed in all experiments and it always lasted for a week, indicating that mortality under laboratory conditions was a short-term event. It was also shown that mortality could be repeated for a batch in several experiments using oysters that never experienced any abnormal mortality. This approach could facilitate further studies to investigate the causes of mortality by allowing repeated trials during a summer. Differences in mortality between the resistant and the susceptible selected lines confirmed the positive response to selection under laboratory conditions. Batches that performed well in the laboratory also showed high survival in the field, and the results of those exhibiting low survival in the laboratory trials were also mirrored in the field. Finally, challenging oysters with heat stress is proposed as a useful method for estimating the survival capacity of hatchery-produced and wild-caught spat used by the oyster industry.

AB  - The global climate scenario has been changing alarmingly, attributed to the unabated emission of greenhouse gases into the Earth's atmosphere. Some of the consequences of climate change include a rise of surface temperature and sea levels, and abnormal precipitation across the world. The resulting abiotic stresses from drought, extreme temperature, salinity, radiation, or environmental pollution are likely to impact plant genome integrity and function. This, in turn, would affect plant diversity and productivity adversely, having far-reaching consequences in the ecosystems in various parts of the world. The problem can be mitigated considerably through the development of strategies for plant adaptation to abiotic stress that nevertheless warrants better understanding. Excess generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the general adaptive syndrome that plants manifest in response to stress. The activation of the antioxidative machinery consisting of antioxidant molecules and enzymes is crucial for the maintenance of redox homeostasis that is necessary for normal cellular metabolism and survival under stress. Stress-induced perturbation of this delicate redox balance prompts ROS to trigger signal transduction networks that through gene expression and adaptive responses confer genome protection against environmental stresses. The present chapter highlights the state of the art of transgenic vis-à-vis epigenetic approaches to accelerate adaptive evolution of plant tolerance to stress. © 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

VL  - 4

SP  - 1176-1185
AB  - Longevity is modulated by a range of conserved genes in eukaryotes, but it is unclear how variation in these genes contributes to the evolution of longevity in nature. Mutations that increase life span in model organisms typically induce trade-offs which lead to a net reduction in fitness, suggesting that such mutations are unlikely to become established in natural populations. However, the fitness consequences of manipulating longevity have rarely been assessed in heterogeneous environments, in which stressful conditions are encountered. Using laboratory selection experiments, we demonstrate that long-lived, stress-resistant Caenorhabditis elegans age-1(hx546) mutants have higher fitness than the wild-type genotype if mixed genotype populations are periodically exposed to high temperatures when food is not limited. We further establish, using stochastic population projection models, that the age-1(hx546) mutant allele can confer a selective advantage if temperature stress is encountered when food availability also varies over time. Our results indicate that heterogeneity in environmental stress may lead to altered allele frequencies over ecological timescales and indirectly drive the evolution of longevity. This has important implications for understanding the evolution of life-history strategies. © 2014 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Numerical modelling of heating in porous planetesimal collisions
VL  - 208
IS  - 1
SP  - 468-481
AB  - Collisions between planetesimals at speeds of several kilometres per second were common during the early evolution of our Solar System. However, the collateral effects of these collisions are not well understood. In this paper, we quantify the efficiency of heating during high-velocity collisions between planetesimals using hydrocode modelling. We conducted a series of simulations to test the effect on shock heating of the initial porosity and temperature of the planetesimals, the relative velocity of the collision and the relative size of the two colliding bodies. Our results show that while heating is minor in collisions between non-porous planetesimals at impact velocities below 10kms-1, in agreement with previous work, much higher temperatures are reached in collisions between porous planetesimals. For example, collisions between nearly equal-sized, porous planetesimals can melt all, or nearly all, of the mass of the bodies at collision velocities below 7kms-1. For collisions of small bodies into larger ones, such as those with an impactor-to-target mass ratio below 0.1, significant localised heating occurs in the target body. At impact velocities as low as 5kms-1, the mass of melt will be nearly double the mass of the impactor, and the mass of material shock heated by 100K will be nearly 10 times the mass of the impactor. We present a first-order estimate of the cumulative effects of impact heating on a porous planetesimal parent body by simulating the impact of a population of small bodies until a disruptive event occurs. Before disruption, impact heating is volumetrically minor and highly localised; in no case was more than about 3% of the parent body heated by more than 100K. However, heating during the final disruptive collision can be significant; in about 10% of cases, almost all of the parent body is heated to 700K (from an initial temperature of ~300K) and more than a tenth of the parent body mass is melted. Hence, energetic collisions between planetesimals could have had important effects on the thermal evolution of primitive materials in the early Solar System. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

VL  - 23
IS  - 9
SP  - 1979-1988
AB  - Geographical variation in traits related to fitness is often the result of adaptive evolution. Stress resistance traits in Drosophila often show clinal variation, suggesting that selection affects resistance traits either directly or indirectly. Multiple stress resistance traits were investigated in 45 natural populations of Drosophila ananassae collected from all over India. There was significant positive correlation between starvation resistance and lipid content. Significant negative correlations between desiccation and lipid content and between desiccation and heat resistance were also found. Flies from lower latitudes had higher starvation resistance, heat resistance and lipid content but the pattern was reversed for desiccation resistance. These results suggest that flies from different localities varied in their susceptibility to starvation because of difference in their propensity to store body lipid. Multiple regression analysis provided evidence of climatic selection driven by latitudinal variation in the seasonal amplitude of temperature and humidity changes within the Indian. Finally, our results suggest a high degree of variation in stress resistance at the population level in D. ananassae. © 2010 The Authors.

VL  - 87

SP  - 222-230
AB  - Physiological function in ectotherms is tightly linked to body temperature. As a result, the thermal sensitivity of physiological function may evolve to optimize fitness across different thermal environments. One hypothesis for the evolution of thermal sensitivity, coadaptation, predicts that optimal temperatures for performance should evolve to match the temperatures that an organism experiences in nature. Another hypothesis, countergradient variation, posits that genetic variation can compensate for decreased performance in cool environments, leading to physiological phenotypes that do not track environmental temperatures. On Mo'orea, French Polynesia, thermal ecology and physiology were studied in two morphologically similar skinks that differ in habitat use. Previous studies show that Emoia impar tends to inhabit closed-canopy and interior habitats that are cooler compared to those inhabited by Emoia cyanura, but these differences had not been quantified on Mo'orea. The goal of this study was to determine whether this pattern of habitat partitioning exists on Mo'orea and relates to interspecific differences in thermal physiology and to evaluate whether the evolution of thermal sensitivity supports coadaptation or countergradient variation. I found that E. impar inhabits closedcanopy habitats with cooler substrates and with higher altitudes compared to habitats of E. cyanura. Although the two species do not differ significantly in critical thermal minimum, E. impar has a significantly lower preferred body temperature and critical thermal maximum than does E. cyanura. Despite a preference for cooler habitats and temperatures, E. impar has a warmer optimal temperature for sprint speed and sprints faster than E. cyanura at all temperatures, which supports the countergradient model of thermal adaptation. These results are robust to three different curve-fitting functions and support the view that generalist/ specialist trade-offs do not universally constrain the evolution of performance curves. © 2014 by The University of Chicago.

VL  - 58

SP  - 812-819
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the variance of incubation temperature may have constituted a significant selective force for reptilian viviparity, we incubated eggs of the slender forest skink Scincella modesta in five thermally different natural nests and at two constant temperatures (18 degrees C and 21 degrees C). Our manipulation of incubation temperature had significant effects on incubation length and several hatchling traits (snout-vent length, tail length, fore-limb length, and sprint speed), but not on hatching success and other hatchling traits examined (body mass, head size, and hind-limb length). Incubation length was nonlinearly sensitive to temperature, but it was not correlated with the thermal variance when holding the thermal mean constant. The 18 degrees C treatment not only produced smaller sized hatchlings but also resulted in decreased sprint speed. Eggs in the nest with the greatest proportion of temperatures higher than 28 degrees C also produced smaller sized hatchlings. None of the hatchling traits examined was affected by the thermal variance. Thermal fluctuations did result in longer incubation times, but females would benefit little from maintaining stable body temperatures or selecting thermally stable nests in terms of the reduced incubation length. Our data show that the mean rather than the variance of temperatures has a key role in influencing incubation length and hatchling phenotypes, and thus do not support the hypothesis tested [Current Zoology 58 (6): 812-819, 2012].

TI  - Overcoming biotic and abiotic stresses in the Solanaceae through grafting: Current status and future perspectives
VL  - 30
IS  - 4
SP  - 272-287
AB  - This paper reviews the status of the use of grafting in two solanaceous crops of global importance, tomato and eggplant, for the control of biotic and abiotic stresses. Flooding and soil-borne diseases cause severe crop losses of tomato during the hot and wet summer months in the lowland tropics. Asian Vegetable Research and Development Center (AVRDC) recommended since 2003 the use of eggplant rootstocks VI046103 (EG195) and VI045276 (EG203) for grafting tomato scions to provide a high degree of tolerance and resistance against flooding, bacterial wilt, root-knot nematodes and other soil-borne diseases. These two eggplant rootstocks and the tomato rootstock VI043614 (Hawaii 7996) are widely used in Southeast and East Asia for successful tomato production in both the tropical lowlands and highlands, providing significant economic returns to farmers. Given the rapid evolution of plant pathogens that might cause a breakdown of the limited rootstocks currently available, as well as the challenges of other abiotic stresses such as salinity and supra-optimal temperatures, it is necessary to expand the search for new rootstocks and evaluate new rootstock-scion combinations. Breeding and evaluation of appropriate rootstocks is still a matter of trial and error because desired rootstock traits, especially for abiotic stresses, are quite complex and regulated by multiple genes. Physiological and genetic markers to guide the selection process are still lacking but are essential to fast-track the identification of rootstocks with multiple benefits. This review supports an initiative to upgrade grafting technology through evaluation of a new and wider range of rootstocks sourced from the AVRDC genebank. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Composting is a solid waste treatment process consisting of the biochemical degradation of organic materials. A controlled microbial aerobic decomposition produces stabilized organic materials to be used as soil conditioners or organic fertilizers. The efficiency of this process is Strongly temperature-dependent and the key to successful composting lies in the tracking of an appropriate temperature batch curve based on experience and related to a complex succession of differing microbial activities. Such a complexity is modelled in this paper with a fuzzy structure composed of clustered antecedents, describing the process regimes, and consequent linear models driven by the aeration cycle and in-cycle temperature evolution. This fuzzy model was adapted to the data by cluster training and minimization of a model/data error criterion. The calibrated model was able to describe the temperature profile during the most significant part of the composting batch. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 29
IS  - 4
SP  - 562-569
AB  - Variation in the strength of age-dependent natural selection shapes differences in ageing rates across species and populations. Likewise, sexual selection can promote divergent patterns of senescence across the sexes. However, the effects of these processes on the evolution of ageing have largely been considered independently, and interactions between them are poorly understood. We use experimental evolution to investigate how natural and sexual selection affect life span and ageing in Drosophila simulans. Replicate populations were evolved under lifetime monogamy (relaxed sexual selection) or lifetime polyandry (elevated sexual selection) and at one of two temperatures, 25 °C (relaxed natural selection) or 27 °C (enhanced natural selection), in a fully factorial design. We measured longevity in 150 individually housed flies taken from each of three replicate populations per selection regime. We found that natural and sexual selection affected the evolution of life span via sex-specific effects on different ageing parameters (ageing rate vs. baseline mortality): natural selection reduced the rate of ageing in both sexes but increased male baseline mortality, while sexual selection elevated baseline mortality in both sexes but particularly in males. This means that sexual and natural selection interacted to reduce male life span but acted on female life span by independently affecting particular ageing parameters. Sex-specific effects of sexual and natural selection may help explain the diverse patterns of ageing seen in nature but complicate predictions about how ageing and life span evolve across the sexes. © 2014 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Advanced Heat Map and Clustering Analysis Using Heatmap3
VL  - 2014
AB  - Heat maps and clustering are used frequently in expression analysis studies for data visualization and quality control. Simple clustering and heat maps can be produced from the "heatmap" function in R. However, the "heatmap" function lacks certain functionalities and customizability, preventing it from generating advanced heat maps and dendrograms. To tackle the limitations of the "heatmap" function, we have developed an R package "heatmap3" which significantly improves the original "heatmap" function by adding several more powerful and convenient features. The "heatmap3" package allows users to produce highly customizable state of the art heat maps and dendrograms. The "heatmap3" package is developed based on the "heatmap" function in R, and it is completely compatible with it. The new features of "heatmap3" include highly customizable legends and side annotation, a wider range of color selections, new labeling features which allow users to define multiple layers of phenotype variables, and automatically conducted association tests based on the phenotypes provided. Additional features such as different agglomeration methods for estimating distance between two samples are also added for clustering. © 2014 Shilin Zhao et al.

TI  - Specificity of genome evolution in experimental populations of Escherichia coli evolved at different temperatures
VL  - 114
IS  - 10
SP  - E1904-E1912
AB  - Isolated populations derived from a common ancestor are expected to diverge genetically and phenotypically as they adapt to different local environments. To examine this process, 30 populations of Escherichia coli were evolved for 2,000 generations, with six in each of five different thermal regimes: constant 20°C, 32°C, 37°C, 42°C, and daily alternations between 32°C and 42°C. Here, we sequenced the genomes of one endpoint clone from each population to test whether the history of adaptation in different thermal regimes was evident at the genomic level. The evolved strains had accumulated ∼5.3 mutations, on average, and exhibited distinct signatures of adaptation to the different environments. On average, two strains that evolved under the same regime exhibited ∼17% overlap in which genes were mutated, whereas pairs that evolved under different conditions shared only ∼4%. For example, all six strains evolved at 32°C had mutations in nadR, whereas none of the other 24 strains did. However, a population evolved at 37°C for an additional 18,000 generations eventually accumulated mutations in the signature genes strongly associated with adaptation to the other temperature regimes. Two mutations that arose in one temperature treatment tended to be beneficial when tested in the others, although less so than in the regime in which they evolved. These findings demonstrate that genomic signatures of adaptation can be highly specific, even with respect to subtle environmental differences, but that this imprint may become obscured over longer timescales as populations continue to change and adapt to the shared features of their environments. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

TI  - Curvature evolution of porcelain tile during firing
VL  - 820

AB  - Planarity is one of indispensable attribute of a ceramic tile quality. During the firing changes on curvature may be permanent causing damage on quality and productivity. The objective was to evaluate curvature evolution on porcelain tile during heating stage of firing. Effects of engobe and glaze coating were evaluated. The performance of two compositions of porcelain tile was studied on industrial (1000 mm x 500 mm x 10 mm) and laboratorial (100 mm x 50 mm x 6 mm) scale. Industrial test pieces were fired at 950 and 1200°C. Final curvature was measured by conventional dial indicator. Curvature evolution of laboratorial test pieces was evaluated by thermal fleximetry from 25 to 1200°C. This characterization was capable to identify very significant positive curvature deflection on temperature range from 930 to 1200°C, directly associated to permanent planarity defects. Differences on composition affect significantly the curvature evolution. © (2015) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

TI  - Widespread phenotypic and genetic divergence along altitudinal gradients in animals
VL  - 26
IS  - 12
SP  - 2527-2543
AB  - Altitudinal gradients offer valuable study systems to investigate how adaptive genetic diversity is distributed within and between natural populations and which factors promote or prevent adaptive differentiation. The environmental clines along altitudinal gradients tend to be steep relative to the dispersal distance of many organisms, providing an opportunity to study the joint effects of divergent natural selection and gene flow. Temperature is one variable showing consistent altitudinal changes, and altitudinal gradients can therefore provide spatial surrogates for some of the changes anticipated under climate change. Here, we investigate the extent and patterns of adaptive divergence in animal populations along altitudinal gradients by surveying the literature for (i) studies on phenotypic variation assessed under common garden or reciprocal transplant designs and (ii) studies looking for signatures of divergent selection at the molecular level. Phenotypic data show that significant between-population differences are common and taxonomically widespread, involving traits such as mass, wing size, tolerance to thermal extremes and melanization. Several lines of evidence suggest that some of the observed differences are adaptively relevant, but rigorous tests of local adaptation or the link between specific phenotypes and fitness are sorely lacking. Evidence for a role of altitudinal adaptation also exists for a number of candidate genes, most prominently haemoglobin, and for anonymous molecular markers. Novel genomic approaches may provide valuable tools for studying adaptive diversity, also in species that are not amenable to experimentation. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Craters on comets
VL  - 107
IS  - 1
SP  - 53-63
AB  - This paper reviews the observations of crater-like features on cometary nuclei. We compare potential crater sizes and morphologies, and we discuss the probability of impacts between small asteroids in the Main Belt and a comet crossing this region of the Solar System. Finally, we investigate the fate of the impactor and its chances of survival on the nucleus. We find that comets do undergo impacts although the rapid evolution of the surface erases most of the features and make craters difficult to detect. In the case of a collision between a rocky body and a highly porous cometary nucleus, two specific crater morphologies can be formed: a central pit surrounded by a shallow depression, or a pit, deeper than typical craters observed on rocky surfaces. After the impact, it is likely that a significant fraction of the projectile will remain in the crater. During its two years long escort of comet 67P/Churyumov Gerasimenko, ESA's mission Rosetta should be able to detect specific silicates signatures at the bottom of craters or crater-like features, as evidence of this contamination. For large craters, structural changes in the impacted region, in particular compaction of material, will affect the local activity. The increase of tensile strength can extinct the activity by preventing the gas from lifting up dust grains. On the other hand, material compaction can help the heat flux to travel deeper in the nucleus, potentially reaching unexposed pockets of volatiles, and therefore increasing the activity. Ground truth data from Rosetta will help us infer the relative importance of those two effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 162

SP  - 939-944
AB  - The environment is rarely constant and organisms are exposed to spatial and temporal variation that will impact life-histories. It is important to understand how such variation affects the adaptation of organisms to their local environment. We compare the adaptation of populations of the ciliate Paramecium caudatum exposed to constant (23 degrees C or 35 degrees C) and temporally variable temperature environments (random daily fluctuations between 23 degrees C or 35 degrees C). Consistent with theory, our experiment shows the evolution of specialists when evolution proceeds in constant environments and generalists when the environment is temporally variable. In addition, we demonstrate costs for specialists of being locally adapted through reduced fitness in novel environments. Conversely, we do not find any costs for generalists, as all populations from variable environments had equal or superior performance to specialists in their own environment. The lack of a cost for generalists is emphasised by the presence of a super generalist that has the highest performance at both assay temperatures.

AB  - A previously established multiscale population genetics model posits that fitness can be inferred from the physical properties of proteins under the physiological assumption that a loss of stability by any protein confers the lethal phenotype to an organism. Here, we develop this model further by positing that replication rate (fitness) of a bacterial or viral strain directly depends on the copy number of folded proteins, which determine its replication rate. Using this model, and both numerical and analytical approaches, we studied the adaptation process of bacteria and viruses at varied environmental temperatures. We found that a broad distribution of protein stabilities observed in the model and in experiment is the key determinant of thermal response for viruses and bacteria. Our results explain most of the earlier experimental observations: the striking asymmetry of thermal response curves; the absence of evolutionary tradeoff, which was expected but not found in experiments; correlation between denaturation temperature for several protein families and the optimal growth temperature of their carrier organisms; and proximity of bacterial or viral optimal growth temperatures to their evolutionary temperatures. Our theory quantitatively and with high accuracy described thermal response curves for 35 bacterial species using, for each species, only two adjustable parameters-the number of rate-determining genes and the energy barrier for metabolic reactions. © 2010 by the Biophysical Society.

VL  - 14
IS  - 3
SP  - 254-261
AB  - In most temperate insects, diapause strategies and voltinism generally exhibit latitudinal clines, supporting the concept that they represent adaptations to climate. In contrast, in the satyrine butterfly Ypthima multistriata Butler, local populations with different voltinism patterns are geographically intermingled, suggesting that life-history traits related to diapause may differ even between geographically and phylogenetically close populations. In this study, we experimentally examined the critical photoperiod for diapause induction and the larval developmental period in two univoltine and two bivoltine populations of Y. multistriata, all of which inhabit virtually the same latitude (34.652-34.750°N). We found that the critical photoperiod for diapause induction was longer in the univoltine populations than in the bivoltine populations. Moreover, the larval period under the long day length treatment was different among populations in both sexes, although significant differences were also detected between populations with the same voltinism. These results indicate that in Y. multistriata, life-history traits related to diapause can not be attributed merely to climatic conditions such as temperature or day length, which depend largely on latitude. Therefore, we suggest that biotic elements, such as leaf toughness, as well as abiotic elements should be taken into account in attempts to explain the enigmatic pattern of geographic variation in the diapause strategies of Y. multistriata. © 2011 The Entomological Society of Japan.

VL  - 4
IS  - 9
SP  - 1657-1665
AB  - Experimental evolution studies, coupled with new advances in DNA sequencing technology, have become a powerful tool for exploring how populations respond to selection at the genomic level. Recent experiments in microbes typically have found evidence for multiple novel mutations, which are usually fixed. In contrast, in animal model systems, evolutionary responses seem to involve more modest changes in the frequencies of pre-existing alleles, probably because these populations outcross and are usually initialized with greater levels of standing variation. In this experiment, I used whole-genome resequencing to estimate allele frequencies and look for novel substitutions in experimentally evolved populations of Caenorhabditis elegans. These populations were founded with a fixed pair of deleterious mutations introgressed into multiple wild genetic backgrounds and allowed to evolve for 50 generations with a mixed mating system. There is evidence for some recombination between ancestral haplotypes, but selective sweeps seem to have resulted in the fixation of large chromosomal segments throughout most of the genome. In addition, a few new mutations were detected. Simulations suggest that strong selection and low outcrossing rates are likely explanations for the observed outcomes, consistent with earlier work showing large fitness increases in these populations over 50 generations. These results also show clear parallels to population genetic patterns in C. elegans in nature: recent selective sweeps, high linkage disequilibrium, and low effective recombination rates. Thus, the genomic consequences of selection depend heavily on the biology of the organism in question, including its mating system and levels of genetic variation. © 2014 Chandler.

VL  - 68
SP  - 53-62
AB  - The determination of thermophysical properties from an inverse method is an attractive technique both from the experimental and methodological point of view. The aim of this paper is to identify simultaneously the thermal conductivity and the thermal diffusivity of liquids and the heat transfer coefficient by the utilization of the well-known flash method which is coupled to an inverse parameter identification method. To be characterized, a thin layer of the liquid is sandwiched between two metal plates and a cylindrical sample holder. Then it is subjected on its front face to a heat flux density during a short time. The temperature evolution of the rear face of the container is measured during and after the thermal excitation. The identification procedure based on the inverse method consists in the minimization of an objective function that represents the errors between the measured temperature at the rear face and a theoretical model that describes the temperature evolution of the system (liquid and container). The theoretical model, which is a function of the unknown thermophysical properties of the three layer system, is calculated by the use of the thermal quadrupoles formalism. To minimize the objective function, a genetic algorithm is developed and used. Genetic algorithm is categorized as global search heuristics. It is an iterative procedure which borrows the ideas of natural selection and survival of the fittest from natural evolution which were first described by Darwin. The identification procedure based on the use the flash method and the developed genetic algorithm is used in this work to identify thermophysical properties of distilled water, glycerol, acetone, and ethylene glycol. A good agreement is found between our experimental results and the thermophysical properties indicated in the literature of the studied liquids. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

VL  - 43
IS  - 13
SP  - 6775-6782
AB  - The New Horizons spacecraft has found evidence for geologic activity on the surface of Pluto, including extensional tectonic deformation of its water ice bedrock see Moore et al. (2016). One mechanism that could drive extensional tectonic activity is global surface expansion due to the partial freezing of an ocean. We use updated physical properties for Pluto and simulate its thermal evolution to understand the survival of a possible subsurface ocean. For thermal conductivities of rock less than 3 W m−1 K−1, an ocean forms and at least partially freezes, leading to recent extensional stresses in the ice shell. In scenarios where the ocean freezes and the ice shell is thicker than 260 km, ice II forms and causes global volume contraction. Since there is no evidence for recent compressional tectonic features, we argue that ice II has not formed and that Pluto's ocean has likely survived to present day. ©2016.

VL  - 6
IS  - 10
AB  - Twelve replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster, all derived from a common ancestor, were independently evolved for 34+ generations in one of three treatment environments of varying PO 2: hypoxia (5.0-10.1 kPa), normoxia (21.3 kPa), and hyperoxia (40.5 kPa). Several traits related to whole animal performance and metabolism were assayed at various stages via "common garden" and reciprocal transplant assays to directly compare evolved and acclimatory differences among treatments. Results clearly demonstrate the evolution of a greater tolerance to acute hypoxia in the hypoxia-evolved populations, consistent with adaptation to this environment. Greater hypoxia tolerance was associated with an increase in citrate synthase activity in fly homogenate when compared to normoxic (control) populations, suggesting an increase in mitochondrial volume density in these populations. In contrast, no direct evidence of increased performance of the hyperoxia-evolved populations was detected, although a significant decrease in the tolerance of these populations to acute hypoxia suggests a cost to adaptation to hyperoxia. Hyperoxia-evolved populations had lower productivity overall (i.e., across treatment environments) and there was no evidence that hypoxia or hyperoxia-evolved populations had greatest productivity or longevity in their respective treatment environments, suggesting that these assays failed to capture the components of fitness relevant to adaptation. © 2011 Charette et al.

VL  - 73
IS  - 6
SP  - 1114-1122
AB  - This study examines micro-evolutionary aspects of a natural Daphnia magna population exposed to Cd. To this end, a set of hypotheses related to micro-evolutionary responses and to how these are influenced by temperature and Cd stress, were tested. Life-table experiments were conducted with 14 D. magna clones collected from an unpolluted lake following a 2 x 2 design with Cd concentration and temperature as the factors (control vs. 5 mu g/L cadmium, 20 vs. 24 degrees C). Several fitness traits were monitored during 21 days. Our results demonstrate (1) that chemicals can have effects on key population genetic characteristics such as genetic variation and between-trait correlations and (2) that these effects may differ depending on temperature. Their findings also suggests that further research is needed to understand the importance of combined chemical-global warming stress for micro-evolutionary responses of organisms. These aspects are currently not accounted for in any regulatory environmental risk assessment procedure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

VL  - 7

AB  - Increasing climate variability may pose an even greater risk to species than climate warming because temperature fluctuations can amplify adverse impacts of directional warming on fitness-related traits. Here, the influence of directional warming and increasing climate variability on marine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) offspring size variation was investigated by simulating changes to the mean and variance of ocean temperatures predicted under climate change. Reproductive traits of mothers and offspring size reaction norms across four climate scenarios were examined to assess the roles of standing genetic variation, transgenerational and within-generation plasticity in adaptive potential. Mothers acclimated to directional warming produced smaller eggs than mothers in constant, ambient temperatures, whereas mothers in a predictably variable environment (weekly change between temperatures) produced a range of egg sizes, possibly reflecting a diversified bet hedging strategy. Offspring size post-hatch was mostly influenced by genotype by environment interactions and not transgenerational effects. Offspring size reaction norms also differed depending on the type of environmental predictability (predictably variable vs. stochastic), with offspring reaching the largest sizes in the stochastic environment. Release of cryptic genetic variation for offspring size in the stochastic environment suggests hidden evolutionary potential in this wild population to respond to changes in environmental predictability. © 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Impact of thermal stress on evolutionary trajectories of pathogen resistance in three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Pathogens are a major regulatory force for host populations, especially under stressful conditions. Elevated temperatures may enhance the development of pathogens, increase the number of transmission stages, and can negatively influence host susceptibility depending on host thermal tolerance. As a net result, this can lead to a higher prevalence of epidemics during summer months. These conditions also apply to marine ecosystems, where possible ecological impacts and the population-specific potential for evolutionary responses to changing environments and increasing disease prevalence are, however, less known. Therefore, we investigated the influence of thermal stress on the evolutionary trajectories of disease resistance in three marine populations of three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus by combining the effects of elevated temperature and infection with a bacterial strain of Vibrio sp. using a common garden experiment. Results: We found that thermal stress had an impact on fish weight and especially on survival after infection after only short periods of thermal acclimation. Environmental stress reduced genetic differentiation (QST) between populations by releasing cryptic within-population variation. While life history traits displayed positive genetic correlations across environments with relatively weak genotype by environment interactions (GxE), environmental stress led to negative genetic correlations across environments in pathogen resistance. This reversal of genetic effects governing resistance is probably attributable to changing environment-dependent virulence mechanisms of the pathogen interacting differently with host genotypes, i.e. GPathogenxGHostxE or (GPathogenxE)x(GHostxE) interactions, rather than to pure host genetic effects, i.e. GHostxE interactions. Conclusion: To cope with climatic changes and the associated increase in pathogen virulence, host species require wide thermal tolerances and pathogen-resistant genotypes. The higher resistance we found for some families at elevated temperatures showed that there is evolutionary potential for resistance to Vibrio sp. in both thermal environments. The negative genetic correlation of pathogen resistance between thermal environments, on the other hand, indicates that adaptation to current conditions can be a weak predictor for performance in changing environments. The observed feedback on selective gradients exerted on life history traits may exacerbate this effect, as it can also modify the response to selection for other vital components of fitness. © 2014 Schade et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

TI  - Fisheries-induced evolution in growth, maturation and reproductive investment of the sexually dimorphic North Sea plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L.)
VL  - 64
IS  - 1
SP  - 85-93
AB  - Changes in the onset of sexual maturation, reproductive investment and growth of North Sea plaice are studied between three periods: 1900s, 1980s and 2000s. Probabilistic maturation reaction norms of both males and females, describing the probability of becoming mature conditional on age and size, shifted towards smaller sizes and younger ages, indicating a fisheries-induced evolutionary change. A higher rate of change was observed during the past 20 years, which may be related to higher temperature conditions. Reproductive investment was estimated from the decrease in lipid, protein, dry weight content and condition factor of the whole body between pre- and post-spawning adults. Reproductive investment expressed as the energy loss over the spawning period increased with body size from 19% at 20 cm to 30% at 40 cm in males and from 35% at 30 cm to 48% at 50 cm in females. No change in reproductive investment could be detected between the 1980s and the 2000s. Von Bertalanffy (VB) growth parameters showed a decrease in L-infinity the asymptotic size and an increase in K, the velocity to reach L-infinity, in both males and females. The changes in VB growth are consistent with an increase in energy acquisition and reproductive investment. The observed changes in maturation, reproductive investment and growth are consistent with fisheries-induced evolution, but the changes in reproductive investment and growth need further investigation to disentangle the role of phenotypic plasticity.

TI  - Predictable variation of range-sizes across an extreme environmental gradient in a lizard adaptive radiation: Evolutionary and ecological inferences
VL  - 6
IS  - 12
AB  - Large-scale patterns of current species geographic range-size variation reflect historical dynamics of dispersal and provide insights into future consequences under changing environments. Evidence suggests that climate warming exerts major damage on high latitude and elevation organisms, where changes are more severe and available space to disperse tracking historical niches is more limited. Species with longer generations (slower adaptive responses), such as vertebrates, and with restricted distributions (lower genetic diversity, higher inbreeding) in these environments are expected to be particularly threatened by warming crises. However, a well-known macroecological generalization (Rapoport's rule) predicts that species range-sizes increase with increasing latitude-elevation, thus counterbalancing the impact of climate change. Here, I investigate geographic range-size variation across an extreme environmental gradient and as a function of body size, in the prominent Liolaemus lizard adaptive radiation. Conventional and phylogenetic analyses revealed that latitudinal (but not elevational) ranges significantly decrease with increasing latitude-elevation, while body size was unrelated to range-size. Evolutionarily, these results are insightful as they suggest a link between spatial environmental gradients and range-size evolution. However, ecologically, these results suggest that Liolaemus might be increasingly threatened if, as predicted by theory, ranges retract and contract continuously under persisting climate warming, potentially increasing extinction risks at high latitudes and elevations. © 2011 Daniel Pincheira-Donoso.

VL  - 22

SP  - 4162-4168
AB  - Ocean warming may lead to smaller body sizes of marine ectotherms, because metabolic rates increase exponentially with temperature while the capacity of the cardiorespiratory system to match enhanced oxygen demands is limited. Here, we explore the impact of rising sea water temperatures on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), an economically important fish species. We focus on changes in the temperature-dependent growth potential by a transfer function model combining growth observations with climate model ensemble temperatures. Growth potential is expressed in terms of asymptotic body weight and depends on water temperature. We consider changes between the periods 1985–2004 and 2081–2100, assuming that future sea water temperatures will evolve according to climate projections for IPCC AR5 scenario RCP8.5. Our model projects a response of Atlantic cod to future warming, differentiated according to ocean regions, leading to increases of asymptotic weight in the Barents Sea, while weights are projected to decline at the southern margin of the biogeographic range. Southern spawning areas will disappear due to thermal limitation of spawning stages. These projections match the currently observed biogeographic shifts and the temperature- and oxygen-dependent decline in routine aerobic scope at southern distribution limits. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Vector life-history traits and parasite development respond in strongly nonlinear ways to changes in temperature. These thermal sensitivities create the potential for climate change to have a marked impact on disease transmission. To date, most research considering impacts of climate change on vector-borne diseases assumes that all populations of a given parasite or vector species respond similarly to temperature, regardless of their source population. This may be an inappropriate assumption because spatial variation in selective pressures such as temperature can lead to local adaptation. We examine evidence for local adaptation in disease vectors and present conceptual models for understanding how local adaptation might modulate the effects of both short- and long-term changes in climate. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Do ectotherms partition thermal resources? We still do not know
VL  - 183
IS  - 2
SP  - 337-345
AB  - Partitioning of the niche space is a mechanism used to explain the coexistence of similar species. Ectotherms have variable body temperatures and their body temperatures influence performance and, ultimately, fitness. Therefore, many ectotherms use behavioral thermoregulation to avoid reduced capacities associated with body temperatures far from the optimal temperature for performance. Several authors have proposed that thermal niche partitioning in response to interspecific competition is a mechanism that allows the coexistence of similar species of ectotherms. We reviewed studies on thermal resource partitioning to evaluate the evidence for this hypothesis. In almost all studies, there was insufficient evidence to conclude unequivocally that thermal resource partitioning allowed species coexistence. Future studies should include sites where species are sympatric and sites where they are allopatric to rule out alternative mechanisms that cause differences in thermal traits between coexisting species. There is evidence of conservatism in the evolution of most thermal traits across a wide range of taxa, but thermal performance curves and preferred temperatures do respond to strong selection under laboratory conditions. Thus, there is potential for selection to act on thermal traits in response to interspecific competition. Nevertheless, more stringent tests of the thermal resource partitioning hypothesis are required before we can assess whether it is widespread in communities of ectotherms in nature. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A full-scale multi-disc clutch test bench was set up and some sliding experiments were conducted to investigate the temperature evolution processes in low and high lubrication regimes. Friction discs with single friction lining were used and arranged back-to-back in order to preserve possible evidences of buckling. Temperatures were measured with thermocouples from four different radii on the mid-plane of the separator disc. Two different kinds of temperature variation processes with obvious critical points of cone shape buckling were obtained. These temperatures can be divided into three effective stages that represent different deformation status of the discs in these experiments. The temperature fields in the contacting separator disc and friction disc were studied through a transient heat conduction model, and the results show that the temperatures measured by the thermocouples from the separator disc can represent the average temperatures in both of the separator disc and friction disc for a long sliding time. By comparing the computational critical moments of the friction components with the experimental results, the capability of the curved beam model for predicting the critical moments of cone buckling was validated. © 2015 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Recent research has filled many gaps about Caenorhabditis natural history, simultaneously exposing how much remains to be discovered. This awareness now provides means of connecting ecological and evolutionary theory with diverse biological patterns within and among species in terms of adaptation, sexual selection, breeding systems, speciation, and other phenomena. Moreover, the heralded laboratory tractability of C. elegans, and Caenorhabditis species generally, provides a powerful case study for experimental hypothesis testing about evolutionary and ecological processes to levels of detail unparalleled by most study systems. Here, I synthesize pertinent theory with what we know and suspect about Caenorhabditis natural history for salient features of biodiversity, phenotypes, population dynamics, and interactions within and between species. I identify topics of pressing concern to advance Caenorhabditis biology and to study general evolutionary processes, including the key opportunities to tackle problems in dispersal dynamics, competition, and the dimensionality of niche space. © 2015 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Cold tolerance in flour beetle species differing in body size and selection temperature
VL  - 39
IS  - 1
SP  - 80-87
AB  - Cold tolerance is an important trait directly related to survival and hence fitness. In the present study, the link is addressed between cold tolerance and body size, which is associated with many key fitness traits, at both the intra- and interspecific levels. Specifically, chill coma recovery time, as a metric of cold tolerance, is examined in five related flour beetle species (four of them belonging to the genus Tribolium), two additional Tribolium castaneum Herbst populations selected for higher temperatures, and a mutant showing reduced body size. Recovery times are negatively correlated with the species average body size but not within each species. Females usually recover faster than males, although this difference is significant in only a single species, and is unrelated to body size. Repeating the experimental procedure with the same individuals, after 2 days in isolation with a limited amount of food, results in longer recovery times. Therefore, even if cold acclimation takes place, its influence appears to be diminished by the deleterious effects associated with the experimental procedure. Hence, the findings provide evidence for an association between body size and cold tolerance in the genus Tribolium, with larger species recovering faster from chill than smaller species. By contrast, the smalleyed flour beetle Palorus ratzeburgii Wissmann does not follow this pattern. Additionally, a population of T. castaneum selected for the highest temperature takes longer to recover from chill coma, indicating a trade-off between cold and heat adaptations and not to a cross-protection effect, as sometimes demonstrated. © 2014 The Royal Entomological Society.

VL  - 139
IS  - 22
AB  - The low frequency depolarized Raman spectra of 100 mg/ml aqueous solutions of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) have been collected in the 25-85 degrees C range. Short and long exposures to high temperatures have been used to modulate the competition between the thermally induced reversible and irreversible denaturation processes. A peculiar temperature evolution of spectra is evidenced under prolonged exposure of the protein solution at temperatures higher than 65 degrees C. This result is connected to the self-assembling of polypeptide chains and testifies the sensitivity of the technique to the properties of both protein molecule and its surrounding. Solvent free spectra have been obtained after subtraction of elastic and solvent components and assigned to a genuine vibrational contribution of hydrated HEWL. A straight similarity is observed between the solvent-free THz Raman feature and the vibrational density of states as obtained by molecular dynamics simulations; according to this, we verify the relation between this spectroscopic observable and the effective protein volume, and distinguish the properties of this latter respect to those of the hydration shell in the pre-melting region.

TI  - Thermal plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster populations from eastern Australia: quantitative traits to transcripts
VL  - 29
IS  - 12
SP  - 2447-2463
AB  - The flexibility afforded to genotypes in different environments by phenotypic plasticity is of interest to biologists studying thermal adaptation because of the thermal lability of many traits. Differences in thermal performance and reaction norms can provide insight into the evolution of thermal adaptation to explore broader questions such as species distributions and persistence under climate change. One approach is to study the effects of temperature on fitness, morphological and more recently gene expression traits in populations from different climatic origins. The diverse climatic conditions experienced by Drosophila melanogaster along the eastern Australian temperate-tropical gradient are ideal given the high degree of continuous trait differentiation, but reaction norm variation has not been well studied in this system. Here, we reared a tropical and temperate population from the ends of the gradient over six developmental temperatures and examined reaction norm variation for five quantitative traits including thermal performance for fecundity, and reaction norms for thermotolerance, body size, viability and 23 transcript-level traits. Despite genetic variation for some quantitative traits, we found no differentiation between the populations for fecundity thermal optima and breadth, and the reaction norms for the other traits were largely parallel, supporting previous work suggesting that thermal evolution occurs by changes in trait means rather than by reaction norm shifts. We examined reaction norm variation in our expanded thermal regime for a gene set shown to previously exhibit GxE for expression plasticity in east Australian flies, as well as key heat-shock genes. Although there were differences in curvature between the populations suggesting a higher degree of thermal plasticity in expression patterns than for the quantitative traits, we found little evidence to support a role for genetic variation in maintaining expression plasticity. © 2016 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Respiratory response to temperature of three populations of Aurelia aurita polyps in northern Europe
VL  - 12
IS  - 5
AB  - The benthic life stage (polyp or scyphistoma) of the bloom-forming jellyfish, Aurelia aurita (Linnaeus, 1759), also known as the moon jellyfish, contributes to the seasonal occurrence and abundance of medusa blooms via asexual reproduction. A. aurita is widely distributed in coastal areas in northern Europe, and one of the most studied jellyfish species. While the physiology of the visible medusa is largely understood, understanding of the physiology of the perennial benthic life-stage is scarce. To measure the physiological tolerance of A. aurita, the scyphistoma's temperature sensitivity across its distributional range was investigated. Respiration rates of polyps from three northern European locations exposed to 11 temperatures between 2 and 22ÊC were measured. There was a significant difference in respiration rate among the three polyp populations, which may reflect on differences in their thermal tolerance window. A critical temperature was reached at 14ÊC with the metabolic rate decreasing below and above that temperature. This pattern was less pronounced in the Norwegian population but polyps were able to survive, at least temporarily, those temperatures exceeding their natural range. While polyps collected from northern Norway, with a narrow environmental thermal window, displayed a low baseline metabolism with a Q10 value of 1.2, polyps from southern England and Scotland had Q10 values of 1.6 and 2.5, respectively. Differences in polyps' respiration rates across their distributional range suggest that populations have evolved adaptations to local environmental thermal conditions. © 2017 Grelet et al.

TI  - The consequences of alternative parental care tactics in free-ranging pythons in tropical Australia
VL  - 26
IS  - 4
SP  - 812-821
AB  - Life-history theory attributes the evolution of parental care to the benefits to offspring viability outweighing any costs to parental viability. However, the consequences of parental care tactics to parent(s) and the developmental environment have seldom been measured under field conditions. 2.Laboratory research on pythons shows that maternal nest-site selection and egg brooding benefit embryos, but prolonged nest attendance may impose fitness costs to free-ranging females. A population of water pythons (Liasis fuscus) in tropical Australia provides an excellent opportunity to examine this parent-offspring trade-off because females exhibit parental care polymorphism wherein some individuals brood their eggs only briefly (<10 days) post-oviposition ('short brooders') while others remain with their eggs throughout the incubation period (>50 days; 'long brooders'). 3.We used radiotelemetry, temperature and humidity data loggers, ultrasonography, haematological techniques, and habitat analyses to examine the correlates and consequences of maternal nesting decisions in 14 free-ranging female pythons over the 4-month reproductive season. 4.Nest-site selection and maternal attendance enhanced thermal and hydric regimes within the nest. Egg production by reproducing female pythons resulted in high energetic costs (loss of 60% of maternal body mass) and increased parasite load. However, the estimated mass loss because of brooding was (i) low (<5%), (ii) inversely related to fecundity (females that produced relatively large clutches tended to select lower temperatures and thus lost less mass during brooding) and (iii) surprisingly unrelated to brooding duration. Phenotypic traits of short and long brooders were similar, but long brooders had higher haemoparasite burdens prior to oviposition. Clutches of long brooders were laid in more open sites (less canopy cover) and experienced warmer and more humid conditions than did those of short brooders. 5.Together with previous research, we suggest several explanations for the maintenance of maternal care polymorphism within this population, such as a trade-off between offspring number and quality (long brooders may produce fewer clutches during their lifespan but enhance offspring quality). Our study provides detailed measurements of the correlates and consequences of parental care in a free-ranging reptile, and it clarifies the trade-offs mediated by taxonomically widespread maternal decisions (e.g. nest- or oviposition-site selection and nest attendance). © 2012 The Authors.

AB  - Following the initial discovery of the heat shock RNA omega (hsr?) gene of Drosophila melanogaster to be non-coding (nc) and also inducible by cell stress, other stress-inducible long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have been described in diverse organisms. In view of the rapid sequence divergence of lncRNAs, present knowledge of stress trasncriptome is limited and fragmented. Several known stress-related lncRNAs, associated with specific nuclear speckled domains or nucleolus, provide structural base for sequestering diverse RNA-processing/regulatory proteins. Others have roles in transcriptional or translational inhibition during stress or in signaling pathways; functions of several other lncRNAs are not yet known. Most stress-related lncRNAs act primarily by modulating activity of the proteins to which they bind or by sequestering specific sets of proteins away from the active pool. A common emerging theme is that a given lncRNA targets one or more protein/s with key role/s in the cascade of events triggered by the stress and therefore has a widespread integrative effect. Since proteins associate with RNA through short sequence motifs, the overall base sequence of functionally similar ncRNAs is often not conserved except for specific motifs. The rapid evolvability of ncRNA sequences provides elegant modules for adaptability to changing environment as binding of one or the other protein to ncRNA can alter its structure and functions in distinct ways. Thus the stress-related lncRNAs act as hubs in the cellular networks to coordinate activities of the members within and between different networks to maintain cellular homeostasis for survival or to trigger cell death.

TI  - Enhanced sleep is an evolutionarily adaptive response to starvation stress in Drosophila
VL  - 10
IS  - 7
AB  - Animals maximize fitness by modulating sleep and foraging strategies in response to changes in nutrient availability. Wild populations of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, display highly variable levels of starvation and desiccation resistance that differ in accordance with geographic location, nutrient availability, and evolutionary history. Further, flies potently modulate sleep in response to changes in food availability, and selection for starvation resistance enhances sleep, revealing strong genetic relationships between sleep and nutrient availability. To determine the genetic and evolutionary relationship between sleep and nutrient deprivation, we assessed sleep in flies selected for desiccation or starvation resistance. While starvation resistant flies have higher levels of triglycerides, desiccation resistant flies have enhanced glycogen stores, indicative of distinct physiological adaptations to food or water scarcity. Strikingly, selection for starvation resistance, but not desiccation resistance, leads to increased sleep, indicating that enhanced sleep is not a generalized consequence of higher energy stores. Thermotolerance is not altered in starvation or desiccation resistant flies, providing further evidence for context-specific adaptation to environmental stressors. F2 hybrid flies were generated by crossing starvation selected flies with desiccation selected flies, and the relationship between nutrient deprivation and sleep was examined. Hybrids exhibit a positive correlation between starvation resistance and sleep, while no interaction was detected between desiccation resistance and sleep, revealing that prolonged sleep provides an adaptive response to starvation stress. Therefore, these findings demonstrate context-specific evolution of enhanced sleep in response to chronic food deprivation, and provide a model for understanding the evolutionary relationship between sleep and nutrient availability.

TI  - Acclimatization and Adaptive Capacity of Marine Species in a Changing Ocean
VL  - 74
SP  - 69-116
AB  - To persist in an ocean changing in temperature, pH and other stressors related to climate change, many marine species will likely need to acclimatize or adapt to avoid extinction. If marine populations possess adequate genetic variation in tolerance to climate change stressors, species might be able to adapt to environmental change. Marine climate change research is moving away from single life stage studies where individuals are directly placed into projected scenarios (‘future shock’ approach), to focus on the adaptive potential of populations in an ocean that will gradually change over coming decades. This review summarizes studies that consider the adaptive potential of marine invertebrates to climate change stressors and the methods that have been applied to this research, including quantitative genetics, laboratory selection studies and trans- and multigenerational experiments. Phenotypic plasticity is likely to contribute to population persistence providing time for genetic adaptation to occur. Transgenerational and epigenetic effects indicate that the environmental and physiological history of the parents can affect offspring performance. There is a need for long-term, multigenerational experiments to determine the influence of phenotypic plasticity, genetic variation and transgenerational effects on species’ capacity to persist in a changing ocean. However, multigenerational studies are only practicable for short generation species. Consideration of multiple morphological and physiological traits, including changes in molecular processes (eg, DNA methylation) and long-term studies that facilitate acclimatization will be essential in making informed predictions of how the seascape and marine communities will be altered by climate change. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Mechanistic description of population dynamics using dynamic energy budget theory incorporated into integral projection models
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
SP  - 146-154
AB  - Integral projection models (IPMs) provide a powerful approach to investigate ecological and rapid evolutionary change in quantitative life-history characteristics and population dynamics. IPMs are constructed from functions that describe the demographic rates – survival, growth and reproduction – in relation to the characteristics of individuals and their environment. Currently, however, demographic rates are estimated using phenomenological regression models that lack a mechanistic representation of the biological processes that give rise to observed demographic variation. This lack of mechanistic underpinning limits the ability of the model to predict future dynamics under novel environmental conditions because the model ingredients pertain to current environmental conditions only. Here, we use dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory to construct DEB-IPMs based on a mechanistic representation of individual life-history trajectories. We derive the demographic functions describing growth and reproduction from a simple DEB growth model. The functions describing mortality and the association between parent and offspring characteristics do not follow DEB theory and hence are estimated from individual-level observations. We apply the DEB-IPM to two contrasting systems: the small, fast-reproducing bulb mite Rhizoglyphus robini and the large, slow-reproducing reef manta ray Manta alfredi. In both cases, predictions of population growth rate, lifetime reproductive success and generation time agree with empirical observations. In case of the bulb mite, predictions and observations even agree across different feeding conditions. If the DEB energetics model is accepted as describing growth and reproduction, DEB-IPMs can be parameterised using easy-to-collect life cycle information (growth rate, length at birth, maturation and old age) making them suitable for data-deficient species. Because species differ only in these DEB parameters, comparative studies of character and population dynamics between species are straightforward, particularly since DEB-IPMs can be extended to include population feedback on resources, of which we give an example. Most crucially, because DEB theory specifies growth and reproduction rates as explicitly dependent on environmental conditions such as food availability or temperature, DEB-IPMs provide a mechanistic platform to investigate the biological processes that determine joint change in phenotypic characters, life-history traits, population size and community structure. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Natural selection on thermal preference, critical thermal maxima and locomotor performance
VL  - 284
IS  - 1860
AB  - Climate change is resulting in a radical transformation of the thermal quality of habitats across the globe. Whereas species have altered their distributions to cope with changing environments, the evidence for adaptation in response to rising temperatures is limited. However, to determine the potential of adaptation in response to thermal variation, we need estimates of the magnitude and direction of natural selection on traits that are assumed to increase persistence in warmer environments. Most inferences regarding physiological adaptation are based on interspecific analyses, and those of selection on thermal traits are scarce. Here, we estimate natural selection on major thermal traits used to assess the vulnerability of ectothermic organisms to altered thermal niches. We detected significant directional selection favouring lizards with higher thermal preferences and faster sprint performance at their optimal temperature. Our analyses also revealed correlational selection between thermal preference and critical thermal maxima, where individuals that preferred warmer body temperatures with cooler critical thermal maxima were favoured by selection. Recent published estimates of heritability for thermal traits suggest that, in concert with the strong selective pressures we demonstrate here, evolutionary adaptation may promote long-term persistence of ectotherms in altered thermal environments. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

VL  - 180
IS  - 4
SP  - E110-E126
AB  - Understanding biodiversity gradients is a long-standing challenge, and progress requires theory unifying ecology and evolution. Here, we unify concepts related to the speed of evolution, the influence of species richness on diversification, and niche-based coexistence.We focus on the dynamics, through evolutionary time, of community invasibility and species richness across a broad thermal gradient. In our framework, the evolution of body size influences the ecological structure and dynamics of a trophic network, and organismal metabolism ties temperature to eco-evolutionary processes. The framework distinguishes ecological invasibility (governed by ecological interactions) from evolutionary invasibility (governed by local ecology and constraints imposed by small phenotypic effects of mutation). The model yields four primary predictions: (1) ecological invasibility declines through time and with increasing temperature; (2) average evolutionary invasibility across communities increases and then decreases through time as the richness-temperature gradient flattens; (3) in the early stages of diversification, richness and evolutionary invasibility both increase with increasing temperature; and (4) at equilibrium, richness does not vary with temperature, yet evolutionary invasibility decreases with increasing temperature. These predictions emerge from the 'evolutionary-speed' hypothesis, which attempts to account for latitudinal species richness gradients by invoking faster biological rates in warmer, tropical regions. The model contrasts with predictions from other richness-gradient hypotheses, such as "niche conservatism" and "species energy." Empirically testing our model's predictions should help distinguish among these hypotheses. © 2012 by The University of Chicago.

Species with widespread distributions are expected to have evolved higher levels of plasticity compared with those with more restricted, tropical distributions. At the intraspecific level, temperate populations are expected to have evolved higher levels of plasticity than their tropical counterparts. However, empirical support for these expectations is limited. In addition, no studies have comprehensively examined the evolution of thermal plasticity across life stages. Using populations of Drosophila simulans collected from a latitudinal cline spanning the entire east coast of Australia, we assessed thermal plasticity, measured as hardening capacity (the difference between basal and hardened thermal tolerance) for multiple measures of heat and cold tolerance across both adult and larval stages of development. This allowed us to explicitly ask whether the evolution of thermal plasticity is favoured in more variable, temperate environments. We found no relationship between thermal plasticity and latitude, providing little support for the hypothesis that temperate populations have evolved higher levels of thermal plasticity than their tropical counterparts. With the exception of adult heat survival, we also found no association between plasticity and ten climatic variables, indicating that the evolution of thermal plasticity is not easily predicted by the type of environment that a particular population occupies. We discuss these results in the context of the role of plasticity in a warming climate. © 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

VL  - 102

SP  - 526-536
AB  - The adaptive potential of the northernmost Pinus sylvestris L. (and other northern tree) populations is considered by examining first the current patterns of quantitative genetic adaptive traits, which show high population differentiation and clines. We then consider the postglacial history of the populations using both paleobiological and genetic data. The current patterns of diversity at nuclear genes suggest that the traces of admixture are mostly visible in mitochondrial DNA variation patterns. There is little evidence of increased diversity due to admixture between an eastern and western colonization lineage, but no signal of reduced diversity (due to sequential bottlenecks) either. Quantitative trait variation in the north is not associated with the colonizing lineages. The current clines arose rapidly and may be based on standing genetic variation. The initial phenotypic response of Scots pine in the north is predicted to be increased survival and growth. The genetic responses are examined based on quantitative genetic predictions of sustained selection response and compared with earlier simulation results that have aimed at more ecological realism. The phenotypic responses of increased growth and survival reduce the opportunity for selection and delay the evolutionary responses. The lengthening of the thermal growing period also causes selection on the critical photoperiod in the different populations. Future studies should aim at including multiple ecological and genetic factors in evaluating potential responses. The American Genetic Association. 2011. All rights reserved.

VL  - 202
IS  - 1
SP  - 285-295
AB  - Adaptive evolution progresses as a series of steps toward a multidimensional phenotypic optimum, and organismal or environmental complexity determines the number of phenotypic dimensions, or traits, under selection. Populations evolving in complex environments may experience costs of complexity such that improvement in one or more traits is impeded by selection on others. We compared the fitness effects of the first fixed mutations for populations of single-stranded DNA bacteriophage evolving under simple selection for growth rate to those of populations evolving under more complex selection for growth rate as well as capsid stability. We detected a cost of complexity manifested as a smaller growth rate improvement for mutations fixed under complex conditions. We found that, despite imposing a cost for growth rate improvement, strong complex selection resulted in the greatest overall fitness improvement, even for single mutations. Under weaker secondary selective pressures, tradeoffs between growth rate and stability were pervasive, but strong selection on the secondary trait resulted largely in mutations beneficial to both traits. Strength of selection therefore determined the nature of pleiotropy governing observed trait evolution, and strong positive selection forced populations to find mutations that improved multiple traits, thereby overriding costs incurred as a result of a more complex selective environment. The costs of complexity, however, remained substantial when considering the effects on a single trait in the context of selection on multiple traits. © 2016 by the Genetics Society of America.

TI  - Environmental determinants of population divergence in life-history traits for an invasive species: Climate, seasonality and natural enemies
VL  - 26
IS  - 8
SP  - 1634-1645
AB  - Invasive species cope with novel environments through both phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary change. However, the environmental factors that cause evolutionary divergence in invasive species are poorly understood. We developed predictions for how different life-history traits, and plasticity in those traits, may respond to environmental gradients in seasonal temperatures, season length and natural enemies. We then tested these predictions in four geographic populations of the invasive cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae) from North America. We examined the influence of two rearing temperatures (20 and 26.7 °C) on pupal mass, pupal development time, immune function and fecundity. As predicted, development time was shorter and immune function was greater in populations adapted to longer season length. Also, phenotypic plasticity in development time was greater in regions with shorter growing seasons. Populations differed significantly in mean and plasticity of body mass and fecundity, but these differences were not associated with seasonal temperatures or season length. Our study shows that some life-history traits, such as development time and immune function, can evolve rapidly in response to latitudinal variation in season length and natural enemies, whereas others traits did not. Our results also indicate that phenotypic plasticity in development time can also diverge rapidly in response to environmental conditions for some traits. © 2013 THE AUTHORS. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

VL  - 64
SP  - 48-57
AB  - Contemporary evolution of thermal physiology has the potential to help limit the physiological stress associated with rapidly changing thermal environments; however it is unclear if wild populations can respond quickly enough for such changes to be effective. We used native Canadian Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) sunfish, and non-native Pumpkinseed introduced into the milder climate of Spain ~100 years ago, to assess genetic differences in thermal physiology in response to the warmer non-native climate. We compared temperature performance reaction norms of two Canadian and two Spanish Pumpkinseed populations born and raised within a common environment. We found that Canadian Pumpkinseed had higher routine metabolic rates when measured at seasonally high temperatures (15 °C in winter, 30 °C in summer), and that Spanish Pumpkinseed had higher critical thermal maxima when acclimated to 30 °C in the summer. Growth rates were not significantly different among populations, however Canadian Pumpkinseed tended to have faster growth at the warmest temperatures measured (32 °C). The observed differences in physiology among Canadian and Spanish populations at the warmest acclimation temperatures are consistent with the introduced populations being better suited to the warmer non-native climate than native populations. The observed differences could be the result of either founder effects, genetic drift, and/or contemporary adaptive evolution in the warmer non-native climate. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

VL  - 277

SP  - 2139-2148
AB  - Comparative sociogenomics has the potential to provide important insights into how social behaviour evolved. We examined brain gene expression profiles of the primitively eusocial wasp Polistes metricus and compared the results with a growing base of brain gene expression information for the advanced eusocial honeybee, Apis mellifera. We studied four female wasp groups that show variation in foraging/provisioning behaviour and reproductive status, using our newly developed microarray representing approximately 3248 E metricus genes based on sequences generated from high-throughput pyrosequencing. We found differences in the expression of approximately 389 genes across the four groups. Pathways known from Drosophila melanogaster to be related to lipid metabolism, heat and stress response, and various forms of solitary behaviour were associated with behavioural differences among wasps. Fortyfive per cent of differentially expressed transcripts showed significant associations with foraging/provisioning status, and 14 per cent with reproductive status. By comparing these two gene lists with lists of genes previously shown to be differentially expressed in association with honeybee division of labour, we found a significant overlap of genes associated with foraging/provisioning, but not reproduction, across the two species. These results suggest common molecular roots for foraging division of labour in two independently evolved social insect species and the possibility of more lineage-specific roots of reproductive behaviour. We explore the implications of these findings for the idea that there is a conserved 'genetic toolkit' for division of labour across multiple lineages. © 2010 The Royal Society.

AB  - Species may respond to climate change in many ecological and evolutionary ways. In this simulation study, we focus on the concurrent evolution of three traits in response to climate change, namely dispersal probability, temperature tolerance (or niche width), and temperature preference (optimal habitat). More specifically, we consider evolutionary responses in host species involved in different types of interaction, that is parasitism or commensalism, and for low or high costs of a temperature tolerance-fertility trade-off (cost of generalization). We find that host species potentially evolve all three traits simultaneously in response to increasing temperature but that the evolutionary response interacts and may be compensatory depending on the conditions. The evolutionary adjustment of temperature preference is slower in the parasitism than in commensalism scenario. Parasitism, in turn, selects for higher temperature tolerance and increased dispersal. High costs for temperature tolerance (i.e. generalization) restrict evolution of tolerance and thus lead to a faster response in temperature preference than that observed under low costs. These results emphasize the possible role of biotic interactions and the importance of 'multidimensional' evolutionary responses to climate change. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Limits to sustained energy intake. XXIII. Does heat dissipation capacity limit the energy budget of lactating bank voles?
VL  - 219
IS  - 6
SP  - 805-815
AB  - Understanding factors limiting sustained metabolic rate (SusMR) is a central issue in ecological physiology. According to the heat dissipation limit (HDL) theory, the SusMR at peak lactation is constrained by the maternal capacity to dissipate body heat. To test that theory, we shaved lactating bank voles (Myodes glareolus) to experimentally elevate their capacity for heat dissipation. The voles were sampled from lines selected for high aerobic exercise metabolism (A; characterized also by increased basal metabolic rate) and unselected control lines (C). Fur removal significantly increased the peak-lactation food intake (mass-adjusted least square means±s.e.; shaved: 16.3±0.3 g day-1, unshaved: 14.4± 0.2 g day-1; P&lt;0.0001), average daily metabolic rate (shaved: 109± 2 kJ day-1, unshaved: 97±2 kJ day-1; P&lt;0.0001) and metabolisable energy intake (shaved: 215±4 kJ day-1, unshaved: 185±4 kJ day-1; P&lt;0.0001),aswellasthe milkenergyoutput (shaved:104±4 kJ day-1; unshaved: 93±4 kJ day-1; P=0.021) and litter growth rate (shaved: 9.4±0.7 g 4 days-1, unshaved: 7.7±0.7 g 4 days-1; P=0.028). Thus, fur removal increased both the total energy budget and reproductive output at the most demanding period of lactation, which supports the HDL theory. However, digestive efficiency was lower in shaved voles (76.0±0.3%) than in unshaved ones (78.5±0.2%; P&lt;0.0001), which may indicate that a limit imposed by the capacity of the alimentary system was also approached. Shaving similarly affected the metabolic and reproductive traits in voles from the A and C lines. Thus, the experimental evolution model did not reveal a difference in the limiting mechanism between animals with inherently different metabolic rates. © 2016.

TI  - The latitudinal species richness gradient in New World woody angiosperms is consistent with the tropical conservatism hypothesis
VL  - 111
IS  - 22
SP  - 8125-8130
AB  - Plant diversity, like that of most other taxonomic groups, peaks in the tropics, where climatic conditions are warm and wet, and it declines toward the temperate and polar zones as conditions become colder and drier, with more seasonally variable temperatures. Climate and evolutionary history are often considered competing explanations for the latitudinal gradient, but they are linked by the evolutionarily conserved environmental adaptations of species and the history of Earth's climate system. The tropical conservatism hypothesis (TCH) invokes niche conservatism, climatic limitations on establishment and survival, and paleoclimatic history to explain the latitudinal diversity gradient. Here, we use latitudinal distributions for over 12,500 woody angiosperm species, a fossil-calibrated supertree, and null modeling to test predictions of the TCH. Regional assemblages in the northern and southern temperate zones are less phylogenetically diverse than expected based on their species richness, because temperate taxa are clustered into relatively few clades. Moreover, lineages with temperate affinities are generally younger and nested within older, more tropical lineages. As predicted by the TCH, the vast majority of temperate lineages have arisen since global cooling began at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (34 Mya). By linking physiological tolerances of species to evolutionary and biogeographic processes, phylogenetic niche conservatism may provide a theoretical framework for a generalized explanation for Earth's predominant pattern of biodiversity.

AB  - Thermodynamic processes increase metabolic rate and decrease longevity at high temperatures in ectotherms. However, how sustained long-term increase in temperature affects the evolution of longevity is poorly understood. Stress theory of ageing predicts that increased longevity is positively genetically correlated with resistance to different types of environmental stressors implying that evolutionary trajectories of ageing may be mediated by correlative selection for robust phenotypes under thermal stress. Here, we test this hypothesis by using replicate populations of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, evolving under two thermal environments: ancestral 30 °C and incremental increase towards novel 36 °C. Beetles evolving under climate warming became larger, more fecund and lived longer than the beetles evolving under 30 °C across both environments. However, the increase in longevity was partly due to parental effects because after two generations of acclimatization it persisted only in males. Our results support the hypothesis that evolution of stress resistance confers increased longevity through positive pleiotropy but demonstrate that such effects can be sex specific. These findings suggest that sex differences can evolve as correlated responses to selection under environmental change. © 2013 The Authors. Functional Ecology © 2013 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Heat tolerance in Drosophila subobscura along a latitudinal gradient: Contrasting patterns between plastic and genetic responses
VL  - 69
IS  - 10
SP  - 2721-2734
AB  - Susceptibility to global warming relies on how thermal tolerances respond to increasing temperatures through plasticity or evolution. Climatic adaptation can be assessed by examining the geographic variation in thermal-related traits. We studied latitudinal patterns in heat tolerance in Drosophila subobscura reared at two temperatures. We used four static stressful temperatures to estimate the thermal death time (TDT) curves, and two ramping assays with fast and slow heating rates. Thermal death time curves allow estimation of the critical thermal maximum (CTmax), by extrapolating to the temperature that would knock down the flies almost "instantaneously," and the thermal sensitivity to increasing stressful temperatures. We found a positive latitudinal cline for CTmax, but no clinal pattern for knockdown temperatures estimated from the ramping assays. Although high-latitude populations were more tolerant to an acute heat stress, they were also more sensitive to prolonged exposure to less stressful temperatures, supporting a trade-off between acute and chronic heat tolerances. Conversely, developmental plasticity did not affect CTmax but increased the tolerance to chronic heat exposition. The patterns observed from the TDT curves help to understand why the relationship between heat tolerance and latitude depends on the methodology used and, therefore, these curves provide a more complete and reliable measurement of heat tolerance. © 2015, Society for the Study of Evolution.

AB  - Antagonistic correlations among traits may slow the rate of adaptation to a changing environment. The tide pool copepod Tigriopus californicus is locally adapted to temperature, but within populations, the response to selection for increased heat tolerance plateaus rapidly, suggesting either limited variation within populations or costs of increased tolerance. To measure possible costs of thermal tolerance, we selected for increased upper lethal limits for 10 generations in 22 lines of T. californicus from six populations. Then, for each line, we measured six fitness-related traits. Selected lines showed an overall increase in male and female body sizes, fecundity, and starvation resistance, suggesting a small benefit from (rather than costs of) increased tolerance. The effect of selection on correlated traits also varied significantly by population for five traits, indicating that the genetic basis for the selection response differed among populations. Our results suggest that adaptation was limited by the presence of variation within isolated populations rather than by costs of increased tolerance. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

VL  - 26

SP  - 2271-2282
AB  - Ocean warming can alter natural selection on marine systems, and in many cases, the long-term persistence of affected populations will depend on genetic adaptation. In this study, we assess the potential for adaptation in the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma armigera, an Australian endemic, that is experiencing unprecedented increases in ocean temperatures. We used a factorial breeding design to assess the level of heritable variation in larval hatching success at two temperatures. Fertilized eggs from each full-sibling family were tested at 22 °C (current spawning temperature) and 25 °C (upper limit of predicted warming this century). Hatching success was significantly lower at higher temperatures, confirming that ocean warming is likely to exert selection on this life-history stage. Our analyses revealed significant additive genetic variance and genotype-by-environment interactions underlying hatching success. Consistent with prior work, we detected significant nonadditive (sire-by-dam) variance in hatching success, but additionally found that these interactions were modified by temperature. Although these findings suggest the potential for genetic adaptation, any evolutionary responses are likely to be influenced (and possibly constrained) by complex genotype-by-environment and sire-by-dam interactions and will additionally depend on patterns of genetic covariation with other fitness traits. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Evolution of a genetic polymorphism with climate change in a Mediterranean landscape
VL  - 110

SP  - 2893-2897
AB  - Many species show changes in distribution and phenotypic trait variation in response to climatic warming. Evidence of genetically based trait responses to climate change is, however, less common. Here, we detected evolutionary variation in the landscape-scale distribution of a genetically based chemical polymorphism in Mediterranean wild thyme (Thymus vulgaris) in association with modified extreme winter freezing events. By comparing current data on morph distribution with that observed in the early 1970s, we detected a significant increase in the proportion of morphs that are sensitive to winter freezing. This increase in frequency was observed in 17 of the 24 populations in which, since the 1970s, annual extreme winter freezing temperatures have risen above the thresholds that cause mortality of freezing-sensitive morphs. Our results provide an original example of rapid ongoing evolutionary change associated with relaxed selection (less extreme freezing events) on a local landscape scale. In species whose distribution and genetic variability are shaped by strong selection gradients, there may be little time lag associated with their ecological and evolutionary response to long-term environmental change.

TI  - Mechanisms of Chinese tallow (Triadica sebifera) invasion and their management implications – A review
VL  - 404
SP  - 1-13
AB  - Ecosystems are under increasing stress from environmental change, including invasion by non-native species that can disrupt ecological processes and functions. Chinese tallow [Triadica sebifera (L.) Small] is a highly invasive tree species in southeastern US forests, prairies, and wetlands, and effectively managing this invasive species is a significant challenge for scientists and land managers. In this review, we synthesize the literature on invasion ecology and management of Chinese tallow. Our review suggests that the invaded range of Chinese tallow is currently limited by dispersal in many areas and by low temperatures and low soil moisture, and by high soil salinity and frequent flooding in others, but these barriers may be overcome by increased dispersal, phenotypic plasticity, and/or rapid evolution. Invasions by Chinese tallow are facilitated by both the invasiveness of the species and the invasibility of the recipient communities. Invasiveness of Chinese tallow has been attributed to fast growth, high fecundity, a persistent seed bank, aggressive resprouting, abiotic stress tolerance, and the ability to transform fire maintained ecosystems. Some of these traits may be enhanced in invasive populations. Anthropogenic and natural disturbances, lack of herbivore pressure, and facilitation by soil microbes enhance the intensity of Chinese tallow invasions. Biological control of Chinese tallow is being developed. Treatments such as herbicides, prescribed fire, and mechanical control can effectively control Chinese tallow at the local scale. A combination of these treatments improves results. However, a proactive management approach would simultaneously achieve invasion control and promote subsequent ecological restoration, especially in the context of legacy effects, secondary invasions, and/or variable ecosystem responses to different control treatments. Future research should clarify the roles of species invasiveness and community invasibility, increase our understanding of the effects of Chinese tallow in invaded communities, and develop viable management regimes that are effective in both controlling or reducing the probability of Chinese tallow invasion and restoring desired native communities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Clinal patterns of chromosomal inversion polymorphisms in drosophila subobscura are partly associated with thermal preferences and heat stress resistance
VL  - 64
IS  - 2
SP  - 385-397
AB  - Latitudinal clines in the frequency of various chromosomal inversions are well documented in Drosophila subobscura. Because these clines are roughly parallel on three continents, they have undoubtedly evolved by natural selection. Here, we address whether individuals carrying different chromosomal arrangements also vary in their thermal preferences (Tp) and heat stress tolerance (Tko). Our results show that although Tp and Tko were uncorrelated, flies carrying "cold-adapted" gene arrangements tended to choose lower temperatures in the laboratory or had a lower heat stress tolerance, in line with what could be expected from the natural patterns. Different chromosomes were mainly responsible for the underlying genetic variation in both traits, which explains why they are linearly independent. Assuming Tp corresponds closely with temperatures that maximize fitness our results are consistent with previous laboratory natural selection experiments showing that thermal optimum diverged among thermal lines, and that chromosomes correlated with Tp differences responded to selection as predicted here. Also consistent with data from the regular tracking of the inversion polymorphism since the colonization of the Americas by D. subobscura, we tentatively conclude that selection on tolerance to thermal extremes is more important in the evolution and dynamics of clinal patterns than the relatively "minor" adjustments from behavioral thermoregulation. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

TI  - Attempt to Improve Indoor Air Quality in Computer Laboratories
VL  - 172
SP  - 1154-1160
AB  - Low indoor air quality (IAQ) can impact occupants' health and lead to poor productivity or low academic performance. Therefore the provision of good IAQ in classrooms and laboratories is very important. This paper presents the results of the investigation devoted to the quality of indoor air in computer laboratories of selected Polish high schools. Six schools in a town with a population of 200 000 inhabitants were involved in the investigations. The participating school buildings were built between 1975 and 1991 and had gravity ventilation systems. The variability of basic IAQ parameters, i.e., temperature, relative humidity and carbon dioxide level, was analysed and the assessment of the computer laboratories in terms of microbiological purity was performed. The outomes confirmed the low quality of the indoor air in these buildings. Certain modifications aimed at improving IAQ were proposed during the investigations. Two solutions were implemented. The first solution involved a twofold increase in the volume of supply air from 90 m(3)/h to 180 m(3)/h. The other modification consisted in installing indoor air cleaning devices based on the radiant catalytic ionization technology (RCI). The results of this study indicate that the proposed solution offers the potential to improve IAQ within computer labs. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Energetic adaptations to larval export within the brackish-water palaemonine shrimp, palaemonetes varians
VL  - 505
SP  - 177-191
AB  - Decapod crustaceans have repeatedly colonised brackish, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. Many decapods that inhabit brackish and freshwater habitats export larvae into estuarine and coastal areas where conditions for larval development may be better. In this study, we assessed the starvation resistance, biochemical composition and respiration rate during larval development of the brackish-water palaemonine shrimp, Palaemonetes varians, and the effects of temperature on these factors. Our results demonstrate that P. varians is highly resistant to starvation and may be considered facultative lecithotrophic in its first and second larval instars, and planktotrophic from its third instar. This high starvation resistance is associated with a relatively large size, high carbon content (∼45%) and C:N ratio (∼4.2), and visible yolk reserves at hatching. These energy reserves are interpreted as an adaptation to the exportation of larvae from peri - pheral adult environments into mid- and lower estuarine waters. Respiration rates varied with the moult cycle and were similar between fed and unfed larvae, suggesting that starved larvae do not suppress their metabolism as an energy-saving strategy. Despite higher respiration rates at higher temperatures, energy loss throughout development (estimated from respiration rates) increased with decreasing temperature, whilst larval growth and development rates increased with increasing temperature. High energy reserves at hatching, as within P. varians, is an important life history adaptation in the colonisation of brackish and fresh water, initially enabling the exportation of larvae from adult environments and eventually enabling lecithotrophy and direct development. © 2014 Inter-Research.

TI  - Genetic basis of growth adaptation of Escherichia coli after deletion of pgi, a major metabolic gene
VL  - 6
IS  - 11
AB  - Bacterial survival requires adaptation to different environmental perturbations such as exposure to antibiotics, changes in temperature or oxygen levels, DNA damage, and alternative nutrient sources. During adaptation, bacteria often develop beneficial mutations that confer increased fitness in the new environment. Adaptation to the loss of a major non-essential gene product that cripples growth, however, has not been studied at the whole-genome level. We investigated the ability of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 to overcome the loss of phosphoglucose isomerase (pgi) by adaptively evolving ten replicates of E. coli lacking pgi for 50 days in glucose M9 minimal medium and by characterizing endpoint clones through whole-genome re-sequencing and phenotype profiling. We found that 1) the growth rates for all ten endpoint clones increased approximately 3-fold over the 50-day period; 2) two to five mutations arose during adaptation, most frequently in the NADH/NADPH transhydrogenases udhA and pntAB and in the stress-associated sigma factor rpoS; and 3) despite similar growth rates, at least three distinct endpoint phenotypes developed as defined by different rates of acetate and formate secretion. These results demonstrate that E. coli can adapt to the loss of a major metabolic gene product with only a handful of mutations and that adaptation can result in multiple, alternative phenotypes. © 2010 Charusanti et al.

TI  - Evolution of pre- and post-cop00ulatory traits in male Drosophila melanogaster as a correlated response to selection for resistance to cold stress
VL  - 91
IS  - 4
SP  - 26-33
AB  - Background: In Drosophila melanogaster the fitness of males depends on a broad array of reproductive traits classified as pre- and post-copulatory traits. Exposure to cold stress, can reduce sperm number, male mating ability and courtship behavior. Therefore, it is expected that the adaptation to cold stress will involve changes in pre- and post-copulatory traits. Such evolution of reproductive traits in response to cold stress is not well studied. Methods: We selected replicate populations of D. melanogaster for resistance to cold shock. Over 37-46 generations of selection, we investigated pre- and post-copulatory traits such as mating latency, copulation duration, mating frequency, male fertility, fitness (progeny production) and sperm competitive ability in male flies subjected to cold shock and those not subjected to cold shock. Results: We found that post cold shock, the males from the selected populations had a significantly lower mating latency along with, higher mating frequency, fertility, sperm competitive ability and number of progeny relative to the control populations. Conclusion: While most studies of experimental evolution of cold stress resistance have documented the evolution of survivorship in response to selection, our study clearly shows that adaptation to cold stress involves rapid changes in the pre- and post-copulatory traits. Additionally, improved performances under stressful conditions need not necessarily trade-off with performance under benign conditions. © 2016 Singh et al.

TI  - Hot and not-so-hot females: Reproductive state and thermal preferences of female Arizona Bark Scorpions (Centruroides sculpturatus)
VL  - 28
IS  - 2
SP  - 368-375
AB  - For ectotherms, environmental temperatures influence numerous life history characteristics, and the body temperatures (Tb) selected by individuals can affect offspring fitness and parental survival. Reproductive trade-offs may therefore ensue for gravid females, because temperatures conducive to embryonic development may compromise females' body condition. We tested whether reproduction influenced thermoregulation in female Arizona Bark Scorpions (Centruroides sculpturatus). We predicted that gravid females select higher Tb and thermoregulate more precisely than nonreproductive females. Gravid C. sculpturatus gain body mass throughout gestation, which exposes larger portions of their pleural membrane, possibly increasing their rates of transcuticular water loss in arid environments. Accordingly, we tested whether gravid C. sculpturatus lose water faster than nonreproductive females. We determined the preferred Tb of female scorpions in a thermal gradient and measured water loss rates using flow-through respirometry. Gravid females preferred significantly higher Tb than nonreproductive females, suggesting that gravid C. sculpturatus alter their thermoregulatory behaviour to promote offspring fitness. However, all scorpions thermoregulated with equal precision, perhaps because arid conditions create selective pressure on all females to thermoregulate effectively. Gravid females lost water faster than nonreproductive animals, indicating that greater exposure of the pleural membrane during gestation enhances the desiccation risk of reproductive females. Our findings suggest that gravid C. sculpturatus experience a trade-off, whereby selection of higher Tb and increased mass during gestation increase females' susceptibility to water loss, and thus their mortality risk. Elucidating the mechanisms that influence thermal preferences may reveal how reproductive trade-offs shape the life history of ectotherms in arid environments. © 2015 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

VL  - 33
IS  - 2
SP  - 161-170
AB  - Several aspects of natural history of Blaesodactylus ambonihazo, a gecko distributed in a dry forest of northwestern Madagascar, were investigated in the rainy and dry seasons between 2000 and 2006. There were no significant sexual size differences in snout-vent length, and no sexual dimorphism was detected either in head width or body mass. Females ceased oogenesis during the rainy season and were recrudescent at the beginning of the dry season. They probably lay eggs in the middle of the dry season. Hatchlings were observed at the beginning of the rainy season and probably reach adult size in the subsequent dry season. At night geckos perched on tree trunks and buildings and exhibited typical sit-and-wait foraging. During the day they retreated to shelters, mainly crevices between buttress roots. The gecko was thermally passive to environmental temperatures, showing a wide range of cloacal temperatures (15-30 C), but they selected relatively higher substrate temperatures at low air temperature, possibly for thermoregulation. Because multiple individuals were observed on single trees, home ranges of the gecko were presumably overlapping each other, and no obvious territorial behavior was observed. The absence of male-biased sexual dimorphism, which suggests little male-male competition for mating, also supports the absence of territoriality of B. ambonihazo. Comparison with a syntopic diurnal gecko, Phelsuma kochi, which shows ecological characters similar to B. ambonihazo but has exclusive home ranges, may clarify ecological correlates associated with temporal niche partitioning. © 2014 by The Herpetological Society of Japan.

AB  - The self-adaptive low-high evaluation evolutionary-algorithm (SALHE-EA) is used to solve multimodal optimization problems. SALHE-EA is able to find the multiple optima of a single objective function (OF) and to give an idea of the fitness landscape in the neighborhood of these optima. This aspect is of crucial importance when the single OF is obtained using the weighted sum of the OFs, each related to a different goal of the optimization problem. This paper presents an improved version of SALHE-EA. This new version has several new features and, mainly, the suitability for parallelization. © 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Low larval densities in northern populations reinforce range expansion by a Mediterranean damselfly
VL  - 61
IS  - 9
SP  - 1430-1441
AB  - Contemporary climate change triggers a poleward range shift in many species. A growing number of studies document evolutionary changes in traits accelerating range expansion (such as growth rate and dispersal-related traits). In contrast, the direct impact of decreasing conspecific densities towards the very edge of the expansion front has been neglected. Density effects may, however, have a profound direct impact on traits involved in range expansion and influence range dynamics. In this study, we contrast the effects of high conspecific larval density typical for established populations and low larval density typical for newly founded populations at the edge of the expansion front on a set of larval traits that may affect the range dynamics in the poleward moving damselfly Coenagrion scitulum. We therefore ran an outdoor mesocosm experiment with a low- and high-density treatment close to the species’ northern expansion front. Density effects on survival, growth rate and body size are scored both during the pre-winter growth period and during the subsequent winter period. Additionally, foraging activity was scored at the end of the pre-winter period and body condition [size-corrected body mass, fat content and activity of phenoloxidase (PO)] was scored at the end of the winter period. The low-density treatment had strong direct positive effects on survival, growth rate and body size of larvae before winter indicating relaxed competition. Lower foraging activity at the low-density treatment indicated higher food availability at low conspecific densities. Interestingly, the initial density treatment had stronger effect than densities experienced at the time of quantification on survival during the pre-freezing winter period and body condition estimates at the end of the experiment, indicating also delayed effects of the initial density treatment. Survival throughout a freezing period indicated extreme winter conditions are not likely a limiting factor in the range expansion of this Mediterranean species. The increased survival and individual growth rates (through causing shifts in voltinism) at low conspecific density will translate in increased population growth rates. Furthermore, nutritional advantages at low conspecific density may increase investment in dispersal ability. Together, these direct and delayed density-dependent effects that gradually increase towards the expansion front are expected to accelerate range expansion. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Metabolic Erosion Primarily Through Mutation Accumulation, and Not Tradeoffs, Drives Limited Evolution of Substrate Specificity in Escherichia coli
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
AB  - Evolutionary adaptation to a constant environment is often accompanied by specialization and a reduction of fitness in other environments. We assayed the ability of the Lenski Escherichia coli populations to grow on a range of carbon sources after 50,000 generations of adaptation on glucose. Using direct measurements of growth rates, we demonstrated that declines in performance were much less widespread than suggested by previous results from Biolog assays of cellular respiration. Surprisingly, there were many performance increases on a variety of substrates. In addition to the now famous example of citrate, we observed several other novel gains of function for organic acids that the ancestral strain only marginally utilized. Quantitative growth data also showed that strains with a higher mutation rate exhibited significantly more declines, suggesting that most metabolic erosion was driven by mutation accumulation and not by physiological tradeoffs. These reductions in growth by mutator strains were ameliorated by growth at lower temperature, consistent with the hypothesis that this metabolic erosion is largely caused by destabilizing mutations to the associated enzymes. We further hypothesized that reductions in growth rate would be greatest for substrates used most differently from glucose, and we used flux balance analysis to formulate this question quantitatively. To our surprise, we found no significant relationship between decreases in growth and dissimilarity to glucose metabolism. Taken as a whole, these data suggest that in a single resource environment, specialization does not mainly result as an inevitable consequence of adaptive tradeoffs, but rather due to the gradual accumulation of disabling mutations in unused portions of the genome. Author Summary Adaptation to a single constant environment is commonly expected to result in decreased performance in alternative conditions, or specialization. It has been proposed that, rather than occurring through the neutral accumulation of mutations in unused alternative pathways, this happens because loss of these pathways enhances fitness in the constant environment via tradeoffs. We examined growth rates across a variety of nutrients for 12 independent lineages of Escherichia coli that had evolved in the laboratory for decades in a glucose-containing medium. Surprisingly, after 20,000 generations there were actually widespread improvements in the use of alternative nutrients, rather than the expected declines. After 50,000 generations, however, we find that this trend reversed for those populations that evolved a much higher mutation rate. This indicates that high mutation rate, and not adaptive tradeoffs per se (as had been previously proposed), is the primary driver of specialization. These results caution against general assumptions about the importance of adaptive tradeoffs during evolution, and emphasize the key role that newly evolved changes in mutation rate can play in promoting niche specialization.

TI  - Courtship song does not increase the rate of adaptation to a thermally stressful environment in a Drosophila melanogaster laboratory population
VL  - 9
IS  - 11
AB  - Courtship song in D. melanogaster contributes substantially to male mating success through female selection. We used experimental evolution to test whether this display trait is maintained through adaptive female selection because it indicates heritable male quality for thermal stress tolerance. We used non-displaying, outbred populations of D. melanogaster (nub1) mutants and measured their rate of adaptation to a new, thermally stressful environment, relative to wild-type control populations that retained courtship song. This design retains sexually selected conflict in both treatments. Thermal stress should select across genomes for newly beneficial alleles, increasing the available genetic and phenotypic variation and, therefore, the magnitude of female benefit derived from courtship song. Following introduction to the thermally stressful environment, net reproductive rate decreased 50% over four generations, and then increased 19% over the following 16 generations. There were no differences between the treatments. Possible explanations for these results are discussed. © 2014 Cabral, Holland.

AB  - The use of heat to treat cancer has been extensively studied in preclinical models and in human clinical trials. When combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, hyperthermia can yield synergistic interactions that increase likelihood that tumors will be controlled locally. Some evidence also exists that improvement in local tumor control. can lead to survival advantages. The achievement of therapeutic success with thermal therapies, however, requires a robust thermal dosimetry. This paper provides an overview of the evolution of thermometry and thermal dosimetry for both traditional hyperthermia and thermal ablation.

AB  - The formation conditions of marine shale gas in the Wufeng-Longmaxi Formation of Jiaoshiba area were evaluated in this paper on the basis of drilling, seismic survey and sample experiment data. The major factors controlling the accumulation and high productivity of marine shale gas in the lower paleozoic of Sichuan Basin were analyzed. The results show that shales of Longmaxi Formation in Jiaoshiba area are characterized by thick formation, good type, high levels of thermal evolution of organic matter, good physical and gas-bearing properties, suitable preservation condition and fracability. Meanwhile, the development and preservation condition of organic-rich shales, natural fractures development and crushability of the shales constitute the major factors controlling the accumulation and high productivity of marine shale gas in the lower Paleozoic strata of Sichuan Basin and its periphery. As abundant materials were provided by the development of organic-rich shales for shale gas generation and storage, suitable preservation conditions seem to be the key factor for accumulation and high productivity of shale gas. Natural fractures and crushability have guaranteed high productivity of shale gas.

VL  - 42
IS  - 2
SP  - 173-180
AB  - As a result of a variety of chemical, environmental, mechanical and physiological difficulties, insects that spend their entire life spans in the marine or intertidal region are relatively rare. The present study assesses whether morphological and physiological adaptations have evolved in a maritime parasitoid wasp species Echthrodesis lamorali Masner, 1968 (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae, Scelioninae), in response to environmental pressures on its respiratory functioning. Scanning electron and light microscopy of whole and sectioned specimens show the presence of structure-retaining taenidia in the tracheal tubes, although there is an absence of other major adaptations associated with the trachea or spiracles. Histological sectioning reveals the presence of unusual sacs in the female metasoma whose role is unknown, although they are hypothesized to most likely be linked to ovipositor control. Respirometry experiments illustrate the formation of a plastron when submerged, with the longevity of the wasps being increased by quiescence. The critical thermal range of E. lamorali is shown to be large: from −1.1 °C ± 0.16 to 45.7 °C ± 0.26 (mean ± SE). Behavioural and physiological adaptations in E. lamorali appear to have evolved in response to exposure to the heterogeneous environmental conditions experienced within the intertidal zone. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society

TI  - Positive selection at high temperature reduces gene transcription in the bacteriophage phi X174
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Background. Gene regulation plays a central role in the adaptation of organisms to their environments. There are many molecular components to gene regulation, and it is often difficult to determine both the genetic basis of adaptation and the evolutionary forces that influence regulation. In multiple evolution experiments with the bacteriophage X174, adaptive substitutions in cis-acting regulatory sequences sweep through the phage population as the result of strong positive selection at high temperatures that are non-permissive for laboratory-adapted phage. For one cis-regulatory region, we investigate the individual effects of four adaptive substitutions on transcript levels and fitness for phage growing on three hosts at two temperatures. Results. The effect of the four individual substitutions on transcript levels is to down-regulate gene expression, regardless of temperature or host. To ascertain the conditions under which these substitutions are adaptive, fitness was measured by a variety of methods for several bacterial hosts growing at two temperatures, the control temperature of 37°C and the selective temperature of 42°C. Time to lysis and doublings per hour indicate that the four substitutions individually improve fitness over the ancestral strain at high temperature independent of the bacterial host in which the fitness was measured. Competition assays between the ancestral strain and either of two mutant strains indicate that both mutants out-compete the ancestor at high temperature, but the relative frequencies of each phage remain the same at the control temperature. Conclusions. Our results strongly suggest that gene transcription plays an important role in influencing fitness in the bacteriophage X174, and different point mutations in a single cis-regulatory region provided the genetic basis for this role in adaptation to high temperature. We speculate that the adaptive nature of these substitutions is due to the physiology of the host at high temperature or the need to maintain particular ratios of phage proteins during capsid assembly. Our investigation of regulatory evolution contributes to interpreting genome-level assessments of regulatory variation, as well as to understanding the molecular basis of adaptation. © 2010 Brown et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Three African antelope species with varying water dependencies exhibit similar selective brain cooling
VL  - 186

SP  - 527-540
AB  - The use of selective brain cooling, where warm arterial blood destined for the brain is cooled in the carotid rete via counter-current heat exchange when in close proximity to cooler venous blood, contributes to the conservation of body water. We simultaneously measured carotid blood and hypothalamic temperature in four gemsbok, five red hartebeest and six blue wildebeest to assess the extent to which these free-living animals, with varying water dependency, routinely rely on selective brain cooling. We investigated the hypothesis that innate differences in selective brain cooling exist in large, sympatric artiodactyls with varying water dependency. All three species used selective brain cooling, without any discernible differences in three selective brain cooling indices. GLMMs revealed no species differences in the threshold temperature for selective brain cooling (z = 0.79, P = 0.43), the magnitude (z = −0.51, P = 0.61), or the frequency of selective brain cooling use (z = −0.47, P = 0.64), after controlling for carotid blood temperature and black globe temperature. Comparison of anatomical attributes of the carotid retes of the three species revealed that the volume (F2,9 = 5.54, P = 0.03) and height (F2,9 = 5.43, P = 0.03) of the carotid rete, per kilogram body mass, were greater in the red hartebeest than in the blue wildebeest. Nevertheless, intraspecific variability in the magnitude, the frequency of use, and the threshold temperature for selective brain cooling exceeded any interspecific variability in the three indices of selective brain cooling. We conclude that the three species have similar underlying ability to make use of selective brain cooling in an environment with freely available water. It remains to be seen to what extent these three species would rely on selective brain cooling, as a water conservation mechanism, when challenged by aridity, a condition likely to become prevalent throughout much of southern Africa under future climate change scenarios. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Inheritance of nesting behaviour across natural environmental variation in a turtle with temperature-dependent sex determination
VL  - 277
IS  - 1685
SP  - 1219-1226
AB  - Nesting behaviour is critical for reproductive success in oviparous organisms with no parental care. In organisms where sex is determined by incubation temperature, nesting behaviour may be a prime target of selection in response to unbalanced sex ratios. To produce an evolutionary change in response to sex-ratio selection, components of nesting behaviour must be heritable. We estimated the field heritability of two key components of nesting behaviour in a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) with temperature-dependent sex determination by applying the 'animal model' to a pedigree reconstructed from genotype data. We obtained estimates of low to non-detectable heritability using repeated records across all environments. We then determined environment-specific heritability by grouping records with similar temperatures for the winter preceding the nesting season, a variable known to be highly associated with our two traits of interest, nest vegetation cover and Julian date of nesting. The heritability estimates of nest vegetation cover and Julian date of nesting were qualitatively highest and significant, or nearly so, after hot winters. Additive genetic variance for these traits was not detectable after cold winters. Our analysis suggests that the potential for evolutionary change of nesting behaviour may be dependent on the thermal conditions of the preceding winter, a season that is predicted to be especially subject to climate change. © 2009 The Royal Society.

TI  - Genetic background and embryonic temperature affect DNA methylation and expression of myogenin and muscle development in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
VL  - 12
IS  - 6
AB  - The development of ectothermic embryos is strongly affected by incubation temperature, and thermal imprinting of body growth and muscle phenotype has been reported in various teleost fishes. The complex epigenetic regulation of muscle development in vertebrates involves DNA methylation of the myogenin promoter. Body growth is a heritable and highly variable trait among fish populations that allows for local adaptations, but also for selective breeding. Here we studied the epigenetic effects of embryonic temperature and genetic background on body growth, muscle cellularity and myogenin expression in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Eggs from salmon families with either high or low estimated breeding values for body growth, referred to as Fast and Slow genotypes, were incubated at 8C or 4C until the embryonic 'eyed-stage' followed by rearing at the production temperature of 8C. Rearing temperature strongly affected the growth rates, and the 8C fish were about twice as heavy as the 4C fish in the order Fast8>Slow8>Fast4>Slow4 prior to seawater transfer. Fast8 was the largest fish also at harvest despite strong growth compensation in the low temperature groups. Larval myogenin expression was approximately 4±6 fold higher in the Fast8 group than in the other groups and was associated with relative low DNA methylation levels, but was positively correlated with the expression levels of the DNA methyltransferase genes dnmt1, dnmt3a and dnmt3b. Juvenile Fast8 fish displayed thicker white muscle fibres than Fast4 fish, while Slow 8 and Slow 4 showed no difference in muscle cellularity. The impact of genetic background on the thermal imprinting of body growth and muscle development in Atlantic salmon suggests that epigenetic variation might play a significant role in the local adaptation to fluctuating temperatures over short evolutionary time. © 2017 Burgerhout et al.

AB  - Exposure to extreme temperatures is increasingly likely to impose strong selection on many organisms in their natural environments. The ability of organisms to adapt to such selective pressures will be determined by patterns of genetic variation and covariation. Despite increasing interest in thermal adaptation, few studies have examined the extent to which the genetic covariance between traits might constrain thermal responses. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether sex-specific genetic architectures will constrain responses to climatic selection. We used a paternal half-sibling breeding design to examine whether sex-specific genetic architectures and genetic covariances between traits might constrain evolutionary responses to warming climates in a population of Drosophila melanogaster. Our results suggest that the sexes share a common genetic underpinning for heat tolerance as indicated by a strong positive inter-sexual genetic correlation. Further, we found no evidence in either of the sexes that genetic trade-offs between heat tolerance and fitness will constrain responses to thermal selection. Our results suggest that neither trade-offs, nor sex-specific genetics, will significantly constrain an evolutionary response to climatic warming, at least in this population of D. melanogaster. © 2012 The Authors.

SP  - 343-363
AB  - The diversity of plants and animals at high altitudes is well studied, but there are scarcity of reports on diversity of microorganisms and their networking with plants. Extreme environments at high altitude have a very high impact on inhabiting plants and microbes. Here is an effort to explore the relationship between plant, microbes and environmental conditions at high altitude. The composition of microbial communities at high altitude, shaping the abundance and distribution, depends on the extreme environmental factors such as cold and hypoxia. Microorganisms have a range of adaptations that allow them to remain active in the extreme environments of high altitude and are indispensable for their survival. The extreme freezing temperature present at high altitude affects the microbial cells in many ways such as decrease in membrane fluidity, decrease in ribosome efficiency, and increased stabilization of secondary structures of nucleic acids. Collectively these factors may affect DNA replication, transcription and translation and leads to physiological and evolutionary adaptations. Similarly the plants present in any given environment influence everything from food chain to climate change. High altitude environment influence a plants physiology and morphology in many ways that may change their interaction with microorganism. The present chapter summarizes current knowledge about the ubiquitous presence of microbes and plants at high altitude atmosphere and various evolutionary and physiological adaptations required for survival. The purpose is to evaluate the high altitude environment as a source of pathogenic and beneficial interaction between microbes and plants. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Chill-tolerant Gryllus crickets maintain ion balance at low temperatures
VL  - 77
SP  - 15-25
AB  - Insect cold tolerance is both phenotypically-plastic and evolutionarily labile, but the mechanisms underlying this variation are uncertain. Chill-susceptible insects lose ion and water homeostasis in the cold, which contributes to the development of injuries and eventually death. We thus hypothesized that more cold-tolerant insects will better maintain ion and water balance at low temperatures. We used rapid cold-hardening (RCH) and cold acclimation to improve cold tolerance of male Gryllus pennsylvanicus, and also compared this species to its cold-tolerant relative (Glyllus veletis). Cold acclimation and RCH decreased the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and chill coma recovery time (CCR) in G. pennsylvanicus, but while cold acclimation improved survival of 0 0 degrees C, RCH did not; G. veletis was consistently more cold-tolerant (and had lower CCR and CTmin) than G. pennsylvanicus. During cold exposure, hemolymph water and Ne migrated to the gut of warm-acclimated G. pennsylvanicus, which increased hemolymph [K+] and decreased muscle K+ equilibrium potentials. By contrast, cold-acclimated G. pennsylvanicus suffered a smaller loss of ion and water homeostasis during cold exposure, and this redistribution did not occur at all in cold-exposed G. veletis. The loss of ion and water balance was similar between RCH and warm-acclimated G. pennsylvanicus, suggesting that different mechanisms underlie decreased CCR and CTmin compared to increased survival at 0 degrees C. We conclude that increased tolerance of chilling is associated with improved maintenance of ion and water homeostasis in the cold, and that this is consistent for both phenotypic plasticity and evolved cold tolerance.

TI  - Insect pollinators and climate change
SP  - 71-91
AB  - Many of the world's plants depend on insects for pollination. Climate change has led to shifts in these insects' phenologies, as warming temperatures have caused bees and butterflies to emerge earlier in the spring and (in some cases) extend their flight seasons. Afewrecent studies have pointed to climate change as a cause of pollinator declines, but other environmental changes (habitat loss, pesticides, pathogens) are generally suspected to have more important impacts on pollinator populations and have been the subject of more research. The mechanisms by which climate change might be causing observed population declines are so far undemonstrated, but insect pollinators can be affected both directly and indirectly (i.e., via their interactions with other species) by climate change. Insect pollinators, like other ectotherms, increase their activity and development rates with temperature, up to species-specific maxima beyond which performance declines abruptly. Large-bodied pollinators, in particular, can overheat and be unable to fly at high temperatures. Other known costs of warm temperatures for pollinators include depletion of energetic reserves, reduced adult body size, and (sometimes) increased mortality rates. Warm temperatures could also affect pollinators by altering plants' abilities to produce floral resources (nectar and pollen), by disrupting temporal synchronization or spatial overlap of plants and pollinators, or by changing the frequency of interactions with natural enemies. So far, however, there are few examples of these indirect mechanisms affecting pollinator populations, and no examples involving bees. There is clearly room for further research on responses of bee populations to the changing climate, including their capacity for adaptive evolutionary change. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Specific features of thermoregulation behavior were studied, and values of the selected and final selected temperature (25. 1°C) for early juveniles of roach Rutilus rutilus aged 11-28 days after hatching were first studied in long-term experiments (16 days). Two periods of the process of thermoselection-transient (selected temperature, up to 7-9 days after the beginning of the experiment) and final (final selected temperature, 8-10 days after the beginning of the experiment)-have been identified. The selection by larval roach of final selected temperature values occurs with use of the adaptation response of "excessive responding." It was shown that correct determination of final selected temperature values for early juveniles of fish is possible only in long-term experiments (more than 7 days). The obtained results can be used during the analysis of behavior and distribution of larval roach under natural and experimental conditions. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

VL  - 6
IS  - 10
AB  - Physiological responses to temperature reflect the evolutionary adaptations of organisms to their thermal environment and the capability of animals to tolerate thermal stress. Contrary to conventional metabolism theory, increasing environmental temperatures have been shown to reduce metabolic rate in rocky-eulittoral-fringe species inhabiting highly variable environments, possibly as a strategy for energy conservation. To study the physiological adaptations of an intertidal-subtidal species to the extreme and unpredictable heat stress of the intertidal zone, oxygen consumption rate and heat shock protein expression were quantified in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus. Using simulate natural temperatures, the relationship between temperature, physiological performance (oxygen consumption and heat shock proteins) and thermotolerance were assessed. Depression of oxygen consumption rate and upregulation of heat shock protein genes (hsps) occurred in sequence when ambient temperature was increased from 24 to 30°C. Large-scale mortality of the sea cucumber occurred when temperatures rose beyond 30°C, suggesting that the upregulation of heat shock proteins and mortality are closely related to the depression of aerobic metabolism, a phenomenon that is in line with the concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT). The physiologically-related thermotolerance of this sea cucumber should be an adaptation to its local environment. © 2011 Dong et al.

AB  - Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a polymodal ion channel sensitive to temperature and chemical stimuli. The importance of temperature and aversive chemical detection for survival has driven the evolutionary diversity of TRPA1 sensitivity. This diversity can be observed in the various roles of TRPA1 in different species, where it is proposed to act as a temperature-insensitive chemosensor, a heat transducer, a noxious cold transducer, or a detector of low-intensity heat for prey localization. Exploring the variation of TRPA1 functions among species provides evolutionary insight into molecular mechanisms that fine-tune thermal and chemical sensitivity, and offers an opportunity to address basic principles of temperature gating in ion channels. A decade of research has yielded a number of hypotheses describing physiological roles of TRPA1, modulators of its activity, and biophysical principles of gating. This review surveys the diversity of TRPA1 adaptations across evolutionary taxa and explores possible mechanisms of TRPA1 activation. © 2015, © 2015 The Author(s).

VL  - 7
IS  - 1

AB  - Seed dormancy and size are two important life-history traits that interplay as adaptation to varying environmental settings. As evolution of both traits involves correlated selective pressures, it is of interest to comparatively investigate the evolution of the two traits jointly as well as independently. We explore evolutionary trajectories of seed dormancy and size using adaptive dynamics in scenarios of deterministic or stochastic temperature variations. Ecological dynamics usually result in unbalanced population structures, and temperature shifts or fluctuations of high magnitude give rise to more balanced ecological structures. When only seed dormancy evolves, it is counter-selected and temperature shifts hasten this evolution. Evolution of seed size results in the fixation of a given strategy and evolved seed size decreases when seed dormancy is lowered. When coevolution is allowed, evolutionary variations are reduced while the speed of evolution becomes faster given temperature shifts. Such coevolution scenarios systematically result in reduced seed dormancy and size and similar unbalanced population structures. We discuss how this may be linked to the system stability. Dormancy is counter-selected because population dynamics lead to stable equilibrium, while small seeds are selected as the outcome of size-number trade-offs. Our results suggest that unlike random temperature variation between generations, temperature shifts with high magnitude can considerably alter population structures and accelerate life-history evolution. This study increases our understanding of plant evolution and persistence in the context of climate changes. © 2016 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Evolution of escherichia coli rifampicin resistance in an antibiotic-free environment during thermal stress
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Beneficial mutations play an essential role in bacterial adaptation, yet little is known about their fitness effects across genetic backgrounds and environments. One prominent example of bacterial adaptation is antibiotic resistance. Until recently, the paradigm has been that antibiotic resistance is selected by the presence of antibiotics because resistant mutations confer fitness costs in antibiotic free environments. In this study we show that it is not always the case, documenting the selection and fixation of resistant mutations in populations of Escherichia coli B that had never been exposed to antibiotics but instead evolved for 2000 generations at high temperature (42.2°C). Results: We found parallel mutations within the rpoB gene encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. These amino acid substitutions conferred different levels of rifampicin resistance. The resistant mutations typically appeared, and were fixed, early in the evolution experiment. We confirmed the high advantage of these mutations at 42.2°C in glucose-limited medium. However, the rpoB mutations had different fitness effects across three genetic backgrounds and six environments. Conclusions: We describe resistance mutations that are not necessarily costly in the absence of antibiotics or compensatory mutations but are highly beneficial at high temperature and low glucose. Their fitness effects depend on the environment and the genetic background, providing glimpses into the prevalence of epistasis and pleiotropy. © 2013 Rodríguez-Verdugo et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

VL  - 185

SP  - 401-413
AB  - Environmental temperature has strong effects on the rate and efficiency of resource use in ectotherms, but little is known about how changes in temperature influence their diet selection patterns. Changes in temperature may alter the balance of nutrients required by ectotherms by affecting metabolism. In response to temperature changes, ectotherms are predicted to express a preference for a specific nutrient (protein or carbohydrate) to match their altered nutrient requirement. Here, we examined the nutritional consequences of mealworm beetles (Tenebrio molitor L.) that were constrained to diets varying in protein:carbohydrate balance (P:C = 1:5, 1:1, or 5:1) or offered a choice between two nutritionally complementary diets (1:5 vs. 5:1) at four different temperatures (20, 25, 30, or 35 °C). Beetles had high mortality and reduced body mass at higher temperatures. Post-ingestive use efficiencies of both protein and carbohydrate decreased as temperature rose. Warming-driven decrease in carbohydrate use efficiencies occurred most profoundly when carbohydrates were consumed excessively. When given a choice, beetles selected protein and carbohydrate equally at 25 and 30 °C, but exhibited a significant preference for carbohydrate at 35 °C. Since carbohydrate is an immediate source of energy, this warming-driven preference for carbohydrate is explicable as an adaptive response of beetles to meet increased energy needs at high temperature. Beetles exposed to 20 °C ate substantially less food, but preferentially consumed carbohydrate over protein possibly to cope with reduced energy intake. The present findings have implications for the impact of temperature on foraging and resource use in ectotherms. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Ectotherms often exhibit smaller adult body size with faster growth when reared at higher temperatures. The phylogenetically widespread trend in this thermal life-history plasticity is called the "temperature-size rule". Empirical evidence suggests that this thermal reaction norm has adaptive significance, but specifying its ultimate mechanism remains an open question. Most existing hypotheses are based on optimaliry models, which hinders an intuitive understanding of the theories. Such models explain which phenotypes maximize fitness via natural selection within a particular phenotypic range, determined by specific constraints and tradeoffs. In this article, I review these hypotheses to facilitate future empirical efforts to test their validity and discuss the main issues that need to be addressed in the near future.

VL  - 17

SP  - 380-397
AB  - Thermal developmental plasticity represents a key organismal adaptation to maintain reproductive capacity in contrasting and fluctuating temperature niches. Although extensively studied, research on thermal plasticity has mainly focused on phenotypic outcomes, such as adult life history, rather than directly measuring plasticity of underlying developmental processes. How thermal plasticity of developmental phenotypes maps into plasticity of resulting final phenotypes, and how such mapping relationships evolve, thus remain poorly understood. Here we address these questions by quantifying thermal plasticity of Caenorhabditis hermaphrodite germline development. We integrate measurements of germline development and fertility at the upper thermal range in isolates of C. briggsae, C. elegans, and C. tropicalis. First, we compare intra- and interspecific variation in thermal germline plasticity with plasticity in reproductive output. Second, we ask whether the developmental errors leading to fertility break-down at upper thermal limits are evolutionarily conserved. We find that temperature variation modulates spermatogenesis, oogenesis and germ cell progenitor pools, yet the thermal sensitivity of these processes varies among isolates and species, consistent with evolutionary variation in upper thermal limits of hermaphrodite fertility. Although defective sperm function is a major contributor to heat-induced fertility break-down, high temperature also significantly perturbs oogenesis, germline integrity, and mitosis-meiosis progression. Remarkably, the occurrence and frequency of specific errors are strongly species- and genotype-dependent, indicative of evolutionary divergence in thermal sensitivity of distinct processes in germline development. Therefore, the Caenorhabditis reproductive system displays complex genotype-by-temperature interactions at the developmental level, which may remain masked when studying thermal plasticity exclusively at the life history level. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Expression Characterization of Stress Genes Under High and Low Temperature Stresses in the Pacific Oyster, Crassostrea gigas
VL  - 18
IS  - 2
SP  - 176-188
AB  - As a characteristic sessile inhabitant of the intertidal zone, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas occupies one of the most physically stressful environments on earth. With high exposure to terrestrial conditions, oysters must tolerate broad fluctuations in temperature range. However, oysters’ cellular and molecular responses to temperature stresses have not been fully characterized. Here, we analyzed oyster transcriptome data under high and low temperatures. We also identified over 30 key temperature stress-responsive candidate genes, which encoded stress proteins such as heat shock proteins and apoptosis-associated proteins. The expression characterization of these genes under short-term cold and hot environments (5 and 35 °C) and long-term cold environments (5 °C) was detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Most of these genes reached expression peaks during the recovery stage after 24 h of heat stress, and these genes were greatly induced around day 3 in long-term cold stress while responded little to short-term cold stress. In addition, in the second heat stress after 2 days of recovery, oysters showed milder expression in these genes and a lower mortality rate, which indicated the existence of plasticity in the oyster’s response to heat stress. We confirmed that homeostatic flexibility and anti-apoptosis might be crucial centers of temperature stress responses in oysters. Furthermore, we analyzed stress gene families in 11 different species and found that the linage-specific expansion of stress genes might be implicated in adaptive evolution. These results indicated that both plasticity and evolution played an important role in the stress response adaptation of oysters. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Limited evolutionary rescue of locally adapted populations facing climate change
VL  - 368
IS  - 1610
AB  - Dispersal is a key determinant of a population's evolutionary potential. It facilitates the propagation of beneficial alleles throughout the distributional range of spatially outspread populations and increases the speed of adaptation. However, when habitat is heterogeneous and individuals are locally adapted, dispersal may, at the same time, reduce fitness through increasing maladaptation. Here, we use a spatially explicit, allelic simulation model to quantify how these equivocal effects of dispersal affect a population's evolutionary response to changing climate. Individuals carry a diploid set of chromosomes, with alleles coding for adaptation to non-climatic environmental conditions and climatic conditions, respectively. Our model results demonstrate that the interplay between gene flow and habitat heterogeneity may decrease effective dispersal and population size to such an extent that substantially reduces the likelihood of evolutionary rescue. Importantly, even when evolutionary rescue saves a population from extinction, its spatial range following climate change may be strongly narrowed, that is, the rescue is only partial. These findings emphasize that neglecting the impact of nonclimatic, local adaptation might lead to a considerable overestimation of a population's evolvability under rapid environmental change. © 2012 The Authors.

TI  - Co-gradient variation in growth rate and development time of a broadly distributed butterfly
VL  - 9
IS  - 4
AB  - Widespread species often show geographic variation in thermally-sensitive traits, providing insight into how species respond to shifts in temperature through time. Such patterns may arise from phenotypic plasticity, genetic adaptation, or their interaction. In some cases, the effects of genotype and temperature may act together to reduce, or to exacerbate, phenotypic variation in fitness-related traits across varying thermal environments. We find evidence for such interactions in life-history traits of Heteronympha merope, a butterfly distributed across a broad latitudinal gradient in south-eastern Australia. We show that body size in this butterfly is negatively related to developmental temperature in the laboratory, in accordance with the temperature-size rule, but not in the field, despite very strong temperature gradients. A common garden experiment on larval thermal responses, spanning the environmental extremes of H. merope's distribution, revealed that butterflies from low latitude (warmer climate) populations have relatively fast intrinsic growth and development rates compared to those from cooler climates. These synergistic effects of genotype and temperature across the landscape (cogradient variation) are likely to accentuate phenotypic variation in these traits, and this interaction must be accounted for when predicting how H. merope will respond to temperature change through time. These results highlight the importance of understanding how variation in life-history traits may arise in response to environmental change. Without this knowledge, we may fail to detect whether organisms are tracking environmental change, and if they are, whether it is by plasticity, adaptation or both.©2014 Barton et al.

VL  - 4
AB  - The unique geography of the Indian subcontinent has provided diverse natural environments for a variety of organisms. In this region, many ecological indices such as temperature and humidity vary predictably as a function of both latitude and altitude; these environmental parameters significantly affect fundamental dynamics of natural populations. Indian drosophilids are diverse in their geographic distribution and climate tolerance, possibly as a result of climatic adaptation. These associations with environmental parameters are further reflected in a large number of clines that have been reported for various fitness traits along these geographical ranges. This unique amalgamation of environmental variability and genetic diversity make the subcontinent an ecological laboratory for studying evolution in action. We assembled data collected over the last 20 years on the geographical clines for various phenotypic traits in several species of drosophilids and present a web-resource on Indian-Drosophila (http://www.indian-drosophila.org/). The clinal data on ecologically relevant phenotypes of Indian drosophilids will be useful in addressing questions related to future challenges in biodiversity and ecosystems in this region. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - Microevolution in time and space: SNP analysis of historical DNA reveals dynamic signatures of selection in Atlantic cod
VL  - 22
IS  - 9
SP  - 2424-2440
AB  - Little is known about how quickly natural populations adapt to changes in their environment and how temporal and spatial variation in selection pressures interact to shape patterns of genetic diversity. We here address these issues with a series of genome scans in four overfished populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) studied over an 80-year period. Screening of >1000 gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified 77 loci that showed highly elevated levels of differentiation, likely as an effect of directional selection, in either time, space or both. Exploratory analysis suggested that temporal allele frequency shifts at certain loci may correlate with local temperature variation and with life history changes suggested to be fisheries induced. Interestingly, however, largely nonoverlapping sets of loci were temporal outliers in the different populations and outliers from the 1928 to 1960 period showed almost complete stability during later decades. The contrasting microevolutionary trajectories among populations resulted in sequential shifts in spatial outliers, with no locus maintaining elevated spatial differentiation throughout the study period. Simulations of migration coupled with observations of temporally stable spatial structure at neutral loci suggest that population replacement or gene flow alone could not explain all the observed allele frequency variation. Thus, the genetic changes are likely to at least partly be driven by highly dynamic temporally and spatially varying selection. These findings have important implications for our understanding of local adaptation and evolutionary potential in high gene flow organisms and underscore the need to carefully consider all dimensions of biocomplexity for evolutionarily sustainable management. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Uncovering genetic responses to selection in wild populations typically requires tracking individuals over generations and use of animal models. Our group monitored the body size of one Swiss Yellow Dung Fly (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae) field population over 15 years, including intermittent common-garden rearing in the laboratory to assess body size with minimized environmental and maximized genetic variation. Contrary to expectations based on repeated heritability and phenotypic selection assessments over the years (reported elsewhere), field body sizes declined by >10% and common-garden laboratory sizes by >5% from 1993 to 2009. Our results confirm the temperature-size rule (smaller when warmer) and, albeit entirely correlational, could be mediated by climate change, as over this period mean temperature at the site increased by 0.5°C, although alternative systematic environmental changes cannot be entirely excluded. Monitoring genetic responses to selection in wild invertebrate populations is thus possible, though indirect, and wild populations may evolve in directions not consistent with strongly positive directional selection favoring large body size. © 2015, Society for the Study of Evolution.

AB  - Climate change is expected to result in an increased occurrence of heat stress. The long-term population-level impact of this stress would be lessened in populations able to genetically adapt to higher temperatures. Adaptation requires the presence of genetically-based variation. At-risk populations may undergo strong declines in population size that lower the amount of genetic variation. The objectives of this study were to quantify the heritability of heat tolerance in populations of the least killifish, Heterandria formosa, and to determine if heritabilities were reduced following a population bottleneck. Heritabilities of heat tolerance were determined for two lines of each of two source populations; two bottlenecked lines (established with one pair of fish) and two regular lines. Heat tolerance was quantified as temperature-at-death (TAD), when fish acclimated at 28°C were subjected to an increase in water temperature of 2°C/day. Mid-parent/mean offspring regressions and full-sib analyses were used to estimate the heritability of TAD. Heritability estimates from parent/offspring regressions ranged from 0.185 to 0.462, while those from sib analyses ranged from 0 to 0.324, with an overall estimate of 0.203 (0.230 for the regular lines, 0.168 for bottlenecked ones). Fish from the bottlenecked line from one source population (but not the other) had a lower heritability than did those from the regular line. These results show that the populations tested had some potential for adaptation to elevated water temperatures, and that this potential may be reduced following a population bottleneck. This should not be construed as evidence that natural populations will not suffer negative consequences from global warming; this study only showed that these specific populations have some potential to adapt under a very specific set of conditions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Energy storage and fecundity explain deviations from ecological stoichiometry predictions under global warming and size-selective predation
VL  - 85

SP  - 1431-1441
AB  - A key challenge for ecologists is to predict how single and joint effects of global warming and predation risk translate from the individual level up to ecosystem functions. Recently, stoichiometric theory linked these levels through changes in body stoichiometry, predicting that both higher temperatures and predation risk induce shifts in energy storage (increases in C-rich carbohydrates and reductions in N-rich proteins) and body stoichiometry (increases in C : N and C : P). This promising theory, however, is rarely tested and assumes that prey will divert energy away from reproduction under predation risk, while under size-selective predation, prey instead increase fecundity. We exposed the water flea Daphnia magna to 4 °C warming and fish predation risk to test whether C-rich carbohydrates increase and N-rich proteins decrease, and as a result, C : N and C : P increase under warming and predation risk. Unexpectedly, warming decreased body C : N, which was driven by reductions in C-rich fat and sugar contents while the protein content did not change. This reflected a trade-off where the accelerated intrinsic growth rate under warming occurred at the cost of a reduced energy storage. Warming reduced C : N less and only increased C : P and N : P in the fish-period Daphnia. These evolved stoichiometric responses to warming were largely driven by stronger warming-induced reductions in P than in C and N and could be explained by the better ability to deal with warming in the fish-period Daphnia. In contrast to theory predictions, body C : N decreased under predation risk due to a strong increase in the N-rich protein content that offsets the increase in C-rich fat content. The higher investment in fecundity (more N-rich eggs) under predation risk contributed to this stronger increase in protein content. Similarly, the lower body C : N of pre-fish Daphnia also matched their higher fecundity. Warming and predation risk independently shaped body stoichiometry, largely by changing levels of energy storage molecules. Our results highlight that two widespread patterns, the trade-off between rapid development and energy storage and the increased investment in reproduction under size-selective predation, cause predictable deviations from current ecological stoichiometry theory. © 2016 The Authors.

VL  - 10
AB  - Background: The purpose of this research was to replicate a successful intervention to increase physical activity in a different region of the country, and explore genetic and physiological moderators of intervention efficacy drawn from a transdisciplinary theoretical framework.Method: A randomized controlled trial comparing a print-based physical activity intervention (COSTRIDE) to a print-based health and wellness contact control (HW) intervention was conducted. Sedentary participants (n = 219) completed assessments at baseline and follow-up assessments at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following the initiation of the intervention.Results: Participants in both conditions significantly increased exercise behavior in the first six months, and then leveled off or decreased physical activity in the second six months of the study. Those in the COSTRIDE intervention increased significantly more than those in the HW intervention, and were better able to maintain their exercise behavior. Genetic factors (BDNF, rs6265; FTO, rs8044769), but not selected physiological (body temperature, blood lactate, systolic blood pressure, plasma norepinephrine, and heart rate) or subjective (perceived pain, affect) responses to physical activity, moderated response to the intervention.Conclusions: There are underlying genetic factors that influence response to behavioral intervention, and a better understanding of these factors has the potential to influence the development, targeting and tailoring of behavioral interventions to increase physical activity.Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov registration: NCT01091857. © 2013 Bryan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

VL  - 417
SP  - 159-170
AB  - The combined effects of predicted ocean acidification and global warming on the larvae of the cold-eurythermal spider crab Hyas araneus L. were investigated in 2 populations: a southernmost around Helgoland (North Sea, 54° N) and a northernmost at Svalbard (North Atlantic, 79°N). Larvae were exposed at temperatures of 3, 9 and 15°C to present day normocapnia (380 ppm CO2) and to CO2 conditions predicted for the near or medium-term future (710 ppm by the year 2100, 3000 ppm by 2300 and beyond). Larval development time, growth and C/N ratio were studied in the larval stages Zoea I, II, and Megalopa. Permanent differences in instar duration between both populations were detected in all stages, likely as a result of evolutionary temperature adaptation. With the exception of Zoea II at 3°C and under all CO2conditions, development in all instars from Svalbard was delayed compared to those from Helgoland. Most prominently, development was much longer and fewer specimens morphosed to the first crab instar in the Megalopa from Svalbard than from Helgoland. Enhanced CO2 levels (particularly 3000 ppm) extended the duration of larval development and reduced larval growth (measured as dry mass) and fitness (decreasing C/N ratio, a proxy of the lipid content). Such effects were strongest in the zoeal stages of Svalbard larvae, and during the Megalopa instar of Helgoland larvae. The high sensitivity of megalopae from the Svalbard population to warming and of those from Helgoland to enhanced CO2levels suggests that this larval instar is a physiologically sensitive bottleneck within the life cycle of H. araneus. © Inter-Research 2010.

VL  - 38

SP  - 345-354
AB  - In the last two decades a considerable number of studies have described geographic variation in morphometric, physiological and behavioral traits of over a dozen species of wild south-Asian drosophild fruit flies. Due to strong latitudinal and altitudinal gradients this region is highly diverse with respect to climatic conditions, making it important for studies in evolutionary ecology. In this review, we examine spatial heterogeneity across the Indian subcontinent in almost all of the traits previously investigated (body weight, desiccation tolerance, pigmentation, copulation duration, fecundity, ovariole number, wing length, alcohol dehydrogenase fast allele frequency, rate of water loss and starvation resistance). We find a linear correlation between trait variation and latitude. Our data suggest that a single climatic component, the coefficient of variance of monthly temperature averages, which is strongly correlated with latitude, explains a large proportion of variation in the traits investigated. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ever since the pre-molecular era, the birth of new genes with novel functions has been considered to be a major contributor to adaptive evolutionary innovation. Here, I review the origin and evolution of new genes and their functions in eukaryotes, an area of research that has made rapid progress in the past decade thanks to the genomics revolution. Indeed, recent work has provided initial whole-genome views of the different types of new genes for a large number of different organisms. The array of mechanisms underlying the origin of new genes is compelling, extending way beyond the traditionally well-studied source of gene duplication. Thus, it was shown that novel genes also regularly arose from messenger RNAs of ancestral genes, protein-coding genes metamorphosed into new RNA genes, genomic parasites were coopted as new genes, and that both protein and RNA genes were composed from scratch (i.e., from previously nonfunctional sequences). These mechanisms then also contributed to the formation of numerous novel chimeric gene structures. Detailed functional investigations uncovered different evolutionary pathways that led to the emergence of novel functions from these newly minted sequences and, with respect to animals, attributed a potentially important role to one specific tissue - the testis - in the process of gene birth. Remarkably, these studies also demonstrated that novel genes of the various types significantly impacted the evolution of cellular, physiological, morphological, behavioral, and reproductive phenotypic traits. Consequently, it is now firmly established that new genes have indeed been major contributors to the origin of adaptive evolutionary novelties. © 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.
