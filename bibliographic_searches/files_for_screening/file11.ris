TI  - EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON THE FITNESS COST OF RESISTANCE TO BACTERIOPHAGE T4 IN ESCHERICHIA COLI
VL  - 63

SP  - 1406-1416
AB  - Resistance to predation, herbivory, or disease often comes at a cost such that resistant genotypes are competitively inferior to their sensitive counterparts in the absence of predators, herbivores, or pathogens. The effects of this trade-off on natural populations depend on its sensitivity to environmental changes. We used Escherichia coli and bacteriophage T4 as a model predator/prey system to study the effects of temperature on the cost of resistance. An array of independent T4-resistant mutants, derived from a single ancestral strain of E. coli B, had a mean reduction in competitive fitness that depended strongly on environmental temperature; the cost of resistance generally increased with temperature. Genetic variance for fitness among phage-resistant mutants also depended on temperature; however, genetic variance increased at high and low thermal extremes. These results suggest that temperature is likely to be an important determinant of the consequences of predation in natural communities. We also discuss the underlying mechanistic basis for the cost of resistance in this system and its interaction with temperature.

TI  - Allometric and non-allometric consequences of inbreeding on Drosophila melanogaster wings
VL  - 102
IS  - 3
SP  - 626-634
AB  - Inbreeding is expected to increase the variability in size and shape within populations. The distinct effects of inbreeding on size and shape suggest that they are governed by different developmental pathways. One unresolved question is whether the non-allometric shape component is partially unconstrained developmentally and therefore whether shape is evolvable. In the present study, we utilized a mass outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster maintained at standard laboratory conditions. Eight lines with equivalent expected levels of inbreeding (F approximate to 0.67) were obtained by restricting the size of each population to two pairs for nine generations. Nine landmarks were measured on Drosophila wings of the inbreed lines and compared with those of the mass population. Wing landmarks comprise an excellent model system for studying evolution of size and shape. Landmark measurements were analyzed with a Procrustes generalized least squares procedure. To visualize global shape changes among samples, we reconstructed the mean shape and the shape changes related to both the allometric and non-allometric components. An increased variability in the non-allometric shape component was found with inbreeding. This indicated that shape was not entirely developmentally constrained, and therefore that shape appears to be evolvable.

TI  - Body Size Variation of Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) Through an Elevation Gradient
VL  - 108
IS  - 5
SP  - 800-806
AB  - The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, vectors the bacterium `Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' responsible for the huanglongbing ( HLB) disease. In Mexico, economic losses caused by HLB severely affect the citrus industry. Despite the threat that the presence of D. citri implies, due to its invasive characteristics, there are few ecological and biological studies addressing its adaptation to new and different environments in Mexico. Based on the temperature-size rule, stating smaller adult size at higher rearing temperatures, the aim of this study was to evaluate D. citri's body size variation at different temperatures related to an elevation gradient. Adults were collected at four different elevations in the states of Jalisco and Colima, Mexico. Right forewing length and width as well as prothorax width and right antenna length were measured. Statistical differences between the sexes were analyzed by a multivariate analysis using Hotelling's T 2 and Kruskal- Wallis nonparametric test to evaluate body size variation between elevations followed by a Nemenyi's pairwise comparison test. To evaluate relationships between size variation and elevation, a v2 independence test was performed. Females were shown to be statistically larger than males. All body structures except the prothorax were shown to be larger at location El Arenal ( higher elevation) and smaller at location Tecoma ' n ( lower elevation). Forewing length and width best explained the differences observed between the sexes and at the four locations, showing that the temperature- size rule applies in this case.

TI  - Contribution of brown adipose tissue to human energy metabolism
VL  - 68
SP  - 82-89
AB  - The present "obesogenic' environment has favored excessive energy intake resulting in the current obesity epidemic and its associated diseases. The epidemic has incentivized scientists to develop novel behavioral and pharmacological strategies that enhance energy expenditure to compensate for excessive energy intake. Although physical activity is effective to increase total energy expenditure, it is insufficient to induce negative energy balance and weight loss. With the discovery of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans, BAT activation soon emerged as a potential strategy for elevating energy expenditure. BAT is the only tissue that expresses uncoupling protein 1, conferring on this tissue high thermogenic capacity due to a low efficiency for mitochondrial ATP generation. Potential manipulation of BAT mass and activity has fueled the interest in altering whole-body energy balance through increased energy expenditure. Remarkable advances have been made in quantifying the amount and activity of BAT in humans. Many studies have concluded that the amount of active BAT appears insufficient to induce meaningful increases in energy expenditure. Thus, the majority of studies report that BAT activation does not influence body weight and metabolic control in humans. Strategies to increase BAT mass and/or to potentiate BAT activity seem necessary.

TI  - Critical thermal limits in ants and their implications under climate change
VL  - 97
IS  - 4
SP  - 1287-1305
AB  - Critical thermal limits (CTLs) constrain the performance of organisms, shaping their abundance, current distributions, and future distributions. Consequently, CTLs may also determine the quality of ecosystem services as well as organismal and ecosystem vulnerability to climate change. As some of the most ubiquitous animals in terrestrial ecosystems, ants are important members of ecological communities. In recent years, an increasing body of research has explored ant physiological thermal limits. However, these CTL data tend to centre on a few species and biogeographical regions. To encourage an expansion of perspectives, we herein review the factors that determine ant CTLs and examine their effects on present and future species distributions and ecosystem processes. Special emphasis is placed on the implications of CTLs for safeguarding ant diversity and ant-mediated ecosystem services in the future. First, we compile, quantify, and categorise studies on ant CTLs based on study taxon, biogeographical region, methodology, and study question. Second, we use this comprehensive database to analyse the abiotic and biotic factors shaping ant CTLs. Our results highlight how CTLs may affect future distribution patterns and ecological performance in ants. Additionally, we identify the greatest remaining gaps in knowledge and create a research roadmap to promote rapid advances in this field of study.

TI  - Presence of an invasive species reverses latitudinal clines of multiple traits in a native species
VL  - 25
IS  - 2
SP  - 620-628
AB  - Understanding the processes driving formation and maintenance of latitudinal clines has become increasingly important in light of accelerating global change. Many studies have focused on the role of abiotic factors, especially temperature, in generating clines, but biotic factors, including the introduction of non-native species, may also drive clinal variation. We assessed the impact of invasion by predatory fire ants on latitudinal clines in multiple fitness-relevant traits-morphology, physiological stress responsiveness, and antipredator behavior-in a native fence lizard. In areas invaded by fire ants, a latitudinal cline in morphology is opposite both the cline found in museum specimens from historical populations across the species' full latitudinal range and that found in current populations uninvaded by fire ants. Similarly, clines in stress-relevant hormone response to a stressor and in antipredator behavior differ significantly between the portions of the fence lizard range invaded and uninvaded by fire ants. Changes in these traits within fire ant-invaded areas are adaptive and together support increased and more effective antipredator behavior that allows escape from attacks by this invasive predator. However, these changes may mismatch lizards to the environments under which they historically evolved. This research shows that novel biotic pressures can alter latitudinal clines in multiple traits within a single species on ecological timescales. As global change intensifies, a greater understanding of novel abiotic and biotic pressures and how affected organisms adapt to them across space and time will be central to predicting and managing our changing environment.

TI  - Evolution of Marine Organisms under Climate Change at Different Levels of Biological Organisation
VL  - 6
IS  - 11
SP  - 3545-3574
AB  - Research to date has suggested that both individual marine species and ecological processes are expected to exhibit diverse responses to the environmental effects of climate change. Evolutionary responses can occur on rapid (ecological) timescales, and yet studies typically do not consider the role that adaptive evolution will play in modulating biological responses to climate change. Investigations into such responses have typically been focused at particular biological levels (e. g., cellular, population, community), often lacking interactions among levels. Since all levels of biological organisation are sensitive to global climate change, there is a need to elucidate how different processes and hierarchical interactions will influence species fitness. Therefore, predicting the responses of communities and populations to global change will require multidisciplinary efforts across multiple levels of hierarchy, from the genetic and cellular to communities and ecosystems. Eventually, this may allow us to establish the role that acclimatisation and adaptation will play in determining marine community structures in future scenarios.

TI  - Not all cicadas increase thermal tolerance in response to a temperature gradient in metropolitan Seoul
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - Rapid anthropogenic alterations caused by urbanization are increasing temperatures in urban cores, a phenomenon known as the urban heat island (UHI) effect. Two cicada species, Cryptotympana atrata and Hyalessa fuscata (Hemiptera: Cicadidae), are abundant in metropolitan Seoul where their population densities correlate strongly with UHI intensities. Such a positive correlation between cicada density and UHI intensity may be possible if cicada abundance is linked to a certain thermal tolerance. We tested this hypothesis by investigating variation in morphology and thermal responses of two cicada species along a thermal gradient in Seoul and surrounding areas. The morphological responses were measured by metrics such as length, thorax width and depth, and mass. The thermal responses were measured in terms of minimum flight temperature, maximum voluntary temperature and heat torpor temperature. First, we observed a species-specific variation in thermal responses, in which C. atrata displayed a higher thermal threshold for maximum voluntary and heat torpor temperatures than H. fuscata. Second, a positive association between temperature conditions and body sizes were displayed in females H. fuscata, but not in either conspecific males or C. atrata individuals. Third, C. atrata exhibited similar thermal responses regardless of habitat temperature, while H. fuscata in warmer areas showed an increase in heat tolerance. In addition, H. fuscata individuals with bigger thorax sizes were more heat-tolerant than those with smaller thoraxes. Overall, our research is the first to detect a variation in thermal responses and body size of H. fuscata individuals at a local scale. More investigations would be needed to better understand the adaptation mechanisms of insects linked to UHI effects.

TI  - Cold tolerance varies among invasive populations of the Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea)
VL  - 99
IS  - 8
SP  - 729-740
AB  - The distribution of the subtropical Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea (O.F. Muller, 1774)), one of the world's most invasive freshwater molluscs, is reportedly constrained by a lower thermal tolerance limit of 2 degrees C. Although its occurrence in north temperate regions is typically restricted to artificially heated waterbodies, the species has been found to overwinter in unheated lakes and rivers. In laboratory experiments, we compared the cold tolerance of populations from several geographically distinct sites spanning 35 degrees N to 46 degrees N in eastern North America. Each population contained individuals that fully recovered from 2 months of continuous exposure to near-freezing (1 degrees C) conditions, contrary to published accounts of C. fluminea's thermal ecology. Survivorship increased with body size and was enhanced by prior acclimation to a low temperature (10 degrees C) compared with a higher one (18 degrees C). When acclimated to 10 degrees C, clams from northern populations exhibited greater survivorship (55.0% +/- 16.1%) than those from southern populations (26.7% +/- 19.2%). However, one southern population demonstrated survivorship as great as that of the most tolerant northern population, suggesting that its clams could overwinter in unheated northern waterbodies. Differences among populations indicate either that contemporary evolution has occurred or that developmental plasticity shapes future acclimation responses.

VL  - 110
SP  - 163-169
AB  - The pace-of-life hypothesis predicts that among-individual differences in behaviour should integrate with a wide variety of morphological, metabolic and life-history traits along a slow to fast pace-of-life continuum. Support for the pace-of-life hypothesis has been mixed, in part because most empirical tests have been conducted strictly at the phenotypic level and have thus conflated genetic and environmental sources of covariance among traits. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that, according to the predictions of the pace-of-life hypothesis, body mass, routine metabolic rate, activity and exploratory propensity are positively integrated in the house cricket Acheta domesticus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). Using modified open field behavioural tests and flow-through respirometry, we determined whether among-individual differences are correlated across morphology, behaviour and metabolism in 50 male house crickets. All traits were repeatable, but we found poor evidence for overall integration across traits. Instead we found evidence for modularity, with behavioural traits covarying independently from mass and routine metabolic rate. Modularity, like that found here between activity and exploratory propensity, has been suggested to facilitate adaptive evolutionary change by coupling functionally related traits into suites on which selection can act more rapidly.

TI  - Probabilistic maturation reaction norm trends reveal decreased size and age at maturation in an intensively harvested stock of pikeperch Sander lucioperca
VL  - 167
SP  - 1-12
AB  - Reports of fishing-induced evolution in the maturation schedules of commercially exploited marine fishes are numerous and are alarming. Here, we analysed the probabilistic maturation reaction norms for a freshwater fish species, the pikeperch (Sander lucioperca), to assess whether the maturation patterns of cohorts 1993-2006 responded to intensive coastal commercial and recreational fishing in the Archipelago Sea area of the Baltic Sea. Lp(50) values estimated using individual data from catch samples revealed that maturation had shifted towards an earlier age and smaller size. Lengths-at-age showed variation, but no linear trends, whereas the condition factor decreased for most of the age groups. Cross-correlation analysis of Lp(50) values with variables describing stock size (potential social effects on maturation) and water temperature revealed no obvious growth-independent effects on the maturation trends. This suggests that fishing, in line with the life-history theory, was the most important driving factor favouring early maturation. These results suggest that fishing-induced shifts in the maturation patterns of fish are nearly ubiquitous and not limited to commercially harvested marine species. This calls for increased awareness of fishing-induced life-history changes also in coastal and inland fisheries management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 73

SP  - 1052-1081
AB  - Temperature is the most significant factor controlling developmental timing of most temperate poikilotherms. In the face of climate change, a crucial question is how will poikilothermic organisms evolve when faced with changing thermal environments? In this paper, we integrate models for developmental timing and quantitative genetics. A simple model for determining developmental milestones (emergence times, egg hatch) is introduced, and the general quantitative genetic recursion for the mean value of developmental parameters presented. Evolutionary steps proportional to the difference between current median parameters and parameters currently selected for depend on the fitness, which is assumed to depend on emergence density. Asymptotic states of the joint model are determined, which turn out to be neutrally stable (marginal) fixed points in the developmental model by itself, and an associated stable emergence distribution is also described. An asymptotic convergence analysis is presented for idealized circumstances, indicating basic stability criteria. Numerical studies show that the stability analysis is quite conservative, with basins of attraction to the asymptotic states that are much larger than expected. It is shown that frequency-dependent selection drives oscillatory dynamics and that the asymptotic states balance the asymmetry of the emergence distribution and the fitness function.

VL  - 29

SP  - 2168-2180
AB  - Climate-mediated evolution plays an integral role in species migration and range expansion. Gaining a clearer understanding of how climate affects demographic history and adaptation provides fundamental insight into the generation of intra-and interspecific diversity. In this study, we used the natural colonization of the green anole (Anolis carolinensis) from the island of Cuba to mainland North America to investigate the role of evolution at the niche, phenotypic and genetic levels after long-term establishment in a novel environment. The North American green anole occupies a broader range of thermal habitats than its Cuban sister species. We documented niche expansion in the mainland green anole, mediated primarily through adaptation to winter temperatures. Common garden experiments strongly suggest a genetic component to differences in thermal performance found between populations in different temperature regimes. Analysis of geographic variation in population structure based on 53 486 single nucleotide variants from RAD loci revealed increased genetic isolation between populations in different vs. similar thermal environments. Selection scans for environment-allele correlations reveal 19 genomic loci of known function that may have played a role in the physiological adaptation of A. carolinensis to temperate environments on the mainland.

TI  - Genetics and geometry of canalization and developmental stability in Drosophila subobscura
VL  - 5
AB  - Background: Many properties of organisms show great robustness against genetic and environmental perturbations. The terms canalization and developmental stability were originally proposed to describe the ability of an organism to resist perturbations and to produce a predictable target phenotype regardless of random developmental noise. However, the extent to which canalization and developmental stability are controlled by the same set of genes and share underlying regulatory mechanisms is largely unresolved. Results: We have analyzed the effects of clinal genetic variation ( inversion polymorphism) on wing asymmetry by applying the methods of geometric morphometrics in the context of quantitative genetics using isochromosomal lines of Drosophila subobscura. For the analysis of overall size, developmental stability was positively correlated with levels of heterozygosity and development at the optimal temperature. For analyses of shape, the overall comparisons by matrix correlations indicate that inter- and intraindividual variation levels were poorly correlated, a result also supported when comparing the vectors describing patterns of variation of landmark position. The lack of similarity was basically due to the discrepancy between the genetic and environmental components of the interindividual variation. Finally, the analyses have also underscored the presence of genetic variation for directional asymmetry. Conclusions: The results strongly support the hypothesis that environmental canalization and developmental stability share underlying regulatory mechanisms, but environmental and genetic canalization are not functionally the same. A likely explanation for this lack of association is that natural wing shape variation in Drosophila populations is loosely related to individual fitness.

TI  - Response of life-history traits to artificial and natural selection for virulence and nonvirulence in a Drosophila parastitoid, Asobara tabida
VL  - 25
IS  - 2
SP  - 317-327
AB  - Co-evolution of host-parasitoid interactions is determined by the costs of host resistance, which received empirical evidence, and the costs of parasitoid virulence, which have been mostly hypothesized. Asobara tabida is a parasitoid, which mainly parasitizes Drosophila melanogaster and D. subobscura, the first species being able to resist to the parasitoid development while the second species is not. To parasitize resistant hosts, including D. melanogaster, A. tabida develops sticky eggs, which prevent encapsulation, but this virulence mechanism may be costly. Interindividual and interpopulation variation in the proportion of sticky eggs respectively allowed us to (i) artificially select and compare life-history traits of a virulent and a nonvirulent laboratory strain, and (ii) compare a virulent and a nonvirulent field strain, to investigate the hypothetical costs of virulence. We observed strong differences between the 2 laboratory strains. The nonvirulent strain invested fewer resources in reproduction and walked less than the virulent one but lived longer. Concerning the field strains, we observed that the nonvirulent strain had larger wings while the virulent one walked more and faster. All together, our results suggest that virulence may not always be costly, but rather that different life histories associated with different levels of virulence may coexist at both intra- and interpopulation levels.

TI  - Wing trait-inversion associations in Drosophila subobscura can be generalized within continents, but may change through time
VL  - 28
IS  - 12
SP  - 2163-2174
AB  - Clinal variation is one of the most emblematic examples of the action of natural selection at a wide geographical range. In Drosophila subobscura, parallel clines in body size and inversions, but not in wing shape, were found in Europe and South and North America. Previous work has shown that a bottleneck effect might be largely responsible for differences in wing trait-inversion association between one European and one South American population. One question still unaddressed is whether the associations found before are present across other populations of the European and South American clines. Another open question is whether evolutionary dynamics in a new environment can lead to relevant changes in wing traits-inversion association. To analyse geographical variation in these associations, we characterized three recently laboratory founded D.subobscura populations from both the European and South American latitudinal clines. To address temporal variation, we also characterized the association at a later generation in the European populations. We found that wing size and shape associations can be generalized across populations of the same continent, but may change through time for wing size.The observed temporal changes are probably due to changes in the genetic content of inversions, derived from adaptation to the new, laboratory environment. Finally, we show that it is not possible to predict clinal variation from intrapopulation associations. All in all this suggests that, at least in the present, wing traits-inversion associations are not responsible for the maintenance of the latitudinal clines in wing shape and size.

TI  - Predators modify the temperature dependence of life-history trade-offs
VL  - 8
IS  - 17
SP  - 8818-8830
AB  - Although life histories are shaped by temperature and predation, their joint influence on the interdependence of life-history traits is poorly understood. Shifts in one life-history trait often necessitate shifts in anotherstructured in some cases by trade-offsleading to differing life-history strategies among environments. The offspring size-number trade-off connects three traits whereby a constant reproductive allocation (R) constrains how the number (O) and size (S) of offspring change. Increasing temperature and size-independent predation decrease size at and time to reproduction which can lower R through reduced time for resource accrual or size-constrained fecundity. We investigated how O, S, and R in a clonal population of Daphnia magna change across their first three clutches with temperature and size-independent predation risk. Early in ontogeny, increased temperature moved O and S along a trade-off curve (constant R) toward fewer larger offspring. Later in ontogeny, increased temperature reduced R in the no-predator treatment through disproportionate decreases in O relative to S. In the predation treatment, R likewise decreased at warmer temperatures but to a lesser degree and more readily traded off S for O whereby the third clutch showed a constant allocation strategy of O versus S with decreasing R. Ontogenetic shifts in S and O rotated in a counterclockwise fashion as temperature increased and more drastically under risk of predation. These results show that predation risk can alter the temperature dependence of traits and their interactions through trade-offs.

TI  - Egg size and the adaptive capacity of early life history traits in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha)
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
SP  - 205-219
AB  - Offspring traits are greatly influenced by maternal effects, and these maternal effects may provide an important pathway through which populations can adapt to changing thermal environments. We investigated the effect of egg size on the among- and within-population variation in early life history traits among introduced Great Lakes Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations under varying thermal conditions. We reared Chinook salmon from three populations in a common-garden hatchery study at 6.5, 9.4, and 15.2 degrees C and measured a variety of fitness-related traits during development. We found that most of the among-population variation in early life history traits was explained by egg size. However, the contribution of egg size to the among-population variation decreased with an increase in temperature suggesting that other effects, such as genetic, contribute at high temperature. Within populations, egg size explained much of the dam variance and maternal effect for traits in every temperature, whereas egg size generally had little to no influence on the sire variance and heritability. Overall, our results demonstrate the significant contribution egg size makes to shaping early life history phenotypes among and within populations, and suggest that egg size is an important pathway through which offspring phenotypes can evolve on contemporary timescales.

TI  - Exaggerated male forelegs are not more differentiated than wing morphology in two widespread sister species of black scavenger flies
VL  - 58
IS  - 1
SP  - 159-173
AB  - Sexual selection represents a potent force that can drive rapid population differentiation in traits related to reproductive success. Hence, sexual traits are expected to show greater population divergence than non-sexual traits. We test this prediction by exploring patterns of morphological differentiation of the exaggerated fore femur (a male-specific sexual trait) and the wing (a non-sexual trait) among allopatric and sympatric populations of the widespread sister dung fly species Sepsis neocynipsea and Sepsis cynipsea (Diptera: Sepsidae). While both species occur in Eurasia, S. neocynipsea also abounds in North America, albeit previous studies suggest strong differentiation in morphology, behavior, and mating systems. To evaluate the degree of differentiation expected under neutrality between S. cynipsea, European S. neocynipsea, and North American S. neocynipsea, we genotyped 30 populations at nine microsatellite markers, revealing almost equal differentiation between and minor differentiation among geographic populations within the three lineages. Landmark-based analysis of 18 populations reared at constant 18 and 24 degrees C in a laboratory common garden revealed moderate temperature-dependent phenotypic plasticity and significant heritable differentiation in size and shape of male forelegs and wings among iso-female lines of the three lineages. Following the biological species concept, there was weaker differentiation between cross-continental populations of S. neocynipsea relative to S. cynipsea, and more fore femur differentiation between the two species in sympatry versus allopatry (presumably due to character displacement). Contrary to expectation, wing morphology showed as much shape differentiation between evolutionary independent lineages as fore femora, providing no evidence for faster diversification of traits primarily engaged in mating.

TI  - Genomic models predict successful coral adaptation if future ocean warming rates are reduced
VL  - 3
IS  - 11
AB  - Population genomic surveys suggest that climate-associated genetic variation occurs widely across species, but whether it is sufficient to allow population persistence via evolutionary adaptation has seldom been quantified. To ask whether rapid adaptation in reef-building corals can keep pace with future ocean warming, we measured genetic variation at predicted warm-adapted loci and simulated future evolution and persistence in a high-latitude population of corals from Rarotonga, Cook Islands. Alleles associated with thermal tolerance were present but at low frequencies in this cooler, southerly locality. Simulations based on predicted ocean warming in Rarotonga showed rapid evolution of heat tolerance resulting in population persistence under mild warming scenarios consistent with low CO2 emission plans, RCP2.6 and RCP4.5. Under more severe scenarios, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, adaptation was not rapid enough to prevent extinction. Population adaptation was faster for models based on smaller numbers of additive loci that determine thermal tolerance and for higher population growth rates. Finally, accelerated migration via transplantation of thermally tolerant individuals (1 to 5%/year) sped adaptation. These results show that cool-water corals can adapt to warmer oceans but only under mild scenarios resulting from international emissions controls. Incorporation of genomic data into models of species response to climate change offers a promising method for estimating future adaptive processes.

TI  - Effects of fragmentation on plant adaptation to urban environments
VL  - 372
IS  - 1712
AB  - Urban ecosystems are relatively recent and heavily human-altered terrestrial ecosystems with a surprisingly high diversity of animals, plants and other organisms. Urban habitats are also strongly fragmented and subject to higher temperatures, providing a compelling model for studying adaptation to global change. Crepis sancta (Asteraceae), an annual Mediterranean wasteland weed, occupies fragmented urban environments as well as certain unfragmented landscapes in southern France. We tested for shifts in dispersal, reproductive traits and size across a rural-urban gradient to learn whether and how selection may be driving changes in life history in urban and fragmented habitats. We specifically compared the structure of quantitative genetic variation and of neutral markers (microsatellites) between urban and rural and between fragmented and unfragmented habitats. We showed that fragmentation provides a better descriptor of trait variation than urbanization per se for dispersal traits. Fragmentation also affected reproductive traits and plant size though one rural population did conform to this scheme. Our study shows the role of fragmentation for dispersal traits shift in urban environments and a more complex pattern for other traits. We discuss the role of pollinator scarcity and an inhospitable matrix as drivers of adaptation. This article is part of the themed issue 'Human influences on evolution, and the ecological and societal consequences'.

TI  - Eco-Evolutionary Origins of Diverse Abundance, Biomass, and Trophic Structures in Food Webs
VL  - 7
AB  - Organismal traits and their evolution can strongly influence food web structure and dynamics. To what extent the evolution of such traits impacts food web structure, however, is poorly understood. Here, we investigate a simple three-species omnivory food web module where the attack rates of all predators evolve as ecological dynamics unfold, such that predator trophic levels are themselves dynamic. We assume a timescale where other vital rates that govern population dynamics are constant and incorporate a well-known tradeoff between attack rates and the conversion of prey into predator biomass. We show that this eco-evolutionary model yields a surprisingly rich array of dynamics. Moreover, even small amounts of selection lead to important differences in the abundance, trophic, and biomass structure of the food web. Systems in which intermediate predators are strongly constrained by tradeoffs lead to hourglass-shaped food webs, where basal resources and top predators have large abundances, but intermediate predators are rare, like those observed in some marine ecosystems. Such food webs are also characterized by a relatively low maximum trophic level. Systems in which intermediate predators have weaker tradeoffs lead to pyramid-shaped food webs, where basal resources are more abundant than intermediate and top predators, such as those observed in some terrestrial system. These food webs also supported a relatively higher maximum trophic level. Overall, our results suggest that eco-evolutionary dynamics can strongly influence the abundance-, trophic-, and biomass-structure of food webs, even in the presence of small levels of selection, thus stressing the importance of taking traits and trait evolution into account to further understand community-level patterns and processes.

TI  - Jurassic palynoevents in the circum-Arctic region
VL  - 58
SP  - 55-98
AB  - Successions of Jurassic strata located in the Arctic region normally yield rich assemblages of terrestrially-derived and marine palynomorphs, reflecting relatively warm air and sea-surface temperatures. The land plant floras were prone to the development of local communities and regional provincialism, whereas the marine biotas thrived across extensive open marine areas with high productivity, resulting in the rapid evolution of dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) following their earliest fossil record in the Triassic. Dinocysts exhibit low taxonomic richness and provide low biostratigraphic resolution throughout the Lower Jurassic sections. By contrast, they are diverse in Middle and Upper Jurassic strata where they provide excellent biostratigraphic markers for correlating and dating both surface and subsurface sections. Over twenty formal and informal biozonations based on the first and last occurrences of dinocysts have been erected in Alaska, Arctic Canada, the Barents Sea region, Greenland and northern Russia, many of which are correlated with macrofossils, including ammonites, that occur in the same sections. This paper presents a compilation of 214 Jurassic palynostratigraphic events (118 first occurrences and 96 last occurrences) that have regional chronostratigraphic value in the Circum-Arctic, based on their published records. Each event is correlated with the base of a chronostratigraphical unit (including formal stages and sub-Boreal ammonite zones), or as an estimated percentage above the base of the chronostratigraphical unit relative to the entire unit. The relationships of each event to stages and key fossil zonal schemes is shown on chronostratigraphic plots using the 2020 version of TimeScale Creator (R).

TI  - Rapid evolution of an introduced insect Ophraella communa LeSage in new environments: temporal changes and geographical differences in photoperiodic response
VL  - 18
IS  - 1
SP  - 104-112
AB  - The accidentally introduced beetle Ophraella communa was first found in 1996 in Japan and has rapidly expanded its distribution range to include regions with substantially different climates. During this range expansion and subsequent establishment in new habitats, the life history traits of O.communa have changed depending on new habitat environmental conditions. In this study, we investigated the photoperiodic response of O.communa controlling its reproductive diapause, an important trait that adjusts the life cycle to local climate and phenology of host-plants. We examined temporal changes and geographical differences in this trait. In the Tsukuba population of O.communa, the diapause incidence under conditions of 12h light:12h dark (LD 12:12), 13:11 and 14:10 did not consistently increase or decrease during 2005-2012, although it fluctuated yearly. The diapause incidence in this period, however, was lower than that in 1999 reported previously and the critical day-length inducing diapause was shortened by >1h from 1999 to 2005. These results suggest that the photoperiodic response of O.communa shifted during this period. To examine geographical differences in this trait, we compared the Hirosaki, Morioka, Tsukuba and Koshi lines. The diapause incidence at LD13:11 was significantly different between the O.communa lines: 86.5% in the Hirosaki line (collected in 2010) , 81.4% in Morioka (collected in 2010), 45.0% in Tsukuba (collected in 2011) and 7.1% in Koshi (collected in 2009), and was positively correlated with the latitude of the origin. These results suggest that this trait shifted, responding to the environmental conditions in the colonized regions.

VL  - 25
IS  - 6
SP  - 1307-1319
AB  - Environmental constraints can be determinant key factors conditioning predator life history evolution. Prey seems to have conditioned life history evolution in their ladybird predator, with the predators of aphids apparently presenting faster development, greater fecundity and shorter longevity than species preying on coccids. However a rigorous comparison has never been done. We hypothesize that aphids and coccids differ by their developmental rate, abundance, and distribution in the field, which act as ecological constraints promoting life history evolution in ladybird predators. Field data reveal that aphids are ephemeral resources available in the form of large colonies randomly distributed in the habitat whereas coccids form smaller colonies that tend to be aggregated in space and available for longer periods. A comparison in laboratory conditions of two predatory species belonging to the tribe Scymnini (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) show that the aphidophagous species lives at a faster pace than the coccidophagous: it develops faster, matures earlier, is more fecund, has a shorter reproductive life-span and allocate proportionally more fat in its gonads relative to soma. This indicates that the life histories of aphidophagous and coccidophagous ladybird predators appear to have evolved in response to particular patterns of prey availability in time and space. Under the light of these results, the existence of a slow-fast continuum in ladybirds is briefly addressed.

TI  - Hibernation as a major determinant of life-history traits in marmots
VL  - 98
IS  - 2
SP  - 321-331
AB  - During the downward trend of Quaternary global temperatures, crown-group marmots evolved to occupy harsh, seasonal environments at high latitudes and elevations. Marmots evolved hibernation and large body size, which allowed them to cope with a long, cold season with low, stressful ambient temperatures when food was unavailable. Harsh conditions during a short active season frequently cause reproductive failure and reproductive skipping in marmots. Seasonal phenology is controlled by a circannual rhythm that directs metabolic changes and fat accumulation for hibernation and reproduction. Metabolism and water balance in marmots are adapted to the low environmental temperatures of hibernation. Thus, marmots are subject to heat stress from solar radiation and high ambient temperatures during the active season. Energy conservation characterizes metabolism in marmots throughout the annual cycle: metabolic rates are lower than predicted from body size and decline during the active season, metabolism is actively suppressed to enter torpor, and most of the time during hibernation is spent at low metabolism in deep torpor. Young typically require 2 or more of the short active seasons to reach reproductive maturity and are retained at home, which leads to sociality based on kinship. Competition within the social group is expressed primarily as reproductive suppression, which delays the age of 1st reproduction that in turn strongly affects demography. Early snowmelt due to global warming may enable marmots to colonize new habitats or increase population growth. However, climate change most likely will diminish the ability of marmots to mobilize sufficient energy resources in a drier, warmer active season, which will reduce both survivorship and reproduction.

VL  - 17
IS  - 10
SP  - 2382-2396
AB  - Disentangling evolutionary forces that may interact to determine the patterns of genetic differentiation within and among wild populations is a major challenge in evolutionary biology. The objective of this study was to assess the genetic structure and the potential influence of several ecological variables on the extent of genetic differentiation at multiple spatial scales in a widely distributed species, the Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar. A total of 2775 anadromous fish were sampled from 51 rivers along the North American Atlantic coast and were genotyped using 13 microsatellites. A Bayesian analysis clustered these populations into seven genetically and geographically distinct groups, characterized by different environmental and ecological factors, mainly temperature. These groups were also characterized by different extent of genetic differentiation among populations. Dispersal was relatively high and of the same magnitude within compared to among regional groups, which contrasted with the maintenance of a regional genetic structure. However, genetic differentiation was lower among populations exchanging similar rates of local as opposed to inter-regional migrants, over the same geographical scale. This raised the hypothesis that gene flow could be constrained by local adaptation at the regional scale. Both coastal distance and temperature regime were found to influence the observed genetic structure according to landscape genetic analyses. The influence of other factors such as latitude, river length and altitude, migration tactic, and stocking was not significant at any spatial scale. Overall, these results suggested that the interaction between gene flow and thermal regime adaptation mainly explained the hierarchical genetic structure observed among Atlantic salmon populations.

VL  - 3

SP  - 935-942
AB  - The life-histories of exploited fish species, such as Pacific salmon, are vulnerable to a wide variety of anthropogenic stressors including climate change, selective exploitation and competition with hatchery releases for finite foraging resources. However, these stressors may generate unexpected changes in life-histories due to developmental linkages when species complete their migratory life cycle in different habitats. We used multivariate time-series models to quantify changes in the prevalence of different life-history strategies of sockeye salmon from Bristol Bay, Alaska, over the past half-century-specifically, how they partition their lives between freshwater habitats and the ocean. Climate warming has decreased the time spent by salmon in their natal freshwater habitat, as climate-enhanced growth opportunities have enabled earlier migration to the ocean. Migration from freshwater at a younger age, and increasing competition from wild and hatchery-released salmon, have tended to delay maturation toward the salmon spending an additional year feeding in the ocean. Models evaluating the effects of size-selective fishing on these patterns had only small support. These stressors combine to reduce the size-at-age of fish vulnerable to commercial fisheries and have increasingly favoured a single-age class, potentially affecting the age class complexity that stabilizes this highly reliable resource.

TI  - Brook Trout Distribution, Genetics, and Population Characteristics in the Driftless Area of Minnesota
VL  - 35
IS  - 4
SP  - 632-648
AB  - The Driftless Area in southeastern Minnesota is on the southwestern edge of the native range of Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis. It was assumed that native Brook Trout were extirpated from this region in the early 1900s due to degraded stream conditions and stockings of eastern-origin Brook Trout and European Brown Trout Salmo trutta. Our objectives were to examine Brook Trout populations in the region to determine their spatial and genetic distribution and quantify population characteristics. Information on presence or absence of Brook Trout was gathered by electrofishing 174 streams in southeastern Minnesota. Brook Trout were present in 68% of coldwater streams compared with only in 3% in the early 1970s. The increase is likely due to increasing stream discharge throughout the Driftless Area, enabling recolonization or successful establishment of stocked populations. Streams with higher base flow discharge also had higher abundance, larger size at maturity, and larger Brook Trout present. Genetic data on 74 populations were analyzed to characterize genetic variation within populations, assess genetic structure among populations, and determine possible origins. Numerous populations were not associated with known hatchery sources but were primarily composed of geographic groupings that could represent remnant lineages. Although population characteristics were similar among genetic origins, potentially remnant populations should be given conservation priority because they have proven their ability to sustain themselves in this region. Management actions that emphasize maintaining or increasing stream base flows throughout the region will likely enhance remnant Brook Trout populations in the Driftless Area.

VL  - 90

SP  - 1814-1830
AB  - Climate change is altering ecological and evolutionary processes across biological scales. These simultaneous effects of climate change pose a major challenge for predicting the future state of populations, communities and ecosystems. This challenge is further exacerbated by the current lack of integration of research focused on these different scales. We propose that integrating the fields of quantitative genetics and food web ecology will reveal new insights on how climate change may reorganize biodiversity across levels of organization. This is because quantitative genetics links the genotypes of individuals to population-level phenotypic variation due to genetic (G), environmental (E) and gene-by-environment (G x E) factors. Food web ecology, on the other hand, links population-level phenotypes to the structure and dynamics of communities and ecosystems. We synthesize data and theory across these fields and find evidence that genetic (G) and plastic (E and G x E) phenotypic variation within populations will change in magnitude under new climates in predictable ways. We then show how changes in these sources of phenotypic variation can rewire food webs by altering the number and strength of species interactions, with consequences for ecosystem resilience. We also find evidence suggesting there are predictable asymmetries in genetic and plastic trait variation across trophic levels, which set the pace for phenotypic change and food web responses to climate change. Advances in genomics now make it possible to partition G, E and G x E phenotypic variation in natural populations, allowing tests of the hypotheses we propose. By synthesizing advances in quantitative genetics and food web ecology, we provide testable predictions for how the structure and dynamics of biodiversity will respond to climate change.

TI  - Genetic variation of the interaction type between two stressors in a single population: From antagonism to synergism when combining a heat spike and a pesticide*
VL  - 308
AB  - Despite the surging interest in the interactions between toxicants and non-chemical stressors, and in evolutionary ecotoxicology, we have poor knowledge whether these patterns differ among genotypes within a population. Warming and toxicants are two widespread stressors in aquatic systems that are known to modify each other's effects. We studied to what extent effects of sequential exposure to a heat spike and the pesticide esfenvalerate differed among genotypes in the water flea Daphnia magna. Esfenvalerate had similar negative effects on survival and body size across genotypes, and for most genotypes it increased time to maturation, yet the effects on the reproductive performance were only detected in some genotypes and were inconsistent in direction. Across genotypes, the heat spike increased the heat tolerance, yet the negative effects of the heat spike on survival, reproductive performance and body size, and the positive effects on grazing rate and the shortened time to maturation were only seen in some genotypes. Notably, the interaction type between both stressors differed among genotypes. In contrast to our expectation, the impact of esfenvalerate was only magnified by the heat spike in some genotypes and only for a subset of the traits. For survival and time to maturation, the interaction type for the same stressor combination covered all three categories: additions, synergisms and antagonisms. This illustrates that categorizing the interaction type between stressors at the level of populations may hide considerable intrapopulation variation among genotypes. Opposite to our expectation, the more pesticide-tolerant genotypes showed a stronger synergism between both stressors. Genotype-dependent interaction patterns between toxicants and non-chemical stressors may explain inconsistencies among studies and challenges ecological risk assessment based on single genotypes. The observed genetic differences in the responses to the (combined) stressors may fuel the evolution of the stressor interaction pattern, a largely ignored topic in evolutionary ecotoxicology.

TI  - Adaptive dynamics of cuticular hydrocarbons in Drosophila
VL  - 30
IS  - 1
SP  - 66-80
AB  - Cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are hydrophobic compounds deposited on the arthropod cuticle that are of functional significance with respect to stress tolerance, social interactions and mating dynamics. We characterized CHC profiles in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster at five levels: across a latitudinal transect in the eastern United States, as a function of developmental temperature during culture, across seasonal time in replicate years, and as a function of rapid evolution in experimental mesocosms in the field. Furthermore, we also characterized spatial and temporal changes in allele frequencies for SNPs in genes that are associated with the production and chemical profile of CHCs. Our data demonstrate a striking degree of parallelism for clinal and seasonal variation in CHCs in this taxon; CHC profiles also demonstrate significant plasticity in response to rearing temperature, and the observed patterns of plasticity parallel the spatiotemporal patterns observed in nature. We find that these congruent shifts in CHC profiles across time and space are also mirrored by predictable shifts in allele frequencies at SNPs associated with CHC chain length. Finally, we observed rapid and predictable evolution of CHC profiles in experimental mesocosms in the field. Together, these data strongly suggest that CHC profiles respond rapidly and adaptively to environmental parameters that covary with latitude and season, and that this response reflects the process of local adaptation in natural populations of D. melanogaster.

TI  - Can laboratory-reared aphid populations reflect the thermal performance of field populations in studies on pest science and climate change biology?
AB  - Laboratory insect rearing provides well-developed tested insects for research in general biology, pest science and development of pest management technology and products. The effects of environmental conditions on various traits in laboratory populations are often extrapolated to field populations; for example, the thermal performances of laboratory populations are used to predict the phenology and abundance of wild pest populations. However, these studies generally do not consider the potential rapid evolution of the laboratory populations. Therefore, it is not certain whether laboratory populations reflect the performance of field populations in natural fluctuating and sometimes extreme conditions. Here, we used a global insect pest, the English grain aphid [Sitobion avenae (Hemiptera: Aphididae)] as the model system, to compare the demography of field and laboratory populations experimentally under constant and ecologically relevant fluctuating temperatures. Our results indicated that the field population adapted better to fluctuating temperatures and high temperatures. By contrast, the laboratory population adapted better to mild constant temperatures but reduced ability to withstand extremely high temperatures under diurnal fluctuations and chronic high temperatures. Therefore, caution is needed when extending the ecological effects of temperature from laboratory populations to wild populations, especially in environments with extreme events. Laboratory populations require regular replenishing or rearing under fluctuating temperature conditions to maintain the genetic diversity and prevent rapid adaptation to rearing environments.

TI  - Population genomic consequences of life-history and mating system adaptation to a geothermal soil mosaic in yellow monkeyflowers
VL  - 76
IS  - 4
SP  - 765-781
AB  - Local selection can promote phenotypic divergence despite gene flow across habitat mosaics, but adaptation itself may generate substantial barriers to genetic exchange. In plants, life-history, phenology, and mating system divergence have been proposed to promote genetic differentiation in sympatry. In this study, we investigate phenotypic and genetic variation in Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflowers) across a geothermal soil mosaic in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Plants from thermal annual and nonthermal perennial habitats were heritably differentiated for life-history and mating system traits, consistent with local adaptation to the ephemeral thermal-soil growing season. However, genome-wide genetic variation primarily clustered plants by geographic region, with little variation sorting by habitat. The one exception was an extreme thermal population also isolated by a 200 m geographical gap of no intermediate habitat. Individual inbreeding coefficients (F-IS) were higher (and predicted by trait variation) in annual plants and annual pairs showed greater isolation by distance at local (<1 km) scales. Finally, YNP adaptation does not reuse a widespread inversion that underlies M. guttatus life-history ecotypes range-wide, suggesting a novel genetic mechanism. Overall, this work suggests that life-history and mating system adaptation strong enough to shape individual mating patterns does not necessarily generate incipient speciation without geographical barriers.

TI  - Predicting woodrat (Neotoma) responses to anthropogenic warming from studies of the palaeomidden record
VL  - 33
IS  - 12
SP  - 2061-2076
AB  - Aim The influence of anthropogenic climate change on organisms is an area of great scientific concern. Increasingly there is recognition that abrupt climate transitions have occurred over the late Quaternary; studies of these shifts may yield insights into likely biotic responses to contemporary warming. Here, we review research undertaken over the past decade investigating the response of Neotoma (woodrats) body size and distribution to climate change over the late Quaternary (the last 40,000 years). By integrating information from woodrat palaeomiddens, historical museum specimens and field studies of modern populations, we identify potential evolutionary responses to climate change occurring over a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Specifically, we characterize climatic thresholds in the past that led to local species extirpation and/or range alterations rather than in situ adaptation, and apply them to anticipate potential biotic responses to anthropogenic climate change. Location Middens were collected at about 55 sites scattered across the western United States, ranging from about 34 to 46 degrees N and about 104 to 116 degrees W, respectively. Data for modern populations were drawn from studies conducted in Death Valley, California, Missoula, Montana and the Sevilleta LTER site in central New Mexico. Methods We analysed faecal pellets from midden series collected at numerous cave sites across the western United States. From these we estimated body mass using techniques validated in earlier studies. We compared body size fluctuations at different elevations in different regions and integrated these results with studies investigating temperature-body size tradeoffs in modern animals. We also quantify the rapidity of the size changes over the late Quaternary to estimate the evolutionary capacity of woodrats to deal with predicted rates of anthropogenic climate change over the next century. Results We find remarkable similarities across the geographical range to late Quaternary climate change. In the middle of the geographical range woodrats respond in accordance to Bergmann's rule: colder climatic conditions select for larger body size and warmer conditions select for smaller body size. Patterns are more complicated at range boundaries, and local environmental conditions influence the observed response. In general, woodrat body size fluctuates with approximately the same amplitude and frequency as climate; there is a significant and positive correlation between woodrat body size and generalized climate proxies (such as ice core records). Woodrats have achieved evolutionary rates of change equal to or greater than those needed to adapt in situ to anthropogenic climate change. Main conclusions In situ body size evolution is a likely outcome of climate change, and such shifts are part of a normal spectrum of adaptation. Woodrats appear to be subject to ongoing body size selection in response to fluctuating environmental conditions. Allometric considerations suggest that these shifts in body size lead to substantial changes in the physiology, life history and ecology of woodrats, and on their direct and indirect interactions with other organisms in the ecosystem. Our work highlights the importance of a finely resolved and long-term record in understanding biotic responses to climatic shifts.

TI  - Exploring thermal flight responses as predictors of flight ability and geographic range size in Drosophila
VL  - 236
AB  - Thermal flight performance curves (TFPCs) may be a useful proxy for determining dispersal on daily timescales in winged insect species. Few studies have assessed TFPCs across a range of species under standard conditions despite that they may be useful in predicting variation in performance, abundance or geographic range shifts with forecast climate variability. Indeed, the factors determining realized dispersal within and among flying insect species are generally poorly understood. To better understand how flight performance may be correlated with geographic range extent and potential latitudinal climate variability, we estimated the thermal performance curves of flight ability in 11 Drosophilidae species (in 4 degrees C increments across 16-28 degrees C) after standard laboratory rearing for two generations. We tested if key morphological, evolutionary or ecological factors (e.g. species identity, sex, body mass, wing loading, geographic range size) predicted traits of TFPCs (including optimum temperature, maximum performance, thermal breadth of performance) or flight ability (success/failure to fly). Although several parameters of TFPCs varied among species these were typically not statistically significant probably owing to the relatively small pool of species assessed and the limited trait variation detected. The best explanatory model of these flight responses across species included significant positive effects of test temperature and wing area. However, the rank of geographic distribution breadth and phylogeny failed to explain significant variation in most of the traits, except for thermal performance breadth, of thermal flight performance curves among these 11 species. Future studies that employ a wider range of Drosophilidae species, especially if coupled with fine-scale estimates of species' environmental niches, would be useful.

TI  - Heritability of heat tolerance in zebra mussel veligers
VL  - 30
IS  - 3
SP  - 360-366
AB  - Previous work has suggested that zebra mussel populations differ in temperature tolerance and researchers have hypothesized that these differences have been caused by natural selection. For selection to act on a phenotypic character such as heat tolerance, there must be additive genetic variation for the character within populations. Individuals must have different alleles at loci that contribute to measurable differences in the phenotypic character of interest. We tested the hypothesis that heat tolerance of zebra mussel veligers has an additive genetic component and is therefore heritable. We used a full-sib, half-sib design with a large number of full-sib families (20), half-sib families (5), and offspring (averaging 41) per family (estimated power, beta = 0.75). We exposed family groups to a lethal temperature of 34degreesC and determined individual time-to-death. Our best estimate of heritability (which can range from 0 to 1) was -0.125 ( +/-0.095), which implies that heritability of heat tolerance among veligers was extremely low. These results are surprising given the high genetic diversity reported for North American zebra mussel populations. A lack of additive genetic variation for heat tolerance within the studied population means that heat tolerance of the veliger stage is not likely to increase further via natural selection. Further studies examining both the veliger and adult stages, and examining populations in different watersheds are required to show whether this lack of variation is widespread among North American zebra mussel populations.

TI  - Repeatability and heritability of resting metabolic rate in a long-lived amphibian
VL  - 253
AB  - Resting metabolic rate (RMR), i.e. spent energy necessary to maintain basic life functions, is a basic component of energy budget in ectotherms. The evolution of RMR through natural selection rests on the premise of its non-zero repeatability and heritability, i.e. consistent variation within individual lifetimes and resemblance between parents and their offspring, respectively. Joint estimates of RMR repeatability and heritability are missing in ectotherms, however, which precludes estimations of the evolutionary potential of this trait. We examined RMR repeatability and heritability in a long-lived ectotherm, the alpine newt (Ichthyosaura alpestris). Individual RMR was repeatable over both six-month (0.28 +/- 0.09 [SE]) and five-year (0.16 +/- 0.07) periods. While there was no resemblance between parent and offspring RMR (0.21 +/- 0.34), the trait showed similarity among offspring within families (broad-sense heritability; 0.25 +/- 0.09). Similar repeatability and broad-sense heritability values in parental and offspring generations, respectively, and non-conclusive narrow-sense heritability suggest the contribution of non-additive genetic factors to total phenotypic variance in this trait. We conclude that RMR evolutionary trajectories are shaped by other processes than natural selection in this long-lived ectotherm.

VL  - 18
IS  - 1
SP  - 45-56
AB  - Distributions of non-native fish represent the outcome of a match between the habitat and the traits of a given species. Thermal tolerance, in particular, is highly variable among species and is one of the dominant organismal traits limiting the establishment and persistence of non-native species. Population and individual variation in thermal tolerance has implications for ecological processes such as the establishment of non-native species, especially when non-native species are introduced at the periphery of their thermal niche. Cold tolerance of wild-caught (escaped) and farm-raised (farmed) populations of green swordtail (Xiphophorus hellerii) was determined using field surveys and thermal tolerance methodology to examine whether populations exhibit predictable patterns of cold tolerance distributed across the landscape. The green swordtail, native to tropical Central America, is common in the ornamental trade with some evidence of establishment in subtropical Florida, USA. Seven escaped or farmed populations were examined: one import farmed (Thailand), two Florida farmed, two interior Florida escaped and two coastal Florida escaped. Highly variable chronic lethal minimum temperatures (CLmin) were found for individual fish, ranging from 5.5 to 11.3 degrees C. Significant population differences were also found where escaped populations (range 6.1-7.1 degrees C) exhibited lower CLmin than farmed populations (7.9-8.0 degrees C) and were nearly 50 % lower than those imported from Thailand (8.9 degrees C). The field exposure experiment revealed similar patterns; escaped populations exhibited greater survival during cold January conditions. Escaped populations were captured throughout the year, suggesting locally persistent populations. Whether of genetic or plastic origins, variation in thermal tolerance shown here has implications for the persistence and predicted range of introduced species.

VL  - 88

AB  - Global change is altering biodiversity locally and globally and subsequently affecting the dynamics of communities and ecosystems. Biodiversity can be impacted both at the interspecific (i.e., species composition of communities) and at the intraspecific (evolutionary modification of phenotypic traits through selection or plasticity) levels. Changes in intraspecific diversity have been demonstrated to generate evolutionary feedbacks acting on ecological dynamics. Quantifying the role of intraspecific trait variation, global change and their interactions on ecological dynamics is of utmost importance. Here, we used the range-expanding dragonfly Crocothemis erythraea as a model species to test the relative effects of intraspecific trait variation in larvae and thermal conditions on the dynamics of freshwater community and ecosystem functioning. Using experimental mesocosms, we manipulated intraspecific trait variation arising from genetic (G), early developmental environment (E-E) and late developmental environment (E-L) contributions in a full factorial design. We showed that intraspecific trait variation arising from genetic effects has the strongest consequences on community and ecosystem dynamics relative to trait variation driven by the thermal environment (E-E and E-L). Importantly, the ecological effects of trait variation due to genetic effects were partly modulated by thermal conditions (G x E-L, and to a lesser extent G x E-E interactions) and varied among ecological response variables. For instance, the strongest G x E-L effects were observed on primary productivity and zooplankton dynamics. Trait variation driven by plasticity related to early or late developmental environments has an overall weak effect on ecological dynamics. Intraspecific trait variation induced by genetic effects can affect ecological dynamics (evo-to-eco dynamics) more strongly than variation induced by the developmental environment. However, they likely interact to modulate the structure of communities and the functioning of ecosystems, highlighting the strong context (environmental) dependency of evo-to-eco dynamics.

Organism: We studied seasonal variation in plasticity of a population of Daphnia, a key grazer in alpine lakes. Methods: We isolated maternal lines of Daphnia pulicaria from Blue Lake (Sierra Nevada, CA) at four different times throughout the growing season, then measured phenotypic traits and survivorship after individuals were reared at two temperatures (17 degrees C and 24 degrees C). Results: We found mixed evidence for the role of thermal variation in maintaining plasticity. Thermal plasticity for offspring number and age at maturity varied seasonally; however, inconsistent with our hypothesis, neither response was related to stratification. Similarly, we observed lower plasticity for the clutch interval when the lake experienced peak thermal stratification in mid-summer compared with early-fall conditions. In contrast, plasticity for critical maximum temperature (CTmax) was highest during peak stratification. As CTmax is a direct measurement of upper thermal limits, it should be related to maximum temperature experienced in the water column. Thus, this result is consistent with a positive correlation between thermal variation and plasticity. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the degree of plasticity in response to temperature varies throughout the season in relation to thermal stratification, with different life-history traits showing distinct seasonal patterns of plasticity.

TI  - Rapid evolutionary responses to selection in heterogeneous environments among agricultural and nonagricultural weeds
VL  - 166
IS  - 4
SP  - 641-647
AB  - Agricultural settings are hypothesized to impose strong selection on invading weed species, and the direction of selection can be consistent across many generations, depending on crop-rotation schedules. Because the history of selection is often known, agricultural environments provide a useful experimental setting for studies testing mechanisms of adaptation and rates of evolutionary response. Here, two populations of Abutilon theophrasti with known evolutionary histories of competing either in agricultural or nonagricultural settings were reciprocally transplanted across experimental treatments simulating the site of origin ( rotating corn and soybean cultivation, local weeds, or no-competition control). Consistent with hypotheses of local adaptation, the agricultural population had higher fitness than the nonagricultural population in the cornfield treatment. The nonagricultural population had higher fitness in the no-competition control. Because weedy, nonagricultural sites are typically patchy and consist of both high- and low-density (i.e., noncompetitive) microsites, the observed population differences in fitness in the no-competition control also indicate local adaptation. In addition to fitness, the two populations differed in the expression of life-history traits such that the life-history of the agricultural population was accelerated relative to the nonagricultural population. The observed life-history differences probably reflect adaptive synchronization of life-history events to the shorter growth season duration of agricultural relative to nonagricultural sites. Because the two experimental populations have histories of only 10 - 50 yr in the site of origin, the results provide evidence of rapid differentiation.

TI  - Population Genomic Time Series Data of a Natural Population Suggests Adaptive Tracking of Fluctuating Environmental Changes
AB  - Natural populations are constantly exposed to fluctuating environmental changes that negatively affect their fitness in unpredictable ways. While theoretical models show the possibility of counteracting these environmental changes through rapid evolutionary adaptations, there have been few empirical studies demonstrating such adaptive tracking in natural populations. Here, we analyzed environmental data, fitness-related phenotyping and genomic time-series data sampled over 3 years from a natural Chironomus riparius (Diptera, Insecta) population to address this question. We show that the population's environment varied significantly on the time scale of the sampling in many selectively relevant dimensions, independently of each other. Similarly, phenotypic fitness components evolved significantly on the same temporal scale (mean 0.32 Haldanes), likewise independent from each other. The allele frequencies of 367,446 SNPs across the genome showed evidence of positive selection. Using temporal correlation of spatially coherent allele frequency changes revealed 35,574 haplotypes with more than one selected SNP. The mean selection coefficient for these haplotypes was 0.30 (s.d. = 0.68). The frequency changes of these haplotypes clustered in 46 different temporal patterns, indicating concerted, independent evolution of many polygenic traits. Nine of these patterns were strongly correlated with measured environmental variables. Enrichment analysis of affected genes suggested the implication of a wide variety of biological processes. Thus, our results suggest overall that the natural population of C. riparius tracks environmental change through rapid polygenic adaptation in many independent dimensions. This is further evidence that natural selection is pervasive at the genomic level and that evolutionary and ecological time scales may not differ at all, at least in some organisms.

TI  - Genetic Basis Underlying Rapid Evolution of an Introduced Insect Ophraella communa (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae): Heritability of Photoperiodic Response
VL  - 46
IS  - 1
SP  - 167-173
AB  - The introduced beetle Ophraella communa LeSage has adapted to local environments in Japan in a short period by adjusting the photoperiodic response for induction of reproductive diapause. Based on these results, we predicted that the O. communa population has significant genetic variation in this trait on which natural selection should act. To examine the type and amount of genetic variation in photoperiodic response in O. communa, we performed artificial selection on this trait in opposite directions, i. e., directions of diapausing and nondiapausing under a photoperiod of 13: 11 (L: D) h, using three Tsukuba (Japan) lines derived from different years (2005, 2006, and 2012). Bidirectional selection shifted the diapause incidence to 100% in six or seven generations (diapausing selection) or 0% in five to eight generations (nondiapausing selection). The offspring produced by hybridization between diapausing and nondiapausing lines exhibited a wide range of diapause incidence under a photoperiod of 13: 11 (L: D) h, depending on the differences in the number of selected generations between the two parental lines. These results show that the photoperiodic response of O. communa is not inherited in a simple Mendelian manner but under polygenic control. Based on the results of artificial selection, we estimated the heritability of photoperiodic response, assuming polygenic inheritance. The heritability estimates were 0.770 to 0.856 in diapausing lines and 0.208 to 0.620 in nondiapausing lines, indicating substantial genetic variation in this trait. Thus, genetic variation in photoperiodic response of O. communa is one factor allowing the beetle to adapt rapidly to newly colonized habitats.

TI  - Genetic Composition of the Warm Springs River Chinook Salmon Population Maintained following Eight Generations of Hatchery Production
VL  - 143
IS  - 5
SP  - 1280-1294
AB  - Balancing the disparate objectives of fishery augmentation and conservation of an endemic fish population presents a substantial challenge. In the case of Warm Springs National Fish Hatchery (Warm Springs Hatchery), strategies for achieving both objectives included incorporation of natural fish into the hatchery broodstock and restricting proportions of hatchery fish on the spawning grounds. The hatchery has been more successful in implementing the latter than the former. We analyzed 76 single nucleotide polymorphism markers in Spring Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha collected from the Warm Springs River in 1976-1977 (prior to hatchery production) and 2001-2011 (posthatchery) to examine whether the genetic characteristics of the endemic population had changed during that time. Pre- and posthatchery collections clustered together when compared with those from Round Butte Hatchery, which has a nearby segregated program, and other Columbia River populations. The difference between pre- and posthatchery collections was nonsignificant, but posthatchery samples exhibited significantly lower expected heterozygosity. We observed some evidence of reduced effective size and increased genetic drift in fish produced at Warm Springs Hatchery (relative to natural-origin fish) and even stronger evidence of this in fish produced at Round Butte Hatchery. We conclude that natural-origin Chinook Salmon returning to the Warm Springs River form a distinct group within the interior Columbia Basin spring-run lineage and have changed very little over the past eight generations. We further speculate that differences between hatchery-and natural-origin fish at Warm Springs Hatchery are expected to increase if hatchery operations remain static (i.e., little integration of natural-origin fish and incorporation of Round Butte Hatchery fish in the broodstock).

TI  - Adaptive divergence vs. environmental plasticity: tracing local genetic adaptation of metamorphosis traits in salamanders
VL  - 13
IS  - 6
SP  - 1665-1677
AB  - In order to assess the significance of local adaptation relative to environmental plasticity on the evolution of life history traits, we analysed the possible genetic basis of differences between pond- and stream-breeding fire salamanders (Salamandra salamandra) in Germany. These salamanders typically deposit their larvae in small streams, where they grow until they are sufficiently large to metamorphose. However, some populations in Western Germany use ponds as larval habitat. Because habitat quality of streams differs from that of ponds one expects life history differences in the pond animals, which may result either from a plastic response or through genetic differentiation (i.e. local adaptation). Using a phylogeographical analysis of mitochondrial D-loop sequences, we show that both stream and pond populations in Western Germany are derived from a single lineage that recolonized following the last glaciation. This finding suggests that pond breeding originated very recently. Our studies of habitat quality and metamorphic behaviour of larvae in natural ponds and streams disclosed that pond larvae experience a significantly reduced food supply and greater risk of drying than do stream larvae. Pond larvae metamorphose earlier at the cost of reduced mass. Common-environment experiments with pond and stream larvae show that metamorphic behaviour of pond larvae under limited-food conditions is determined genetically and is not simply a plastic response to the differing habitat conditions. These results show that phenotypic plasticity is less important than local adaptation in explaining differences in ecological diversification within this species and suggests the possibility of rapid evolution of genetic adaptations when new habitats are exploited.

TI  - Decimation by sea star wasting disease and rapid genetic change in a keystone species, Pisaster ochraceus
VL  - 115

SP  - 7069-7074
AB  - Standing genetic variation enables or restricts a population's capacity to respond to changing conditions, including the extreme disturbances expected to increase in frequency and intensity with continuing anthropogenic climate change. However, we know little about how populations might respond to extreme events with rapid genetic shifts, or how population dynamics may influence and be influenced by population genomic change. We use a range-wide epizootic, sea star wasting disease, that onset in mid-2013 and caused mass mortality in Pisaster ochraceus to explore how a keystone marine species responded to an extreme perturbation. We integrated field surveys with restriction site-associated DNA sequencing data to (i) describe the population dynamics of mortality and recovery, and (ii) compare allele frequencies in mature P. ochraceus before the disease outbreak with allele frequencies in adults and new juveniles after the outbreak, to identify whether selection may have occurred. We found P. ochraceus suffered 81% mortality in the study region between 2012 and 2015, and experienced a concurrent 74-fold increase in recruitment beginning in late 2013. Comparison of pre- and postoutbreak adults revealed significant allele frequency changes at three loci, which showed consistent changes across the large majority of locations. Allele frequency shifts in juvenile P. ochraceus (spawned from premortality adults) were consistent with those seen in adult survivors. Such parallel shifts suggest detectable signals of selection and highlight the potential for persistence of this change in subsequent generations, which may influence the resilience of this keystone species to future outbreaks.

TI  - Oxygen consumption in weakly electric Neotropical fishes
VL  - 137

SP  - 502-511
AB  - Weakly electric gymnotiform fishes with wave-type electric organ discharge (EOD) are less hypoxia-tolerant and are less likely to be found in hypoxic habitats than weakly electric gymnotiforms with pulse-type EOD, suggesting that differences in metabolism resulting from EOD type affects habitat choice. Although gymnotiform fishes are common in most Neotropical freshwaters and represent the dominant vertebrates in some habitats, the metabolic rates of these unique fishes have never been determined. In this study, O-2 consumption rates during EOD generation are reported for 34 gymnotiforms representing 23 species, all five families and 17 (59%) of the 28 genera. Over the size range sampled (0.4 g to 125 g), O-2 consumption of gymnotiform fishes was dependent on body mass, as expected, fitting a power function with a scaling exponent of 0.74, but the O-2 consumption rate was generally about 50% of that expected by extrapolation of temperate teleost metabolic rates to a similar ambient temperature (26degreesC). O-2 consumption rate was not dependent on EOD type, but maintenance of 'scan swimming' (continuous forwards and backwards swimming), which is characteristic only of gymnotiforms with wave-type EODs, increased O-2 consumption 2.83+/-0.49-fold (mean+/-SD). This suggests that the increased metabolic cost of scan swimming could restrict gymnotiforms with wave-type EODs from hypoxic habitats.

TI  - Unifying evolutionary dynamics: From individual stochastic processes to macroscopic models
VL  - 69
IS  - 3
SP  - 297-321
AB  - A distinctive signature of living systems is Darwinian evolution, that is, a propensity to generate its well as self-select individual diversity. To capture this essential feature of life while describing the dynamics Of Populations, mathematical models must be rooted in the microscopic, stochastic description of discrete individuals characterized by one or several adaptive traits and interacting with each other. The simplest models assume asexual reproduction and haploid genetics: an offspring usually inherits the trait values of her progenitor, except when a Mutation causes the offspring to take it mutation step to new trait values; selection follows from ecological interactions among individuals. Here we present it rigorous construction of the microscopic population process that captures the probabilistic dynamics over continuous time of birth, mutation, and death, as influenced by the trait values of each individual, and interactions between individuals. A by-product of this formal construction is a general algorithm for efficient numerical simulation of the individual-level model. Once the microscopic process is in place, we derive different macroscopic models of adaptive evolution. These models differ in the renormalization they assume, i.e. in the limits taken, in specific orders, on population size, initiation rate, mutation step, while rescaling time accordingly. The macroscopic models also differ in their mathematical nature: deterministic, in the form of ordinary, integro-, or partial differential equations, or probabilistic, like stochastic partial differential equations or superprocesses. These models include extensions of Kimura's equation (and of its approximation for small mutation effects) to frequency- and density-dependent selection. A novel class of macroscopic models obtains when assuming that individual birth and death occur on a short timescale compared with the timescale of typical Population growth. On a timescale of very rare mutations, we establish rigorously the models of "trait substitution sequences" and their approximation known as the "canonical equation of adaptive dynamics". We extend these models to account for mutation bias and random drift between multiple evolutionary attractors. The renormalization approach used in this Study also opens promising avenues to Study and predict patterns of life-history allometries, thereby bridging individual physiology, genetic variation, and ecological interactions in it common evolutionary framework.

TI  - Population-level responses to temperature, density and clonal differences in Daphnia magna as revealed by integral projection modelling
VL  - 32
IS  - 10
SP  - 2407-2422
AB  - 1. Raising global temperatures are predicted to have strong consequences for ectotherms, as metabolic rates depend directly on external temperatures. To understand consequences for population fitness, a full life cycle approach is important because (a) temperature can have opposite effects on different vital rates (growth, survival, reproduction) and (b) sensitivities of population growth rate to changes in vital rates can vary in magnitude. As vital rates are concurrently influenced by other factors, adequately predicting temperature effects requires factors such as body size, population density and genetics to be taken into account. 2. The aim of this study was to quantify the role of temperature on all vital rates of Daphnia magna individuals and their integrated effects on population dynamics. In addition, we evaluated how clonal lineages differed in their temperature response, both on the vital rate and population level. 3. We performed a laboratory experiment, in which we followed 40 populations (five clonal lineages x eight temperatures) during 80 days. Due to our novel set-up, we were able to quantify vital rates of individuals within those populations. We identified relations between vital rates and body size, lineage, temperature and population density and used a size-structured integral projection model to integrate the experimental effects over all vital rates. 4. We found negative density dependence in growth and reproduction, resulting in lineage-specific carrying capacities. Population fitness showed a thermal optimum that differed among genotypes. It is interesting that we found that clones had different life-history strategies, optimizing population fitness via different routes. As no lineage outperformed the others in all vital rates, we identified trade-offs between vital rates, which had strong effects on the dynamics of the population. Moreover, simulations suggest that the genetic composition of mixed populations is temperature-dependent. 5. Our results underscore the importance of studying individuals within their population when predicting responses to environmental change. The observed density effects, which were as strong as temperature effects but explained considerably more variation in population growth, would have been overlooked in life table experiments. Furthermore, differential temperature responses emphasize the importance of genetic variation in the ability of ectotherm species such as Daphnia magna to respond to climate change.

AB  - When temperature and other kinds of barrier divide formerly continuous populations and confine them to more restricted geographical areas, there is an evolutionary reaction that will, over time, result in the formation of endemic species. In such cases, an allopatric speciation process is considered to have taken place because reproductive isolation was caused by physical means instead of by natural selection. In contrast, when populations exist in a very high-diversity area and remain undivided by physical events, they exhibit a tendency to speciate by means of sympatry (or parapatry). This process, sometimes called competitive or ecological speciation, does involve reproductive isolation by means of natural selection. Populations that exist in geographical provinces bounded by physical barriers add to the overall diversity through the production of endemic species. This increase by species packing is relatively slow due to the very gradual tempo of the allopatric speciation process. Populations existing in centres of origin add to the general diversity through the production of species that are dominant in terms of their ability to spread over large parts of the world. It is proposed that such species are usually formed by sympatric speciation, a process that can be c. 20 times faster than species formation by allopatry. It is not suggested that sympatry is exclusive to centres of origin, nor that allopatry is confined to peripheral provinces. Both processes are widespread, but there do appear to be distinctive geographical concentrations. Considering that numbers of widespread species produced by centres of origin may eventually become subdivided by barriers, and thus give rise to descendants by allopatry, it is difficult to say how much of our present species diversity has come from one source or the other. Both speciation by sympatry from centres of origin and speciation by allopatry in peripheral provinces appear to be important sources of marine biodiversity.

TI  - Metabolic rate thermal plasticity in the marine annelid Ophryotrocha labronica across two successive generations
AB  - Marine ectotherms have evolved a range of physiological strategies to cope with temperature changes that persist across generations. For example, metabolic rates are expected to increase following an acute exposure to temperature, with potential detrimental impacts for fitness. However, they may be downregulated in the following generation if offspring experience the thermal conditions of their parents, with a resulting decrease in maintenance costs and fitness maximization. Yet, trans-generational studies on metabolic rates are few in marine ectotherms, thus limiting our ability to accurately predict longer-term implications of ocean warming on organisms' performance, metabolic rates being the fundamental pacemaker for all biological processes. This is particularly true for small-size organisms, for which the determination of individual metabolic rates has been historically challenging, and for many groups of marine invertebrates, such as annelids, which are under-represented in physiological investigations. Here, we exposed the subtidal annelid Ophryotrocha labronica (body length: similar to 4 mm) to a thermal gradient (21, 24, 26, 29 degrees C) and measured, for the first time in this species, the temperature dependence of metabolic rates across two generations. We found that metabolic rates were positively related to temperature, but this relationship did not differ between generations. Our study provides additional evidence for the diversity of temperature-associated physiological responses of marine ectotherms and offers a number of methodological recommendations for unveiling the mechanisms underpinning the observed trans-generational responses of metabolic rates in marine annelid species.

VL  - 135
SP  - 1-9
AB  - Building occupants' perception of thermal comfort can be influenced by a number of contextual factors, such as their demographic and anthropometric characteristics, behavioural patterns and cultural aspects. The objective of this work is to investigate the relationship between various contextual factors and the perception of thermal comfort in workplaces, by examining the gap between the current thermal comfort criteria and the actual requirements observed for different groups of occupants. The classic thermal comfort field research design i.e. simultaneous measurements of physical environmental parameters and questionnaire surveys, was implemented for two years in both centralised HVAC and mixed-mode office buildings located in Southern Brazil. Over 7500 questionnaires were completed by occupants of the buildings. Key variables including the participants' gender, age, body mass index, prior exposure to air-conditioning and building ventilation type were investigated in order to identify their association with thermal discomfort in the office workplace. Our results suggest that males, overweight occupants and those who are more frequently exposed to air-conditioning are more likely to express thermal discomfort due to feeling 'warm', compared to females, non-overweight occupants and those who were exposed to air-conditioning less frequently. In comparison, females, non-overweight occupants, air-conditioning light users, and occupants of centralised HVAC buildings were more likely to declare 'cold' discomfort. We also investigated how those variables were related to the width of thermal comfort zone. The analysis indicates that different groups of occupants require different comfort zones, suggesting that group differences should be considered when designing/operating spaces for diverse groups of occupants.

TI  - Can heat waves change the trophic role of the world's most invasive crayfish? Diet shifts in Procambarus clarkii
VL  - 12
IS  - 9
AB  - In the Mediterranean basin, the globally increasing temperatures are expected to be accompanied by longer heat waves. Commonly assumed to benefit cold-limited invasive alien species, these climatic changes may also change their feeding preferences, especially in the case of omnivorous ectotherms. We investigated heat wave effects on diet choice, growth and energy reserves in the invasive red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. In laboratory experiments, we fed juvenile and adult crayfish on animal, plant or mixed diets and exposed them to a short or a long heat wave. We then measured crayfish survival, growth, body reserves and Fulton's condition index. Diet choices of the crayfish maintained on the mixed diet were estimated using stable isotopes (C-13 and N-15). The results suggest a decreased efficiency of carnivorous diets at higher temperatures, as juveniles fed on the animal diet were unable to maintain high growth rates in the long heat wave; and a decreased efficiency of herbivorous diets at lower temperatures, as juveniles in the cold accumulated less body reserves when fed on the plant diet. Heat wave treatments increased the assimilation of plant material, especially in juveniles, allowing them to sustain high growth rates in the long heat wave. Contrary to our expectations, crayfish performance decreased in the long heat wave, suggesting that Mediterranean summer heat waves may have negative effects on P. clarkii and that they are unlikely to boost its populations in this region. Although uncertain, it is possible that the greater assimilation of the plant diet resulted from changes in crayfish feeding preferences, raising the hypotheses that i) heat waves may change the predominant impacts of this keystone species and ii) that by altering species' trophic niches, climate change may alter the main impacts of invasive alien species.

TI  - On the Ecology and Distribution of Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in California's Eel River
VL  - 111
IS  - 6
SP  - 548-563
AB  - The preservation of life history and other phenotypic complexity is central to the resilience of Pacific salmon stocks. Steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) express a diversity of life-history strategies such as the propensity to migrate (anadromy/residency) and the timing and state of maturation upon return to freshwater (run-timing), providing an opportunity to study adaptive phenotypic complexity. Historically, the Eel River supported upwards of 1 million salmon and steelhead, but the past century has seen dramatic declines of all salmonids in the watershed. Here we investigate life-history variation in Eel River steelhead by using Rapture sequencing, on thousands of individuals, to genotype the region diagnostic for run-timing (GREB1L) and the region strongly associated with residency/anadromy (OMY5) in the Eel River and other locations, as well as determine patterns of overall genetic differentiation. Our results provide insight into many conservation-related issues. For example, we found that distinct segregation between winter and summer-run steelhead correlated with flow-dependent barriers in major forks of the Eel, that summer-run steelhead inhabited the upper Eel prior to construction of an impassable dam, and that both life history and overall genetic diversity have been maintained in the resident trout population above; and we found no evidence of the summer-run allele in the South Fork Eel, indicating that summer run-timing cannot be expected to arise from standing genetic variation in this and other populations that lack the summer-run phenotype. The results presented in this study provide valuable information for designing future restoration and management strategies for O. mykiss in Northern California and beyond.

TI  - Early Observations from Monitoring a Reintroduction Program: Return of Sockeye Salmon to a Nursery Lake of Historical Importance
VL  - 148
IS  - 2
SP  - 271-288
AB  - The historical distribution of Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in the Columbia River basin has been constrained by the species' dependence on nursery lakes for juvenile rearing. Several productive lake systems were impounded by dams during the last century leading to the extirpation of Sockeye Salmon from many nursery lakes in the region. Recent efforts to re-establish populations in historically natal areas are exemplified by the Cle Elum Lake reintroduction program. The program is founded on outplanting adult fish from two middle Columbia River donor populations with different adaptive potentials. We used genetic stock identification methods to differentiate stock origins between Osoyoos Lake (OSO) and Lake Wenatchee (WEN) donor stocks and to evaluate the relative productivity from two brood years (2011 and 2012) of natural spawning in the novel environment. Spawning ground surveys revealed assortative mating between earlier-spawning WEN fish that were more abundant farthest upstream and later-spawning OSO fish that were concentrated (82%) downstream nearest the lake. Hybrids accounted for only 5% of sampled smolts and 4% of adult returns. Smolts rearing in Cle Elum Lake were significantly larger overall (OSO, 140 mm; WEN, 129 mm) than smolts in either donor population (84 mm). However, the average size of OSO smolts varied among emigration years, and relative smolt abundances favored the WEN stock (70% overall), indicative of a rearing survival advantage. In relation, the WEN stock exhibited a better average rate of replacement (0.80) in adult-to-adult escapement compared with the OSO stock (0.17). Continued monitoring will focus on trends in productivity and potential demographic shifts that may arise in the Cle Elum Lake population and will provide managers with information concerning limiting factors in the environment that might affect similar approaches to reintroductions in other lake systems.

TI  - Plasticity of haemoglobin concentration and thermoregulation in a mountain lizard
VL  - 92
AB  - The plastic capability of species to cope with the new conditions created by climate change is poorly understood. This is particularly relevant for organisms restricted to high elevations because they are adapted to cold temperatures and low oxygen availability. Therefore, evaluating trait plasticity of mountain specialists is fundamental to understand their vulnerability to environmental change. We transplanted mountain lizards, Iberolacerta cyreni, 800 m downhill to evaluate the plastic response in body condition, thermoregulation traits, haemoglobin level, and haemoparasite load. Initial measurements of body mass, total haemoglobin concentration ([Hb]), hematic parasite intensities, dorsal luminance, and thermoregulatory behaviour were resampled after two and four weeks of acclimation. We also tested whether an anti-parasitic drug reduced haemoparasite intensity. After only two weeks of acclimation to a lower elevation, lizards decreased 42% in [Hb], had 17% less parasite intensities, increased body condition by 25%, and raised by similar to 3% their mean preferred temperatures and their voluntary thermal maximum. The anti-parasitic treatment had no significant effect on the intensity of hematic parasites, but our results suggest that negative effects of haemoparasites on [Hb] are relaxed at lower elevation. The rapid plastic changes observed in thermal preferences, body condition, [Hb], and parasite intensity of I. cyreni demonstrate a potential plastic response of a mountain specialist. This may be adaptive under the climatic extremes typical of mountain habitats. However, there is uncertainty in whether the observed plasticity can also help overcome long term environmental changes.

TI  - Evolution of conspicuous colouration, body size and gregariousness: a comparative analysis of lepidopteran larvae
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
SP  - 51-66
AB  - Protective colouration in animals includes camouflage (i.e., crypsis), that decreases the risk of detection, and conspicuous colouration, which is often used in combination with chemical defences to deter predators from attacking. Experiments have shown that the efficacy of conspicuous colouration increases with increasing size of pattern elements and larger body size. Prey species that have acquired avoidance inducing colouration therefore may be exposed to selection for larger body size, and such colouration may more easily evolve in large than in small prey species. Here we test for a difference in body size between species with different colouration modes and perform a comparative analysis based on phylogenetically independent contrasts to examine if evolutionary shifts in colour pattern have been associated with evolutionary changes in body size, using data for 578 species of moths. Larval body size did not differ between species with signalling and non-signalling larvae, and results from the comparative analysis suggest that these two traits have not evolved in parallel. The lack of association between evolutionary changes in colouration and body size may reflect a confounding influence of lifestyle, because evolutionary shifts from solitary to group-living larvae were associated with decreased larval body length and adult wing span. Because evolutionary changes in larval body size were associated with evolutionary changes in adult wing span the predicted association between colouration and size may have been confounded also by conflicting selection on body size in larvae and adults.

TI  - Invasive Widow Spiders Perform Differently at Low Temperatures from Conspecifics from the Native Range
VL  - 62
IS  - 2
SP  - 179-190
AB  - Temperature challenges are one of the leading abiotic causes of success or failure of non-native species in a novel environment, and this is particularly true for low temperatures. Establishing and reproducing in a novel thermal environment can alter survival, behavior, and traits related to fitness. It has been proposed that plasticity or adaptation of thermal tolerance may allow an introduced species to thrive, or that successful invaders may be those with a thermal breadth in their native habitat that encompasses their new environment. Here, we tested these hypotheses using native and invasive populations of Australian redback spiders (Latrodectus hasselti). We measured how exposure to temperatures common to invasive and native range habitats (exposure to 15 and 25 degrees C, respectively) affected behavioral and life-history traits and trade-offs that may underlie fitness in an invasive population detected in 1995 in Japan and a native population from Australia. We found that the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) was higher in the invasive population from Japan than in the native population, but critical thermal maximum (CTmax) did not differ between populations. Compared to the invasive population, eggs from the native population had a longer development time and lower hatching success at 15 degrees C. Both populations performed equally well at 25 degrees C, as measured by egg development time and hatching success. Invasive juveniles tested at 15 degrees C were faster to explore a novel environment and bolder compared to those tested at 25 degrees C. In comparison, the native population showed faster average exploration, with no differences in boldness or exploration at the two development or testing temperatures. Overall, L. hasselti from Japan maintained hatching success and development across a wider temperature range than the native population, indicating greater thermal breadth and higher behavioral plasticity. These results support the importance of plasticity in thermal tolerance and behavior for a successful invasion under novel environmental temperatures.

TI  - A tale of two species: Extirpation and range expansion during the late Quaternary in an extreme environment
VL  - 65
IS  - 3
SP  - 122-133
AB  - Death Valley, California is today the hottest hyperarid area in the western Hemisphere with temperatures of 57 degrees C (134 degrees F) recorded. During the late Quaternary, pluvial Lake Manly covered much of the Valley and contributed to a much more moderate climate. The abrupt draining of Lake Manly in the mid-Holocene and coincident dramatic shifts in temperature and aridity exerted substantial selection pressure on organisms living in this area. Our research investigates the adaptive response of Neotoma (woodrats) to temperature change over the late Quaternary along a steep elevational and environmental gradient. By combining fieldwork, examination of museum specimens, and collection of paleomiddens, our project reconstructs the divergent evolutionary histories of animals from the valley floor and nearby mountain gradients (-84 to >3400 m). We report on recent paleomidden work investigating a transition zone in the Grapevine Mountains (Amargosa Range) for two species of woodrats differing significantly in size and habitat preferences: N. lepida, the desert woodrat, and N. cinerea, the bushy-tailed woodrat. Here, at the limits of these species' thermal and ecological thresholds, we demonstrate dramatic fluctuations in the range boundaries over the Holocene as climate shifted. Moreover, we find fundamental differences in the adaptive response of these two species related to the elevation of the site and local microclimate. Results indicate that although N. cinerea are currently extirpated in this area, they were ubiquitous throughout the late Pleistocene and into the middle Holocene. They adapted to climate shifts over this period by phenotypic changes in body mass, as has been demonstrated for other areas within their range; during colder episodes they were larger, and during warmer intervals, animals were smaller. Their presence may have been tied into a much more widespread historical distribution of juniper (Juniperus sp.); we document a downward displacement of approximately 1000 m relative to juniper's modern extent in the Amargosa Range. These results suggest a cooler and more mesic habitat association persisting for longer and at lower elevations than previously reported. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evolutionary forces in diabetes and hypertension pathogenesis in Africans
VL  - 30
SP  - R110-R118
AB  - Rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension are increasing rapidly in urbanizing sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). While lifestyle factors drive the increases in T2D and hypertension prevalence, evidence across populations shows that genetic variation, which is driven by evolutionary forces including a natural selection that shaped the human genome, also plays a role. Here we report the evidence for the effect of selection in African genomes on mechanisms underlying T2D and hypertension, including energy metabolism, adipose tissue biology, insulin action and salt retention. Selection effects found for variants in genes PPARA and TCF7L2 may have enabled Africans to respond to nutritional challenges by altering carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Likewise, African-ancestry-specific characteristics of adipose tissue biology (low visceral adipose tissue [VAT], high intermuscular adipose tissue and a strong association between VAT and adiponectin) may have been selected for in response to nutritional and infectious disease challenges in the African environment. Evidence for selection effects on insulin action, including insulin resistance and secretion, has been found for several genes including MPHOSPH9, TMEM127, ZRANB3 and MC3R. These effects may have been historically adaptive in critical conditions, such as famine and inflammation. A strong correlation between hypertension susceptibility variants and latitude supports the hypothesis of selection for salt retention mechanisms in warm, humid climates. Nevertheless, adaptive genomics studies in African populations are scarce. More work is needed, particularly genomics studies covering the wide diversity of African populations in SSA and Africans in diaspora, as well as further functional assessment of established risk loci.

TI  - Beyond climate: disturbance niche shifts in invasive species
VL  - 24
IS  - 3
SP  - 360-370
AB  - AimAnalysing how species niches shift between native and introduced ranges is a powerful tool for understanding the determinants of species distributions and for anticipating range expansions by invasive species. Most studies only consider the climatic niche, by correlating widely available presence-only data with regional climate. However, habitat characteristics and disturbance also shape species niches, thereby potentially confounding shifts attributed only to differences in climate. Here we used presence and abundance data for Oxalis pes-caprae, a species native to South Africa and invading areas globally, to understand how niche shifts may be influenced by disturbance at habitat and landscape scales in addition to climate. LocalityMediterranean climate areas world-wide. MethodsWe used available presence-only data and also conducted extensive surveys of the abundance of Oxalis (c. 11,000 plots) across different habitats in South Africa and in the introduced range in the Mediterranean Basin. We extended principal component analysis methods for measuring niche shifts by using Bayesian generalized linear models to identify climatic and disturbance niche shifts. ResultsWe found a large climatic niche expansion towards stronger seasonality and lower temperature in the introduced range, but this expansion was greatly reduced when considering only conditions available in both ranges. Oxalis occupied more natural landscapes in the native range that remained unoccupied in the introduced range (niche unfilling'). In contrast to the similar abundances in natural and disturbed habitats in its native range, Oxalis was more abundant in disturbed habitats in the introduced range. ConclusionsThe large climatic niche expansion most likely reflects significant plasticity of Oxalis rather than rapid evolution. Furthermore, the unfilling of its disturbance niche in the introduced range suggests high potential for further invasion of natural areas. Together, these findings suggest that the potential for future spread of invasive species may be underestimated by approaches that characterize species niches based only on climate or partial information about their distributions.

AB  - Food choice and habitual diet-related health outcomes are strongly influenced by the oral sensations elicited by food. Of the biological-based mediators of orosensation, thermal tasting-the capacity to experience phantom taste sensations on lingual thermal stimulation-has not been investigated with respect to orosensation and liking of sampled foods. Twenty-three female thermal tasters (TTs) and 21 female thermal non-tasters (TnTs) scored liking of (9-point hedonic scale) and the intensity of orosensations elicited by (gVAS) 22 food and beverage items in duplicate using a randomized complete block design in a customized sensory evaluation laboratory. Foods selected included high fat, high sugar, and high salt items. Sampled items were grouped according to the dominant orosensation(s) elicited (sweet, bitter, sour, salty, astringent, creamy, crunchy, crispy, firm, menthol cool, and grainy), and intensity and liking assessed for each group. No significant differences were found for thermal tasting status (TTS) in intensity ratings of orosensory groupings (p(t) > 0.05). TnTs gave higher liking ratings for creamy foods than TTs (t = 5.99, p = 0.015), and their liking of the "aversive" food grouping was higher than for TTs and approached significance (t = 2.97, p = 0.086). The previously reported variation in orosensation due to TTS observed with simple aqueous solutions, and some beverages may not extend to sampled foods. However, differences in liking are suggested for some food groupings and are worthy of further investigation.

TI  - What are extreme environmental conditions and how do organisms cope with them?
VL  - 57
IS  - 3
SP  - 363-374
AB  - Severe environmental conditions affect organisms in two major ways. The environment may be predictably severe such as in deserts, polar and alpine regions, or individuals may be exposed to temporarily extreme conditions through weather, presence of predators, lack of food, social status etc. Existence in an extreme environment may be possible, but then to breed or molt in addition can present major bottlenecks that have resulted in the evolution of hormone-behavior adaptations to cope with unpredictable events. Examples of hormone-behavior adaptations in extreme conditions include attenuated testosterone secretion because territoriality and excess courtship may be too costly when there is one opportunity to reproduce. The individual may even become insensitive to testosterone when target areas of the brain regulating reproductive behavior no longer respond to the hormone. A second example is reduced sensitivity to glucocorticoids following acute stress during the breeding season or molt that allows successful reproduction and/or a vital renewal of the integument to endure extreme conditions during the rest of the year. Reduced sensitivity could involve: (a) modulated response of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, (b) reduced sensitivity to high glucocorticoid levels, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b). Moreover, corticosteroid binding proteins (CBP) buffer responses to stress by reducing the movement of glucocorticoids into target cells. Finally, intracellular enzymes (11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and variants) can deactivate glucocorticoids entering cells thus reducing interaction with receptors. These mechanisms have important implications for climate change and increasing extremes of weather [Current Zoology 57 (3): 363-374, 2011].

TI  - The Fukushima nuclear accident and the pale grass blue butterfly: evaluating biological effects of long-term low-dose exposures
VL  - 13
AB  - Background: On August 9th 2012, we published an original research article in Scientific Reports, concluding that artificial radionuclides released from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant exerted genetically and physiologically adverse effects on the pale grass blue butterfly Zizeeria maha in the Fukushima area. Immediately following publication, many questions and comments were generated from all over the world. Here, we have clarified points made in the original paper and answered questions posed by the readers. Results: The following points were clarified. (1) There are many advantages to using the pale grass blue butterfly as an indicator species. (2) The forewings of the individuals collected in Fukushima were significantly smaller than in the northern and southern localities. (3) We observed growth retardation in the butterflies from the Fukushima area. (4) The aberrant colour patterns in the butterflies obtained in the Fukushima area were different from the colour patterns induced by temperature and sibling crosses but similar to those induced by external and internal exposures to the artificial radionuclides and by a chemical mutagen, suggesting that genetic mutations caused the aberrations. (5) This species of butterfly has been plentiful in Fukushima area for at least half a century. We here present specimens collected from Fukushima Prefecture before the accident. (6) Mutation accumulation was detected by the increase in the abnormality rates from May 2011 to September 2011. (7) The abnormal traits were heritable. (8) Our sampling localities were not affected by the tsunami. (9) We used a high enough number of samples to obtain statistically significant results. (10) The standard rearing method was followed, producing normal adults in the control groups. (11) The exposure experiments successfully reproduced the results of the field work. This species of butterfly is vulnerable to long-term low-dose internal and external exposures; however, insect cells are known to be resistant to short-term high-dose irradiation. This discrepancy is reconcilable based on the differences in the experimental conditions. Conclusions: We are just beginning to understand the biological effects of long-term low-dose exposures in animals. Further research is necessary to accurately assess the possible biological effects of the accident.

TI  - Temperature-dependent mutational robustness can explain faster molecular evolution at warm temperatures, affecting speciation rate and global patterns of species diversity
VL  - 39
IS  - 11
SP  - 1025-1033
AB  - Distribution of species across the Earth shows strong latitudinal and altitudinal gradients with the number of species decreasing with declining temperatures. While these patterns have been recognized for well over a century, the mechanisms generating and maintaining them have remained elusive. Here, we propose a mechanistic explanation for temperature-dependent rates of molecular evolution that can influence speciation rates and global biodiversity gradients. Our hypothesis is based on the effects of temperature and temperature-adaptation on stability of proteins and other catalytic biomolecules. First, due to the nature of physical forces between biomolecules and water, stability of biomolecules is maximal around. 20 degrees C and decreases as temperature either decreases or increases. Second, organisms that have adapted to cold temperatures have evolved especially flexible (but unstable) proteins to facilitate catalytic reactions in cold, where molecular movements slow down. Both these effects should result in mutations being on average more detrimental at cold temperatures (i.e. lower mutational robustness in cold). At high temperatures, destabilizing water-biomolecule interactions, and the need to maintain structures that withstand heat denaturation, should decrease mutational robustness similarly. Decreased mutational robustness at extreme temperatures will slow down molecular evolution, as a larger fraction of new mutations will be removed by selection. Lower mutational robustness may also select for reduced mutation rates, further slowing down the rate of molecular evolution. As speciation requires the evolution of epistatic incompatibilities that prevent gene flow among incipient species, slow rate of molecular evolution at extreme temperatures will directly slow down the rate at which new species arise. The proposed mechanism can thus explain why molecular evolution is faster at warm temperatures, contributing to higher speciation rate and elevated species richness in environments characterized by stable and warm temperatures.

TI  - Physiological and haematological consequences of a novel parasite on the red-rumped swallow Hirundo daurica
VL  - 31
IS  - 11
SP  - 1187-1193
AB  - Parasite virulence has been hypothesised to increase with the degree of host sociality because highly social hosts have a greater probability of encountering horizontal transmission of parasites and experiencing infections with multiple strains of the same parasites than do solitary hosts. As compared with the defences of closely related social host species, we predicted that solitary hosts should have relatively weak defences against parasites, thus being relatively more affected when parasitised by a novel parasite. We tested this prediction by either experimentally infesting 12 nests of the solitarily nesting red-rumped swallow Hirundo daurica with 50 individuals of the generalist martin bug Oeciacus hirundinis or by fumigation of nine nests. Nestlings 13 days old from the parasite addition group experienced increased mortality, attained lower body mass and tended to have shorter tarsi compared to nestlings from fumigated nests. Surprisingly, nestlings from the parasite addition group had higher packed cell volume (cellular fraction of blood) and lower levels of heat shock proteins (HSP60) than nestlings from the fumigation group. A measure of immunocompetence was not significantly affected by treatment, but its magnitude was positively related to packed cell volume and negatively related to level of HSP60. Solitary hosts like the red-rumped swallow have weak immune responses and low levels of heat shock proteins when infested with ectoparasites while highly social hosts have strong immune responses and high levels of heat shock proteins when infested. These findings partially support the hypothesis that potential host species with weak defences are more susceptible to infection and the deleterious effects of evolving parasites than potential hosts with strong defences.

TI  - Emergence of a Viral RNA Polymerase Variant during Gene Copy Number Amplification Promotes Rapid Evolution of Vaccinia Virus
VL  - 91
IS  - 4
AB  - Viruses are under relentless selective pressure from host immune defenses. To study how poxviruses adapt to innate immune detection pathways, we performed serial vaccinia virus infections in primary human cells. Independent courses of experimental evolution with a recombinant strain lacking E3L revealed several high-frequency point mutations in conserved poxvirus genes, suggesting important roles for essential poxvirus proteins in innate immune subversion. Two distinct mutations were identified in the viral RNA polymerase gene A24R, which seem to act through different mechanisms to increase virus replication. Specifically, a Leu18Phe substitution encoded within A24R conferred fitness trade-offs, including increased activation of the antiviral factor protein kinase R (PKR). Intriguingly, this A24R variant underwent a drastic selective sweep during passaging, despite enhanced PKR activity. We showed that the sweep of this variant could be accelerated by the presence of copy number variation (CNV) at the K3L locus, which in multiple copies strongly reduced PKR activation. Therefore, adaptive cases of CNV can facilitate the accumulation of point mutations separate from the expanded locus. This study reveals how rapid bouts of gene copy number amplification during accrual of distant point mutations can potently facilitate poxvirus adaptation to host defenses.

TI  - Native distribution characteristics rather than functional traits explain preadaptation of invasive species to high-UV-B environments
VL  - 26
IS  - 10
SP  - 1421-1438
AB  - Aim Alien species successfully colonize new ranges if they encounter favourable environmental conditions there and possess traits that match new challenges. Climate-matching approaches comparing native and exotic ranges mostly consider temperature and precipitation niches of alien species, but have largely ignored UV-B radiation. UV-B fundamentally differs between hemispheres, with much higher levels at southern than at northern latitudes. Consequently, UV-B might act at the global scale and present a so far neglected filter that species need to overcome when invading high-UV-B environments. Location We performed two multi-species common garden experiments, conducted in the native European range (Germany) and the high-UV-B exotic range (New Zealand) to test for preadaptation to UV-B. Methods We used 25 herbaceous species from open habitats, which we exposed in each range to three UV radiation treatments: (a) natural sunlight, (b) exclusion of UV-B while allowing natural UV-A, and (c) exclusion of UV-B and UV-A. We additionally used plant traits (TRY), global distribution data (GBIF, GloNAF) and global UV-B satellite data (glUV) to determine species-specific characteristics as fostering agents of UV-B tolerance. The joint analysis of experimental and macroecological data allowed quantification of species plasticity and identification of beneficial species traits in high-UV-B environments. Results Our results showed an overall limiting effect of UV-B in both common gardens but the UV-stress response tended to be more pronounced in the invaded range. Across all species, we found little evidence for preadaptation by functional plant traits. In contrast, preadaptation to climatic conditions related to the species' native UV-B niche was of greater importance for plant performance in the presence of UV-B radiation. Main conclusions For predicting alien species' ability to expand into high-UV-B environments, macroclimatic niche characteristics of the species' native range might be better predictors than functional traits and should be more considered in future projection models.

TI  - The Effect of Environmental Factors on the Morphological Variation of the Common Pheasant, Phasianus colchicus in China
VL  - 53
IS  - 2
SP  - 675-684
AB  - This study aims to assess morphological variation of the ring-necked or common pheasant Phasianus colchicus across mainland China in response to environmental factors. We collected 399 pheasant and divided them into two groups: high altitude ( 1500m) and low altitude (<1500m). The results that all morphological size measures of males were significantly higher than those of females (P<0.05). Most measures of size at low altitude significantly greater than those at high altitudes, including body weight, body length, and wing length for males (P<0.05), and body weight and wing length for females. The results showed that males and females are different in response to environmental factors. The body weight, wing length, tarsus, skull length and interorbital distance in females were significantly correlated with atmospheric pressure (P<0.05), along with body weight, body length, rictus, wing length, tarsus and skull length in males (P<0.05). A significant positive correlation was observed between wing length of males and wind speed (P=0.017). Conversely, body weight, body length, wing length and tail length in males were significantly negatively correlated with air temperature (P<0.05). Many measures of body size (wing length and tail length for males; tail length for females) increased with latitude after controlling for altitude, indicating that the body size of this species, especially in males, is significantly larger at high latitudes. It is the common pheasant?s adaptability to considerable environmental change that has facilitated the vast distribution of this species.

TI  - Intraspecific variation in reproductive characters is associated with the strength of sexual selection in the hermaphroditic land snail Cornu aspersum
VL  - 71
IS  - 10
AB  - Intraspecific variation in sexual traits may arise from a variety of processes such as genetic drift, sexual selection, or spatial heterogeneity of environmental conditions. Recent empirical studies suggest that sexual selection may vary with environmental conditions accelerating differentiation of sexual traits among populations. Land snails are simultaneously hermaphroditic animals characterized by low mobility and limited dispersal, so that life cycle characteristics of their populations are strongly influenced by local environmental conditions. In this study, we report results on intraspecific variation in sexual selection intensity as well as in behavioral and anatomical reproductive traits in the land snail Cornu aspersum. We performed a common garden experiment of adult snails originating from four populations from either of two regions in Greece differing in habitat temperature and predictability of rainfall during their reproductive season. Our results indicate substantial intra-specific variation in the opportunity for sexual selection, which was associated with differences in both behavioral and anatomical reproductive characters. Snails from populations that experienced unpredictable habitat conditions expanded their reproductive activity period, exhibited higher mating frequency, and showed longer copulation duration, relative to snails living in more predictable habitats. Additionally, snails originating from populations with unpredictable habitat conditions showed a distinct reproductive morphology with a shorter bursa tract length, which we interpret as indicative of an enhanced ability to hydrolyze the received spermatophores. We conclude that local environmental conditions experienced by the different populations could have triggered differences in the opportunity for sexual selection, which may ultimately lead to allopatric speciation through sexual selection. Significance statement Environment-dependent sexual selection is considered to promote allopatric speciation of distant populations. However, empirical studies testing for geographic differences in the strength of sexual selection and associated reproductive characters are scarce. In C. aspersum, variation in both behavioral and anatomical reproductive traits among populations is well-documented, but the extent to which this is driven by diverse pressures of sexual selection under heterogeneous environmental conditions among populations remains unexplored. We demonstrate that snails from two geographically distant regions of Greece, with contrasting natural habitats, differ mainly in their behavioral traits and in several morphological traits, which are associated with differences in the opportunity for pre-and post-copulatory sexual selection.

TI  - On the dynamics of dust grains in a hierarchical environment - I. Binary case
VL  - 81
IS  - 2
SP  - 145-173
AB  - Most main sequence stars are binaries or higher multiplicity Systems and it appears that at birth most stars have circumstellar disks. It is commonly accepted that planetary systems arise from the material of these disks; consequently, binary and multiple systems may have a main role in planet formation. In this paper, we study the stage of planetary formation during which the particulate material is still dispersed as centimetre-to-metre sized primordial aggregates. We investigate the response of the particles, in a protoplanetary disk with radius R(D) = 100 AU around a solar-like star, to the gravitational field of bound perturbing companions in a moderately wide (300-1600 AU) orbit. For this purpose, we have carried out a series of simulations of coplanar hierarchical configurations using a direct integration code that models gravitational and viscous forces. The massive protoplanetary disk is around one of the components of the binary. The evolution in time of the dust sub-disk depends mainly on the nature (prograde or retrograde) of the relative revolution of the stellar companion, and on the temperature and mass of the circumstellar disk. Our results show that for binary companions near the limit of tidal truncation of the disk, the perturbation leads to an enhanced accretion rate onto the primary, decreasing the lifetime of the particles in the protoplanetary disk with respect to the case of a single star. As a consequence of an enhanced accretion rate the mass of the disk decreases faster, which leads to a longer resultant lifetime for particles in the disk. On the other hand, binary companions may induce tidal arms in the dust phase of protoplanetary disks. Spiral perturbations with m = 1 may increase in a factor 10 or more the dust surface density in the neighbourhood of the arm, facilitating the growth of the particles. Moreover, in a massive disk (0.01M.) the survival time of particles is significantly shorter than in a less massive nebula (0.001M.) and the temperature of the disk severely influences the spiral-in time of particles. The rapid evolution of the dust component found in post T Tauri stars can be explained as a result of their binary nature. Binarity may also influence the evolution of circumpulsar disks.

TI  - Annual change in morphometry and in somatic and reproductive indices of Chiton articulatus adults (Polyplacophora: Chitonidae) from Oaxaca, Mexican Pacific
VL  - 31
IS  - 1
SP  - 65-74
AB  - The polyplacophoran Chiton articulatus Sowerby, 1832, is distributed along the tropical Pacific coast of Mexico and has been collected for generations in an artisanal manner for bait or as a complement in domestic cookery of coastal inhabitants; nevertheless, recently, some restaurants are offering this chiton to the tourists as a gourmet and aphrodisiac food, thus becoming of potential economic interest. This study explores in a population of C. articulatus adults from Oaxaca, southern Mexican Pacific, the changes in morphometry and in somatic and reproductive indices throughout one year, reporting on five reproductive indices, five somatic indices, body shape (BS), and length-weight relationships. An attempt is made to elucidate the energetic trade-off between somatic and reproductive tissues, including an assessment of whether these can be estimated from noninvasive indices. Somatic indices diminished considerably as gonad development proceeded, thus showing an inverse relationship with reproductive indices. Body mass index (BMI, i.e., physical conditions) patterns revealed that chitons were overweight (in the sense of high accumulation of lipids in the gonad) during reproductive seasons. The C. articulatus body was mainly oval-shaped throughout the whole sampling period. The slope of the length-weight regressions indicated an allometric growth (b, between 2.2 and 2.8). Gonad development is fueled by energy and nutrients derived from food rather than from reallocation of somatic reserves, although some somatic tissue constituents (in particular from foot) of reproducing adults may be mobilized in the short-term to meet nutrient and energy needs for reproduction. Reproductive seasons of C. articulatus according to the measured indices, occurred around May (late-spring) and again around August-September (late-summer), and these periods were correlated with maximum sea surface temperatures. The measurement of BS together with BMI can be used nearly as effectively as the more invasive reproductive indices to estimate reproductive seasonality.

VL  - 81
IS  - 1
SP  - 14-24
AB  - Since DeNiro and Epstein's discovery that the C-13 and N-15 isotopic signatures of animals approximate those of their respective diets, the measurement of stable isotope signatures has become an important tool for ecologists studying the diets of wild animals. This study used Madagascar hissing cockroaches (Gromphadorhina portentosa) to examine several preexisting hypotheses about the relationship between the isotopic composition of an animal and its diet. Contrary to my predictions, the results revealed that the tissues of adult cockroaches raised for two generations on a diet of known isotopic composition did not demonstrate enrichment of heavy stable isotopes. More-over, the N-15 signatures of cockroaches were neither influenced by periods of rapid growth (i.e.,300-fold increase in dry body mass over 120 d) nor by imposed periods of starvation lasting up to 80 d. The offspring born to mothers raised on known diets were enriched in N-15. Diet-switching experiments showed that turnover times of C-13 were highly correlated with age and ranged from 9 to 10 d to 60 to 75 d in subadults and adults, respectively. Adults subjected to diet switches differed from the subadults in that the adults achieved equilibrated isotopic signatures that were shifted approximately 1.0 parts per thousand toward their respective original diets. Lipid fractions of adult cockroaches averaged 2.9 parts per thousand more depleted in C-13 than in lipid-free fractions, but no changes in 13C were observed in aging adults. Exposure to reduced ambient temperature from 33 degrees C to 23 degrees C over 120 d did not influence isotopic signatures of tissues. Overall, the results of this study reveal that different endogenous and exogenous factors can influence the isotopic signatures of cockroaches. These findings reinforce the need to conduct controlled studies to further examine environmental factors that influence the relationships between the isotopic signatures of animals and their diets.

TI  - Antioxidant capacity, lipid peroxidation, and lipid composition changes during long-term and short-term thermal acclimation in Daphnia
VL  - 187
IS  - 8
SP  - 1091-1106
AB  - Examples of phenotypic plasticity-the ability of organisms of identical genotypes to produce different phenotypes in response to the environment-are abundant, but often lack data on the causative physiology and biochemistry. Phenotypes associated with increased protection against or reduced damage from harmful environments may, in fact, be downstream effects of hidden adaptive responses that remain elusive to experimental measurement or be obscured by homeostatic or over-compensatory effects. The freshwater zooplankton crustacean Daphnia drastically increases its heat tolerance as the result of acclimation to high temperatures, an effect often assumed to be based on plastic responses allowing better protection against oxidative stress. Using several geographically distant Daphnia magna genotypes, we demonstrate that the more heat tolerant individuals have a higher total antioxidant capacity (TAC) both in the comparison of heat-acclimated vs. non heat-acclimated females and in the comparison of females to age- and body size-matched males, which show lower heat tolerance than females. However, experimental manipulations of hypothesized antioxidant pathways by either glutathione addition or glutathione synthesis inhibition had no effect on heat tolerance. Lipid peroxidation (LPO), contrary to expectations, did not appear to be a predictive measure of susceptibility to thermal damage: LPO was higher, not lower, in more heat tolerant heat-acclimated individuals after exposure to a lethally high temperature. We hypothesize that LPO may be maintained in Daphnia at a constant level in the absence of acute exposure to elevated temperature and increase as a by-product of a possible protective antioxidant mechanism during such exposure. This conclusion is corroborated by the observed short-term and long-term changes in phospholipid composition that included an increase in fatty acid saturation at 28 A degrees C and up-regulation of certain long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Phospholipid composition was more strongly affected by recently experienced temperature (4-day transfer) than by long-term (2 generations) temperature acclimation. This is consistent with partial loss of thermal tolerance after a short-term switch to a reciprocal temperature. As predicted under the homeoviscous adaptation hypothesis, the more heat tolerant Daphnia showed lower membrane fluidity than their less heat tolerant counterparts, in comparison both between acclimation temperatures and among different genotypes. We conclude that thermal tolerance in Daphnia is influenced by total antioxidant capacity and membrane fluidity at high temperatures, with both effects possibly reflecting changes in phospholipid composition.

TI  - Capacity for thermal adaptation in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus): Effects on oxygen uptake and ventilation
VL  - 105
AB  - Standard metabolic rate (SMR) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR) were determined for Nile tilapia acclimated to six different experimental temperatures from 18 degrees C to 38 degrees C. SMR increased exponentially with temperature, from 79.8 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 18 degrees C, to 255.1 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 38 degrees C (Q(10) = 1.79). The main increase in Q(10) occurred within the highest temperature range, whereas in the lower temperature from 18 degrees C to 22 degrees C, temperature did not significantly affect SMR. MMR showed a hyperbolic correlation with increasing temperature, rising from 240.5 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 18 degrees C to a peak of 373.8 mg O-2 kg(-1) h(-1) at 30 degrees C, before decreasing again at higher temperatures. Absolute aerobic scope (AAS) peaked at 26.0 degrees C, which we conclude to be the optimal temperature for Nile tilapia. The optimal temperature range, defined as the thermal range where 80% or more of the metabolic scope (MS) can be maintained, occurred between 19.5 and 32.1 degrees C. The lower (TCMIN) and upper (TCMAX) critical temperatures occurred at 13.1 degrees C and 38.8 degrees C. Nile tilapia showed a 4-fold scope for increasing ventilation frequency from 24 opercular beats min(-1) (OB min(-1)) during SMR at 18 degrees C, to a maximum of 100 OB min(-1) which occurred during MMR at 34 degrees C. f(V) during MMR increased with temperature, but above 30 degrees C became uncoupled with MO2, as fish were unable to sustain their rates of oxygen consumption despite a high f(V). There was a strong correlation between f(V) and SMR (r(2) = 0.83) across all temperatures indicating that fV is a good predictor of SMR. However, the correlation between MMR and f(V) was weak (r(2) = 0.06), due to a strong interacting effect of temperature. When selecting data from the thermal optimum range, a good correlation between f(V) and MO2 was obtained (r(2) = 0.74).

TI  - Numerical simulation of hail formation in the 28 June 1989 Bismarck thunderstorm: Part I. Studies related to hail production
VL  - 71
IS  - 1
SP  - 51-79
AB  - This study assesses the relative influence of an active warm rain process on precipitation development and hail formation in a series of cells in numerical simulations of the severe hailstorm case of 28 June 1989 from the North Dakota Thunderstorm Project. Two model runs are reported, Case I with rain autoconversion on and Case 11 with rain autoconversion off. Various aspects of hail production are examined within the context of these simulations. The results illustrate the importance of the microphysical path to precipitation on subsequent hail formation, especially for isolated cells. Precipitation is initiated earlier in Case I than in Case II. Frozen drops initiate the precipitating ice in Case 1; for Case 11, ice processes initiate the precipitating ice field and precipitation development is slower than in Case I. Pronounced differences in precipitation development, especially hail growth and production, are indicated for a relatively isolated cell undergoing rapid evolution. Much more hail mass and larger hail are produced in this cell in Case I than in Case 11, with the major embryo source for hail being frozen drops in Case I and ice embryos in Case II. Differences between Case I and Case 11 are much less pronounced for the other cells in the simulations which experience multiple growth surges. For a strong cell embedded in the storm system, the effect of the autoconversion process is of minor significance because the surrounding cloud mass provides an ample supply of embryos in both cases. The net effect is Case 11 produces slightly more hail for this embedded cell. Hail growth analyses indicate that the major growth of the ice particles occurs in high liquid water regions between -5 and -35 degreesC, usually between -10 and -25 degreesC. Trajectory analyses indicate that particles which grow to relatively large size begin their major growth cycle in a very narrow ribbon-like region in an area of weak updraft near the updraft/down draft interface on the forward flank of the storm cells, in agreement with recent observations. Model results compared favorably with recent aircraft observations of cloud properties in the neighborhood of -40 degreesC within fresh, vigorous deep convection. Substantial amounts of supercooled liquid water at temperatures as low as - 38 degreesC and an abrupt transition from water to ice at slightly colder temperatures were common features in the observations and model results.

TI  - Heatwaves and Novel Host Consumption Increase Overwinter Mortality of an Imperiled Wetland Butterfly
VL  - 7
AB  - Disruptive effects of climate change include range shifts, phenological mismatches among consumers and producers, and population declines. While these biological alterations have been widely documented, studies identifying specific mechanisms linking climate change to population declines are scarce. Extreme events, such as heatwaves can have devastating effects on living organisms and are increasing in frequency as Earth warms. Hence, understanding the effects of heatwaves on insects is necessary to inform conservation efforts and to develop predictions of population dynamics under future climate scenarios. Here, we experimentally evaluated the effects of heatwaves on the survival and phenology of the Baltimore Checkerspot (Euphydryas phaeton phaeton), a wetland butterfly with imperiled populations that has incorporated a novel host. We performed laboratory manipulations (implementing realistic temperature regimes) to assess the effect of heatwaves during summer and winter on the survival and phenology of E. p. phaeton. In addition, we analyzed historical temperature records to quantify the incidence of heatwaves within E. p. phaeton's range to assess their potential role in the decline of southeastern populations. We found that winter heatwaves with maximum temperatures of 20 degrees C can have more devastating effects on survival than summer heatwaves (up to 41 degrees C). Eggs endured acute heat stress during summer with no significant effects on phenology and survival; similarly, pre-overwintering larvae were robust to heatwave exposure, as only the most intense heatwave treatment reduced their survival (37% reduction compared to control conditions). By contrast, dormant larvae were the most vulnerable stage, as they lost from 2 to 6% of their body mass after a three-day summer heatwave. Furthermore, their exposure to winter heatwaves resulted in 75 to 100% mortality. Feeding on the native host provided higher resilience under thermal stress than feeding on the invasive, recently acquired host. Finally, both heatwave incidence and severity have increased in the southern range of E. p. phaeton in the period from 1894 to 2011. We show that warm winter days induced severe mortality, providing a mechanistic explanation of how climate change can trigger population declines in E. p. phaeton and other insects.

TI  - Pleiotropic Meta-Analyses of Longitudinal Studies Discover Novel Genetic Variants Associated with Age-Related Diseases
VL  - 7
AB  - Age-related diseases may result from shared biological mechanisms in intrinsic processes of aging. Genetic effects on age-related diseases are often modulated by environmental factors due to their little contribution to fitness or are mediated through certain endophenotypes. Identification of genetic variants with pleiotropic effects on both common complex diseases and endophenotypes may reveal potential conflicting evolutionary pressures and deliver new insights into shared genetic contribution to healthspan and lifespan. Here, we performed pleiotropic meta-analyses of genetic variants using five NIH-funded datasets by integrating univariate summary statistics for age-related diseases and endophenotypes. We investigated three groups of traits: (1) endophenotypes such as blood glucose, blood pressure, lipids, hematocrit, and body mass index, (2) time-to-event outcomes such as the age-at-onset of diabetes mellitus (DM), cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), and (3) both combined. In addition to replicating previous findings, we identify seven novel genome-wide significant loci (<5e-08), out of which five are low-frequency variants. Specifically, from Group 2, we find rs7632505 on 3q21.1 in SEMA5B, rs460976 on 21q22.3 (1 kb from TMPRSS2) and rs12420422 on 11q24.1 predominantly associated with a variety of CVDs, rs4905014 in ITPK1 associated with stroke and heart failure, rs7081476 on 10p12.1 in ANKRD26 associated with multiple diseases including DM. CVDs, and NDs. From Group 3, we find rs8082812 on 18p11.22 and rs1869717 on 4q31.3 associated with both endophenotypes and CVDs. Our follow-up analyses show that rs7632505, rs4905014, and rs8082812 have age-dependent effects on coronary heart disease or stroke. Functional annotation suggests that most of these SNPs are within regulatory regions or DNase clusters and in linkage disequilibrium with expression quantitative trait loci, implying their potential regulatory influence on the expression of nearby genes. Our mediation analyses suggest that the effects of some SNPs are mediated by specific endophenotypes. In conclusion, these findings indicate that loci with pleiotropic effects on age-related disorders tend to be enriched in genes involved in underlying mechanisms potentially related to nervous, cardiovascular and immune system functions, stress resistance, inflammation, ion channels and hematopoiesis, supporting the hypothesis of shared pathological role of infection, and inflammation in chronic age-related diseases.

TI  - Correlated evolution of conspicuous coloration and body size in poison frogs (dendrobatidae)
VL  - 57
IS  - 12
SP  - 2904-2910
AB  - Conspicuous coloration is often used in combination with chemical defenses to deter predators from attacking. Experimental studies have shown that the avoidance inducing effect of conspicuous prey coloration increases with increasing size of pattern elements and with increasing body size. Here we use a comparative approach to test the prediction from these findings, namely that conspicuous coloration will evolve in tandem with body size. In our analysis, we use a previously published mitochondrial DNA-based phylogeny and comparative analysis of independent contrasts to examine if evolutionary shifts in color pattern have been associated with evolutionary changes in body size in aposematic poison frogs (Anura: Dendrobatidae). Information on body size (snout to vent length) and coloration were obtained from the literature. Two different measures of conspicuousness were used, one based on rankings by human observers and the other based on computer analysis of digitized photographs. The results from comparative analyses using either measure of coloration indicated that avoidance inducing coloration and body size have evolved in concert in poison frogs. Results from reconstruction of character change further indicate that the correlated evolution of size and coloration has involved changes in both directions within each of the different clades of the phylogenetic tree. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that selection imposed by visually guided predators has promoted the evolution of larger body size in species with conspicuous coloration, or enhanced evolution of conspicuous coloration in larger species.

SP  - 417-433
AB  - Question: What ecological and evolutionary processes are associated with the 25% decrease in age-specific body size of herring (Clupea harengus) in the Bothnian Sea over the last 30 years? Data: Four decades of data on length, age, and sexual maturity of individual herrings as well as environmental variables, including abundances of predators, prey and competitors, and estimates of fishing intensity/mortality from the Bothnian Sea. Search methods: Information-theoretic assessment of the relative influence of ecological and fisheries' effects on temporal changes in body growth. Probabilistic maturation reaction norms to study changes in age-specific size at maturation. Decomposition of trait variation into ecological and evolutionary contributions. Conclusions: Our evolutionary ecosystem perspective shows that both ecological and evolutionary processes are important contributors to observed phenotypic changes in this commercially exploited species. Around 60% of the decrease in age-specific body length can be attributed to increased density-dependent body growth. Evolutionary changes towards earlier maturation, owing to an indirect effect of size-selective mortality from grey seals and fisheries, account for a further 25% of the decrease in age-specific body size.

TI  - PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY OF BODY SIZE IN AN INSULAR POPULATION OF A SNAKE
VL  - 67
IS  - 1
SP  - 46-57
AB  - Difference in growth pattern is one of the proximate causes of geographic variation in body size. Such a difference in growth pattern could be explained by two extremes such as genetically determined outcome and phenotypic plasticity or by a combination of these. The Japanese four-lined snake (Elaphe quadrivirgata) on Yakushima Island, Japan, has small body size compared with snakes on the main islands. To examine whether the dwarfism of Yakushima snakes is a consequence of genetic modification or a direct phenotypic response to immediate environmental conditions, E. quadrivirgata from Yakushima and a main island (Shiga Prefecture in Honshu Island), were reared from hatching in a laboratory environment. Data of field surveys were used to examine feeding habits and growth in the wild. Free-ranging snakes on Yakushima had significantly smaller body size and lower growth rate than those in Shiga. Yakushima snakes consumed almost exclusively lizards, whereas frogs were the main prey for Shiga snakes. The proportion of snakes that contained food in their stomach was lower in Yakushima than in Shiga. Available information suggests that the dwarfism of Yakushima snakes cannot be explained by lower survivorship. At hatching, Yakushima snakes of both sexes were larger than Shiga snakes. However, Yakushima and Shiga snakes reached similar body size after approximately I year. Captive-reared snakes from the insular dwarf population can reach comparable size to those from the main island, indicating that the growth rate, and hence body size, of E. quadrivirgata is obviously highly plastic. Based on these results, I consider that the dwarfism of Yakushima snakes is attributable to a direct phenotypic response, presumably to food limitation, rather than to microevolutionary changes.

VL  - 6

SP  - 5893-5906
AB  - Understanding the physiological and genetic basis of growth and body size variation has wide-ranging implications, from cancer and metabolic disease to the genetics of complex traits. We examined the evolution of body and wing size in high-altitude Drosophila melanogaster from Ethiopia, flies with larger size than any previously known population. Specifically, we sought to identify life history characteristics and cellular mechanisms that may have facilitated size evolution. We found that the large-bodied Ethiopian flies laid significantly fewer but larger eggs relative to lowland, smaller-bodied Zambian flies. The highland flies were found to achieve larger size in a similar developmental period, potentially aided by a reproductive strategy favoring greater provisioning of fewer offspring. At the cellular level, cell proliferation was a strong contributor to wing size evolution, but both thorax and wing size increases involved important changes in cell size. Nuclear size measurements were consistent with elevated somatic ploidy as an important mechanism of body size evolution. We discuss the significance of these results for the genetic basis of evolutionary changes in body and wing size in Ethiopian D. melanogaster.

TI  - A universal driver of macroevolutionary change in the size of marine phytoplankton over the Cenozoic
VL  - 104
IS  - 51
SP  - 20416-20420
AB  - The size structure of phytoplankton assemblages strongly influences energy transfer through the food web and carbon cycling in the ocean. We determined the macroevolutionary trajectory in the median size of dinoflagellate cysts to compare with the macroevolutionary size change in other plankton groups. We found the median size of the dinoflagellate cysts generally decreases through the Cenozoic. Diatoms exhibit an extremely similar pattern in their median size over time, even though species diversity of the two groups has opposing trends, indicating that the macroevolutionary size change is an active response to selection pressure rather than a passive response to changes in diversity. The changes in the median size of dinoflagellate cysts are highly correlated with both deep ocean temperatures and the thermal gradient between the surface and deep waters, indicating the magnitude and frequency of nutrient availability may have acted as a selective factor in the macroevolution of cell size in the plankton. Our results suggest that climate, because it affects stratification in the ocean, is a universal abiotic driver that has been responsible for macroevolutionary changes in the size structure of marine planktonic communities over the past 65 million years of Earth's history.

TI  - Plastic and evolutionary responses of cell size and number to larval malnutrition in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 24
IS  - 4
SP  - 897-903
AB  - Both development and evolution under chronic malnutrition lead to reduced adult size in Drosophila. We studied the contribution of changes in size vs. number of epidermal cells to plastic and evolutionary reduction of wing size in response to poor larval food. We used flies from six populations selected for tolerance to larval malnutrition and from six unselected control populations, raised either under standard conditions or under larval malnutrition. In the control populations, phenotypic plasticity of wing size was mediated by both cell size and cell number. In contrast, evolutionary change in wing size, which was only observed as a correlated response expressed on standard food, was mediated entirely by reduction in cell number. Plasticity of cell number had been lost in the selected populations, and cell number did not differ between the sexes despite males having smaller wings. Results of this and other experimental evolution studies are consistent with the hypothesis that alleles which increase body size through prolonged growth affect wing size mostly via cell number, whereas alleles which increase size through higher growth rate do so via cell size.

TI  - Water temperature fluctuations and territoriality in the intertidal zone: two possible explanations for the elevational distribution of body size in Graus nigra
VL  - 61
IS  - 2
SP  - 472-488
AB  - On the central coast of Chile, distribution of body size in Graus nigra varied with tidal pool height. With the objective of determining whether environmental temperature is one of the possible causes which explains the observed distribution pattern, two behavioural responses were analysed during an experimental period of increasing water temperature: number of opercular movements (an indirect measure of energy expenditure) and activity levels. The interactions of temperature x time and body size x time had a significant effect on the number of opercular movements. At low temperatures (13-15degrees C, large fish reached a maximum number of opercular movements, while small fish reached a maximum only at high temperatures (23-25degreesC . The interaction temperature x time had a significant effect on activity levels of different body sizes. In general, large fish appeared to be less active than small fish, however, at very high temperatures (24-26degrees C all individuals increased their activity levels. These data indicate that small fish are acclimatized to live in a wider range of temperatures (13-23degrees C, and, for fish of all body sizes, the highest temperatures (23-26degrees C probably constitute a suboptimal microhabitat. Strong territoriality was observed, with large individuals displacing smaller individuals. These data suggest that temperature is an important factor in explaining why large individuals are not present in high tidal pools (high temperatures), whereas territoriality explains why small individuals are not in low tidal pools (habitat of large individuals).

VL  - 47

SP  - 178-197
AB  - Deeper knowledge about how species and communities respond to climate change and environmental gradients should be supported by evidence from the past, especially as modern responses are influenced by anthropogenic pressures, including human population growth, habitat destruction and fragmentation, and intensifying land use. There have been great advances in modeling species' geographic distributions over shallow time, where consideration of evolutionary change is likely less important due to shorter time for evolution and speciation to occur. Over these shallow time periods, we have more resources for paleoclimate interpretation across large geographic landscapes. We can also gain insight into species and community changes by studying deep records of temporal changes. However, modeling species geographic distributions in deep time remains challenging, because for many species there is sparse coverage of spatial and temporal occurrences and there are fewer paleoclimate general circulation models (GCMs) to help interpret the geographic distribution of climate availability. In addition, at deeper time periods, it is essential to consider evolutionary change within lineages of species. I will discuss a framework that integrates evolutionary information in the form of phylogenetic relatedness from clades of extant closely related species, where and when there are associated fossil occurrences, and the geographic distribution of paleoclimate in deep time to infer species past geographic response to climate change and to estimate where and when there were hotspots of ancient diversification. More work is needed to better understand the evolution of physiological tolerances and how physiological tolerances relate to the climate space in which species occur.

VL  - 206
IS  - 20
SP  - 3707-3718
AB  - We examined the mechanistic basis for two whole-animal performance traits, aerobic capacity and burst speed, in six laboratory-reared Trinidadian guppy populations from different native drainages with contrasting levels of predation. Using within- and between-population variation, we tested whether variation in organs and organ systems (heart, gill and swimming motor mass) and the activities of several enzymes that support locomotion (citrate synthetase, lactate dehydrogenase and myofibrillar ATPase) are correlated with aerobic performance (maximum rates of oxygen consumption, V(O2)max) or burst performance (maximum swim speed during escape responses). We also tested for associations between physiological traits and habitat type (different drainages and predation levels). Organ size and enzyme activities showed substantial size-independent variation, and both performance measures were strongly correlated to body size. After accounting for size effects, neither burst nor aerobic performance was strongly correlated to any organ size or enzymatic variable, or to each other. Two principal components (PCI, PC2) in both males and females accounted for most of the variance in the organ size and enzymatic variables. In both sexes, heart and gill mass tended to covary and were negatively associated with citrate synthetase and lactate dehydrogenase activity. In males (but not females), variation in aerobic performance was weakly but significantly correlated to variation in PCI, suggesting that heart and gill mass scale positively with V-O2max. Neither of the component variables and no single morphological or enzymatic trait was correlated to burst speed in either sex. Evolutionary changes in important life history traits occur rapidly in guppy populations subjected to different predation intensities (high mortality in downstream sites inhabited by large predatory fish; low mortality in upstream sites lacking large predators). We found significant differences between stream drainages in all morphological variables and most enzymatic variables, but only the mass of the swimming motor and LDH activity were significantly affected by predation regime. Overall, our data show that microevolution has occurred in the physiological foundations of locomotor performance in guppies, but evolutionary changes in physiology do not closely correspond to the predation-induced changes in life history parameters.

VL  - 251

SP  - 111-117
AB  - Populations of animals and plants often undergo conspicuous ecological changes when subjected to climatic extremes. Evolutionary changes may accompany them but are less easily detected. We show that Darwin's finches on a Galapagos island underwent two evolutionary changes after a severe El Nino event caused changes in their food supply. Small beak sizes were selectively favoured in one granivorous species when large seeds became scarce. The effects of selection were transmitted to the next generation as a result of high trait heritabilities. Hybridization between this species and two others resulted in gene exchange, but only after the El Nino when hybrid fitness was much enhanced under the altered feeding conditions. These observations imply that if global warming increases the frequency or severity of El Nino events on the Galapagos, microevolutionary changes in animal and plant populations are to be anticipated.

TI  - Cellular basis of wing size variation in Drosophila melanogaster: a comparison of latitudinal clines on two continents
VL  - 84
IS  - 3
SP  - 338-347
AB  - We investigated the cellular basis of two extensive, continuous, latitudinal, genetic, body size clines of Drosophila melanogaster by measuring wing area and cell size in the wing blade of adult flies reared under standard, laboratory conditions. We report that the contribution of cell size to an Australian cline is much smaller than that to a South American cline. The data suggest that neither cell size nor cell number were the targets of selection, but rather wing area itself, or a trait closely related to it. We hypothesize that the differences between the continents were caused by differences in the initial pattern of genetic variation for the cell traits and/or by the direction of selection on the source populations of the clines. Despite large differences between continents in the cellular basis of the latitudinal variation, multiple regression analysis, using the individual variation within populations, showed that the relationship between cell size and cell number was changed with latitude in the same way in the two clines. The relative contribution of cell number to wing area variation increased with latitude, probably because of compensatory interactions with cell size as a consequence of the latitudinal increase in cell number. Our findings are discussed in relation to the cellular basis of evolutionary change in laboratory thermal selection lines and natural populations along latitudinal clines.

TI  - Effect of temperature on longevity and productivity in Drosophila ananassae: Evidence for adaptive plasticity and trade-off between longevity and productivity
VL  - 114
IS  - 1
SP  - 95-102
AB  - The genetic response of body size to temperature in the laboratory provides an interesting example of phenotypic plasticity. We found that females of Drosophila ananassae reared to adulthood at 18degreesC showed significant increase in body weight as compared to females reared at 25degreesC. At a given temperature, early productivity and lifetime productivity were the highest when the rearing and test temperature were the same. The effect of test temperature was highly significant for total productivity and early productivity. The interaction between test temperature and development temperature was also highly significant. Effect of development temperature was not significant. The females reared at 18degreesC showed greater body weight but their productivity was not significantly higher than smaller females reared at 25degreesC. Thus, the usually close relationship between size and fecundity is lost when the size change is due to rearing temperature. These findings provide evidence for adaptive plasticity in D. ananassae. We also found a negative correlation (trade-off) between longevity and productivity, the first report of such a trade-off between longevity and productivity in D. ananassae.

TI  - Maintenance of phenotypic variation: repeatability, heritability and size-dependent processes in a wild brook trout population
VL  - 4
IS  - 4
SP  - 602-615
AB  - Phenotypic variation in body size can result from within-cohort variation in birth dates, among-individual growth variation and size-selective processes. We explore the relative effects of these processes on the maintenance of wide observed body size variation in stream-dwelling brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Based on the analyses of multiple recaptures of individual fish, it appears that size distributions are largely determined by the maintenance of early size variation. We found no evidence for size-dependent compensatory growth (which would reduce size variation) and found no indication that size-dependent survival substantially influenced body size distributions. Depensatory growth (faster growth by larger individuals) reinforced early size variation, but was relatively strong only during the first sampling interval (age-0, fall). Maternal decisions on the timing and location of spawning could have a major influence on early, and as our results suggest, later (>age-0) size distributions. If this is the case, our estimates of heritability of body size (body length = 0.25) will be dominated by processes that generate and maintain early size differences. As a result, evolutionary responses to environmental change that are mediated by body size may be largely expressed via changes in the timing and location of reproduction.

TI  - THE EVOLUTION OF VERTEBRAL NUMBER AND BODY-SIZE IN SNAKES
VL  - 8
IS  - 6
SP  - 708-719
AB  - 1. In snakes body size and vertebral number vary considerably among species. To investigate whether the two traits are correlated, and similar to a pattern found in fish and termed pleomerism, data from the literature were examined for 771 species and subspecies of advanced snakes (superfamily Colubroidea; families Colubridae, Elapidae and Viperidae). A strong tendency was found for species with many vertebrae to reach a large maximum body size; in 12 groups of species examined all showed a positive correlation coefficient and in nine cases it was significant. 2. To eliminate the possibility that this result is an effect of similarity owing to common ancestry, both a directional method and an independent comparison method were applied on groups for which a cladogram was available. The results were found to be robust, and it is concluded that the evolution of vertebral number has paralleled the evolution of body size in these groups of snakes. It appears that vertebral number, at least in part, has evolved as a correlated response to selection on body size. 3. Deviations from the general pattern of pleomerism were examined to investigate whether they could be explained by family affiliation, body shape or by various ecological factors. The three families did not differ in either slope or elevation of the relationship between vertebral number and body size, but species with a mere elongated body had more vertebrae per size unit than stouter ones whereas burrowing species had fewer vertebrae per size unit than species occupying other habitats. Furthermore, the habit of constriction also appeared to affect vertebral number; constricting species had more vertebrae per size unit than non-constricting ones. Thus, vertebral number per se is also a target of selection and has been adjusted according to specific ecological circumstances apart from being affected by body size. Finally I examined whether body size and vertebral number might be affected by altitude, and thus presumably temperature as has been suggested. However, no effect of altitude on vertebral number or body size was found.

TI  - THE IMPORTANCE AND CONSEQUENCES OF STRESS IN LIVING AND FOSSIL POPULATIONS - FROM LIFE-HISTORY VARIATION TO EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE
VL  - 142
SP  - S5-S20
AB  - Natural populations are subjected to abiotic environmental stresses of varying intensity. Some organisms can increase their resistance to stress by a genetic reduction in metabolic rate. This relationship underlies negative associations of desiccation resistance with many life-history traits but a positive association with longevity in Drosophila melanogaster. The efficacy of stress as an environmental probe exposing such trade-offs follows from the high heritability of stress resistance in these experiments. Generalizations concerning evolutionary change come from the interaction between stress and its metabolic cost. At stressed species borders little available energy may remain beyond maintenance and survival needs so that extinctions become likely. In moderately stressed and narrowly fluctuating environments there should be sufficient genetic variability and metabolic energy to permit genetic adaptation. Phyletic gradualism is an expectation in these environments. In more stressed and widely fluctuating environments a punctuated evolutionary pattern is likely even though stasis may occur most of the time. An interpretation of evolutionary patterns therefore comes from an analysis of the interaction between stress (severity and variability), genetic variability, and energy availability, which can be summarized in an evolutionary templet.

TI  - Flight response, body weight, and lipid content of Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (Coleoptera : Bostrichidae) as influenced by strain, season and phenotype
VL  - 35
IS  - 2
SP  - 183-196
AB  - Effects of geographical origin of strain, season of field collection, genetic background, and number of generations of laboratory rearing on flight initiation, body weight, and lipid content of lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica, were studied. Significant differences in flight initiation, body weight, and total lipid content occurred among the four field strains collected from Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and Mexico. Flight activity tended to be higher for strains with higher average body weight. Oleic, palmitic, and linoleic acids accounted for about 95% of all fatty acids present in the strains tested. However, the percentage of lipids per fresh body weight was not significantly different among these four field strains. Beetles collected in summer tended to fly more and have a higher percentage of lipid content than beetles collected in spring and autumn. Results from crosses between strains with high and low flight responses suggested that the female contributes a higher proportion of additive genetic variance for flight initiation than the male. Rearing for 17 generations in laboratory conditions had no discernible effect on flight initiation of a strain of R. dominica collected from the field. Thus, flight behavior can persist for many generations of laboratory rearing. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Longitudinal Measurements of Oxygen Consumption in Growing Infants during the First Weeks after Birth: Old Data Revisited
VL  - 103
IS  - 3
SP  - 224-232
AB  - Background: In a study conducted in 1966-1969, longitudinal measurements were made of the metabolic rate in growing infants. Statistical methods for analyzing longitudinal data weren't readily accessible at that time. Objectives: To measure minimal rates of oxygen consumption (V) over dotO(2), ml/min) in growing infants during the first postnatal weeks and to determine the relationships between postnatal increases in (V) over dotO(2), body size and postnatal age. Methods: We studied 61 infants of any birth weight or gestational age, including 19 of very low birth weight. The infants, nursed in incubators, were clinically well and without need of oxygen supplementation or respiratory assistance. Serial measures of (V) over dotO(2) using a closed-circuit method were obtained at approximately weekly intervals. (V) over dotO(2) was measured under thermoneutral conditions with the infant asleep or resting quietly. Data were analyzed using mixed-effects models. Results: During early postnatal growth, (V) over dotO(2) rises as surface area (m(2))(1.94) (standard error, SE 0.054) or body weight (kg)(1.24) (SE 0.033). Multivariate analyses show statistically significant effects of both size and age. Reference intervals (Rls) for (V)over dotO(2) for fixed values of body weight and postnatal age are presented. As (V)over dotO(2) rises with increasing size and age, there is an increase in the skin-operative environmental temperature gradient (T skin-op) required for heat loss. Required T skin-op can be predicted from surface area and heat loss (heat production minus heat storage). Conclusions:Generation of Rls for minimal rates of (V) over dotO(2) in growing infants from the 1960s was enabled by application of mixed-effects statistical models for analyses of longitudinal data. Results apply to the pre-caffeine era of neonatal care. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Multi-generational responses of a marine polychaete to a rapid change in seawater pCO(2)
VL  - 9
IS  - 9
SP  - 1082-1095
AB  - Little is known of the capacity that marine metazoans have to evolve under rapid pCO(2) changes. Consequently, we reared a marine polychaete, Ophryotrocha labronica, previously cultured for approximately 33 generations under a low/variable pH regime, under elevated and low pCO(2) for six generations. The strain used was found to be tolerant to elevated pCO(2) conditions. In generations F1 and F2 females' fecundity was significantly lower in the low pCO(2) treatment. However, from generation F3 onwards there were no differences between pCO(2) treatments, indicating that trans-generational effects enabled the restoration and maintenance of reproductive output. Whilst the initial fitness recovery was likely driven by trans-generational plasticity (TGP), the results from reciprocal transplant assays, performed using F7 individuals, made it difficult to disentangle between whether TGP had persisted across multiple generations, or if evolutionary adaptation had occurred. Nonetheless, both are important mechanisms for persistence under climate change. Overall, our study highlights the importance of multi-generational experiments in more accurately determining marine metazoans' responses to changes in pCO(2), and strengthens the case for exploring their use in conservation, by creating specific pCO(2) tolerant strains of keystone ecosystem species.

TI  - Evolution of resource generalism via generalized stress response confers increased reproductive thermal tolerance in a pest beetle
VL  - 137
IS  - 2
SP  - 374-386
AB  - Generalism should be favoured evolutionarily when there is no genetic constraint or loss of fitness across alternative environments. However, evolution of generalism can require substantial evolutionary change, which can confer a general stress response to other aspects of the environment. We created generalist lineages from an ancestral, resource-specialized laboratory population of seed beetles (Callosobruchus maculatus) by rearing lines over 60 generations on a mixture of both ancestral and novel host species to test for costs associated with the evolution of generalism involving evolutionary changes in gene expression and correlated phenotypic responses during a shift to generalism. Evolved lines had higher fitness on the novel resource, with no loss of fitness on the ancestral resource, indicating that they overcame initial fitness trade-offs. This involved upregulation of major stress response (heat shock protein) genes and genes coding for metabolic enzymes, suggesting an underpinning metabolic and physiological cost. Resource generalist populations also evolved greater thermal tolerance breadth, highlighting that the evolution of resource generalism might pre-adapt species to respond favourably to other environmental stressors, following selection for generalized stress response gene upregulation. The rapid gain of novel hosts during a pest invasion might also confer greater thermal resilience to ongoing climate change.

AB  - The link between biodiversity and climate has been obvious to biologists since the work of von Humboldt in the early 1800s, but establishing the relationship of climate to ecological and evolutionary patterns is more difficult. On evolutionary timescales, climate can affect supply of energy by biotic and abiotic effects. Some of the best evidence for a link between biodiversity and climate comes from latitudinal gradients in diversity, which provide an avenue to explore the more general relationship between climate and evolution. Among the wide range of biotic hypotheses, those with the greatest empirical support indicate that warmer climates have provided the energetic foundation for increased biodiversity by fostering greater population size and thus increased extinction resistance; have increased metabolic scope; have allowed more species to exploit specialized niches as a result of greater available energy; and generated faster speciation and/or lower extinction rates. In combination with geologic evidence for carbon dioxide levels and changing areas of tropical seas, these observations provide the basis for a simple, first-order model of the relationship between climate through the Phanerozoic and evolutionary patterns and diversity. Such a model suggests that we should expect greatest marine diversity during globally warm intervals with dispersed continents, broad shelves and moderately extensive continental seas. Demonstrating a significant evolutionary response to either climate or climatic change is challenging, however, because of continuing uncertainties over patterns of Phanerozoic marine diversity and the variety of factors beyond climate that influence evolution.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the latitudinal variation in preadult competitive ability of Drosophila melanogaster. Two pairs of populations from Queensland and Tasmania, Australia, were examined. Queensland flies are genetically smaller and develop more slowly than the Tasmanian flies. Survival and body size of flies raised at different temperatures and densities were compared when larvae were challenged with a common competitor. No latitudinal variation in larval survival was detected. Body size (measured as wing length) decreased with increasing temperature and larval density. Flies from the Tasmanian populations were more sensitive to the effects of temperature and density and to the joint effect of increased temperature and density. This could explain the evolution of greater growth efficiency and larger body size at lower temperatures.

TI  - Trans-generational effect of protein restricted diet on adult body and wing size of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Protein restriction (PR) has established feasible trade-offs in Drosophila melanogaster to understand lifespan or ageing in a nutritionally challenged environment. However, the phenotypes of body size, weight and wing length respond according to factors such as flies' genotype, environmental exposure and parental diet, and hence their understanding is essential. Here, we demonstrate the effect of long-term PR diet on body size, weight, normal and dry wing length of flies subjected to PR50 and PR70 (50% and 70% protein content present in control food, respectively) for 20 generations from the pre-adult stage. We found that PR-fed flies have lower body weight, relative water content (in males), unaltered (PR50%) and higher (PR70%) relative fat content in males, smaller normal and dry body size when compared with control and generations 1 and 2. Interestingly, the wing size and pupal size of PR flies are smaller and showed significant effects on diet and generation. Thus, these traits are sex and generation dependent along with a diet interaction, which is capable of modulating these results variably. Taken together, the trans-generational effect of PR on fitness and fitness-related traits might be helpful to understand the underpinning mechanisms of evolution and ageing in fruit flies D. melanogaster.

VL  - 21
IS  - 2
SP  - 213-226
AB  - Two primary patterns of body size variation have been recorded in ectotherms in relation to latitudinal/altitudinal shifts. In some, body size increases with increasing latitude/altitude whereas, in others, body size decreases with increasing latitude/altitude. This clinal variation is generally assumed to be caused by local adaptation to environmental conditions however the selective variable(s) (temperature, humidity, diet quality, etc.) is still heavily debated. Here we investigate geographic variation in body size of dark and pale color morphs of males of the bush-cricket Isophya rizeensis collected from 15 locations along an elevation gradient ranging from 350 to 2 500 m. Using an information theoretical approach we evaluate the relative support of four different hypotheses (the temperature size rule, the moisture gradient hypothesis, the seasonal constraint hypothesis, and the primary productivity hypothesis) explaining body size variation along the altitudinal gradient. Body size variation in pale color morphs showed a curvilinear relationship with altitude while dark color morphs showed no variation in body size. Body size variation in pale color morphs was highly correlated with precipitation and temperature seasonality values thus giving strong support for the moisture gradient and seasonal constraint hypothesis. Our results reinforce the importance of gradients in humidity and seasonality over temperature in the creation of altitudinal body size clines and the role of selection for resistance to stress factors in the establishment of these clines. Whether a body size cline is observed or not might also depend on the phenotypic properties of the individuals, like coloration.

AB  - We present the first fecundity and egg size data for three species of lithodid crab from Antarctic waters south of the Polar Front, caught in the fisheries operating around the island of South Georgia. In all species, fecundity was observed to increase with body size, but reproductive allocation was found to differ significantly between species. The highest relative fecundity (eggs(-g) body weight) and smallest egg size was found in Paralomis spinosissima, which is found in shallower waters, whereas the lowest relative fecundity values and largest eggs were recorded in the deeper living species, Neolithodes diomedeae. Evidence is presented that closely related sympatric species may employ quite different reproductive strategies that suit their depth distribution whilst indicating the overriding evolutionary adaptation of reproductive traits to temperature and food availability.

TI  - Differences in the thermal physiology of adult Yarrow's spiny lizards (Sceloporus jarrovii) in relation to sex and body size
VL  - 4
IS  - 22
SP  - 4220-4229
AB  - Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is often assumed to reflect the phenotypic consequences of differential selection operating on each sex. Species that exhibit SSD may also show intersexual differences in other traits, including field-active body temperatures, preferred temperatures, and locomotor performance. For these traits, differences may be correlated with differences in body size or reflect sex-specific trait optima. Male and female Yarrow's spiny lizards, Sceloporus jarrovii, in a population in southeastern Arizona exhibit a difference in body temperature that is unrelated to variation in body size. The observed sexual variation in body temperature may reflect divergence in thermal physiology between the sexes. To test this hypothesis, we measured the preferred body temperatures of male and female lizards when recently fed and fasted. We also estimated the thermal sensitivity of stamina at seven body temperatures. Variation in these traits provided an opportunity to determine whether body size or sex-specific variation unrelated to size shaped their thermal physiology. Female lizards, but not males, preferred a lower body temperature when fasted, and this pattern was unrelated to body size. Larger individuals exhibited greater stamina, but we detected no significant effect of sex on the shape or height of the thermal performance curves. The thermal preference of males and females in a thermal gradient exceeded the optimal temperature for performance in both sexes. Our findings suggest that differences in thermal physiology are both sex- and size-based and that peak performance at low body temperatures may be adaptive given the reproductive cycles of this viviparous species. We consider the implications of our findings for the persistence of S.jarrovii and other montane ectotherms in the face of climate warming.

VL  - 18
IS  - 5
SP  - 1499-1508
AB  - There is increasing evidence for morphological change in response to recent environmental change, but how this relates to fluctuations in geographic range remains unclear. We measured museum specimens from two time periods (19021950 and 20002008) that vary significantly in climate to assess if and how two high elevation contracting species of ground squirrels in the Sierra Nevada of California, Belding's ground squirrel (Urocitellus beldingi) and the golden-mantled ground squirrel (Callospermophilus lateralis), and one lower elevation, stable species, the California ground squirrel (Otospermophilus beecheyi), have responded morphologically to changes over the last century. We measured skull length (condylobasal length), an ontogenetically more labile trait highly correlated with body size, and maxillary toothrow length, a more developmentally constrained trait predictive of skull shape. C. lateralis and U. beldingi, both obligate hibernators, have increased in body size, but have not changed in shape. In contrast, O. beecheyi, which only hibernates in parts of its range, has shown no significant change in either morphometric trait. The increase in body size in the higher elevation species, hypothesized to be a plastic effect due to a longer growing season and thus prolonged food availability, opposes the expected direction of selection for decreased body size under chronic warming. Our study supports that population contraction is related to physiological rather than nutritional constraints.

TI  - Climatic-niche evolution with key morphological innovations across clades within Scutiger boulengeri (Anura: Megophryidae)
VL  - 11
IS  - 15
SP  - 10353-10368
AB  - The studies of climatic-niche shifts over evolutionary time accompanied by key morphological innovations have attracted the interest of many researchers recently. We applied ecological niche models (ENMs), ordination method (environment principal component analyses; PCA-env), combined phylogenetic comparative methods (PCMs), and phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) regression methods to analyze the realized niche dynamics and correspondingly key morphological innovations across clades within Scutiger boulengeri throughout their distributions in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) margins of China. Our results show there are six clades in S. boulengeri and obvious niche divergences caused by niche expansion in three clades. Moreover, in our system, niche expansion is more popular than niche unfilling into novel environmental conditions. Annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, and precipitation of driest month may contribute to such a shift. In addition, we identified several key climatic factors and morphological traits that tend to be associated with niche expansion in S. boulengeri clades correspondingly. We found phenotypic plasticity [i.e., length of lower arm and hand (LAHL), hind-limb length (HLL), and foot length (FL)] and evolutionary changes [i.e., snout-vent length (SVL)] may together contribute to niche expansion toward adapting novel niche, which provides us a potential pattern of how a colonizing toad might seed a novel habitat to begin the process of speciation and finally adaptive radiation. For these reasons, persistent phylogeographic divisions and accompanying divergences in niche occupancy and morphological adaption suggest that for future studies, distinct genetic structure and morphological changes corresponding to each genetic clade should be included in modeling niche evolution dynamics, but not just constructed at the species level.

TI  - Evolutionary changes in the biometry of the fossil radiolarian Stichocorys peregrina lineage in the eastern equatorial and eastern North Pacific
VL  - 90
SP  - 13-28
AB  - Stichocotys peregrina (Riedel) contributes to paleoceanography as a valuable stratigraphic tool for correlation of deep-sea siliceous sediments in world oceans and as a paleoceanographic indicator. This paper documents the evolutionary morphologic changes of the S. peregrina lineage from the middle Miocene to late Pliocene in the eastern equatorial and eastern North Pacific (IODP Site U1335 and ODP Site 887, respectively). The size and shape changes show that there are at least two geographical variations in the S. peregrina lineage. In the eastern equatorial Pacific, two significant morphological shifts took place about 11.0 and 7.0 Ma, but the morphology remained relatively stable from 7.0 to 3.0 Ma. Coincident with morphological changes in the S. peregrina lineage were changes in biogenic productivity. These changes suggest that there is a close correspondence between major paleoceanographic events in the late Neogene and evolutionary changes of the S. peregrina lineage in the low latitudes. In the high latitudes, the ratio of the third segment to fourth segment in width and height showed a maximum from 9.5 to 8.0 Ma, and decreased stepwise at about 8.0 and 6.5 Ma. However, the radiolarian data in the high latitudes do not show a clear relationship between the paleoceanographic events and size variation of this lineage. The evolutionary transition from Stichocotys delmontensis to S. peregrina can be used as a primary biostratigraphic marker in the low latitudes. However, it is not easy to use the evolutionary transition for biostratigraphic correlation and age determination in the high latitudes, because there is no obvious change in the ratio of the third to fourth segment widths that can be used to distinguish S. delmontensis from the descendant S. peregrina.

TI  - GENETIC-EFFECTS OF STATIC MAGNETIC-FIELDS - BODY SIZE INCREASE AND LETHAL MUTATIONS INDUCED IN POPULATIONS OF DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER AFTER CHRONIC EXPOSURE
VL  - 24
IS  - 5
SP  - 393-413
AB  - The effect of static magnetic fields on body size of Drosophila melanogaster was analyzed on 3 laboratory stocks reared under chronic exposure to a magnetic field 10-12-fold greater than the earth's. A significant increase in body size was observed which persisted even when the flies were returned to control environmental conditions after a few generations of exposure. The genetic basis of the differences observed between treated and control lines was assessed analyzing 2 fitness components and 4 dimensional characters. The increase in body size was mainly associated with cell number, suggesting that the magnetic field effect on size depends on genes which control cell proliferation. The evolution of the fitness components during the generations of exposure gives some evidence of the underlying genetic mechanisms involved. Lines made isogenic for the 3 major chromosomes were tested to establish whether the size response obtained was dependent on the genetic variability or not. These lines behaved in a similar fashion to outbred lines, suggesting that the response in size depends on an increased mutation rate. A mutagenic test confirmed that one generation of exposure induces X-linked lethal mutations. These events could reflect the fact that the magnetic field acts as a physical mutagenic agent at some stage during development.

TI  - Latitudinal clines in Drosophila melanogaster: body size, allozyme frequencies, inversion frequencies, and the insulin-signalling pathway
VL  - 82
IS  - 3
SP  - 207-223
AB  - Many latitudinal clines exist in Drosophila melanogaster: in adult body size, in allele frequency at allozyme loci, and in frequencies of common cosmopolitan inversions. The question is raised whether these latitudinal clines are causally related. This review aims to connect data from two very different fields of study, evolutionary biology and cell biology, in explaining such natural genetic variation in D. melanogaster body size and development time. It is argued that adult body size clines, inversion frequency clines, and clines in allele frequency at loci involved in glycolysis and glycogen storage are part of the same adaptive strategy. Selection pressure is expected to differ at opposite ends of the clines. At high latitudes, selection on D. melanogaster would favour high larval growth rate at low temperatures, and resource storage in adults to survive winter. At low latitudes selection would favour lower larval critical size to survive crowding, and increased male activity leading to high male reproductive success. Studies of the insulin-signalling pathway in D. melanogaster point to the involvement of this pathway in metabolism and adult body size. The genes involved in the insulin-signalling pathway are associated with common cosmopolitan inversions that show latitudinal clines. Each chromosome region connected with a large common cosmopolitan inversion possesses a gene of the insulin transmembrane complex, a gene of the intermediate pathway and a gene of the TOR branch. The hypothesis is presented that temperate D. melanogaster populations have a higher frequency of a 'thrifty' genotype corresponding to high insulin level or high signal level, while tropical populations possess a more 'spendthrift' genotype corresponding to low insulin or low signal level.

TI  - RESPONSES AND CORRELATED RESPONSES TO ARTIFICIAL SELECTION ON THORAX LENGTH IN DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER
VL  - 47
IS  - 1
SP  - 213-226
AB  - Two sets of four replicate lines of Drosophila melanogaster were selected for large and small thorax with controls. F1 progeny of crosses between the selected lines within each size category showed (a) a reduction in preadult viability in large lines relative to control and small lines when they were cultured at medium or high density in competition with a standard mutant marked competitor stock, and (b) an increase in larval development time in large lines relative to control and small lines. Natural selection for increased body size in adults may therefore be opposed by adverse effects on larval viability. The results are discussed in terms of the developmental mechanisms probably responsible for the change in body size. The preadult survival of the large and control lines was measured at three different temperatures, and there was no evidence for a significant interaction between size and temperature. The observed evolutionary increase in body size in response to reduced temperature in Drosophila must therefore involve either different genes from those subject to selection for size at a single temperature, or a fitness component other than preadult survival. There was no significant asymmetry in response to selection, and thorax length showed heterosis in crosses between the selected lines.

VL  - 55

SP  - 25-37
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the significance of the body weight of hens for their productive adaptability. Under controlled warm environmental conditions (Temp. 32-degrees-C and R. H. 45 %). In the course of the investigation, the performance data from a lightweight (LL) and from a lightmedium (LM) hybrid laying hen population were recorded with 1977 laying hens. Within these two hybrid populations a qualitatively genetic subdivision of weight populations a qualitatively genetic subdivision of weight was achieved with the dwarf gene on the one hand. On the other hand an additional body weight variability based on additive genetic effects was obtained by positively assortative mating. Independently of the genetic structure of the animal material the high environmental temperature had the following effects: 1. Body weight was reduced by 13.6 % on an average associated with a narrowing of the breast angle by 11.3 % as well as a non-significant reduction in shank length. 2. The average egg weight was reduced by 12 %, number of eggs by 19.5 % and egg mass by 28.8 %. The negative effect of heat stress increased with increasing age of the animals. In general th high environmental temperature impaired the performance of the heavier hens more strongly than that of the lighter hens. The changes caused by the dwarf gene independently of the environmental temperature were as follows: 1. There was a reduction of 28.5 % in body weight, associated with a marked reduction in shank length by 21.5 % and a non-significant increase in breast angle. 2. On an average egg weight was reduced by 5.4 %, number of eggs by 20.3 % and egg mass by 24.3 %. The following could be established with respect to the relationship among the traits of body conformation and with egg production. 1. There was a very strong multiple relationship between shank length, breast angle and body weight ranging from B = .82 to .91 within each genetic and environmental group. Under high environmental temperature there was a very small reduction in the relationship. 2. At both temperature levels and in all genetic groups the body weight was more strongly determined by the size of the body (shank length) (r = .77 to .91) than by its condition (breast angle) (r = .47 to .62). 3. The performance traits were mainly determined by body weight or shank length. 4. In general, the relationship between body weight and egg mass were non-linear in temperate as well as warm environments. There were high differences among the magnitudes of temperate and warm environments were B = .35 and B = .07, respectively. The investigation permits the conclusion that a close relationship exists between the body weight of laying hens and their productive adaptability. Consequently, a specific optimum body weight can be defined for the achievement of maximum performance potential within each environmental temperature; this is to be taken into consideration by breeders, specially when there are large differences among the environmental conditions.

VL  - 48

SP  - 1269-1276
AB  - We examined the evolutionary and developmental responses of body size to temperature in Drosophila melanogaster, using replicated lines of flies that had been allowed to evolve for 5 yr at 25 degrees C or at 16.5 degrees C. Development and evolution at the lower temperature both resulted in higher thorax length and wing area. The evolutionary effect of temperature on wing area was entirely a consequence of an increase in cell area. The developmental response was mainly attributable to an increase in cell area, with a small effect on cell number in males. Given its similarity to the evolutionary response, the increase in body size and cell size resulting from development at low temperature may be a case of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. The pattern of plasticity did not evolve in response to temperature for any of the traits. The selective advantage of the evolutionary and developmental responses to temperature is obscure and remains a major challenge for future work.

TI  - Long-term change in a behavioural trait: truncated spawning distribution and demography in Northeast Arctic cod
VL  - 21
IS  - 4
SP  - 1521-1530
AB  - Harvesting may be a potent driver of demographic change and contemporary evolution, which both may have great impacts on animal populations. Research has focused on changes in phenotypic traits that are easily quantifiable and for which time series exist, such as size, age, sex, or gonad size, whereas potential changes in behavioural traits have been under-studied. Here, we analyse potential drivers of long-term changes in a behavioural trait for the Northeast Arctic stock of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, namely choice of spawning location. For 104years (1866-1969), commercial catches were recorded annually and reported by county along the Norwegian coast. During this time period, spawning ground distribution has fluctuated with a trend towards more northerly spawning. Spawning location is analysed against a suite of explanatory factors including climate, fishing pressure, density dependence, and demography. We find that demography (age or age at maturation) had the highest explanatory power for variation in spawning location, while climate had a limited effect below statistical significance. As to potential mechanisms, some effects of climate may act through demography, and explanatory variables for demography may also have absorbed direct evolutionary change in migration distance for which proxies were unavailable. Despite these caveats, we argue that fishing mortality, either through demographic or evolutionary change, has served as an effective driver for changing spawning locations in cod, and that additional explanatory factors related to climate add no significant information.

TI  - Evaluating the role and measures of juvenile growth rate: latitudinal variation in insect life histories
VL  - 126
IS  - 12
SP  - 1726-1737
AB  - Latitudinal and elevational trends in body size are found in numerous animal taxa, with various adaptive explanations proposed. It is however debatable whether geographic trends in adult body size are accompanied by corresponding differences in juvenile growth rate (= mass gain per unit time). Respective studies have been complicated by conceptual and methodological problems related to defining and measuring this variable, particularly in organisms with discontinuous growth like arthropods. Using an original method for estimating differential (instantaneous) juvenile growth rates, we compared geographically distant European populations of six insect species in a common garden experiment. We found no among population differences in differential growth rate in any of the species. This result is in concert with concurrent increase in both adult size and developmental time towards the south. While opposite examples exist, we interpret our results as challenging the view that growth rate is a trait that readily responds to environmentally based selective pressures. Our results thus advocate the more classical view of growth rate maximisation within its physiological limits. We discuss the advantages of using differential (rather than integral) measures of growth rate in evolutionary ecological studies and evaluate the reasons for the detected latitudinal trends in life history traits.

TI  - Rapid phenotypic change in a polymorphic salamander over 43 years
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - Color polymorphic animals offer a unique system for studying intraspecific phenotypic responses to climate change. Discrete color morphs are easy to identify, and correlated trait responses of morphs can indicate how climate warming may facilitate long-term maintenance of polymorphisms. We use a historical dataset spanning 43 years to examine temporal shifts in color morph frequency and body size in response to climate in the Eastern Red-backed Salamander, Plethodon cinereus, which contains a widespread striped/unstriped color polymorphism. We created a pipeline to extract high-throughput trait data from fluid-preserved museum specimens where we batch-photographed salamanders, de-aggregated individual specimens from photographs, and solicited help of community scientists to score color morphs. We used a linear modeling framework that includes information about spatial population structure to demonstrate that color morph frequency and body size vary in response to climate, elevation, and over time, with an overall trend of higher frequency and decreased body size of the striped morph, but increased size of the unstriped morph. These surprising results suggest that morphs may be responding to multiple climate and geographic drivers through co-adapted morphological changes. This work highlights new practices of extracting trait data from museum specimens to demonstrate species phenotypes response to climate change.

TI  - Determination of adult size in a folivorous moth: constraints at instar level?
VL  - 23
IS  - 1
SP  - 80-89
AB  - 1. Reaction norms for size and age at maturity were studied in Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera, Geometridae). Growth rates were manipulated by rearing larvae on different levels of food quality and quantity, and instar-specific final weights and development times were recorded. 2. Food level and initial weight of an instar accounted for most of the variance in final weights. Sexual dimorphism in pupal weights could be entirely ascribed to sex differences in initial weights of the last instar. 3. There were problems with considering the reaction norms optimal within the conventional demographic explanatory framework. Because fecundity increases linearly with body size and no costs of large adult size are known, one should expect female larvae to grow larger to increase their individual fitness. It is therefore likely that constraints play a major role in the determination, and evolution, of size in this species. 4. A focus on individual instars may be the best way to reveal the constraints on, and space for, adaptive evolution of insect growth. Some limit to the initial:final weight ratio of an instar, and the fixed number of instars, may represent important constraints. 5. Reaction norms like the ones described in this study lead to strong environmental determination rather than canalization of body size. Food quality throughout larval development may thus be very important for individual fitness and population dynamics in E. autumnata.

VL  - 68
IS  - 5
SP  - 1385-1398
AB  - Understanding how natural environments shape phenotypic variation is a major aim in evolutionary biology. Here, we have examined clinal, likely genetically based variation in morphology among 19 populations of the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) from Africa and Europe, spanning a range from sea level to 3000 m altitude and including locations approximating the southern and northern range limit. We were interested in testing whether latitude and altitude have similar phenotypic effects, as has often been postulated. Both latitude and altitude were positively correlated with wing area, ovariole number, and cell number. In contrast, latitude and altitude had opposite effects on the ratio between ovariole number and body size, which was negatively correlated with egg production rate per ovariole. We also used transgenic manipulation to examine how increased cell number affects morphology and found that larger transgenic flies, due to a higher number of cells, had more ovarioles, larger wings, and, unlike flies from natural populations, increased wing loading. Clinal patterns in morphology are thus not a simple function of changes in body size; instead, each trait might be subject to different selection pressures. Together, our results provide compelling evidence for profound similarities as well as differences between phenotypic effects of latitude and altitude.

TI  - From genotype to phenotype: buffering mechanisms and the storage of genetic information
VL  - 22
IS  - 12
SP  - 1095-1105
AB  - DNA sequence variation is abundant In wild populations. While molecular biologists use genetically homogeneous strains of model organisms to avoid this variation, evolutionary biologists embrace genetic variation as the material of evolution since heritable differences in fitness drive evolutionary change. Yet, the relationship between the phenotypic variation affecting fitness and the genotypic variation producing it is complex. Genetic buffering mechanisms modify this relationship by concealing the effects of genetic and environmental variation on phenotype. Genetic buffering allows the build-up and storage of genetic variation in phenotypically normal populations. When buffering breaks down, thresholds governing the expression of previously silent variation are crossed. At these thresholds, phenotypic differences suddenly appear and are available for selection. Thus, buffering mechanisms modulate evolution and regulate a balance between evolutionary stasis and change. Recent work provides a glimpse of the molecular details governing some types of genetic buffering. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

TI  - The energetics of growth in Drosophila melanogaster: Effect of temperature and food conditions
VL  - 48
IS  - 2
SP  - 169-188
AB  - The relation between oxygen consumption rate and larval growth rate in Drosophila melanogaster at different temperatures and food levels was analyzed to investigate whether different larval growth rates and adult body sizes are the consequences of different costs of growth. Four isofemale lines from two populations collected from France and Tanzania were compared. The rate of oxygen consumption per mg body weight increased with the relative rate of growth. Costs of growth (C-g), i.e., the increase in oxygen consumption due to growth, took 17.4% of the total energy invested in growth. No significant effect on C-g could be shown of either temperature or food level. Basal metabolic rate (R-b), i.e., the rate of oxygen consumption in the absence of growth, increased with temperature and food level at the intermediate temperature. The two French lines showed a higher rate of growth, independent of the environmental conditions, leading to a larger final body size. The two Tanzanian lines show a reduced C-g as compared to the French lines at 27.5 degrees C, while showing no such difference at 17.5 degrees C and 22.5 degrees C. Yet, these differences in C-g do not lead to clear differences in growth efficiency between populations, indicating that differences in absorption rate are the main cause of both environmental and genetic differences in growth rate.

TI  - Effect of directional selection for body size on fluctuating asymmetry in certain morphological traits in Drosophila ananassae
VL  - 34
IS  - 2
SP  - 275-285
AB  - Variation in the subtle differences between the right and left sides of bilateral characters or fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been considered as an indicator of an organism's ability to cope with genetic and environmental stresses during development. However, due to inconsistency in the results of empirical studies, the relationship between FA and stress has been the subject of intense debate. In this study, we investigated whether stress caused by artificial bidirectional selection for body size has any effect on the levels of FA of different morphological traits in Drosophila ananassae. The realised heritability (h(2)) was higher in low-line females and high-line males, which suggests an asymmetrical response to selection for body size. Further, the levels of FA were compared across 10 generations of selection in different selection lines in both sexes for sternopleural bristle number, wing length, wing-to-thorax ratio, sex comb-tooth number and ovariole number. The levels of FA differed significantly among generations and selection lines but did not change markedly with directional selection. However, the levels of FA were higher in the G10 generation (at the end of selection) than G0 (at the start of selection) but lower than the G5 generation in different selection lines, suggesting that the levels of FA are not affected by the inbreeding generated during the course of selection. Also, the levels of FA in the hybrids of high and low lines were significantly lower than the parental selection lines, suggesting that FA is influenced by hybridisation. These results are discussed in the framework of the literature available on FA and its relationship with stress.

TI  - Natural selection on thermal performance in a novel thermal environment
VL  - 111
IS  - 39
SP  - 14165-14169
AB  - Tropical ectotherms are thought to be especially vulnerable to climate change because they are adapted to relatively stable temperature regimes, such that even small increases in environmental temperature may lead to large decreases in physiological performance. One way in which tropical organisms may mitigate the detrimental effects of warming is through evolutionary change in thermal physiology. The speed and magnitude of this response depend, in part, on the strength of climate-driven selection. However, many ectotherms use behavioral adjustments to maintain preferred body temperatures in the face of environmental variation. These behaviors may shelter individuals from natural selection, preventing evolutionary adaptation to changing conditions. Here, we mimic the effects of climate change by experimentally transplanting a population of Anolis sagrei lizards to a novel thermal environment. Transplanted lizards experienced warmer and more thermally variable conditions, which resulted in strong directional selection on thermal performance traits. These same traits were not under selection in a reference population studied in a less thermally stressful environment. Our results indicate that climate change can exert strong natural selection on tropical ectotherms, despite their ability to thermoregulate behaviorally. To the extent that thermal performance traits are heritable, populations may be capable of rapid adaptation to anthropogenic warming.

TI  - Tipping the scales: Evolution of the allometric slope independent of average trait size
VL  - 70
IS  - 2
SP  - 433-444
AB  - The scaling of body parts is central to the expression of morphology across body sizes and to the generation of morphological diversity within and among species. Although patterns of scaling-relationship evolution have been well documented for over one hundred years, little is known regarding how selection acts to generate these patterns. In part, this is because it is unclear the extent to which the elements of log-linear scaling relationshipsthe intercept or mean trait size and the slopecan evolve independently. Here, using the wing-body size scaling relationship in Drosophila melanogaster as an empirical model, we use artificial selection to demonstrate that the slope of a morphological scaling relationship between an organ (the wing) and body size can evolve independently of mean organ or body size. We discuss our findings in the context of how selection likely operates on morphological scaling relationships in nature, the developmental basis for evolved changes in scaling, and the general approach of using individual-based selection experiments to study the expression and evolution of morphological scaling.

TI  - Testing Rensch's rule in Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus, a seed-feeding beetle infesting Leucaena leucocephala plants
VL  - 97
IS  - 4
SP  - 304-311
AB  - Rensch's rule states that males vary more in size than females when body size increases. The main cause of Rensch's rule has been credited to sexual selection. However, different degrees of plasticity between the sexes have also been proven to be useful for describing variations in sexual size dimorphism, particularly within an intraspecific context. For insects, in general, this rule has rarely been tested within species. Here, we tested whether Acanthoscelides macrophthalmus (Schaeffer, 1907) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) followed Rensch's rule when individuals emerged from seeds immediately after fruit collection and when they were reared for one generation, by measuring three morphological traits. Rensch's rule was not followed for any of the morphological traits. Variations in body size were similar in males and females for bruchines that first emerged from seeds and for those that were reared for one generation. These findings suggest that environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, and seasonality) are unlikely to drive differential plasticity in males and females of this seed-feeding beetle. It is possible that changes in the body size of A. macrophthalmus have a genetic basis. However, regardless of whether variations in body size have a genetic basis, our findings provide no support for Rensch's rule.

AB  - We used highly realistic temperature treatments based on down-scaled global circulation models for 1990-2000 (control) and 2100 (warming treatment) to experimentally assess the impacts of altered temperature regimes on the emerging adults of aquatic insect communities. Experiments were run for 6 weeks and emerging adults of insects were identified and measured for length. There were clear responses to the warming treatment, but responses were taxa- and gender-specific. Males of mayfly Ulmerophlebia pipinna Suter 1986 (Leptophlebiidae) emerged faster under 2100 temperatures. This resulted in a change in the sex ratio that could compromise populations. Mean body size of some insects decreased under warming conditions, which is in agreement with the general hypothesis of reduced body size in response to climate change. However, the degree to which organism size was affected by temperature varied within and between taxa. These changes show the potential for changed temperature regimes to impact ecological systems at individual, population, and community levels. Changes in body size and species composition of emerging insects are likely to impact different levels in both the aquatic and terrestrial communities, for example through disruption of interactions between emerging insects and riparian predators which rely on those resources.

VL  - 35

SP  - 602-610
AB  - Feulgen staining revealed significant geographical differences in mean DNA contents of somatic nuclei of adult female Calanus glacialis and Pseudocalanus acuspes from the Canadian arctic and Nova Scotia; the latter exhibited seasonal differences near Halifax in 1987 but not 1989-1990. Female P. elongatus reared for 96 generations in the laboratory had significantly less DNA per nucleus than did first-generation females from the same North Sea wild stock. Nuclei of C. glacialis reared from juvenile stages (copepodid III) in four food-temperature treatments had significantly more DNA at high food and low temperature. There were also significant treatment effects in P. elongatus and P. acuspes reared from egg to adult. There were always significant differences in DNA contents among females within samples and treatments. Increased variance among nuclei within individual C. glacialis may have resulted from suboptimal laboratory conditions. Body lengths in rearing experiments were positively correlated with nuclear DNA contents in C. glacialis and P. elongatus; there was no correlation of lengths with nucleus number in P. acuspes. Development rate of late-stage C. glacialis was negatively related to nuclear DNA contents. The slight, but significant, differences among females within and among samples and treatments suggest that their DNA contents are both inherent and subject to slight environmental effects. Results are also consistent with earlier indications that body sizes and development rates of copepods, because of restricted variation in cell number, are partly under nucleotypic control.

TI  - Contrasting Geographic Patterns of Genetic Differentiation in Body Size and Development Time With Reproductive Isolation in Dendroctonus ponderosae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae)
VL  - 106
IS  - 3
SP  - 385-391
AB  - Body size and development time are two critical phenotypic traits that can be highly adaptive in insects. Recent population genetic analyses and crossing experiments with the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) have described substantial levels of neutral molecular genetic differentiation, genetic differences in phenotypic traits, and reproductive isolation. To determine whether genetic differences in adaptive phenotypic traits exist that correspond to reproductive boundaries, we conducted a common garden experiment with seven D. ponderosae populations previously used to identify reproductive incompatibilities. Genetic differences in development time were striking between faster developing, and more synchronized, northern populations and slower developing, and less synchronized, southern populations. Additionally, genetic differences in average body size were found between many populations. Differences in these two traits, however, failed to clearly demarcate populations that exhibit reproductive incompatibilities. Our results suggest that local selection pressures likely drive divergence in these two traits that is largely independent of the evolution of reproductive isolation in D. ponderosae.

TI  - Size-dependent mating success at various nutritional states in the yellow dung fly
VL  - 114
IS  - 8
SP  - 752-759
AB  - Mating success not only depends on genetic quality, but also equally on environmental factors, most prominently food availability. We investigated the interactive effects of nutritional state and body size on mating success and copula duration in yellow dung fly males (Scathophaga stercoraria; Diptera: Scathophagidae) of three body size selection lines in the laboratory in both non-competitive (single) and competitive (group) situations. Adults require protein and lipids from prey to reproduce, as well as sugars as an energy source for reproductive activity. We expected mating success to decrease with time because of sperm depletion (sugar treatment) and/or energy shortage (water treatment) relative to the control, prey plus sugar treatment. Based on physiological scaling, we also expected large-line males to become depleted either sooner because of their higher energy and sperm demands, or later because of their more efficient energy use. Average mating success indeed declined over a period of 5-7 d (or 5-15 potential copulations per male), but equally for all food treatments and body size classes. Surprisingly, water-fed and small-line males had the highest mating probability in the non-competitive setting, while in the competitive setting large-line males had the highest success. Energy-depleted males showed apparent terminal investment. Small males acquired females more readily but eventually lost them to larger males in the competitive situation. As shown before, copula duration was inversely related to body size and increased with copulation number, independent of food treatment. We conclude that sugar or prey shortage has little effect on mating success in the short term, and does not differentially affect males of different sizes.

TI  - Larval density and the Charnov-Bull model of adaptive environmental sex determination in a copepod
VL  - 83
IS  - 7
SP  - 943-954
AB  - Charnov and Bull suggested that environmentally induced variation in adult body size coupled with sex-specific differences in fitness can select for the evolution of adaptive environmental sex determination (ESD). In this study we determine whether larval density affects sex determination in the copepod Tigriopus californicus (Baker, 1912), as predicted by Charnov and Bull. Individuals reared at low densities developed faster and were significantly larger than siblings reared at high densities. For these laboratory-reared individuals, sexual selection on male body size was stronger than fecundity selection on female body size, but this sex-specific pattern of selection was reversed in the field. Differences in food availability (for females) and the mode of competition (for males) may account for the conflicting results between laboratory and field. We found a weak effect of larval density on sex determination in a pilot experiment but no effect in a second, more powerful experiment. While larval density did not affect the sex ratio of T. californicus, our sex-specific estimates of selection on adult body size will inform future models of adaptive ESD in this species and other copepods.

VL  - 128
IS  - 1
SP  - 373-384
AB  - In Drosophila melanogaster, inversion In(3R)Payne increases in frequency towards low latitudes and has been putatively associated with variation in size and thermal resistance, traits that also vary clinally. To assess the association between size and inversion, we obtained isofemale lines of inverted and standard karyotype of In(3R)Payne from the ends of the Australian D. melanogaster east coast cline. In the northern population, there was a significant association between In(3R)Payne and body size, with standard lines from this population being relatively larger than inverted lines. In contrast, the inversion had no influence on development time or cold resistance. We strengthened our findings further in a separate study with flies from populations from the middle of the cline as well as from the cline ends. These flies were scored for wing size and the presence of In(3R)Payne using a molecular marker. In females, the inversion accounted for around 30% of the size difference between cline ends, while in males the equivalent figure was 60%. Adaptive shifts in size but not in the other traits are therefore likely to have involved genes closely associated with In(3R)Payne. Because the size difference between karyotypes was similar in different populations, there was no evidence for coadaptation within populations.

VL  - 133

AB  - The behavioral responses of adult female and male Drosophila robusta and D. tripunctata to combined temperature and desiccation stress were compared on a temperature gradient [temperature range 14.7 to 27.7 C; vapor pressure deficit range 8 (cool end) to 19 g/m(3) (warm end)]. Drosophila tripunctata preferred significantly lower temperatures than D. robusta Because previous work showed D. tripunctata to have significantly lower adult viability than D. robusta at high temperature, this behavioral response is adaptive. Both species showed an acclimation response and preferred higher temperatures after a two day prior exposure to a high and stressful temperature (26 C). Adults from stocks which had been cultured a longer time in the laboratory preferred significantly different (higher) temperatures. Adults from older stocks also showed a significantly smaller acclimation response than flies from younger stocks. Both of these results are consistent with genetic changes having occurred in the stocks during the years of laboratory culturing.

TI  - Atmospheric Hypoxia Limits Selection for Large Body Size in Insects
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: The correlations between Phanerozoic atmospheric oxygen fluctuations and insect body size suggest that higher oxygen levels facilitate the evolution of larger size in insects. Methods and Principal Findings: Testing this hypothesis we selected Drosophila melanogaster for large size in three oxygen atmospheric partial pressures (aPO(2)). Fly body sizes increased by 15% during 11 generations of size selection in 21 and 40 kPa aPO(2). However, in 10 kPa aPO(2), sizes were strongly reduced. Beginning at the 12(th) generation, flies were returned to normoxia. All flies had similar, enlarged sizes relative to the starting populations, demonstrating that selection for large size had functionally equivalent genetic effects on size that were independent of aPO(2). Significance: Hypoxia provided a physical constraint on body size even in a tiny insect strongly selected for larger mass, supporting the hypothesis that Triassic hypoxia may have contributed to a reduction in insect size.

VL  - 7
IS  - 2
SP  - 313-322
AB  - Spatial and temporal trends and variation in life-history traits, including age and length at maturation, can be influenced by environmental and anthropogenic processes, including size-selective exploitation. Spawning adults in many wild Alaskan sockeye salmon populations have become shorter at a given age over the past half-century, but their age composition has not changed. These fish have been exploited by a gillnet fishery since the late 1800s that has tended to remove the larger fish. Using a rare, long-term dataset, we estimated probabilistic maturation reaction norms (PMRNs) for males and females in nine populations in two basins and correlated these changes with fishery size selection and intensity to determine whether such selection contributed to microevolutionary changes in maturation length. PMRN midpoints decreased in six of nine populations for both sexes, consistent with the harvest. These results support the hypothesis that environmental changes in the ocean (likely from competition) combined with adaptive microevolution (decreased PMRNs) have produced the observed life-history patterns. PMRNs did not decrease in all populations, and we documented differences in magnitude and consistency of size selection and exploitation rates among populations. Incorporating evolutionary considerations and tracking further changes in life-history traits can support continued sustainable exploitation and productivity in these and other exploited natural resources.

TI  - Mate choice in a polluted world: consequences for individuals, populations and communities
VL  - 374
IS  - 1781
AB  - Pollution (e.g. by chemicals, noise, light, heat) is an insidious consequence of anthropogenic activity that affects environments worldwide. Exposure of wildlife to pollutants has the capacity to adversely affect animal communication and behaviour across a wide range of sensory modalities-by not only impacting the signalling environment, but also the way in which animals produce, perceive and interpret signals and cues. Such disturbances, particularly when it comes to sex, can drastically alter fitness. Here, we consider how pollutants disrupt communication and behaviour during mate choice, and the ecological and evolutionary changes such disturbances can engender. We explain how the different stages of mate choice can be affected by pollution, from encountering mates to the final choice, and how changes to these stages can influence individual fitness, population dynamics and community structure. We end with discussing how an understanding of these disturbances can help inform better conservation and management practices and highlight important considerations and avenues for future research. This article is part of the theme issue 'Linking behaviour to dynamics of populations and communities: application of novel approaches in behavioural ecology to conservation'.

TI  - Occurrence of protandry in an aseasonal multivoltine moth: Implications for body-size evolution
VL  - 94
IS  - 4
SP  - 513-518
AB  - The behaviour of males emerging/maturing/arriving earlier than females is called protandry. Among insects, protandry has been reported only in those that are seasonal. This is probably because discrete generations, a requisite for protandry, are often reported in insects from seasonal environments. In what may be the first evidence for aseasonal multivoltine insects, we report protandry in Opisina arenosella, a tropical moth with discrete generations. The mean emergence time for males of Opisina was significantly earlier than that of females and the proportion of females in the population increased with progress in the flight period, suggesting protandry. Field-activity pattern of moths, monitored using light traps, showed that the peak activity period for males was earlier than that of females, a trend similar to that of the emergence pattern. Further, through laboratory studies on developmental biology, protandry was consistently observed over a range of temperatures (22-34 degrees C) normally prevalent in the study area, suggesting that protandry per se may not be a function of seasonality. We attribute protandry in Opisina to sexual selection for early male emergence. We discuss why protandry among aseasonal insects cannot result from selection for body size in males or females, and suggest that protandry and smaller male body size should not be related to availability of food. The evidences provided in this communication may open opportunities for exploring reproductive asynchrony in general, and protandry in particular, among aseasonal insects.

TI  - Genetic basis of thermal plasticity variation in Drosophila melanogaster body size
VL  - 14
IS  - 9
AB  - Body size is a quantitative trait that is closely associated to fitness and under the control of both genetic and environmental factors. While developmental plasticity for this and other traits is heritable and under selection, little is known about the genetic basis for variation in plasticity that can provide the raw material for its evolution. We quantified genetic variation for body size plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster by measuring thorax and abdomen length of females reared at two temperatures from a panel representing naturally segregating alleles, the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP). We found variation between genotypes for the levels and direction of thermal plasticity in size of both body parts. We then used a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) approach to unravel the genetic basis of inter-genotype variation in body size plasticity, and used different approaches to validate selected QTLs and to explore potential pleiotropic effects. We found mostly "private QTLs", with little overlap between the candidate loci underlying variation in plasticity for thorax versus abdomen size, for different properties of the plastic response, and for size versus size plasticity. We also found that the putative functions of plasticity QTLs were diverse and that alleles for higher plasticity were found at lower frequencies in the target population. Importantly, a number of our plasticity QTLs have been targets of selection in other populations. Our data sheds light onto the genetic basis of inter-genotype variation in size plasticity that is necessary for its evolution.

TI  - Effects of body size, trophic mode and larval habitat on Diptera stoichiometry: a regional comparison
VL  - 118
IS  - 4
SP  - 615-623
AB  - Ecological stoichiometry has emerged as a tool for exploring nutrient demand and evolutionary responses to nutrient limitation. Previous studies of insects have found predictable variability in stoichiometry, both in relation to body size and trophic mode, at ordinal levels or higher. Our study further examines the evolutionary and ecological lability in these traits by comparing the effects of body size, trophic mode (larval and adult) and larval habitat on the stoichiometry of insects within one order (Diptera). The study also expands on previous work by analyzing trophic mode both at coarse (detritivore, herbivore, predator) and fine (high- vs low- nutrient quality resources within trophic categories) scales and by comparing nutrient stoichiometry in two geographical regions, Sweden and Arizona. As predicted, adults feeding on nectar or pollen had the lowest body N content in the dataset. Additionally, for Diptera with predatory larvae, species low N diets had lower body N content than those with high N diets. However, body N content was not consistently lower for all species with low N resources, as species feeding on plant material were indistinguishable in stoichiometry from predators with high N diets. We suggest that these results emerge because larval resource exploitation is poorly understood in herbivorous Diptera species. Body P content for Swedish Diptera decreased with body size for all trophic modes, and the only difference among trophic modes was that blood feeders had higher P content than other groups. The regional comparison further showed that the allometry of body P content is a labile trait that may vary at regional scales, as there was no allometric scaling of body P content in the Arizona data set, in contrast to the Swedish data set. These results are not easily explained by existing theoretical frameworks, but instead point to a general context-dependence of P stoichiometry, which should now be a focus for future work.

TI  - Climatic correlates of body size in European tenebrionid beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)
VL  - 14
IS  - 2
SP  - 215-224
AB  - Tenebrionidae are one of the largest families of beetles and are known for their adaptations to hot and dry climates. An increase in body size also increases the volume/surface area ratio, which reduces transpiration, and hence water loss. If an increase in body size is an important adaptation in tenebrionids to cope with increasing aridity, we expect a correlation between body size and climatic gradients in the major tenebrionid clades. Alternatively, we can postulate that arid climates do not drive body size evolution, but rather select, from a wider fauna containing species of any size, those that have larger bodies. In this case we expect that drier regions will host faunas that contain, on average, larger species. To test the first hypothesis, we correlated inter-specific body size variation in the main tenebrionid clades with climatic gradients in Europe. We found only weak trends. To test the second hypothesis, we regressed mean body size of European country faunas against climatic characteristics. We found a strong increase in body size in southern faunas experiencing hot and dry climates. Therefore, increase in body size is not a major adaptation in tenebrionid evolution, but climate is an important filtering factor that determines a prevalence of larger species in southern Europe.

TI  - Brood parasitism correlates with the strength of spatial autocorrelation of life history and defensive traits in Magpies
VL  - 94
IS  - 6
SP  - 1338-1346
AB  - Environmental characteristics of neighboring locations are generally more similar than those of distant locations. Selection pressures due to parasitism and other environmental conditions shape life history traits of hosts; thus, the probability of parasitism should be associated with the strength of spatial autocorrelation in life history and defensive traits of their hosts. Here we test this hypothesis in three different subpopulations of Magpie (Pica pica) parasitized by the Great Spotted Cuckoo (Clamator glandarius) during three breeding seasons. In some of the years and study plots, we found evidence of positive spatial autocorrelations for clutch size and parasitism rate, but not for laying date. As predicted, brood parasitism was associated with the strength of these spatial autocorrelations. Magpies that bred close to each other in areas of high risk of parasitism responded similarly to experimental parasitic eggs. Moreover, an elevated risk of parasitism eliminated the spatial autocorrelation for clutch size, which became randomly distributed. We discuss possible mechanisms explaining these associations, which may have important consequences for estimating evolutionary responses of hosts to parasitic infections and, therefore, for epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary studies of host-parasite relationships.

TI  - Heat tolerance and gene expression responses to heat stress in threespine sticklebacks from ecologically divergent environments
VL  - 75
SP  - 88-96
AB  - Ectothermic animals like fishes are extremely dependent on temperature, as they are not able to change body temperature physiologically. When populations are found in isolated water bodies such as small lakes they will have to respond to stressful high temperatures by behavioral avoidance, phenotypic plasticity or microevolutionary change. We analyzed threespine sticklebacks from two large and two small lakes, representing different isolated populations. We determined maximum critical thermal limits (CTmax) and the associated gene expression responses in three heat shock (hsp60, hsp70, hsp90) and two key metabolic (idh2, fbp2) genes at ecologically relevant moderate heat stress (26 degrees C) as well as at the critical thermal limit (CTmax). CTmax showed slight variation across populations with no strong indication of local adaptation. Likewise, there was no strong evidence for local adaptation at the level of gene expression. The expression of the metabolic genes indicated a shift from aerobic towards anaerobic energy production with extreme heat stress. We conclude that threespine sticklebacks do not show severe stress during the warmest temperatures they are likely to encounter during current temperature regimes in Denmark, and following this show no sign of local adaptation even in small, isolated water bodies.

TI  - Speciation in modern marine bivalves (Mollusca: Bivalvia): Insights from the published record
VL  - 29
IS  - 1
SP  - 217-245
AB  - What can living marine bivalves tell us about speciation in the marine environment? Three sets of literature data on Recent marine bivalves are analyzed for insight into the mechanisms behind bivalve speciation processes. (1) A dataset of all marine bivalves described as new to science during the years 2000-2009 (381 species in 135 published papers) reveals that malacologists are still describing undiscovered biodiversity, based largely upon newly collected expedition material. New species include those of both large and small body size (0.86-500 mm, mean 28 mm), from 51 bivalve families, all oceanic basins, and a wide range of water depths (intertidal to 7,333 m, mean 444 m). External shell characters dominate the diagnoses but are increasingly supplemented by anatomical, molecular, and phylogenetic evidence. Endemism is low (2.6%) when stated as such although another 57% of species were described as (thus far) restricted to a particular geographic region, habitat, or both. High percentages of deep-water and otherwise (geographically or ecologically) restricted species, plus several case studies, suggest that physiological specialization, in the form of bathymetric limits, unique dietary adaptations, or host/symbiont associations, plays an important role in setting up barriers to gene flow in marine bivalves. (2) Bivalve species complexes [i.e., closely related, cryptic (possibly sibling) species with obscure morphological boundaries, or highly variable single species] also imply factors involved in ongoing speciation. Seven recently studied marine taxa are presented in which species complexes are either revealed or resolved by molecular data. Apparent barriers to gene flow are in most cases physiological (sympatric), or (in two cases) physical (allopatric), and in one case can be readily broken down by anthropogenic transport. (3) Two recent published phylogenetic analyses are discussed that show (a) disparately sized sister taxa with their synapomorphies (glochidia in Unionoidea; chemosymbiotic bacteria and mucus-tube feeding in Lucinoidea; cruciform muscle and long siphons in Tellinoidea; aortic bulb in Veneroidea) as recognized innovations that facilitated radiation of the more species-rich sister, and (b) polytomies in Lucinoidea that suggest rapid ongoing evolutionary change in several clades. Together these three sets of published data defeat the concept of a Marine Speciation Paradox in bivalves speciation clues are merely subtler in marine bivalves and most often act at the physiological, rather than physical, level.

TI  - Hydrodynamics of unsteady fish swimming and the effects of body size: Comparing the flow fields of fish larvae and adults
VL  - 203
IS  - 2
SP  - 193-206
AB  - Zebra danios (Brachydanio rerio) swim in a burst-and-coast mode. Most swimming bouts consist of a single tail flick and a coasting phase, during which the fish keeps its body straight. When visualising the flow in a horizontal section through the wake, the effects of the flow regime become apparent in the structure of the wake. In a two-dimensional, medio-frontal view of the flow, larvae and adults shed two vortices at the tail during the burst phase. These vortices resemble a cross section through a large-core vortex ring: two vortex cores packed close together with the central flow directed away from the fish. This flow pattern can be observed in larvae (body length approximately 4mm) at Reynolds numbers below 100 as well as in adult fish (body length approximately 35mm) at Reynolds numbers above 1000. Larval vortices differ from those of adult zebra danios mainly in their relatively wider vortex cores (higher ratio of core radius to ring radius) and their lower vortex circulation, Both effects result from the increased importance of viscosity on larval flows. During the coasting phase, larval and adult flows again differ because of the changing importance of viscosity. The high viscosity of the water causes large vortical flows adjacent to the larva's body. These regions of high vorticity represent the huge body of water dragged along by the larva, and they cause the larva to stop almost immediately after thrust generation ceases. No such areas of high vorticity are visible adjacent to adult zebra danios performing a comparable swimming manoeuvre. The rapid decrease in vortex circulation and the severe reduction in the coasting distance due to viscous drag contribute to the high cost that larvae - unlike adult fish face when using a burst-and-coast swimming style.

TI  - The proximate sources of genetic variation in body size plasticity: The relative contributions of feeding behaviour and development in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 135
AB  - Body size is a key life-history trait that influences many aspects of an animal's biology and is shaped by a variety of factors, both genetic and environmental. While we know that locally-adapted populations differ in the extent to which body size responds plastically to environmental conditions like diet, we have a limited understanding of what causes these differences. We hypothesized that populations could differ in the way body size responds to nutrition either by modulating growth rate, development time, feeding rate, or a combination of the above. Using three locally-adapted populations of Drosophila melanogaster from along the east coast of Australia, we investigated body size plasticity across five different diets. We then assessed how these populations differed in feeding behaviour and developmental timing on each of the diets. We observed population-specific plastic responses to nutrition for body size and feeding rate, but not development time. However, differences in feeding rate did not fully explain the differences in the way body size responded to diet. Thus, we conclude that body size variation in locally-adapted populations is shaped by a combination of growth rate and feeding behaviour. This paves the way for further studies that explore how differences in the regulation of the genetic pathways that control feeding behaviour and growth rate contribute to population-specific responses of body size to diet.

TI  - Craniovascular traits in anthropology and evolution: from bones to vessels
VL  - 95
SP  - 35-65
AB  - Many aspects of human biology can be reconstructed from skeletal and fossil remains. The endocranial vasculature runs through cerebral, connective, and bone elements, where it is influenced by the functional and structural relationships among these different components of the endocranial system. The imprints and traces of these vessels can be used to analyze the craniovascular features of extinct species or historical samples. These traits can supply information about evolutionary adaptation, the mutual relationships between and within populations, and individual life history. In particular, bioarchaeology considers individual morphological variants as indicators of temporal and spatial relatedness and population structure, whereas paleoanthropology studies functional aspects to consider evolutionary changes and phylogenetic processes. Forensic science can investigate the cause of death associated with craniovascular pathologies by relying on morphological variations for individual identification. In this review, we consider the imprints of middle meningeal vessels, dural venous sinuses, emissary veins, and diploic veins. We summarize the most relevant morphological and functional information about craniovascular features and their applications in retrospective anthropological and medical fields, as well as describing the methodological issues associated with the sampling and quantitative evaluation of these elusive vascular remnants imprinted in the cranial bones.

AB  - Our perspective highlights potentially important links between disparate fieldsbiological oceanography, climate change research, and experimental evolutionary biology. We focus on one important functional groupphotoautotrophic microbes (phytoplankton), which are responsible for approximate to 50% of global primary productivity. Global climate change currently results in the simultaneous change of several conditions such as warming, acidification, and nutrient supply. It thus has the potential to dramatically change phytoplankton physiology, community composition, and may result in adaptive evolution. Although their large population sizes, standing genetic variation, and rapid turnover time should promote swift evolutionary change, oceanographers have focussed on describing patterns of present day physiological differentiation rather than measure potential adaptation in evolution experiments, the only direct way to address whether and at which rate phytoplankton species will adapt to environmental change. Important open questions are (1) is adaptation limited by existing genetic variation or fundamental constraints? (2) Will complex ecological settings such as gradual versus abrupt environmental change influence adaptation processes? (3) How will increasing environmental variability affect the evolution of phenotypic plasticity patterns? Because marine phytoplankton species display rapid acclimation capacity (phenotypic buffering), a systematic study of reaction norms renders them particularly interesting to the evolutionary biology research community.

VL  - 277
IS  - 1690
SP  - 2059-2068
AB  - Wolbachia may act as a biological control agent for pest management; in particular, the Wolbachia variant wMelPop (popcorn) shortens host longevity and may be useful for dengue suppression. However, long-term changes in the host and Wolbachia genomes can alter Wolbachia spread and/or host effects that suppress disease. Here, we investigate the phenotypic effects of wMelPop in a non-native host, Drosophila simulans, following artificial transinfection approximately 200 generations ago. Long-term rearing and maintenance of the bacteria were at 19 degrees C in the original I-102 genetic background that was transinfected with the popcorn strain. The bacteria were then introgressed into three massbred backgrounds, and tetracycline was used to create uninfected sublines. The effect of wMelPop on longevity in this species appears to have changed; longevity was no longer reduced at 25 degrees C in some nuclear backgrounds, reflecting different geographical origin, selection or drift, although the reduction was still evident for flies held at 30 degrees C. Wolbachia influenced productivity and viability, and development time in some host backgrounds. These findings suggest that long-term attenuation of Wolbachia effects may compromise the effectiveness of this bacterium in pest control. They also emphasize the importance of host nuclear background on Wolbachia phenotypic effects.

TI  - An inversion supergene in Drosophila underpins latitudinal clines in survival traits
VL  - 31
IS  - 9
SP  - 1354-1364
AB  - Chromosomal inversions often contribute to local adaptation across latitudinal clines, but the underlying selective mechanisms remain poorly understood. We and others have previously shown that a clinal inversion polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster, In(3R)Payne, underpins body size clines along the North American and Australian east coasts. Here, we ask whether this polymorphism also contributes to clinal variation in other fitness-related traits, namely survival traits (lifespan, survival upon starvation and survival upon cold shock). We generated homokaryon lines, either carrying the inverted or standard chromosomal arrangement, isolated from populations approximating the endpoints of the North American cline (Florida, Maine) and phenotyped the flies at two growth temperatures (18 degrees C, 25 degrees C). Across both temperatures, high-latitude flies from Maine lived longer and were more stress resistant than low-latitude flies from Florida, as previously observed. Interestingly, we find that this latitudinal pattern is partly explained by the clinal distribution of the In(3R)P polymorphism, which is at similar to 50% frequency in Florida but absent in Maine: inverted karyotypes tended to be shorter-lived and less stress resistant than uninverted karyotypes. We also detected an interaction between karyotype and temperature on survival traits. As In(3R)P influences body size and multiple survival traits, it can be viewed as a supergene', a cluster of tightly linked loci affecting multiple complex phenotypes. We conjecture that the inversion cline is maintained by fitness trade-offs and balancing selection across geography; elucidating the mechanisms whereby this inversion affects alternative, locally adapted phenotypes across the cline is an important task for future work.

TI  - Climate warming and ectotherm body size - from individual physiology to community ecology
VL  - 27
IS  - 4
SP  - 991-1001
AB  - 1. Accumulating evidence suggests that the average body size of many organisms is declining in response to climate warming. This phenomenon has been suggested to represent a universal response to warming that may impose significant adverse effects on ecosystem functioning and services. 2. However, we do not have a thorough understanding of why body sizes are commonly declining, and why some organisms show the opposite response. Because ectotherms constitute the vast majority of organism biomass and about 99% of species worldwide, it is particularly important to understand how ectotherms respond to a warming climate. 3. This review discusses the underlying physiological mechanisms of changes in ectotherm body size and addresses observed responses within a broad ecological context at different levels of organization, from individuals to communities, particularly in aquatic systems. 4. Warming-induced responses in average body size are not only determined by changes in rates of individual growth and development, but also mediated through size-dependent feed-backs at the population level, as well as competitive and predatory interactions within the community. Emergent properties at higher organizational levels have already been observed in both experimental and natural systems. 5. Various approaches will be required for enhancing our knowledge about the importance of such processes in natural systems. These include controlled semi-natural experiments and phylogenetic comparisons as well as statistical models of time-series data and theoretical models linking climate effects at the individual, population and community levels. 6. Understanding causes of observed changes in organism body sizes and how these depend on the ecological context is essential for improving our predictions and the management of ecosystems in the face of a warming climate.

TI  - Size-abundance rules? Evolution changes scaling relationships between size, metabolism and demography
VL  - 22
IS  - 9
SP  - 1407-1416
AB  - Body size often strongly covaries with demography across species. Metabolism has long been invoked as the driver of these patterns, but tests of causal links between size, metabolism and demography within a species are exceedingly rare. We used 400 generations of artificial selection to evolve a 2427% size difference in the microalga Dunaliella tertiolecta. We repeatedly measured size, energy fluxes and demography across the evolved lineages. Then, we used standard metabolic theory to generate predictions of how size and demography should covary based on the scaling of energy fluxes that we measured. The size dependency of energy remained relatively consistent in time, but metabolic theory failed to predict demographic rates, which varied unpredictably in strength and even sign across generations. Classic theory holds that size affects demography via metabolism - our results suggest that both metabolism and size act separately to drive demography and that among-species patterns may not predict within-species processes.

TI  - Role of dissolved oxygen on behavioural and stress response of golden mahseer, Tor putitora
VL  - 42
IS  - 2
SP  - 235-239
AB  - Aim: The study assessed the effect of different concentration of dissolved oxygen in Tor putitora, commonly known as Golden mahseer on physiological activities of juveniles regarding their growth performance, behavioural response and stress. Methodology: Twenty-seven acclimatized fingerlings of Tor putitora were selected for the experiment, in which nine were exposed to each group of dissolved oxygen treatment (Natural, 6.76 mg l(-1), low 4.81mg l(-1) and high, 10.20 mg ml(-1)) in aquaria (60x30x30) cm. The body weight (g), cortisol concentration (ng g(-1)) and behaviour profile was assessed using the Ethovision XT-13 software (Noldus, Info Tech, Wageningen, The Netherlands). Results: The average value of body weight (g), cortisol concentration (ng g(-1)) and all behavioural profiles of Tor putitora showed a significant difference at P<0.05. The average concentration of cortisol was lower in high oxygen dissolved exposed juveniles as compared to other oxygen treatment groups. Interpretation: High oxygen content in water bodies reduces the stress level and stereotyped behavioural responses of fishes. These novel data, on cognitive swimming pattern in Tor putitora, is quite important for enhancement of production and maintaining the fish health issues.

AB  - Latitudinal geographic variation in Drosophila melanogaster is pervasive. Parallel dines in traits such as body size, egg size, ovariole number, and development time have been found on several continents throughout the world. However, a dine in starvation resistance and fat content in D. melanogaster has so far been found only in India. Here we investigate starvation resistance and fat content in 10 populations from South America, in which dines in body size, egg size, and development time have previously been found. We find no evidence for a dine in starvation resistance or fat content in South America. We therefore suggest that the dine in starvation resistance in India may have evolved in response to specific climatic variation found only in India.

TI  - Size selection from fishways and potential evolutionary responses in a threatened Atlantic salmon population
VL  - 33
IS  - 7
SP  - 1004-1015
AB  - The evolutionary effects of harvest on wild fish populations have been documented around the world; however, sublethal selective pressures can also cause evolutionary changes in phenotypes. For migratory fishes, passage facilities may represent instances of nonlethal selective pressure. Our analysis of 6years of passage data suggests that certain fish passage facilities on the Penobscot River have been exerting selective pressure against large-bodied, anadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). At the second and third dams in the river, a 91-cm salmon was 21%-27% and 12%-16% less likely to pass than a 45-cm salmon, respectively. Fish size positively influences egg survival and number and is a heritable trait. Therefore, in a wild-reproducing population, exclusion of large fish from spawning areas may have population-level impacts. In the Penobscot River, most returning adults derive from a hatchery program that collects its broodstock after passing the first dam in the river. Analysis of fork lengths of salmon returning to the Penobscot River from 1978 to 2012 provided mixed support for evolution of size at maturity in different age classes in a pattern that may be expected from interactions with conservation hatchery operations. Additionally, slow-maturing and iteroparous individuals that represent the largest salmon size classes were essentially lost from the population during that time, and Penobscot River fish have shorter fork lengths at maturity than Atlantic salmon in undammed systems.

TI  - The consistency of individual differences in behaviour: temperature effects on antipredator behaviour in garter snakes
VL  - 57
SP  - 445-451
AB  - Differences among individuals are necessary for natural selection to occur. The extent and expression of these differences can limit the power of selection to cause evolutionary change. When individuals inconsistently express a trait, selection is less powerful. Labile traits such as behaviour are most likely to be inconsistent in their expression, because of the substantial role of environmental factors in their immediate expression. Previous work has focused on the consistency, or repeatability, of individual behaviour across different environments or within a single environment; little is known about how repeatability within an environment changes across environments. To address this issue, we examined the consistency of antipredator behaviour in juvenile garter snakes in different thermal environments. A group of 59 laboratory-born garter snakes, Thamnophis ordinoides, was repeatedly assayed for sprint speed, distance crawled, and number of reversals performed during flight and antipredator display. Antipredator display showed very little variation and could not be analysed. Each individual was tested three times at each of three temperatures chosen to span the range of temperatures that snakes encounter in the field (15, 22.5, 30 degrees C). Temperature had substantial effects on the average expression of each behaviour;snakes crawled more slowly, for shorter distances, and performed fewer reversals at cooler temperatures. Individuals showed significant consistency in their behaviour, and this consistency of expression was not affected by temperature. (C) 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

TI  - Transition to annual life history coincides with reduction in cell cycle speed during early cleavage in three independent clades of annual killifish
VL  - 5
AB  - Background: Annual killifishes inhabit temporary ponds and their embryos survive the dry season encased in the mud by entering diapause, a process that arrests embryonic development during hostile conditions. Annual killifishes are present within three clades distributed in Africa (one East and one West of the Dahomey gap) and South America. Within each of these phylogenetic clades, a non-annual clade is sister taxon to a annual clade and therefore represent an example of convergent evolution. Early cleavage of teleost embryos is characterized by a very fast cell cycle (15-30 minutes) and lack of G(1) and G(2) phases. Here, we decided to investigate rates of early cleavage in annual killifishes. In addition, we specifically tested whether also annual killifish embryos lack G(1) and G(2) phases. Results: We used time lapse brightfield microscopy to investigate cell division kinetics during the first developmental stages of annual- and non-annual species belonging to the three different phylogenetic clades. Annual killifishes of all three clades showed cleavage times significantly longer when compared to their non-annual sister taxa (average 35 min vs. average 75 min). Using FUCCI fluorescent imaging of the cell cycle after microinjection in the annual species Nothobranchius furzeri, we demonstrate that the first 5 division are synchronous and do not show a G(1) phase. Cell cycle synchronization is lost after the 5th cleavage division. Conclusions: Our results show, for the first time, that cell cycle rate during cleavage, a trait thought to be rather evolutionary conserved can undergo convergent evolutionary change in response to variations in life-history.

TI  - Effect of temperature on the reproductive success, developmental rate and brood characteristics of Ips sexdentatus (Boern.)
VL  - 19
IS  - 1
SP  - 23-33
AB  - Global warming is predicted to enhance the development rate and increase the number of generations in multivoltine insects. For secondary forest pests, such as the pine bark beetle Ips sexdentatus, the resulting increase in population level could trigger more frequent outbreaks. However, this positive effect could be outweighed by a temperature-dependent decrease in offspring quality. To test these hypotheses, we carried out a laboratory rearing experiment with maritime pine logs at six temperature regimes reproducing hourly fluctuations and averaging 12-25.5 degrees C. We estimated the thermal requirements for a complete development of the beetle and the number of offspring per female. The offspring quality was estimated using three traits: dry body weight, elytra length and lipid content. The minimum and maximum developmental threshold were estimated at 10.9 and 36 degrees C, respectively, and the thermal requirements for complete development were estimated at 517 degree-days. We predicted a mean of two generations per year in southwestern France, although an additional generation could occur during warmer years. The number of offspring increased exponentially with temperature, although we observed a curvilinear response of offspring traits to temperature, with optima at 15-18 degrees C. This suggests that there are trade-offs between productivity and quality of offspring. Global warming is therefore likely to result in higher number of generations of I. sexdentatus per year, with larger broods but of reduced fitness at high temperatures.

TI  - Climatic influences on the evolution of early Homo?
VL  - 78
IS  - 5
SP  - 365-388
AB  - The nature of the human fossil record is less than ideal for the generation of precise correlations between environmental variables and patterns of evolution in specific lineages. Nonetheless, a critical look at what can and cannot be said from individual fossil morphology and the correlation of specific environmental proxies with specific hominin fossils may lead to a greater understanding of the degree of certainty with which we should embrace environmental hypotheses for the evolution of Homo. Climate shifts have been implicated in both the origin of the genus and its dispersal from Africa. Here, I consider three areas in which a climatic influence has been posited to explain evolutionary shifts in the genus Homo: the origin and dispersal of the genus from Africa; geography, climate and body size in early Homo, and the influence of climate-induced sea level rise on morphological isolation in H. erectus. Each of the data sets is far from ideal, and interpretations of each of the data sets are fraught with issues of equifinality. Of the three hypotheses discussed, the clearest link is seen between latitudinal variation (and presumably temperature) and body size in H. erectus. Similarly, climate-induced sea level change seems a reasonable isolating mechanism to explain the pattern of cranial variation in later Asian H. erectus, but the distribution could also reflect incompletely sampled clinal variation. Alternatively, only equivocal support is found for the influence of climate on the differentiation of H. erectus from H. habilis (as proxied by body/brain size scaling), and therefore the dispersal of the genus Homo cannot be as clearly linked to changes in body size and shape as it has been in the past. These preliminary data suggest that an emphasis on understanding local adaptation before looking at global (and specific) level change is critical to elucidating the importance of climatic factors on the evolution of the genus Homo.

VL  - 25
IS  - 6
SP  - 571-579
AB  - The empirical study of interpopulation variation in life history and other fitness traits has been an important approach to understanding the ecology and evolution of organisms and gaining insight into possible sources of variation. We report a quantitative analysis for variations of five life history traits (larval developmental time, adult body weight, adult lifespan, age at first reproduction, total fecundity) and flight capacity among populations of Epiphyas postvittana originating from four localities in Australia and one in New Zealand. These populations were compared at two temperatures (15 degrees and 25 degreesC) after being maintained under uniform laboratory conditions for 1.5 generations, so that the relative role of genetic divergence and phenotypic plasticity in determining interpopulation variation could be disentangled. Genetic differentiation between populations was shown in all measured traits, with the greatest divergence occurring in developmental time, fecundity and adult body size. However, these traits were highly sensitive to changes in environmental temperatures; and furthermore, significant interactions between population and temperature occurred in all traits except for flight capacity of female moths. Thus, phenotypic plasticity may be another cause of interpopulation variation. The interpopulation variation for some measured traits was apparently related to climatic differences found where the populations originated. Individuals of the populations from the warmer climates tended to develop more slowly at immature stages, producing smaller and less fecund moths but with stronger flight capacity, in comparison to those from the cooler regions. It seems, therefore, that natural populations off. postvittana have evolved different strategies to cope with local environmental conditions.

TI  - Body size and food-web interactions mediate species range shifts under warming
VL  - 289
IS  - 1972
AB  - Species ranges are shifting in response to climate change, but most predictions disregard food-web interactions and, in particular, if and how such interactions change through time. Predator-prey interactions could speed up species range shifts through enemy release or create lags through biotic resistance. Here, we developed a spatially explicit model of interacting species, each with a thermal niche and embedded in a size-structured food-web across a temperature gradient that was then exposed to warming. We also created counterfactual single species models to contrast and highlight the effect of trophic interactions on range shifts. We found that dynamic trophic interactions hampered species range shifts across 450 simulated food-webs with up to 200 species each over 200 years of warming. All species experiencing dynamic trophic interactions shifted more slowly than single-species models would predict. In addition, the trailing edges of larger bodied species ranges shifted especially slowly because of ecological subsidies from small shifting prey. Trophic interactions also reduced the numbers of locally novel species, novel interactions and productive species, thus maintaining historical community compositions for longer. Current forecasts ignoring dynamic food-web interactions and allometry may overestimate species' tendency to track climate change.

AB  - 1. Divergent selection was undertaken in a Rhode Island Red population for residual food intake, measured in males and females, using mass selection. 2. In the absence of a control line, selection response during 14 generations was estimated by the within-year divergence between lines. 3. The direct response in residual food intake was found to be significant in both sexes, the divergence reaching almost three phenotypic standard deviations in each sex. 4. Significant correlated responses were obtained for food efficiency; it was improved in the low residual food intake line. Shank length, wattle length and rectal and comb temperature showed higher values in the high line, suggesting an increased heat production or dissipation. Inconsistent changes were observed for other egg production traits.

TI  - Variation in morphological characters of two invasive leafminers, Liriomyza huidobrensis and L. sativae, across a tropical elevation gradient
VL  - 11
AB  - Changes in morphological traits along elevation and latitudinal gradients in ectotherms are often interpreted in terms of the temperature-size rule, which states that the body size of organisms increases under low temperatures, and is therefore expected to increase with elevation and latitude. However other factors like host plant might contribute to spatial patterns in size as well, particularly for polyphagous insects. Here elevation patterns for trait size and shape in two leafminer species are examined, Liriomyza huidobrensis (Blanchard) (Diptera: Agromyzidae) and L. sativae Blanchard, along a tropical elevation gradient in Java, Indonesia. Adult leafminers were trapped from different locations in the mountainous area of Dieng in the province of Central Java. To separate environmental versus genetic effects, L. huidobrensis originating from 1378 m and 2129 m ASL were reared in the laboratory for five generations. Size variation along the elevation gradient was only found in L. huidobrensis and this followed expectations based on the temperature-size rule. There were also complex changes in wing shape along the gradient. Morphological differences were influenced by genetic and environmental effects. Findings are discussed within the context of adaptation to different elevations in the two species.

TI  - Body size and cell size in Drosophila: the developmental response to temperature
VL  - 44
IS  - 11
SP  - 1081-1089
AB  - In Drosophila, like most ectotherms, development at low temperature reduces growth rate but increases final adult size. Cultures were shifted from 25 degrees C to low (16.5 degrees C) or to high (29 degrees C) temperature at regular intervals through larval and pupal stages, and the flies of both sexes showed an increase or decrease, respectively, in the size of thorax, wing and abdominal tergite. Size changes in the wing blade resulted from changes in the size of the epidermal cells (with only a small increase in cell number in males reared at low temperature). The temperature-shifts became less effective as they were made at successively later developmental stages, demonstrating a cumulative effect of temperature on adult size. The thorax and wing develop From the same imaginal disc, with most cell division occurring in larval stages, but they differ in timing of temperature sensitivity, which extends only to pupariation or into the late pupal stage, respectively. Growth of the adult abdomen occurs largely after pupariation but its size is temperature-sensitive through both larval and pupal stages. We discuss growth control in Drosophila and the likely effects of temperature on food assimilation, growth efficiency and allocation of nutrients to the production of different tissues.

TI  - Empirical evidence for competition-driven semelparity in wild medaka
VL  - 58
IS  - 3
SP  - 371-383
AB  - Metabolic theory predicts that maintenance rate increases faster with animal body size than food intake rate, such that the critical resource density R* at which ingested energy exactly covers maintenance requirements increases with body size. Small-sized (low R*) juveniles may thus exclude their larger-sized (high R*) parents in resource competition, resulting in apparent semelparous life histories and non-overlapping generations. However, empirical support for such a competition-driven semelparity (CDS) remains scarce. Here, we report a high consistency of cohort dynamics with CDS in wild medaka (Oryzias latipes). As predicted by the theory, there was a strong juvenile-adult diet overlap, and all individuals died after reproduction as semelparous age-1 adults, synchronous with a rapid somatic growth of age-0 juveniles into the adult stage and with dropping abundances of zooplankton food resources. In addition to the theory, we found evidence for increased reproductive allocation under food stress, translating into immune depression and elevated parasite prevalence. Therefore, CDS in medaka emerges both from intercohort competitive exclusion and from food-dependent energy reallocation from maintenance to reproduction, the later presumably representing an adaptive response to the former. The literature data show that the strengths of both intercohort competition and reproductive allocation increase at higher temperatures in many ectotherms, pointing to climate warming as a potentially powerful magnifier of CDS in the wild.

VL  - 153

SP  - 1775-1787
AB  - Body size dines in Drosophila melanogaster have been documented in both Australia and South America, and may exist in Southern Africa. We crossed flies from the northern and southern ends of each of these dines to produce F-1, F-2, and first backcross generations. Our analysis of generation means for wing area and wing length produced estimates of the additive, dominance, epistatic, and maternal effects underlying divergence within each dine. For both females and males of all three dines, the generation means were adequately described by these parameters, indicating that linkage and higher order interactions did not contribute significantly to wing size divergence. Marked differences were apparent between the dines in the occurrence and magnitude of the significant genetic parameters. No dine was adequately described by a simple additive-dominance model, and significant epistatic and maternal effects occurred in most, but not all, of the dines. Generation variances were also analyzed. Only one dine was described sufficiently by a simple additive variance model, indicating significant epistatic, maternal, or linkage effects in the remaining two dines. The diversity in genetic architecture of the dines suggests that natural selection has produced similar phenotypic divergence by different combinations of gene action and interaction.

TI  - Correlated responses to selection on body size in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 74
IS  - 1
SP  - 43-54
AB  - Correlated responses to artificial selection on body size in Drosophila melanogaster were investigated, to determine how the changes in size were produced during development. Selection for increased thorax length was associated with an increase in larval development time, an extended growth period, no change in growth rate, and an increased critical larval weight for pupariation. Selection for reduced thorax length was associated with reduced growth rate, no change in duration of larval development and a reduced critical larval weight for pupariation. In both lines selected for thorax length and lines selected for wing area, total body size changed in the same direction as the artificially selected trait. In large selection lines of both types, the increase in size was achieved almost entirely by an increase in cell number, while in the small lines the decrease in size was achieved predominantly by reduced cell size, and also by a reduction in cell number. The implications of the results for evolutionary-genetic change in body size in nature are discussed.

TI  - Exposure to mild temperatures decreases overwintering larval survival and post-diapause reproductive potential in the rice stem borer Chilo suppressalis
VL  - 90
IS  - 1
SP  - 117-125
AB  - The rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis Walker, overwinters as larvae that undergo facultative diapause in response to short day lengths. This study tested the hypothesis that exposure to warm temperature reduces the survivorship of overwintering larvae, thereby eventually decreasing the outbreak in the following year. We exposed overwintering larvae to various temperature treatments of 1, 5 and 10 A degrees C and natural conditions with a daily mean temperature of 9.3 A degrees C for 5-6 months. As C. suppressalis undergoes three complete generations and a partial fourth generation each year, we systematically compared the survival rates and the body weights of overwintering larvae, the dynamics of diapause termination (i.e., pupation rate), and the post-diapause reproductive potential, as indicated by pupal weight and female fecundity among the treatments. In all treatments, we observed a gradual decline in the survival rate of overwintering larvae, starting in October for the third generation and in November for the fourth generation and continuing until the following May. Temperature treatments significantly affected the body weights of overwintering larvae. Simulated warmer winter temperatures also resulted in similar declines in pupation rate, pupal weight and post-diapause reproductive potential. It was the relatively lower temperatures of 1 and 5 A degrees C, rather than the warm temperature of 10 A degrees C, that was propitious to the survival of overwintering larvae and increased post-diapause reproduction potential in the following year. Therefore, exposure to warm temperatures is detrimental to overwintering populations of C.suppressalis, which provides useful information for monitoring their population dynamics in practice. Warmer temperatures are generally considered favorable for increasing the overwintering survival of insects in some climatic areas; however, this is unlikely to be a universal effect. The influence of temperatures during overwintering upon survival and post-diapause reproductive potential in C. suppressalis was tested; the survivorship was actually lower at the higher temperature. The results suggest that mild warm temperatures near the threshold temperature for post-diapause development decreased the survival of overwintering larvae and the post-diapause reproductive potential in the rice stem borer C. suppressalis.

TI  - Does selection for stress resistance lower metabolic rate?
VL  - 78
IS  - 3
SP  - 828-837
AB  - Environmental stress reduces the fitness of organisms, and in this manner may shape species distribution and evolutionary change. Ecologists have long been interested in physiological mechanisms that reduce the effects of stress and result in improved fitness. It has previously been suggested (1) that selection for stress resistance will bring about the evolution of lower standard metabolic rates and (2) that organisms with increased stress resistance will have a lower metabolic rate during stressful conditions, compared to stress-sensitive organisms. We have tested these hypotheses using replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Desiccation and starvation-selected populations and their controls, as well as populations selected for postponed senescence and their short-generation controls were examined. The metabolic rate of each selected and control population was measured under three different environmental conditions: (1) desiccation (no food or water), (2) starvation (water present, no food), and (3) food condition (food and water present). The carbohydrate and lipid content of each population were also measured. All selected and control populations lowered their metabolic rates when measured under starving conditions compared to food conditions. The metabolic rates of flies under desiccating conditions did not differ from food conditions regardless of selection treatment. When comparing the mass-specific metabolic rates of stress-selected populations to their controls, stress-selected populations had a significantly lower mass-specific metabolic rate in all cases, regardless of the environmental conditions under which the measurements were made. However, once the mass of nonmetabolizing lipid and carbohydrate was accounted for and metabolic rate was expressed in carbohydrate-lipid free mass, selected populations did not differ significantly in metabolic rate from control populations, regardless of the environmental condition under which the measurements were made. We conclude that in the case of D. melanogaster, resistance to stress does not require the evolution of a lower metabolic rate. Instead, the accumulation of metabolic resources such as carbohydrate and lipid may be important for resistance to specific forms of stress.

TI  - Manipulating plant phylogenetic diversity for green roof ecosystem service delivery
VL  - 11
IS  - 10
SP  - 2014-2024
AB  - Plant species and functional trait diversity have each been shown to improve green roof services. Species and trait differences that contribute to ecosystem services are the product of past evolutionary change and phylogenetic diversity (PD), which quantifies the relatedness among species within a community. In this study, we present an experimental framework to assess the contribution of plant community PD for green roof ecosystem service delivery, and data from one season that support our hypotheses that PD would be positively correlated with two services: building cooling and rainwater management. Using 28 plant species in 12 families, we created six community combinations with different levels of PD. Each of these communities was replicated at eight green roofs along an elevation gradient, as well as a ground level control. We found that the minimum and mean roof temperature decreased with increasing PD in the plant community. Increasing PD also led to an increase in the volume of rainwater captured, but not the proportion of water lost via evapotranspiration 48 hr following the rain event. Our findings suggest that considering these evolutionary relationships could improve functioning of green infrastructure and we recommend that understanding how to make PD (and other measures of diversity) serviceable for plant selection by practitioners will improve the effectiveness of design and ecosystem service delivery. Lastly, since no two green roof sites are the same and can vary tremendously in microclimate conditions, our study illustrates the importance of including multiple independent sites in studies of green roof performance.

TI  - Experimental Evolution Shows Body Size Decrease in Response to Hypoxia, with a Complex Effect on Plastic Size Response to Temperature
AB  - There is a scientific debate whether oxygen concentration may be a factor driving the pattern of size decrease at higher temperature. Central to this debate is the fact that oxygen availability relative to demand for living organisms decreases with increasing temperature. We examined whether rotifers Lecane inermis exposed to hypoxic conditions would evolve smaller sizes than rotifers exposed to normoxic conditions, using experimental evolution with the same fluctuating temperature but differentiated by three regimes of oxygen availability: normoxia, hypoxia throughout the whole thermal range, and hypoxia only at the highest temperature. Immediately after the six-month experiment (more than 90 generations), we tested the plasticity of size responses to temperature in three post-evolution groups, and we related these responses to fitness. The results show that normoxic rotifers had evolved significantly larger sizes than two hypoxic rotifer groups, which were similar in size. All three groups displayed similar plastic body size reductions in response to warming over the range of temperatures they were exposed to during the period of experimental evolution, but they showed different and complex responses at two temperatures below this range. Any type of plastic response to different temperatures resulted in a similar fitness pattern across post-evolution groups. We conclude that (i) these rotifers showed a genetic basis for the pattern of size decrease following evolution under both temperature-dependent and temperature-independent hypoxia; and (ii) plastic body size responds consistently to temperatures that are within the thermal range that the rotifers experienced during their evolutionary history, but responses become more noisy at novel temperatures, suggesting the importance of evolutionary responses to reliable environmental cues.

TI  - Neutral and adaptive genomic signatures of rapid poleward range expansion
VL  - 24
IS  - 24
SP  - 6163-6176
AB  - Many species are expanding their range polewards, and this has been associated with rapid phenotypic change. Yet, it is unclear to what extent this reflects rapid genetic adaptation or neutral processes associated with range expansion, or selection linked to the new thermal conditions encountered. To disentangle these alternatives, we studied the genomic signature of range expansion in the damselfly Coenagrion scitulum using 4950 newly developed genomic SNPs and linked this to the rapidly evolved phenotypic differences between core and (newly established) edge populations. Most edge populations were genetically clearly differentiated from the core populations and all were differentiated from each other indicating independent range expansion events. In addition, evidence for genetic drift in the edge populations, and strong evidence for adaptive genetic variation in association with the range expansion was detected. We identified one SNP under consistent selection in four of the five edge populations and showed that the allele increasing in frequency is associated with increased flight performance. This indicates collateral, non-neutral evolutionary changes in independent edge populations driven by the range expansion process. We also detected a genomic signature of adaptation to the newly encountered thermal regimes, reflecting a pattern of countergradient variation. The latter signature was identified at a single SNP as well as in a set of covarying SNPs using a polygenic multilocus approach to detect selection. Overall, this study highlights how a strategic geographic sampling design and the integration of genomic, phenotypic and environmental data can identify and disentangle the neutral and adaptive processes that are simultaneously operating during range expansions.

TI  - Altitudinal variation for senescence in Melanoplus grasshoppers
VL  - 111
IS  - 3
SP  - 357-364
AB  - We describe differences in senescence among populations of grasshoppers that occur along an altitudinal gradient in the Sierra Nevada, California. Experimental males from five populations of the Melanoplus sanguinipes/devastator sibling species complex were reared in each of two thermal culture conditions from eggs of field-caught females. In both culture conditions, we measured the survival of adult cohorts from each population. Differences in the physiological capacity to survive in a sheltered, common environment reveal genetic differences in underlying rates of senescence, providing maternal effects do not affect the rate of aging in offspring. At each temperature, mortality rates increased as a function of age, which indicates that senescence occurs under laboratory conditions. Within each culture condition, cohorts originating from low-elevation populations had greater survival than did cohorts from high elevations. Variation in body size along the altitudinal gradient did not account for the differences in survival. We suggest that high-elevation populations have evolved accelerated senescence as a direct or an indirect result of selection on reproductive schedules, which are potentially truncated by severe winter conditions at the elevated sites.

TI  - Time to Evolve? Potential Evolutionary Responses of Fraser River Sockeye Salmon to Climate Change and Effects on Persistence
VL  - 6
IS  - 6
AB  - Evolutionary adaptation affects demographic resilience to climate change but few studies have attempted to project changes in selective pressures or quantify impacts of trait responses on population dynamics and extinction risk. We used a novel individual-based model to explore potential evolutionary changes in migration timing and the consequences for population persistence in sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in the Fraser River, Canada, under scenarios of future climate warming. Adult sockeye salmon are highly sensitive to increases in water temperature during their arduous upriver migration, raising concerns about the fate of these ecologically, culturally, and commercially important fish in a warmer future. Our results suggest that evolution of upriver migration timing could allow these salmon to avoid increasingly frequent stressful temperatures, with the odds of population persistence increasing in proportion to the trait heritability and phenotypic variance. With a simulated 2 degrees C increase in average summer river temperatures by 2100, adult migration timing from the ocean to the river advanced by similar to 10 days when the heritability was 0.5, while the risk of quasi-extinction was only 17% of that faced by populations with zero evolutionary potential (i.e., heritability fixed at zero). The rates of evolution required to maintain persistence under simulated scenarios of moderate to rapid warming are plausible based on estimated heritabilities and rates of microevolution of timing traits in salmon and related species, although further empirical work is required to assess potential genetic and ecophysiological constraints on phenological adaptation. These results highlight the benefits to salmon management of maintaining evolutionary potential within populations, in addition to conserving key habitats and minimizing additional stressors where possible, as a means to build resilience to ongoing climate change. More generally, they demonstrate the importance and feasibility of considering evolutionary processes, in addition to ecology and demography, when projecting population responses to environmental change.

VL  - 62

SP  - 139-145
AB  - Ectothermal vertebrates regulate their body temperature within definite limits to maintain physiological processes at their optimal levels. Among others, food processing and absorption are strongly temperature-dependent. Deficiency of adequate temperatures limits ectotherms in growth and maintenance. On the other hand, thermoregulatory behavior is costly and should be constrained by many factors. Using artificial thermal gradients (26-44 degrees C), we measured temperature preferences of 10 spiny-tailed agamas (Uromastyx acanthinura) in controlled indoor experiment. Each lizard could choose place in the terrarium before and after feeding. Then, temperature preferences during pre-feeding and post-feeding periods were compared. We found significant increase of preferred temperature after feeding. Detailed view revealed that there is consistent influence of body size: bigger lizards maintained higher temperature during the whole experiment. We hypothesize that bigger potential predation risk on smaller lizards due to their size would force them to choose less optimal conditions.

TI  - Sexual conflict in wing size and shape in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 23
IS  - 9
SP  - 1989-1997
AB  - Intralocus sexual conflict occurs when opposing selection pressures operate on loci expressed in both sexes, constraining the evolution of sexual dimorphism and displacing one or both sexes from their optimum. We eliminated intralocus conflict in Drosophila melanogaster by limiting transmission of all major chromosomes to males, thereby allowing them to win the intersexual tug-of-war. Here, we show that this male-limited (ML) evolution treatment led to the evolution (in both sexes) of masculinized wing morphology, body size, growth rate, wing loading, and allometry. In addition to more male-like size and shape, ML evolution resulted in an increase in developmental stability for males. However, females expressing ML chromosomes were less developmentally stable, suggesting that being ontogenetically more male-like was disruptive to development. We suggest that sexual selection over size and shape of the imago may therefore explain the persistence of substantial genetic variation in these characters and the ontogenetic processes underlying them.

VL  - 9
IS  - 18
SP  - 10305-10316
AB  - Body size has been shown to decrease with increasing temperature in many species, prompting the suggestion that it is a universal ecological response. However, species with complex life cycles, such as holometabolous insects, may have correspondingly complicated temperature-size responses. Recent research suggests that life history and ecological traits may be important for determining the direction and strength of temperature-size responses. Yet, these factors are rarely included in analyses. Here, we aim to determine whether the size of the bivoltine butterfly, Polyommatus bellargus, and the univoltine butterflies, Plebejus argus and Polyommatus coridon, change in response to temperature and whether these responses differ between the sexes, and for P. bellargus, between generations. Forewing length was measured using digital specimens from the Natural History Museum, London (NHM), from one locality in the UK per species. The data were initially compared to annual and seasonal temperature values, without consideration of life history factors. Sex and generation of the individuals and mean monthly temperatures, which cover the growing period for each species, were then included in analyses. When compared to annual or seasonal temperatures only, size was not related to temperature for P. bellargus and P. argus, but there was a negative relationship between size and temperature for P. coridon. When sex, generation, and monthly temperatures were included, male adult size decreased as temperature increased in the early larval stages, and increased as temperature increased during the late larval stages. Results were similar but less consistent for females, while second generation P. bellargus showed no temperature-size response. In P. coridon, size decreased as temperature increased during the pupal stage. These results highlight the importance of including life history factors, sex, and monthly temperature data when studying temperature-size responses for species with complex life cycles.

TI  - TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT PRODUCTION OF MARINE COPEPODS - A GLOBAL SYNTHESIS
VL  - 140
IS  - 2
SP  - 201-242
AB  - Estimating the production of marine copepods depends on measuring two key variables: biomass and growth rate. The major difficulty in estimating production of marine copepods and other zooplankton has been the inability to obtain precise, rapid measurements. In practice the variability in measurement of biomass greatly exceeds that in growth rate. It is shown here that individual growth rates of copepods can be accurately estimated from data on generation times and the weights of eggs and adults. Analysis of 181 separately published estimates of generation time for 33 species of copepods at environmental temperatures ranging from -1.7-degrees to 30.7-degrees-C shows that temperature alone explains more than 90% of the variance in growth rate. Temperature dependence of growth rate transcends species differences. Weight-specific growth rate appears to be independent of body size. We hypothesize that food may not be limiting to growth in nature; the impression that food is limiting may be due to sampling at the wrong scales. Another possible cause of the apparent maximum growth rates of copepods in nature is predation mortality, which could selectively remove slower-growing individuals from the population. The temperature-dependent model developed here predicts the phenomenon of decreasing body size with increasing environmental temperature, often observed for single species of copepods. A method is suggested for making more accurate estimates of secondary production by using modern instrumentation to make quasi-synoptic measurements of biomass and temperature and using the temperature-dependent model to estimate individual growth rates.

VL  - 146
IS  - 3
SP  - 881-890
AB  - Field-collected Drosophila melanogaster from 19 populations in Eastern Australia were measured for body size traits, and the measurements were compared with similar ones on flies from the same populations reared under standard laboratory conditions. Wild caught flies were smaller, and latitudinal trends in size were greater. Reduced size was caused by fewer cells in the wing, and the steeper dine by greater variation in cell area. The reduction in size in field-collected flies may therefore have been caused by reduced nutrition, and the steeper dine may have been caused by an environmental response to latitudinal variation in temperature. No evidence was found for evolution of size traits in response to laboratory culture. The magnitude of phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature of development time, body size, cell size and cell number was examined for six of the populations, to test for latitudinal variation in plasticity. All characters were plastic in response to temperature. Total development time showed no significant latitudinal variation in plasticity, although larval development time showed a marginally significant effect, with most latitudinal variation at intermediate rearing temperatures. Neither thorax length nor wing size and its cellular components showed significant latitudinal variation in plasticity.

VL  - 26
IS  - 3
SP  - 701-714
AB  - Fecundity selection, acting on traits enhancing reproductive output, is an important determinant of organismal body size. Due to a unique mode of reproduction, mating success and fecundity are positively correlated with body size in both sexes of male-pregnant Syngnathus pipefish. As male pipefish brood eggs on their tail and egg production in females occurs in their ovaries (located in the trunk region), fecundity selection is expected to affect both sexes in this species, and is predicted to act differently on body proportions of males and females during their development. Based on this hypothesis, we investigated sexual size dimorphism in body size allometry and vertebral numbers across populations of the widespread European pipefish Syngnathus typhle. Despite the absence of sex-specific differences in overall and region-specific vertebral counts, male and female pipefish differ significantly in the relative lengths of their trunk and tail regions, consistent with region-specific selection pressures in the two sexes. Male pipefish show significant growth allometry, with disproportionate growth in the brooding tail region relative to the trunk, resulting in increasingly skewed region-specific sexual size dimorphism with increasing body size, a pattern consistent across five study populations. Sex-specific differences in patterns of growth in S. typhle support the hypothesis that fecundity selection can contribute to the evolution of sexual size dimorphism.

TI  - Mixed models for the relationship between latitude, temperature, and human postcranial form
AB  - Objectives The global distribution of human body proportions has long been attributed to thermoregulatory adaptation to climate. However, latitude has been the most common proxy for climate across ecogeographic studies. If thermoregulation was driving post-cranial evolution, temperature should provide a better explanation for the morphological patterns observed than latitude, which encompasses temperature and other variables, as well as major events in human migration history. We investigate relationships between latitude, temperature, and postcranial form by distinguishing the strength of these potential selective factors from population structure. Materials & Methods Quantitative genetic multivariate mixed models were used to estimate morphological effects associated with latitude, minimum temperature, and maximum temperature using osteometric data from 31 globally distributed groups, geographically matched genetic data from 54 groups, and geographically matched temperature data. Results Dimensions reflecting body size (bi-iliac breadth/femoral head size) show independent evolutionary responses from limb lengths. In models including population history, only dimensions reflecting body size show evidence of response to directional selection. Model results indicate that selection in response to minimum temperature has shaped evolution in body breadth and femoral head size. Models for limb length evolution accounting for population history match results of prior studies, but do not indicate responses to temperature-driven directional selection. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of considering multiple potential sources of selection within a multivariate evolutionary model, demonstrating the possible synergistic effects of selective pressures. These results complicate the classic thermoregulatory model of human postcranial evolution and show that factors other than temperature may have shaped post-cranial evolution in humans.

TI  - Male Drosophila melanogaster have higher mating success when adapted to their thermal environment
VL  - 19
IS  - 6
SP  - 1894-1900
AB  - Adaptation to new environments is a well-documented phenomenon. Individuals from populations maintained in a particular environment for multiple generations tend to be better able to survive and/or reproduce in that environment than their ancestors or other individuals adapted to alternative environments. A third major component of fitness, mating success, has not been well studied in replicated populations under selection in divergent environments. In this study, we used mating trials to compare the mating success of male Drosophila melanogaster adapted for 10 years to two different temperatures, 18 and 25 degrees C. In competition for female partners, males had significantly higher mating success at their adapted temperature compared with males adapted to a different temperature. These results are consistent with the notion that those mutations favoured by natural selection also tend to be favoured by sexual selection.

TI  - Spirulina powder as a feed supplement to enhance abalone growth
VL  - 17
AB  - Spirulina powder is used as a functional supplement in animal feeds for enhanced growth and reduced mortality. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Spirulina powder-supplemented feeds on abalone growth after 93 days and 125 days of culture. Spirulina particles were attached to the surfaces of abalone feed granules by mixing to prepare Spirulina powder-supplemented abalone feeds. The morphology, components, and thermal stability of the granules were analyzed. Abalone body weight and shell characteristics (size, pigmentation, morphology, and components) were also assessed for evaluating abalone growth. Protein expression patterns in abalones were monitored. Spirulina particles were detected on the surfaces of Spirulina powder-supplemented abalone feed granules, which were not modified in size and shape after attachment. The Spirulina powder-supplemented feed granules included organic materials and minerals based on C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, and Ca. They were thermally stable up to 20 degrees C. Abalones fed Spirulina powder-supplement at 0.7 % showed significantly increased body weight and shell size after 125-day culture. Shell pigmentation and morphology were also improved. The shell contained C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, and Fe. Abalone proteins were clearly expressed at 75-100 kD and 150-250 kD. These results suggest that Spirulina powder has a promising potential as a feed supplement to be used in next-generation animal feeds for enhanced growth. The study protocol applied in the present work can be extended to the development of other animal feeds.

TI  - Ecophysiological and life-history adaptations of Gammarus balcanicus (Schaferna, 1922) in a sinking-cave stream from Western Carpathians (Romania)
VL  - 139
AB  - Freshwater gammarids are known to colonise occasionally sinking-cave streams, providing contrasting morphological, life-history and ecophysiological adaptations compared to their surface conspecifics. In this study, a subterranean and a surface population of the species Gammarus balcanicus was surveyed for one year in a sinking-cave stream from the Western Carpathians (Romania). The results showed that the cave-dwelling population comprised individuals that were significantly larger compared to their surface conspecifics, had larger body-size at sexual maturity and that the females produced fewer, but larger eggs, compared to the population situated outside the cave. The trophic position and the omnivory were significantly higher for the cave-dwelling compared to surface population and the elemental imbalance for C:P molar ratios lower, but similar for C:N. However, the subterranean population did not present troglomorphic characters or longer lifespan as known for other cave-surface paired crustaceans. This, together with the rather extensive hydrological connection of the habitats, suggests active gene-flow between populations and similar response to seasonality for body-size distributions, indicating that the observed ecophysiological and life-history differences are rather the consequence of phenotypic plasticity than the result of genetic adaptation.

TI  - What factors shape female phenotypes of a poleward-moving damselfly at the edge of its range?
VL  - 112
IS  - 3
SP  - 556-568
AB  - Individuals at the expansion front during a climate-driven range expansion are expected to differ phenotypically from those individuals in core populations. Little information is known about the joint, potentially opposing, effects of stressful conditions at the range edge versus evolutionary changes that take place during range expansion in shaping the phenotypes at the range front. We investigated the effect of range expansion on immune function, body condition and flight-related morphology (flight muscle ratio, wing loading, and wing aspect ratio) of field-collected females of the poleward-moving damselfly Coenagrion scitulum. Individuals at the expansion front had a lower body condition, which indicated more stressful conditions at the range edge. Despite the counteracting effect of the shorter growth season, the higher flight muscle ratios at the expansion front indicated a strong selection for dispersal ability during range expansion. The current study suggests that models need to incorporate the interplay of stressful conditions and evolutionary processes at the expansion front to arrive at robust predictions of future species distributions under global warming.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 112, 556-568.

TI  - Biotic stoichiometric controls on the deep ocean N : P ratio
VL  - 4
IS  - 3
SP  - 353-367
AB  - We re-examine what controls the deep ocean N:P ratio in the light of recent findings that the C:N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton varies with growth rate, nutrient and light limitation, species and phylum, and that N-2-fixation may be limited by Fe, temperature and/or light in large parts of the world ocean. In particular, we assess whether a systematic change in phytoplankton stoichiometry can alter the deep ocean N:P ratio. To do this we adapt recent models to include non-Redfieldian stoichiometry of phytoplankton and restriction of N-2-fixers to a fraction of the surface ocean. We show that a systematic change in phytoplankton C:N:P can alter the concentrations of NO3 and PO4 in the deep ocean but cannot greatly alter their ratio, unless it also alters the N: P threshold for N-2-fixation. This occurs if competitive dynamics set the N:P threshold for N-2-fixation, in which case it remains close to the N: P requirement of non-fixers (rather than that of N-2-fixers) and consequently so does the deep ocean N:P ratio. Then, even if N-2-fixers are restricted to a fraction of the surface ocean, they reach higher densities there, minimising variations in deep ocean N: P. Theoretical limits on the N:P requirements of phytoplankton suggest that whilst the deep ocean has been well oxygenated (i.e. since the Neoproterozoic, with the possible exception of Oceanic Anoxic Events), its N:P ratio is unlikely to have varied by more than a factor of two in either direction. Within these bounds, evolutionary changes in phytoplankton composition, and increased phosphorus weathering due to the biological colonisation of the land surface, are predicted to have driven long-term changes in ocean composition.

TI  - Spatially varying selection shapes life history clines among populations of Drosophila melanogaster from sub-Saharan Africa
VL  - 28
IS  - 4
SP  - 826-840
AB  - Clines in life history traits, presumably driven by spatially varying selection, are widespread. Major latitudinal clines have been observed, for example, in Drosophila melanogaster, an ancestrally tropical insect from Africa that has colonized temperate habitats on multiple continents. Yet, how geographic factors other than latitude, such as altitude or longitude, affect life history in this species remains poorly understood. Moreover, most previous work has been performed on derived European, American and Australian populations, but whether life history also varies predictably with geography in the ancestral Afro-tropical range has not been investigated systematically. Here, we have examined life history variation among populations of D.melanogaster from sub-Saharan Africa. Viability and reproductive diapause did not vary with geography, but body size increased with altitude, latitude and longitude. Early fecundity covaried positively with altitude and latitude, whereas lifespan showed the opposite trend. Examination of genetic variance-covariance matrices revealed geographic differentiation also in trade-off structure, and Q(ST)-F-ST analysis showed that life history differentiation among populations is likely shaped by selection. Together, our results suggest that geographic and/or climatic factors drive adaptive phenotypic differentiation among ancestral African populations and confirm the widely held notion that latitude and altitude represent parallel gradients.

TI  - Effect of introducing the naked neck gene in a line selected for low residual feed consumption on performance in temperate or subtropical environments
VL  - 87
IS  - 7
SP  - 1320-1327
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of combining the naked neck gene with a genetic background that has been optimized for feed efficiency of laying hens at moderate temperature. In 1997, the naked neck gene was introduced into a line selected for low residual feed intake. In 2003, after 6 generations of introgression, 8 males and 56 females heterozygous for the NA*NA mutation were used to generate all 3 genotypes ( NA*N/NA*N, NA*NA/NA*N, NA*NA/NA*NA), in 2 hatches, for rearing in Taiwan and France, respectively, at 3-wk intervals. Growth performance, anatomical traits, laying traits, and feed efficiency were recorded in each country. In addition, comb and rectal temperatures were measured in Taiwan. Performance was generally lower and mortality of laying hens was higher in Taiwan ( 11%) than in France ( 1%). Genotype x environment interactions were rare: genotype x environment was observed only for body weight at 10 wk of age and was close to significance for egg weight. The laying performance was significantly decreased in Taiwan by about 25%. The naked neck genotype had a negative effect on body weight and a positive effect of clutch length and egg weight. It also affected heat dissipation traits such as wattle length and rectal and surface temperature measurements. There was a clear additive and negative effect of the NA*NA mutation on rectal temperature. Feed intake and residual feed intake were increased in the homozygous carriers of the NA*NA mutation, which may improve heat tolerance of the low residual feed consumption (R-) line. Feed efficiency tended to be better in NA*NA/NA*NA hens in both environments. Thus, the introduction of the NA*NA mutation in the R- background appeared to be favorable from the viewpoint of feed efficiency, but it did not improve laying performance in a subtropical environment. Other factors than temperature, such as diet composition and lighting regimen, may be involved.

CV F-1 progeny exhibited smaller body size, enhanced survival during spring, and higher autogeny rates than SJV F-1 progeny; however upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, immature developmental rates and survivorship, and adult life table parameters were relatively similar for both strains. Mosquitoes from both sites exhibited midsummer changes in immature developmental rates and survivorship, adult wing length, life expectancy at emergence, and generation time. These data indicated that temperature may select for both spatial and temporal changes in mosquito biology.

VL  - 287

SP  - 38-45
AB  - This study evaluated whether indicators of metabolic capacity of cod white muscle differ along the length of the body, whether this variation persists over a large range of body sizes, and whether the allometry of metabolic capacities is similar along the length of the body. We examined the maximal activities of two glycolytic enzymes, phosphofructokinase (PFK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a mitochondrial enzyme, cytochrome C oxidase (CCO), and the biosynthetic enzyme nucleotide diphosphate kinase (NDPK). All enzymes examined showed significant size dependence, which was generally apparent in all regions. The activity of glycolytic enzymes increased with size, whereas that of CCO and NDPK decreased with size. For PFK and LDH, the size dependence decreased caudally, whereas for CCO and NDPK it was strongest in the caudal sample. For each size range, the activities of PFK, LDH, and CCO were higher in the last third of the body than in the middle or just behind the head. In contrast, NDPK activity was higher just behind the head than at the middle or in the last third of the body, suggesting that nuclear proliferation is more rapid in this zone. The high capacity for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation in the caudal region suggests that increases in mass-specific ATP output are advantageous in this relatively thin section of the body.

TI  - Epigenetic modifications of brain and behavior: Theory and practice
VL  - 59
IS  - 3
SP  - 393-398
AB  - Evolutionary change is a product of selection. Selection operates on the phenotype, and its consequences are manifest in representation of the genotype in successive generations. Of particular interest to both evolutionary and behavioral biologists is the newly emerging field of epigenetics and behavior. Two broad categories of epigenetic modifications must be distinguished. Context-dependent epigenetic change can be observed if the environmental factors that bring about the epigenetic modification persists (e.g., the frequency and quality of maternal care modifying the brain and future tehavior of the offspring each generation). Because the environment induces epiallelic change, removing the causative factor can reverse a context-dependent epigenetic state. Germline-dependent epigenetic change occurs when the epigenetic imprint is mediated through the germline. Such effects are independent of the causative agent and there is no evidence at present that a germline-dependent epigenetic state can be reversed. Finally, only germline-dependent epigenetic modifications can be truly transgenerational. Although an individual's life history is progressive and continuous, it might usefully be viewed as the cumulation of divisions: each period emerging from what has gone before and, at the same time, setting the stage for what follows. These life history stages are somewhat arbitrary, with many traits spanning conventional divisions, but each period tends to have its own characteristic ethologies and particular contribution to neural and behavioral phenotypes. To understand how these episodes 'fit' together, it is necessary to deconstruct early life events and study each period both in its' own right and how it interacts with the preceding and subsequent stages. Lastly, it seems intuitive that germline- and context-dependent epigenetic modifications interact, resulting in the individual variation observed in behaviors, but until now this hypothesis has never been tested experimentally.

TI  - Support for the climatic variability hypothesis depends on the type of thermal plasticity: lessons from predation rates
VL  - 129
IS  - 7
SP  - 1040-1050
AB  - Plastic and evolutionary changes in traits related to biotic interactions are crucial for the local persistence of populations under global warming. Yet, how acute and developmental thermal plasticity evolve and shape predation rates has been poorly studied, especially in the context of latitude-driven thermal evolution. A powerful predictive framework is given by the climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) stating that thermal plasticity and acclimation capacity evolve to be higher in high-latitude populations because these are exposed to higher thermal seasonal variability. We tested the CVH for predation rates and evaluated if the support for the CVH depended on the type of plasticity and acclimation metric. We examined effects of developmental temperature (20 and 24 degrees C) and acute changes in mean and extreme temperatures (20, 24 and 32 degrees C) on the predation rates of high- and low-latitude populations of a predatory aquatic insect, the damselflyIschnura elegans. We documented opposing and interactive effects between developmental and acute temperatures, which urges caution when using thermal performance curves to forecast the impact of global warming on biotic interactions. Predation rates were higher in low-latitude than high-latitude predators, especially at the warmer developmental and test temperatures, suggesting thermal adaptation to the higher low-latitude temperatures. The latitudinal patterns in acute and developmental plasticities differed, providing mixed support for the CVH. Moreover, there was no latitudinal pattern in post-acclimation thermal sensitivity, indicative of perfect thermal compensation in predators from both latitudes. Strikingly, the acclimation capacity leading to perfect thermal compensation was ~6 times higher in high-latitude than in low-latitude predators. Our study provides new insights into the climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) by documenting that its support is critically dependent on the type of plasticity and acclimation metric used.

AB  - As the data rate of high performance internet router systems continues to increase, meeting the challenges for high speed electrical performance drives ASIC packaging technology to higher silicon integration, higher I/O density, and enhanced thermal power dissipation. The requirement of high Si integration with the increasing needs for embedded SRAM and DRAM drives for the increase in Si die size and the demand for 90nm technology. Die size up to 20x20mm is pushing advanced packaging substrate technology. High I/O density also drives the needs for finer bump pitch and larger package body size, which present challenges for package and card level assembly. Moreover, high availability telecommunication products demand excellent reliability not only at the ASIC package and card assembly level, but also at the final product system level.

TI  - Adaptability of Two Soybean Aphid Species to High Diurnal Temperatures
AB  - The local temperature in the Harbin region of northeast China has been rising, with temperatures above 27 degrees C often being recorded. The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines (Matsumura) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and foxglove aphid, Aulacorthum solani (Kaltenbach) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), are important pests in soybeans in the region, which face great survival pressure due to rising temperatures. In this study, A. glycines and A. solani were reared at thermoperiods with diurnal temperatures of 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, and 37 degrees C, nocturnal temperature of 20 degrees C, 70% +/- 5% relative humidity, and a photoperiod of 14:10 (L: D) hr. Diurnal thermoperiod 25 degrees C was used as control. Some life characteristics of the aphids were assessed. The adaptation of A. solani to high diurnal temperatures was found to be worse than that of A. glycines. Aphis glycines could develop and reproduce successfully at diurnal temperatures of 27-35 degrees C, whereas A. solani could only develop and reproduce at 27-29 degrees C. At diurnal thermoperiods at 25 degrees C, adult lifespan of A. solani was as long as that of A. glycines. When diurnal temperatures increased from 27 to 31 degrees C, adult lifespan of A. solani were shorter than those of A. glycines. At diurnal thermoperiods at 25 and 27 degrees C, the body sizes of A. solani adults were larger than those of A. glycines. At diurnal thermoperiods at 29 and 31 degrees C, the body size of A. solani adults were as large as those of A. glycines. Our results provide important information on the survival, development, and reproduction of A. glycines and A. solani exposed to temperatures above 27 degrees C, which is important for evaluating the adaptability of aphids to high temperatures and predicting their dynamics in soybeans in northeast China, where the local environmental temperature continues to rise.

VL  - 89
SP  - 79-84
AB  - Ectotherms compensate for variation in thermal environments in diverse behavioural ways. Despite widely occurring sex differences in morphology and physiology, the sex-specific thermal sensitivity of behavioural traits has received little attention. We tested the interactive influence of sex and environmental temperature on predator-induced responses in the Alpine newt, Ichthyosaura alpestris. Escape decisions and the duration of flight were less thermally sensitive in females than in males. Males ran more slowly than females. Both sexes required more stimuli at intermediate temperatures than at other temperatures. We conclude that temperature and sex are important determinants of a newt's defensive repertoire. The sex-specific thermal sensitivity of defensive responses suggests both asymmetric selection regimes and an impact of environmental change in newt populations.

TI  - Increased susceptibility to repeated freeze-thaw cycles in Escherichia coli following long-term evolution in a benign environment
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: In order to study the dynamics of evolutionary change, 12 populations of E. coli B were serially propagated for 20,000 generations in minimal glucose medium at constant 37 degrees C. Correlated changes in various other traits have been previously associated with the improvement in competitive fitness in the selective environment. This study examines whether these evolved lines changed in their ability to tolerate the stresses of prolonged freezing and repeated freeze-thaw cycles during adaptation to a benign environment. Results: All 12 lines that evolved in the benign environment for 20,000 generations are more sensitive to freeze-thaw cycles than their ancestor. The evolved lines have an average mortality rate of 54% per daily cycle, compared to the ancestral rate of 34%. By contrast, there was no significant difference between the evolved lines and their ancestor in mortality during prolonged freezing. There was also some variability among the evolved lines in susceptibility to repeated freeze-thaw cycles. Those lines that had evolved higher competitive fitness in the minimal glucose medium at 37 degrees C also had higher mortality during freeze-thaw cycles. This variability was not associated, however, with differences among lines in DNA repair functionality and mutability. Conclusion: The consistency of the evolutionary declines in freeze-thaw tolerance, the correlation between fitness in glucose medium at 37 degrees C and mortality during freeze-thaw cycles, and the absence of greater declines in freeze-thaw survival among the hypermutable lines all indicate a trade-off between performance in minimal glucose medium at 37 degrees C and the capacity to tolerate this stress. Analyses of the mutations that enhance fitness at 37 degrees C may shed light on the physiological basis of this trade-off.

VL  - 12

AB  - Environmental effects on body size are of widespread ecological and economic importance but our understanding of these effects has been obscured by an apparent paradox. Life history analysis suggests that it is adaptive for adults to emerge smaller if reared in conditions that slow down juvenile growth. However, whereas smaller adults emerge if growth is limited by food availability, the reverse is usually observed if growth is limited by temperature. The resolution of this apparent paradox may be that the response of adult size to temperature is adaptive, but is constrained by a trade-off that can be understood in terms of von Bertalanffy's classic theory of growth. Alternatively, the response may be the unavoidable consequence of a fundamental relationship between cell size and temperature.

VL  - 209
IS  - 1
SP  - 185-200
AB  - Local selective regimes and limited dispersal may contribute to genetic differentiation of life history traits among local populations of the marine amphipod Jassa marmorata Holmes. Reciprocal transplant experiments were used to explore growth rate variation and to determine the effects of environment versus source population (genotype) on the observed variation. Gravid females were collected at two sites in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. Hatchlings were measured and reared in field enclosures following a split brood design. Measurements of total body size (length in mm) were made initially and at two additional time intervals. Experiments were conducted in spring and summer of 1994 and again in the spring of 1995. Growth curve analysis was used to test the effects of two independent variables, source population and environment, on growth rate. Results of the spring 1994 experiment revealed both source population (genetic) and environmental effects on growth rate. Individuals collected from and grown at Point Judith attained the highest body size. In the summer of 1994, there were no significant effects of environment or source population on growth rates. In the spring of 1995 only environmental effects were detected; animals grew faster at Point Judith. These results suggest that divergence between populations may occur with respect to growth rate but this divergence is not consistent interannually. An alternative mechanism, phenotypic plasticity, may also be employed by these amphipods to cope with environmental heterogeneity. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The impact of environmental stress factors on genetic variation in animal populations is considered. It is tentatively concluded that genetical variability of populations generally increases in stressful environments. The exposure to stressful factors result in an increase of recombination and mutation rates. In quantitative traits, on which the review is focused, stress often leads to an increase in the genetic component of variation. Experiments on Drosophila demonstrated that the effect of stress on genetic variation is trait-specific. The possible role of stress factors in adaptation and evolution of populations is discussed.

TI  - Androgenic control of male-typical behavior, morphology and sex recognition is independent of the mode of sex determination: A case study on Lichtenfelder's gecko (Eublepharidae: Goniurosaurus lichtenfelderi)
VL  - 72
SP  - 49-59
AB  - Previous work on lizards has shown that many sexually dimorphic traits depend on testosterone (T), but the details of this control can vary among species. Here, we tested the role of T on the expression of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits in Lichtenfelder's gecko (Goniurosaurus lichtenfelderi), from the lizard family Eublepharidae notable for interspecific variation in sexually dimorphic traits and the mode of sex determination. Experiments included three groups of males (intact control, surgically castrated, castrated with T replacement) and two groups of females (intact control, T supplemented). In males, castration caused reductions in 1) the size of hemipenes, 2) offensive aggression, 3) male sexual behavior in a neutral arena, 4) activity of predoacal glands, and 5) loss of male chemical cues for sex recognition. These reductions were not observed in castrated males with T replacement. Interestingly, castrated males performed sexual behavior in their home cages, which shows that the effect of T depends on the environmental context. Notably, tail vibration, previously reported as a courtship behavior in other eublepharids, is displayed by males of G. lichtenfelderi during interactions with conspecifics of both sexes, suggesting an evolutionary shift in the meaning of this signal. In females, T induced growth of hemipenes and male-typical courtship but did not induce precloacal pore activity, aggression, or mounting. In comparison to previous reports on Eublepharis macularius, our results indicate that effects of T do not depend on the mode of sex determination. Further, our results extend our understanding of the complexity of control of male traits and illustrate how lability in the effects of T can be a general mechanism causing evolutionary changes in the components of suites of functionally correlated traits.

TI  - The importance of pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection promoting adaptation to increasing temperatures
VL  - 67
IS  - 3
SP  - 321-327
AB  - Global temperatures are increasing rapidly affecting species globally. Understanding if and how different species can adapt fast enough to keep up with increasing temperatures is of vital importance. One mechanism that can accelerate adaptation and promote evolutionary rescue is sexual selection. Two different mechanisms by which sexual selection can facilitate adaptation are pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection. However, the relative effects of these different forms of sexual selection in promoting adaptation are unknown. Here, we present the results from an experimental study in which we exposed fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster to either no mate choice or 1 of 2 different sexual selection regimes (pre- and postcopulatory sexual selection) for 6 generations, under different thermal regimes. Populations showed evidence of thermal adaptation under precopulatory sexual selection, but this effect was not detected in the postcopulatory sexual selection and the no choice mating regime. We further demonstrate that sexual dimorphism decreased when flies evolved under increasing temperatures, consistent with recent theory predicting more sexually concordant selection under environmental stress. Our results suggest an important role for precopulatory sexual selection in promoting thermal adaptation and evolutionary rescue.

TI  - Historical warming consistently decreased size, dispersal and speciation rate of fish
VL  - 11
IS  - 9
SP  - 787-+
AB  - There is ongoing debate as to whether fish body size will decrease with global warming and how these changes may impact dispersal ability and speciation rate. Theory predicts that, under warmer temperatures, fish grow to a smaller size, undergo a reduction in dispersal ability and increase speciation rates. However, evaluations of such predictions are hampered owing to the lack of empirical data spanning both wide temporal and geographical scales. Here, using phylogenetic methods, we show that smaller clupeiform fish (anchovies and herrings) occurred historically in warmer waters, moved the shortest distances at low speed and displayed the lowest speciation rates. Furthermore, fish moved faster and evolved rapidly under higher rates of temperature change but these historical rates are far lower than current warming rates. Our results predict a future where smaller clupeiform fish that have reduced ability to move will be more prevalent; this, in turn, may reduce future speciation. Phylogenetic data over the past similar to 150 million years show smaller fish occurred in warmer waters, moved shorter distances at low speed and had low speciation rates. Fish moved faster and evolved quicker under periods of rapid change, with implications for movement and survival under climate change.

AB  - there is very little doubt among the scientific community that human induced greenhouse gas emission has contributed significantly to the climate change. Most significant changes in the earth's temperature have been noticed since the advent of the industrial era in the late 1800s. Over the past 100 years, the earth's surface has warmed by approximately 0.6 degrees C. Human activities such as the large-scale burning of fossil fuels to operate power plants and automobiles are releasing greenhouse gases like CO2 into the atmosphere at an unprecedented rate. The anthropogenic climate change and its impact on a wide variety of life-forms in various ecosystems. The pole ward and altitudinal shifts in the distribution of various organisms (especially butterflies), the spread of pathogen-driven diseases, the bleaching of coral reefs, and the changes in community and tropic dynamics in various marine and terrestrial ecosystems. The Earth's climate is changing and the impacts are already being felt by biodiversity and wildlife habitats across the planet. Individual sessions of Global Climate Change and Biodiversity covered a cross-section of the planet's major biomes: forests, marine, high latitudes and montane, managed landscapes and coasts. The impact of climate change on natural systems was shown to vary in different ecosystems in different parts of the world. But climate change is all-pervading and will have an increasing influence on the life systems of the Earth. The rich variety of life on Earth has always had to deal with a changing climate. The need to adapt to new patterns of temperature and rainfall has been a major influence on evolutionary changes that produced the plant and animal species we see today. Variation in the climate is perfectly compatible with the survival of ecosystems and their functions, on which we each depend for the essentials of life. There are several reasons why plants and animals are less able to adapt to the current phase of global warming. One is the very rapid pace of change: it is anticipated that over the next century. Many species will simply be unable to adapt quickly enough to the new conditions, or to move to regions more suited to their survival.

TI  - Complex patterns of phenotypic plasticity: Interactive effects of temperature during rearing and oviposition
VL  - 86
IS  - 4
SP  - 924-934
AB  - Temperature profoundly affects growth and life history traits in ectothermic animals through selection (i.e., genetic) and through direct effects on the phenotype (i.e., nongenetic/plasticity). We examined the effects of rearing temperature (24 degrees, 30 degrees, and 36 degrees C) on adult body size and development time and the interactive effects of temperature experienced during rearing and oviposition on several life history traits (age-at-first-reproduction, fecundity, egg size, egg development, and egg hatching) in two populations of the seed beetle, Stator limbatus, collected at different elevations. The higher elevation population was larger and matured sooner than the low-elevation population when raised at the lower temperature, but the reverse was true at the higher temperature suggesting that these populations have adapted to local temperature. There were interactions between the effects of rearing temperature and oviposition temperature for age-at-first-reproduction, fecundity, egg development, egg hatching, and two composite measures of fitness, generating complex reaction norms. The most dramatic example of this was a large maternal effect on egg hatching; females raised at low temperature produced eggs that had substantially reduced hatching when laid at hi h temperature. Our experimental design also allowed us to explore 0 9 the adaptive significance of acclimation. Beetles reared at intermediate or low temperature had the highest fitness at Multiple oviposition temperatures. There was little support for the "beneficial acclimation hypothesis," which predicts that beetles should have higher fitness at the temperature at which they were reared; acclimation had only a small effect on fitness. This study shows that temperature-mediated plasticity can be complex, but these complex patterns can yield new insights into the evolution of phenotypic plasticity.

TI  - Technology options for next-generation high pin count RF packaging
SP  - 1000-+
AB  - Three packaging technologies are evaluated for application to next-generation RF products, particularly the Radio and MAC/Baseband components for WLAN-cards. The trends for WLAN card packaging point to a need for ever-increasing pin counts in smaller form factors. at an affordable cost. The three technologies considered are leadframe, patternable leadframe and ball grid array (BGA). These technologies are evaluated based upon performance (thermal, mechanical and electrical), manufacturability and design attributes. Data from modeling and assembly builds are presented. The key point of the paper is that increasing on-die integration for functional-rich, multiple-input / multiple output (MIMO)/multi-mode RF products is driving a need to investigate emerging package technologies.. This paper presents a data based evaluation of three front-runner technologies: leadframe body-size extensions, patternable leadframe technologies and BGA. The key unique contributions of this paper are a demonstration of the manufacturability of higher pin count (150+), larger leadframe and patternable leadframe packages than have been previously been demonstrated and a test-vehicle, design-of-experiments comparison of the three leading technologies considered for next-generation RF product packaging.

VL  - 67

SP  - 438-452
AB  - Geographical patterns of morphological variation have been useful in addressing hypotheses about environmental adaptation. In particular, latitudinal clines in phenotypes have been studied in a number of Drosophila species. Some environmental conditions along latitudinal clinesfor example, temperaturealso vary along altitudinal clines, but these have been studied infrequently and it remains unclear whether these environmental factors are similar enough for convergence or parallel evolution. Most clinal studies in Drosophila have dealt exclusively with univariate phenotypes, allowing for the detection of clinal relationships, but not for estimating the directions of covariation between them. We measured variation in wing shape and size in D. melanogaster derived from populations at varying altitudes and latitudes across sub-Saharan Africa. Geometric morphometrics allows us to compare shape changes associated with latitude and altitude, and manipulating rearing temperature allows us to quantify the extent to which thermal plasticity recapitulates clinal effects. Comparing effect vectors demonstrates that altitude, latitude, and temperature are only partly associated, and that the altitudinal shape effect may differ between Eastern and Western Africa. Our results suggest that selection responsible for these phenotypic clines may be more complex than just thermal adaptation.

TI  - Trans- and Within-Generational Developmental Plasticity May Benefit the Prey but Not Its Predator during Heat Waves
VL  - 11
IS  - 8
AB  - Simple Summary Heat waves can have fatal effects on arthropods such as insects and mites since their heat tolerance is often lower than the diurnal maximum temperatures during heat waves. Plastic modifications by the parents, however, can rapidly result in favorable adaptations in offspring traits. This question was investigated by using a prominent natural enemy/pest couple in biological control, the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis and its prey, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae. We exposed both species separately to extreme or mild heat waves during their juvenile development, a vital phase of arthropod life, for two generations and assessed various fitness-relevant parameters of the offspring generation. Under extreme heat waves, adult body sizes of predator and prey males and prey females were insensitive, when they derived from parents also reared under extreme heat waves. Irrespective of their origin, offspring reached earlier adulthood under extreme heat waves. In general, prey benefitted more from parental modifications compared to the predator. However, further investigations are needed to verify whether these changes affect the interactions between the predators and their prey to an extent that it may jeopardize biological control during extreme heat waves. Theoretically, parents can adjust vital offspring traits to the irregular and rapid occurrence of heat waves via developmental plasticity. However, the direction and strength of such trait modifications are often species-specific. Here, we investigated within-generational plasticity (WGP) and trans-generational plasticity (TGP) effects induced by heat waves during the offspring development of the predator Phytoseiulus persimilis and its herbivorous prey, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, to assess plastic developmental modifications. Single offspring individuals with different parental thermal origin (reared under mild or extreme heat waves) of both species were exposed to mild or extreme heat waves until adulthood, and food consumption, age and size at maturity were recorded. The offspring traits were influenced by within-generational plasticity (WGP), trans-generational plasticity (TGP), non-plastic trans-generational effects (TGE) and/or their interactions. When exposed to extreme heat waves, both species speeded up development (exclusively WGP), consumed more (due to the fact of WGP but also to TGP in prey females and to non-plastic TGE in predator males), and predator females got smaller (non-plastic TGE and WGP), whereas prey males and females were equally sized irrespective of their origin, because TGE, WGP and TGP acted in opposite directions. The body sizes of predator males were insensitive to parental and offspring heat wave conditions. Species comparisons indicated stronger reductions in the developmental time and reduced female predator-prey body size ratios in favor of the prey under extreme heat waves. Further investigations are needed to evaluate, whether trait modifications result in lowered suppression success of the predator on its prey under heat waves or not.

AB  - Cohorts of willow sawfly (Nematus oligospilus) were reared in the laboratory on crack willow (Salix fragilis) at seven constant temperatures between 11.3 and 28.8 degrees C. Larvae developed through 5-7 instars. Body size (length) of adult females was influenced by temperature and was strongly correlated with fecundity (R-2 = 0.8973). The developmental threshold (t(o)), determined through linear regression, was calculated to be 8.1 degrees C, and the thermal accumulation above t(o) required to complete one generation was 321 degree-days. The number of degree-days available for seasonal development of the sawfly at 10 sites throughout New Zealand was calculated. Allowing for the period of diapause, it was estimated that N. oligospilus might potentially develop through up to seven generations per year in the North Island and three generations per year in the south of the South Island.

AB  - Hundreds of Sepia officinalis were hatched and cultured through the life cycle in each of 13 populations. Two genetic lines were maintained: one for an unprecedented seven generations and another presently in its fourth. All generations-save one-produced animals in excess of 1.0 kg body weight. Seven of eight generations with adequate data records had mean weights of 1-2 kg, and the largest cuttlefish reared were a male 2.6 kg and a Female 2.9 kg. Fecundity levels were high, but there was a trend towards decreased fertility in later generations, with fertilization rates dropping below 10%. In the 7th generation, most mature animals failed to engage in agonistic courtship and mating behaviour. Almost no normal eggs were laid and none was fertile, thus ending the lineage. Most culture took place at 20-24 degrees C and temperature generally explained variations in life span duration: being of shorter length at higher temperatures. Life spans were consistently longer at 20 degrees C and sizes were greater than predicted from previously published literature. In both lines there was a trend towards larger individuals and longer life spans in subsequent generations. Survival of hatchlings typically exceeded 90% for two months posthatching, and survival averaged 50% or higher to sexual maturity when corrected for animals removed from the populations for experimental use.

VL  - 46
IS  - 3
SP  - 338-341
AB  - Sexual dimorphism in size or shape is common in many reptile species. Amphisbaenians are morphologically specialized for a fossorial life, which might constrain the evolution of sexual dimorphism. This might explain why some amphisbaenian species, but not others, show some type of sexual dimorphism. To understand the differential occurrence of sexual dimorphism in amphisbaenians, studies on a wide number of species belonging to different families and inhabiting different ecological conditions are needed. We measured several morphological variables in a population of the amphisbaenian Trogonophis wiegmanni, a representative of the little-studied family Trogonophidae from North Africa. Results show that males and females have similar body size; but for individuals of similar size, males are heavier, have longer tails, and have larger heads than do females. These differences might be explained by sexual selection, if males with larger heads had advantages in intrasexual contests, or by sexual diet differences. However, most ecological and behavioral aspects of this and other amphisbaenian species remain poorly known, thereby leaving unresolved which selective pressures are responsible for the sexual dimorphism that was evident in this species.

TI  - A Single Amino Acid in the Stalk Region of the H1N1pdm Influenza Virus HA Protein Affects Viral Fusion, Stability and Infectivity
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - The 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm) viruses have evolved to contain an E47K substitution in the HA2 subunit of the stalk region of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. The biological significance of this single amino acid change was investigated by comparing A/California/7/2009 (HA2-E47) with a later strain, A/Brisbane/10/2010 (HA2-K47). The E47K change was found to reduce the threshold pH for membrane fusion from 5.4 to 5.0. An inter-monomer salt bridge between K47 in HA2 and E21 in HA1, a neighboring highly conserved residue, which stabilized the trimer structure, was found to be responsible for the reduced threshold pH for fusion. The higher structural and acid stability of the HA trimer caused by the E47K change also conferred higher viral thermal stability and infectivity in ferrets, suggesting a fitness advantage for the E47K evolutionary change in humans. Our study indicated that the pH of HA fusion activation is an important factor for influenza virus replication and host adaptation. The identification of this genetic signature in the HA stalk region that influences vaccine virus thermal stability also has significant implications for influenza vaccine production. Author Summary Influenza viruses cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics, representing a threat to public health. The trimeric hemagglutinin (HA) surface glycoprotein mediates viral entry and plays important roles in viral host restriction, transmission and pathogenesis. The HA protein binds to the receptor on the cell via the head region, and mediates the low pH-triggered viral and cellular membrane fusion via the stalk region. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pm) viruses have been circulating in humans since 2009. A single amino acid change was found in the stalk region of recent H1N1pdm strains. In this study, we revealed that this amino acid change, by stabilizing the trimer structure, lowered the pH for fusion and exhibited a higher acid stability. Accordingly, the H1N1pdm with this change showed higher thermal stability after high temperature treatment. Furthermore, the H1N1pdm with this change had higher infectivity in ferrets, suggesting that recent H1N1pdm viruses have evolved to be more adapted in humans. Our data not only indicate the importance of the fusion activation pH to viral replication and host adaptation, but also provide solutions to improve the shelf-life of live vaccines in vaccine manufacture.

VL  - 137

SP  - 1406-1421
AB  - Daily consumption was estimated from the stomach contents of walleyes Sander vitreus collected weekly from Oneida Lake, New York, during June-October 1975, 1992, 1993, and 1994 for one to four age-groups per year. Field rations were highly variable between weeks, and trends in ration size varied both seasonally and annually. The coefficient of variation for weekly field rations within years and ages ranged from 45% to 97%. Field estimates were compared with simulated consumption from a bioenergetics model. The simulation averages of daily ration deviated from those of the field estimates by -20.1% to +70.3%, with a mean across all simulations of +14.3%. The deviations for each time step were much greater than those for the simulation averages, ranging from -92.8% to +363.6%. A systematic trend in the deviations was observed, the model producing overpredictions at rations less than 3.7% of body weight. Analysis of variance indicated that the deviations were affected by sample year and week but not age. Multiple linear regression using backwards selection procedures and Akaike's information criterion indicated that walleye weight, walleye growth, lake temperature, prey energy density, and the proportion of gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum in the diet significantly affected the deviations between simulated and field rations and explained 32% of the variance.

TI  - Effects of photoperiod on life-history and thermal stress resistance traits across populations of Drosophila subobscura
VL  - 9
IS  - 5
SP  - 2743-2754
AB  - Introduction Organisms use environmental cues to match their phenotype with the future availability of resources and environmental conditions. Changes in the magnitude and frequency of environmental cues such as photoperiod and temperature along latitudes can be used by organisms to predict seasonal changes. While the role of temperature variation on the induction of plastic and seasonal responses is well established, the importance of photoperiod for predicting seasonal changes is less explored. Materials and methods Here we studied changes in life-history and thermal stress resistance traits in Drosophila subobscura in response to variation in photoperiod (6:18, 12:12 and 18:6 light:dark cycles) mimicking seasonal variations in day length. The populations of D. subobscura were collected from five locations along a latitudinal gradient (from North Africa and Europe). These populations were exposed to different photoperiods for two generations, whereafter egg-to-adult viability, productivity, dry body weight, thermal tolerance, and starvation resistance were assessed. Results We found strong effects of photoperiod, origin of populations, and their interactions on life-history and stress resistance traits. Thermal resistance varied between the populations and the effect of photoperiod depended on the trait and the method applied for the assessment of thermal resistance. Perspectives Our results show a strong effect of the origin of population and photoperiod on a range of fitness-related traits and provide evidence for local adaptation to environmental cues (photoperiod by population interaction). The findings emphasize an important and often neglected role of photoperiod in studies on thermal resistance and suggest that cues induced by photoperiod may provide some buffer enabling populations to cope with a more variable and unpredictable future climate.

VL  - 10

SP  - 7616-7626
AB  - Understanding the effects of temperature on ecological and evolutionary processes is crucial for generating future climate adaptation scenarios. Using experimental evolution, we evolved the model ciliateTetrahymena thermophilain an initially novel high temperature environment for more than 35 generations, closely monitoring population dynamics and morphological changes. We observed initially long lag phases in the high temperature environment that over about 26 generations reduced to no lag phase, a strong reduction in cell size and modifications in cell shape at high temperature. When exposing the adapted populations to their original temperature, most phenotypic traits returned to the observed levels in the ancestral populations, indicating phenotypic plasticity is an important component of this species thermal stress response. However, persistent changes in cell size were detected, indicating possible costs related to the adaptation process. Exploring the molecular basis of thermal adaptation will help clarify the mechanisms driving these phenotypic responses.

TI  - Altitudinal patterns for longevity, fecundity and senescence in Drosophila buzzatii
VL  - 128
IS  - 1
SP  - 81-93
AB  - We tested for variation in longevity, senescence rate and early fecundity of Drosophila buzzatii along an elevational transect in Argentina, using laboratory-reared flies in laboratory tests performed to avoid extrinsic mortality. At 25 degrees C, females from lowland populations lived longer and had a lower demographic rate of senescence than females from highland populations. Minimal instead of maximal temperature at the sites of origin of population best predicted this cline. A very different pattern was found at higher test temperature. At 29.5 degrees C, longevity of males increased with altitude of origin of population. No clinal trend was apparent for longevity of females at 29.5 degrees C. There was evidence for a trade-off between early fecundity and longevity at non-stressful temperature (25 degrees C) along the altitudinal gradient. This trait association is consistent with evolutionary theories of aging. Population-by-temperature and sex-by-temperature interactions indicate that senescence patterns are expressed in environment specific ways.

VL  - 65
IS  - 6
SP  - 1148-1161
AB  - Locomotor performance of spontaneously foraging tent caterpillars (Malacosoma americanum) was videotaped under various thermal conditions as growing colonies progressed from the third through the sixth larval instars. Stride length and, therefore, speed increased with increasing body size. Speed and stride frequency were strongly temperature-dependent (Q10 of 2.2 and 1.9), whereas stride length was less affected by temperature (R10 of 1.2). Tent caterpillars showed little convergence between temperature preferences and thermal physiology; most of their foraging activity occurs at temperatures that greatly reduce locomotor performance. The absolute slowness of caterpillar locomotion appears to have favored an activity pattern in M. americanum that is based on temporal avoidance of predators. The absence of predators during nocturnal foraging bas apparently resulted in little selective pressure for a thermal physiology, which promotes relatively rapid locomotion at low body temperatures.

TI  - Temperature drives diversification in a model adaptive radiation
VL  - 285
IS  - 1886
AB  - The warmer regions harbour more species, attributable to accelerated speciation and increased ecological opportunities for coexistence. While correlations between temperature and energy availability and habitat area have been suggested as major drivers of these biodiversity patterns, temperature can theoretically also have direct effects on the evolution of diversity. Here, we experimentally studied the evolution of diversity in a model adaptive radiation of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens across a temperature gradient. Diversification increased at higher temperatures, driven by both faster generation of genetic variation and stronger diversifying selection. Specifically, low temperatures could limit the generation of diversity, suggested by the observation that supply of genetic variation through immigration increased diversity at low, but not high temperatures. The two major determinants of mutation supply, population size and mutation rate, both showed a positive temperature dependence. Stronger diversifying selection in warmer environments was suggested by promoted coexistence, and further explicitly inferred by the ability of evolved phenotypes to invade the ancestral type from rare. We discuss possible physiological and environmental mechanisms underlying the findings, most of which are likely to be general.

TI  - Seasonal variations in body melanism and size of the wolf spider Pardosa astrigera (Araneae: Lycosidae)
VL  - 8
IS  - 8
SP  - 4352-4359
AB  - Variations in species morphology and life-history traits strongly correlate with geographic and climatic characteristics. Most studies on morphological variations in animals focus on ectotherms distributed on a large geographic scale across latitudinal and/or altitudinal gradient. However, the morphological variations of spiders living in the same habitats across different seasons have not been reported. In this study, we used the wolf spider, Pardosa astrigera, as a model to determine seasonal differences in adult body size, melanism, fecundity, and egg diameter both in the overwintering and the first generation for 2010 and 2016. The results showed that in 2010, both females and males of the overwintering generation were significantly darker than the first generation. Moreover, the overwintering females were markedly larger and produced more and bigger eggs than the first generation in both 2010 and 2016. Considering the overwintering P.astrigera experiencing low temperature and/or desiccation stress, these results suggest that substantially darker and larger body of the overwintering generation is adaptive to adverse conditions.

AB  - Mutation is the source of genetic variation and the fundament of evolution. Temperature has long been suggested to have a direct impact on realized spontaneous mutation rates. If mutation rates vary in response to environmental conditions, such as the variation of the ambient temperature through space and time, they should no longer be described as species-specific constants. By combining mutation accumulation with whole-genome sequencing in a multicellular organism, we provide empirical support to reject the null hypothesis of a constant, temperature-independent mutation rate. Instead, mutation rates depended on temperature in a U-shaped manner with increasing rates toward both temperature extremes. This relation has important implications for mutation-dependent processes in molecular evolution, processes shaping the evolution of mutation rates, and even the evolution of biodiversity as such.

TI  - Evolutionary consequences of habitat loss for Pacific anadromous salmonids
VL  - 1
IS  - 2
SP  - 300-318
AB  - Large portions of anadromous salmonid habitat in the western United States has been lost because of dams and other blockages. This loss has the potential to affect salmonid evolution through natural selection if the loss is biased, affecting certain types of habitat differentially, and if phenotypic traits correlated with those habitat types are heritable. Habitat loss can also affect salmonid evolution indirectly, by reducing genetic variation and changing its distribution within and among populations. In this paper, we compare the characteristics of lost habitats with currently accessible habitats and review the heritability of traits which show correlations with habitat/environmental gradients. We find that although there is some regional variation, inaccessible habitats tend to be higher in elevation, wetter and both warmer in the summer and colder in the winter than habitats currently available to anadromous salmonids. We present several case studies that demonstrate either a change in phenotypic or life history expression or an apparent reduction in genetic variation associated with habitat blockages. These results suggest that loss of habitat will alter evolutionary trajectories in salmonid populations and Evolutionarily Significant Units. Changes in both selective regime and standing genetic diversity might affect the ability of these taxa to respond to subsequent environmental perturbations. Both natural and anthropogenic and should be considered seriously in developing management and conservation strategies.

VL  - 60

SP  - 307-318
AB  - The annual cycles of Euterpina acutifrons Dana (Copepoda: Harpacticoida) are compared in two temperate regions: the Gulf of San Matias (Argentina) and the Gulf of Marseilles (France). The analysis of the generations was determined on the basis of two main criteria: the peaks of relative abundance of copepods I and V, and changes in the modal size-class of the adults. Fluctuations in abundance of the developmental stages with time, the sex ratio and the percentage of ovigerous females were also examined to distinguish between the generations with greater precision. In the two areas, seven generations were identified over the course of the year, with a duration between 23 and 85 days at San Matias, and between 31 and 72 days at Marseilles, depending on the season. The occurrence of naupliar peaks appears to be mainly associated with seasonal phytoplankton blooms in both populations. At San Matias, the species disappears from the plankton in winter. whereas at Marseilles it is permanently present. The influence of temperature on size seems to be more significant at San Matias than at Marseilles where other factors, food supply in particular, might also play a role. The differences of seasonal cycle between the two populations might result from the fact that the annual temperature range is smaller at San Matias, with minima below the threshold of tolerance of the species.

TI  - Geographic clines in wing morphology relate to colonization history in New World but not Old World populations of yellow dung flies
VL  - 72
IS  - 8
SP  - 1629-1644
AB  - Geographic dines offer insights about putative targets and agents of natural selection as well as tempo and mode of adaptation. However, demographic processes can lead to dines that are indistinguishable from adaptive divergence. Using the widespread yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera: Scathophagidae), we examine quantitative genetic differentiation (Q(ST)) of wing shape across North America, Europe, and Japan, and compare this differentiation with that of ten microsatellites (F-ST). Morphometric analyses of 28 populations reared at three temperatures revealed significant thermal plasticity, sexual dimorphism, and geographic differentiation in wing shape. In North America morphological differentiation followed the decline in microsatellite variability along the presumed route of recent colonization from the southeast to the northwest. Across Europe, where S. stercoraria presumably existed for much longer time and where no molecular pattern of isolation by distance was evident, clinal variation was less pronounced despite significant morphological differentiation (Q(ST) >F-ST). Shape vector comparisons further indicate that thermal plasticity (hot-to-cold) does not mirror patterns of latitudinal divergence (south-to-north), as might have been expected under a scenario with temperature as the major agent of selection. Our findings illustrate the importance of detailed phylogeographic information when interpreting geographic dines of dispersal traits in an adaptive evolutionary framework.

TI  - Directional selection on cold tolerance does not constrain plastic capacity in a butterfly
VL  - 12
AB  - Background: Organisms may respond to environmental change by means of genetic adaptation, phenotypic plasticity or both, which may result in genotype-environment interactions (G x E) if genotypes differ in their phenotypic response. We here specifically target the latter source of variation (i.e. G x E) by comparing plastic responses among lines of the tropical butterfly Bicyclus anynana that had been selected for increased cold tolerance and according controls. Our main aim here was to test the hypothesis that directional selection on cold tolerance will interfere with plastic capacities. Results: Plastic responses to temperature and feeding treatments were strong, with e. g. higher compared to lower temperatures reducing cold tolerance, longevity, pupal mass, and development time. We report a number of statistically significant genotype-environment interactions (i.e. interactions between selection regime and environmental variables), but most of these were not consistent across treatment groups. We found some evidence though for larger plastic responses to different rearing temperatures in the selection compared to the control lines, while plastic responses to different adult temperatures and feeding treatments were overall very similar across selection regimes. Conclusion: Our results indicate that plastic capacities are not always constrained by directional selection (on cold tolerance) and therefore genetic changes in trait means, but may operate independently.

TI  - Cenozoic Planktonic Marine Diatom Diversity and Correlation to Climate Change
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Marine planktonic diatoms export carbon to the deep ocean, playing a key role in the global carbon cycle. Although commonly thought to have diversified over the Cenozoic as global oceans cooled, only two conflicting quantitative reconstructions exist, both from the Neptune deep-sea microfossil occurrences database. Total diversity shows Cenozoic increase but is sample size biased; conventional subsampling shows little net change. We calculate diversity from a separately compiled new diatom species range catalog, and recalculate Neptune subsampled-in-bin diversity using new methods to correct for increasing Cenozoic geographic endemism and decreasing Cenozoic evenness. We find coherent, substantial Cenozoic diversification in both datasets. Many living cold water species, including species important for export productivity, originate only in the latest Miocene or younger. We make a first quantitative comparison of diatom diversity to the global Cenozoic benthic delta O-18 (climate) and carbon cycle records (delta C-13, and 20-0 Ma pCO(2)). Warmer climates are strongly correlated with lower diatom diversity (raw: rho=.92, p<.001; detrended, r=.6, p=.01). Diatoms were 20% less diverse in the early late Miocene, when temperatures and pCO(2) were only moderately higher than today. Diversity is strongly correlated to both delta C-13 and pCO(2) over the last 15 my (for both: r>.9, detrended r>.6, all p<.001), but only weakly over the earlier Cenozoic, suggesting increasingly strong linkage of diatom and climate evolution in the Neogene. Our results suggest that many living marine planktonic diatom species may be at risk of extinction in future warm oceans, with an unknown but potentially substantial negative impact on the ocean biologic pump and oceanic carbon sequestration. We cannot however extrapolate our my-scale correlations with generic climate proxies to anthropogenic time-scales of warming without additional species-specific information on proximate ecologic controls.

This result was consistent regardless of whether age cohorts were tested separately or together. Furthermore, juveniles but not adult fishes positioned themselves higher in water column in the presence of a thermal gradient compared with those in the absence of a thermal gradient. Juvenile G. aculeatus and adult fish of both species did opt to position themselves higher in the water column in the hours immediately following a feeding event relative to their positions in the same gradient when they had not fed.

VL  - 242
SP  - 453-462
AB  - Females of Dawson's burrowing bee (Amegilla dawsoni) are receptive to the males as they emerge but have become unreceptive by the time they begin to nest. in addition, there is a single emergence period per year lasting about a month. These factors are predicted to lead to protandry and males of Dawson's burrowing bee do tend to emerge earlier in the annual flight season than females. Moreover, even during a single day, emerging males tend to precede females. The degree of protandry, however, is size-dependent, with smaller males tending to precede larger ones, both over the course of the flight season and on any given day. Because small males are at a disadvantage in the fights that occur for females, the earlier emergence of minor males may be a sexually selected response that reduces the likelihood that they will be displaced from potential mates by larger rivals.

TI  - Meta-analysis of genetic parameters of production traits in cultured shrimp species
VL  - 21
IS  - 6
SP  - 1150-1174
AB  - Genetic parameters of growth, reproductive efficiency and survival are important for designing successful genetic improvement programmes. In this study, a database was assembled and a meta-analysis was conducted using 87 peer-reviewed published studies on genetic parameters of 63 economically important traits reported across nine major farmed shrimp species. A total of 641 estimates of heritability, 978 estimates of genetic correlations and 658 estimates of phenotypic correlations were included in this study. Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) was the most widely reported species followed by giant freshwater prawn (Marcobrachium rosenbergii) and black tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon). Published studies demonstrate large variability across heritability and correlation estimates. Consensus estimates were based on both unweighted and weighted averages. The traits were broadly classed into weight, morphology, growth rate, body composition, feeding efficiency, reproductive efficiency and survival. This meta-analysis revealed moderate-to-high heritability estimates for weight (0.30 +/- 0.002), morphological (0.26 +/- 0.003), growth rate (0.27 +/- 0.01) and feeding efficiency (0.58 +/- 0.07) traits, but low for body composition (0.06 +/- 0.009), reproductive efficiency (0.11 +/- 0.006) and survival traits (0.15 +/- 0.003). Strong responses to selection were found among the shrimp species studied. We have developed a ShinyApp () for visualization of the individual heritability estimates. In addition to the meta-analysis of genetic parameters, we have calculated the correlated responses among economically important traits and highlighted response to selection, realized heritability, social interaction and common environmental effects in shrimp breeding programmes in terms of industry implications. Consensus estimates suggest that there is sufficient additive genetic variation to carry out effective genetic improvement programmes in these species.

TI  - Relationship Between the Duration of Death-Feigning and Temperature in Black and Red Elytral Types of a Polymorphic Ladybug, Harmonia axyridis
VL  - 35
IS  - 1
SP  - 11-16
AB  - Since predation is a strong selection pressure on prey, the later have evolved a variety of anti-predator behavior. Death-feigning is thought as one of anti-predator behaviors to escape from predation by temporarily stopping movement and appearing to be dead. Previous studies have shown that the duration and frequency of death-feigning varies with temperature. Body color may also affect those parameters through thermal adaptation, as body color would have a significant relationship with temperature adaptation. A ladybug, Harmonia axyridis, shows a polymorphism in elytral color, which is controlled by 12 alleles on a single locus. The elytral color can be divided into 1) red with black spots (Red type; R) and 2) black with red spots (Black type; B). Here, we show that the duration of death-feigning in B was correlated positively with temperature whereas that in R was correlated negatively with temperature. The evolutionary reasons for this difference require further study in terms of the trade-off between the opportunity cost associated with death-feigning and the benefit of the duration of death-feigning.

AB  - Biology of Ischyrocerus anguipes amphipods associated with the red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) was studied in Dalnezelenetskii Bay (the southern Barents Sea) in summer periods of 2004-2007 High levels of both prevalence (15 0%) and mean intensity (6 9 +/- 1 1 ind) of amphipods on the hosts were found The absence of negative impacts indicates the commensal relationships between amphipods and crabs The sex ratio (females males) in the I anguipes population was 2 1 The average body size of females was higher than that of males The size at 50% morphometric maturity for females of summer generations was calculated at 3 4 mm Some differences in biological features of associated amphipods and free-living individuals (data obtained in the 1940s-1950s) were found and may be explained both by changes in hydrological conditions of the Barents Sea (increase in water temperature) and advantages of dwelling on the crab (protection from predators and distribution)

VL  - 35

SP  - 515-+
AB  - Spawning time in salmonids is a sex-limited quantitative trait that can be modified by selection. In rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), various quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect the expression of this trait have been discovered. In this study, we describe four microsatellite loci associated with two possible spawning time QTL regions in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). The four loci were identified in females from two populations (early and late spawners) produced by divergent selection from the same base population. Three of the loci (OmyFGT34TUF, One2ASC and One19ASC) that were strongly associated with spawning time in coho salmon (p < 0.0002) were previously associated with QTL for the same trait in rainbow trout; a fourth loci (Oki10) with a suggestive association (p = 0.00035) mapped 10 cM from locus OmyFGT34TUF in rainbow trout. The changes in allelic frequency observed after three generations of selection were greater than expected because of genetic drift. This work shows that comparing information from closely-related species is a valid strategy for identifying QTLs for marker-assisted selection in species whose genomes are poorly characterized or lack a saturated genetic map.

VL  - 77

SP  - 383-408
AB  - Adding a causal, mechanistic dimension to the study of character evolution will increase the strength of inferences regarding the evolutionary history of characters and their adaptive consequences. This approach has the advantage of illuminating mechanism and testing evolutionary hypotheses rigorously. We consider the advantages of combining mechanistic and historical biology in the study of behavior, physiology, and development. we present six examples to illustrate the advantages: (1) preexisting biases in sound perception in frogs; (2) preexisting biases in visual cues in swordtail fishes (3) exploitation of prey location behavior for attraction of mates in water mates; (4) heterospecific mating in asexual molly fishes: (5) developmental foundation of morphological diversification in amphibian digits; and (6) locomotor performance at low temperature and the evolution of nocturnadity in geckos. In each of these examples, the dominant role of history, combined with organasmal integration, makes ignoring history a risky proposition.

TI  - Intraspecific variation in wing and pupal melanization in copper butterflies (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae)
VL  - 98
IS  - 2
SP  - 301-312
AB  - Melanin is a widespread pigment causing variation in skin darkness, with darker phenotypes typically reaching higher equilibrium temperatures than lighter ones. Therefore, selection is expected to favour darker phenotypes in colder environments. In the present study, we show intraspecific variation in pupal (and wing) melanization along an altitudinal gradient in two species of copper butterflies. Both, pupal and wing melanization increased with increasing altitude. Consistent with the thermal melanism hypothesis, darker (high-altitude) pupae reached higher equilibrium temperatures than paler (low-altitude) ones. However, as temperature differences were rather small despite pronounced differences in melanization, we cannot rule out that factors (e.g. ultraviolet protection, disease resistance) other than temperature comprise the principal selective agents. Mechanistically, variation in melanization might be related to variation in hormone titres, as demonstrated by low-altitude pupae showing higher ecdysteroid and juvenile hormone titres compared to high-altitude ones. Furthermore, we report sex differences in wing melanization, with males being darker than females, which is potentially related to a higher flight activity of males.

AB  - The preparation of a water dispersible and pH responsive gelatin-F127 nanocomposite using a thermal relaxation approach is reported. The results indicated that physical properties (size and surface charge) of the gelatin-F127 nanoparticle can be tuned by varying the F127 to gelatin weight ratio. The heating (60 degrees C) of a saline solution (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% (w/v) of gelatin and 20% (w/w of gelatin) of F127 followed by gradual cooling at room temperature yielded nanoparticles of desired size (160 +/- 40 nm), viscosity (1.36 +/- cP) and surface charge (-6.47 +/- 0.7 mV). The drug delivery application of nanocarriers was investigated using doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox) as a model drug. These nanocarriers showed high encapsulation efficiency of Dox (85%), a sustained release profile, and substantial cellular internalization. Additionally, Dox loaded nanocarriers (G-Dox) exhibited prolonged residence in blood as evidenced by their longer circulation time as compared to plain Dox. Moreover, G-Dox exhibited a higher availability of the drug in plasma as compared to nonspecific organs such as the heart, liver and kidneys, highlighting its significance in reducing drug associated side effects. Finally, the enhanced toxicity of G-Dox to a WEHI-164 (fibrosarcoma) tumor model as compared to that of plain Dox under an identical dosage of 6 mg per kg body weight (IP) confirmed its potential for chemotherapy application.

TI  - Dissecting adaptive clinal variation: markers, inversions and size/stress associations in Drosophila melanogaster from a central field population
VL  - 5
IS  - 6
SP  - 756-763
AB  - Many organisms show latitudinal variation for quantitative traits that is assumed to be due to climatic adaptation. These clines provide an opportunity to study the genetics of the adaptive process both at the phenotypic and the underlying molecular levels. Yet researchers rarely try to link variation in quantitative traits to their underlying molecular genetic basis. We describe a novel approach for exploring the genetic basis for clinal variation in size and stress traits in Drosophila melanogaster. We look for associations between genetic markers and traits that exhibit clinal patterns on the east coast of Australia using a single, geographically central population. There are strong associations between markers found within In( 3R) Payne and variation in size, suggesting that this inversion explains much of the clinal variation in this trait. We also find that development time is associated with the Adh allozyme locus, cold resistance is negatively associated with the In(3L) Payne inversion and a genetic marker for Hsp70, a heat-shock protein, is associated with heat resistance. Finally we discuss the importance of inversions in clinal variation for quantitative traits and for identifying quantitative trait loci.

AB  - Reference intervals for diagnostic tests are vitally important for clinical decision making. Despite the popularity of pet goldfish (Carassius auratus), reference intervals have not been generated for routine biochemistry panel analytes in this species. This study establishes de novo reference intervals for packed cell volume and total solids, using 47 apparently healthy immature goldfish, and for 11 common chemistry panel analytes (albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, calcium, creatine kinase, globulin, blood glucose, sodium, potassium, phosphorous, total protein, and uric acid) using 39 immature goldfish. Robust reference intervals were generated following recommendations of the American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology. Linear regression was used to demonstrate a statistically significant relationship between body weight and calcium, albumin, total protein, potassium, packed cell volume, and total solids. The results of this study serve as a useful baseline for future reference interval generation in goldfish.

TI  - Keeping your options open: Maintenance of thermal plasticity during adaptation to a stable environment
VL  - 70

SP  - 195-206
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity may allow species to cope with environmental variation. The study of thermal plasticity and its evolution helps understanding how populations respond to variation in temperature. In the context of climate change, it is essential to realize the impact of historical differences in the ability of populations to exhibit a plastic response to thermal variation and how it evolves during colonization of new environments. We have analyzed the real-time evolution of thermal reaction norms of adult and juvenile traits in Drosophila subobscura populations from three locations of Europe in the laboratory. These populations were kept at a constant temperature of 18 degrees C, and were periodically assayed at three experimental temperatures (13 degrees C, 18 degrees C, and 23 degrees C). We found initial differentiation between populations in thermal plasticity as well as evolutionary convergence in the shape of reaction norms for some adult traits, but not for any of the juvenile traits. Contrary to theoretical expectations, an overall better performance of high latitude populations across temperatures in early generations was observed. Our study shows that the evolution of thermal plasticity is trait specific, and that a new stable environment did not limit the ability of populations to cope with environmental challenges.

VL  - 20

SP  - 75-89
AB  - The selective and environmental effects of captivity on several fitness-correlated traits were assessed in smolts of endangered Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., from the inner Bay of Fundy, produced via artificial spawning and released into the wild as juveniles. Smolts were sampled as they migrated downstream and identified through microsatellite-based parentage analysis as offspring of either wild-spawning adults or adults that were spawned in captivity. Overall, captive-origin smolts exhibited a significantly later run timing and smaller body size than wild smolts. Significant differences in run timing and body size were also found between captive-origin smolts that had experienced rearing environments that differed in duration of captivity and thermal regime. Significant differences in run timing, fork length and weight were found between first and second generation captive-origin smolts, although the expression of these differences depended on the rearing environment experienced, suggesting a possible genotype by environment effect. The ratio of effective-to-census number of breeders that produced the captive-origin smolts was higher than that of the wild-origin smolts due to successful captive breeding management practices. These results have direct implications for captive breeding and rearing programmes for salmonids and wider implications for understanding the rates of evolutionary and environmentally induced change that can occur in captivity.

TI  - Adaptations to thermal stress in social insects: recent advances and future directions
VL  - 95

SP  - 1535-1553
AB  - Thermal stress is a major driver of population declines and extinctions. Shifts in thermal regimes create new environmental conditions, leading to trait adaptation, population migration, and/or species extinction. Extensive research has examined thermal adaptations in terrestrial arthropods. However, little is known about social insects, despite their major role in ecosystems. It is only within the last few years that the adaptations of social insects to thermal stress have received attention. Herein, we discuss what is currently known about thermal tolerance and thermal adaptation in social insects - namely ants, termites, social bees, and social wasps. We describe the behavioural, morphological, physiological, and molecular adaptations that social insects have evolved to cope with thermal stress. We examine individual and collective responses to both temporary and persistent changes in thermal conditions and explore the extent to which individuals can exploit genetic variability to acclimatise. Finally, we consider the costs and benefits of sociality in the face of thermal stress, and we propose some future research directions that should advance our knowledge of individual and collective thermal adaptations in social insects.

VL  - 144

AB  - Specific dynamic action (SDA) is the term used to refer to the increased metabolic expenditure that occurs in postprandial animals. Postprandial increases in metabolism were first documented in animals over two hundred years ago, and have since been observed in every species thus far examined. Ironically, the ubiquity of this physiological response to feeding understates its complex nature. This review is designed to summarize both classical and modem hypotheses regarding the causality of SDA as well as to review important findings from the past century of scientific research into SDA. A secondary aim of this work is to emphasize the importance of carefully designed experiments and systematic hypothesis testing to make more rapid progress in understanding the physiological processes that contribute to SDA. I also identify three areas in SDA research that deserve more detailed investigation. The first area is identification of the causality of SDA in 'model' organisms. The second area is characterization of SDA responses in novel species. The third area is exploration of the ecological and potential evolutionary significance of SDA in energy budgets of animals.

TI  - Bleaching and post-bleaching mortality of Acropora corals on a heat-susceptible reef in 2016
VL  - 7
AB  - In 2016, global temperatures were the highest on record, and mass coral bleaching occurred world-wide. However, around Sesoko Island, Okinawa, southwestern Japan, the heat stress assessed by degree heating week (DHW) based on local temperature measurements was moderate in 2016; in 1998, DHW was three times higher than in 2016 (10.6 vs. 3.3 in September in respective years). On a reef flat of Sesoko Island where the effect of severe coral bleaching on coral assemblage was monitored in 1998, significant coral bleaching occurred in 2016. Bleaching of the heat stress sensitive Acropora corals began in July 2016 on the reef flat as seawater temperature rose. We observed the bleaching and post-bleaching mortality status of individual colonies of Acropora spp. in 2016 in fixed plots on the reef flat. In total, 123 Acropora colonies were followed for six months after seawater temperature became normal by multiple surveys. At the beginning of September 2016, 99.2% of colonies, were either completely (92.7%) or partially (6.5%) bleached. Of those, the dominant species or species groups were A. gemmifera (Ag), A. digitifera (Ad), and tabular Acropora (tA). For all Acropora colonies, the overall whole and partial mortality was 41.5% and 11.4%, respectively. Whole mortality rate differed significantly among species; 72.5%, 17.9%, and 27.8% in Ag, Ad, and tA, respectively. Mortality rates at the end of the surveys were similar in smaller (<= 10 cm in diameter) and larger Ag, but the former suffered mortality earlier than the latter. Higher survival of smaller colonies was observed only in tA (100%), which may be associated with large morphological differences between smaller and larger colonies. Some of the dominant Acropora colonies had survived without partial mortality including 15.0% survival of the most vulnerable Ag at the end of the surveys. These results suggest that moderate heat stress may have a potential for selecting heat-tolerant genotypes. A longer period of mortality lasting for six months, was observed in Ag in addition to immediate whole mortality after bleaching, due to the continuous loss of living tissue by partial mortality. This highlights the need for multiple surveys at least during several months to accurately assess the impact of thermal stress event to corals. In contrast to DHW based on local measurements, DHW obtained from satellite data were similar between 1998 and 2016. Although satellite-based measurement of sea surface temperature is very useful to reveal variations in heat stress at a large spatial scale, temperature should be measured on site when variations at smaller spatial scales are of interest.

TI  - Recent Advances in Understanding the Effects of Climate Change on Coral Reefs
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
AB  - Climate change is one of the greatest threats to the persistence of coral reefs. Sustained and ongoing increases in ocean temperatures and acidification are altering the structure and function of reefs globally. Here, we summarise recent advances in our understanding of the effects of climate change on scleractinian corals and reef fish. Although there is considerable among-species variability in responses to increasing temperature and seawater chemistry, changing temperature regimes are likely to have the greatest influence on the structure of coral and fish assemblages, at least over short-medium timeframes. Recent evidence of increases in coral bleaching thresholds, local genetic adaptation and inheritance of heat tolerance suggest that coral populations may have some capacity to respond to warming, although the extent to which these changes can keep pace with changing environmental conditions is unknown. For coral reef fishes, current evidence indicates increasing seawater temperature will be a major determinant of future assemblages, through both habitat degradation and direct effects on physiology and behaviour. The effects of climate change are, however, being compounded by a range of anthropogenic disturbances, which may undermine the capacity of coral reef organisms to acclimate and/or adapt to specific changes in environmental conditions.

VL  - 43

SP  - 438-449
AB  - Many amphibians are explosive breeders, but the key factors that influence migrations to (and from) breeding sites are not well understood for all species. We used a comparative approach to compare and contrast the complex relationships among breeding chronology, environmental conditions, sexual dimorphism/body size, sex ratio, and genetic variation in Small-mouthed (Ambystoma texanum) and Eastern Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum). We intercepted 171 A. texanum and 330 adult A. t. tigrinum on their annual migration to breeding ponds over two consecutive breeding seasons (2003-04). Both species immigrated over a short period of time (4-17 days) and displayed no clear pattern regarding whether males or females typically arrived first at breeding ponds. Sex ratios were skewed toward males in both species but varied between years. Consistent with their expected sexual selection regimes, intraspecific sexual dimorphism was subtle in A. texanum but pronounced in A. t. tigrinum. There was no size-ordered immigration or emigration for either species examined; migration events were triggered by temperature and precipitation. We genotyped four hypervariable microsatellite loci and found no gross difference in the overall level of genetic variation between species but document that our study populations are genetically diverse (mean of >18 alleles per locus and heterozygosities >0.75 in each species), presumably as a result of historically large effective population sizes.

TI  - Adaptation to climate change: contrasting patterns of thermal-reaction-norm evolution in Pacific versus Atlantic silversides
VL  - 278
IS  - 1716
SP  - 2265-2273
AB  - How organisms may adapt to rising global temperatures is uncertain, but concepts can emerge from studying adaptive physiological trait variations across existing spatial climate gradients. Many ectotherms, particularly fish, have evolved increasing genetic growth capacities with latitude (i.e. countergradient variation (CnGV) in growth), which are thought to be an adaptation primarily to strong gradients in seasonality. In contrast, evolutionary responses to gradients in mean temperature are often assumed to involve an alternative mode, 'thermal adaptation'. We measured thermal growth reaction norms in Pacific silverside populations (Atherinops affinis) occurring across a weak latitudinal temperature gradient with invariant seasonality along the North American Pacific coast. Instead of thermal adaptation, we found novel evidence for CnGV in growth, suggesting that CnGV is a ubiquitous mode of reaction-norm evolution in ectotherms even in response to weak spatial and, by inference, temporal climate gradients. A novel, large-scale comparison between ecologically equivalent Pacific versus Atlantic silversides (Menidia menidia) revealed how closely growth CnGV patterns reflect their respective climate gradients. While steep growth reaction norms and increasing growth plasticity with latitude in M. menidia mimicked the strong, highly seasonal Atlantic coastal gradient, shallow reaction norms and much smaller, latitude-independent growth plasticity in A. affinis resembled the weak Pacific latitudinal temperature gradient.

VL  - 99
SP  - 123-130
AB  - Organisms can respond to and cope with stressful environments in a number of ways including behavioural, morphological and physiological adjustments. To understand the role of behavioural traits in thermal adaptations we compared heat resistance, locomotor (walking and flying) activity, flight performance and morphology of three European populations of Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae) originating from different thermal conditions (Spain, Switzerland and Denmark) at benign and stressful high temperatures. Spanish flies showed greater heat resistance than Swiss and Danish flies. Similarly, at the stressful high temperature Spanish flies flew the furthest and Danish flies the shortest distance. Neither body size nor wing loading affected flight performance, although flies with narrower wings tended to fly further (wing shape effect). Swiss flies were most active in terms of locomotor activity at the benign temperature, whereas the Spanish flies were able to stay active for longer at the stressful temperature. Population differences in behavioural traits and heat resistance were obtained using flies held for several generations in a laboratory common garden setting; therefore we suggest that exposure to and avoidance of high temperatures under natural conditions has been an important selective agent causing the suggested adaptive differentiation between the populations.

TI  - Evolutionary stasis and lability in thermal physiology in a group of tropical lizards
VL  - 281
IS  - 1778
AB  - Understanding how quickly physiological traits evolve is a topic of great interest, particularly in the context of how organisms can adapt in response to climate warming. Adjustment to novel thermal habitats may occur either through behavioural adjustments, physiological adaptation or both. Here, we test whether rates of evolution differ among physiological traits in the cybotoids, a clade of tropical Anolis lizards distributed in markedly different thermal environments on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. We find that cold tolerance evolves considerably faster than heat tolerance, a difference that results because behavioural thermoregulation more effectively shields these organisms from selection on upper than lower temperature tolerances. Specifically, because lizards in very different environments behaviourally thermoregulate during the day to similar body temperatures, divergent selection on body temperature and heat tolerance is precluded, whereas night-time temperatures can only be partially buffered by behaviour, thereby exposing organisms to selection on cold tolerance. We discuss how exposure to selection on physiology influences divergence among tropical organisms

AB  - We report in this paper an evolutionary experiment on Drosophila that tested life-history theory and the evolutionary theory of aging. As theory predicts, higher extrinsic mortality rates did lead to the evolution of higher intrinsic mortality rates, to shorter lifespans. and to decreased age and size at eclosion; peak fecundity also shifted earlier in life. These results confirm the key role of extrinsic mortality rates in the evolution of growth, maturation, reproduction, and aging, and they do so with a selection regime that maintained selection on fertility throughout life while holding population densities constant.

TI  - Local adaptation of developmental time and starvation resistance in eight Drosophila species of the Philippines
VL  - 87
IS  - 1
SP  - 115-125
AB  - The ecological trade-off between developmental time and starvation resistance, acting in a heterogeneous environment, can promote the coexistence of competing species. Heterogeneity results from variation in the vegetation that influences both abiotic (e.g. temperature, humidity) and biotic (e.g. fruit availability during the year) aspects of the environment. In this study, we investigated whether differences between collection sites have led to local differentiation of the two life-history traits underlying the coexistence model: developmental time and starvation resistance. Drosophila were collected from four collection sites, ranging from grassland to secondary forest, along a transect of 15 km. The microclimatic and vegetation differences among these collection sites were considerable. For developmental time, different species showed similar genetic responses to the (habitat) differences between the different collection sites. The shortest developmental times were found in the secondary forest populations and the agricultural area populations, the longest in the grassland populations, and the forest edge populations were intermediate. However, there was no correlation between the habitat ranking based on disturbance and canopy cover, and the ranking of the developmental times. Furthermore, the data did not confirm the generality of the positive correlation between developmental time and starvation underlying the coexistence model. (c) 2006 The Linnean Society of London.

VL  - 82
IS  - 6
SP  - 923-930
AB  - Moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita s.l. has been suggested to have high mortality during the ephyra stage, which potentially affects the population size of the later medusa stage. However, the mechanism behind the high mortality rate has still not been clarified. Ephyrae of A. aurita are liberated from the sessile strobila, which are usually surrounded by filter-feeding sessile organisms. In the present study, we carried out a series of feeding trials at 10 A degrees C, offering A. aurita ephyrae to three potential predatory filter-feeding sessile organisms: the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, the ascidian Styela plicata, and the barnacle Amphibalanus eburneus. From the experiments, the mussel was estimated to have the highest ability to consume ephyrae among the sessile organisms. Size-selective filtration experiments showed that the mussel consumed newly liberated ephyrae [3 mm total body diameter (TBD)] at a significantly higher efficiency than larger (5 and 7 mm TBD) ephyrae. Our results demonstrate that filter-feeding sessile organisms, especially the mussel, are potential consumers of the early ephyra stage.

TI  - Tropical mountain passes are out of reach - but not for arboreal species
VL  - 16
IS  - 2
SP  - 101-108
AB  - According to a prevailing hypothesis, lowland tropical organisms are unlikely to successfully cross mountain passes because they have neither acclimated nor adapted to the colder temperatures found at higher elevations. However, this expectation assumes that changes in temperature are uniform across space and fails to account for the presence of diverse microclimates created by structurally complex ecosystems, such as rainforests. We collected and analyzed temperature data from Afrotropical, Indomalayan, and Australasian tropical mountain ecosystems to determine the degree of overlap between lowland and upland thermal regimes in three selected microenvironments. The thermal regimes of upland and lowland forest canopies overlapped to a greater extent than the thermal regimes of upland and lowland soils or ground-level sites. Tree-dwelling animals may therefore be able to bypass temperature constraints imposed by geography by virtue of where they live, which could lead to broader distributions and greater resilience to climatic change and variability as compared with ground-dwelling species.

VL  - 114
IS  - 5
SP  - 502-514
AB  - Continued and accelerating change in the thermal environment places an ever-greater priority on understanding how organisms are going to respond. The paradigm of 'move, adapt or die', regarding ways in which organisms can respond to environmental stressors, stimulates intense efforts to predict the future of biodiversity. Assuming that extinction is an unpalatable outcome, researchers have focussed attention on how organisms can shift in their distribution to stay in the same thermal conditions or can stay in the same place by adapting to a changing thermal environment. How likely these respective outcomes might be depends on the answer to a fundamental evolutionary question, namely what genetic changes underpin adaptation to the thermal environment. The increasing access to and decreasing costs of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, which can be applied to both model and non-model systems, provide a much-needed tool for understanding thermal adaptation. Here we consider broadly what is already known from non-NGS studies about thermal adaptation, then discuss the benefits and challenges of different NGS methodologies to add to this knowledge base. We then review published NGS genomics and transcriptomics studies of thermal adaptation to heat stress in metazoans and compare these results with previous non-NGS patterns. We conclude by summarising emerging patterns of genetic response and discussing future directions using these increasingly common techniques.

SP  - 147-152
AB  - Understanding the mechanism of metabolic digestion and of food assimilation in wild snake species is of fundamental importance to compare trophic niches, their adaptive significance and evolutionary patterns of diet selection for different snake species. From two adult Hierophis viridiflavus males in fasting condition, we sampled gastric fluids using fiberoptic endoscopy. We analyzed the proteolytic activities (optimal pH and temperature, response to inhibitors) of snake samples by zymography techniques. The two major protease activity bands were always detected at every tested pH. Activity bands were also detectable over 37 degrees C; in particular both bands showed the highest activity ranging from 55 degrees C to 60 degrees C. Ranging from 65 degrees C to 85 degrees C, one band remained visible while the other band disappeared over 60 degrees C. The pattern of proteolytic enzymes activity of sampled gastric fluids highlighted a scenario composed of few active proteases, reflecting the feeding status (e.g., fasting) of studied snakes. Detection of proteolytic activity until 85 degrees C, as in prokaryotic organisms, supported the hypothesis about the presence of proteases of exogenous source.

TI  - Leaf morphology shift linked to climate change
VL  - 8
IS  - 5
SP  - 882-886
AB  - Climate change is driving adaptive shifts within species, but research on plants has been focused on phenology. Leaf morphology has demonstrated links with climate and varies within species along climate gradients. We predicted that, given within-species variation along a climate gradient, a morphological shift should have occurred over time due to climate change. We tested this prediction, taking advantage of latitudinal and altitudinal variations within the Adelaide Geosyncline region, South Australia, historical herbarium specimens (n = 255) and field sampling (n 5 274). Leaf width in the study taxon, Dodonaea viscosa subsp. angustissima, was negatively correlated with latitude regionally, and leaf area was negatively correlated with altitude locally. Analysis of herbarium specimens revealed a 2 mm decrease in leaf width (total range 1-9 mm) over 127 years across the region. The results are consistent with a morphological response to contemporary climate change. We conclude that leaf width is linked to maximum temperature regionally (latitude gradient) and leaf area to minimum temperature locally (altitude gradient). These data indicate a morphological shift consistent with a direct response to climate change and could inform provenance selection for restoration with further investigation of the genetic basis and adaptive significance of observed variation.

TI  - Quantitative genetic variance in experimental fly populations evolving with or without environmental heterogeneity
VL  - 69
IS  - 10
SP  - 2735-2746
AB  - Heterogeneous environments are typically expected to maintain more genetic variation in fitness within populations than homogeneous environments. However, the accuracy of this claim depends on the form of heterogeneity as well as the genetic basis of fitness traits and how similar the assay environment is to the environment of past selection. Here, we measure quantitative genetic (QG) variance for three traits important for fitness using replicated experimental populations of Drosophila melanogaster evolving under four selective regimes: constant salt-enriched medium (Salt), constant cadmium-enriched medium (Cad), and two heterogeneous regimes that vary either temporally (Temp) or spatially (Spatial). As theory predicts, we found that Spatial populations tend to harbor more genetic variation than Temp populations or those maintained in a constant environment that is the same as the assay environment. Contrary to expectation, Salt populations tend to have more genetic variation than Cad populations in both assay environments. We discuss the patterns for QG variances across regimes in relation to previously reported data on genome-wide sequence diversity. For some traits, the QG patterns are similar to the diversity patterns of ecological selected SNPs, whereas the QG patterns for some other traits resembled that of neutral SNPs.

TI  - Countergradient selection for rapid growth in pumpkinseed sunfish: Disentangling ecological and evolutionary effects
VL  - 80

SP  - 2793-2798
AB  - Ecologists often assume that the evolutionary response to an environmental gradient will be the same as the phenotypic response. However, under some circumstances the evolutionary response to a gradient may be opposite of the ecological response, a phenomenon known as "countergradient variation." We had previously predicted that counter-gradient selection has occurred in pumpkinseed sunfish in response to a resource gradient created by competition with bluegill sunfish. Because competition only occurs when pumpkinseed are small, rapid growth has evolved to allow passage through the competing size classes as quickly as possible. We performed a common-garden experiment using juvenile pumpkinseed derived from lakes with bluegill and from lakes without bluegill. Pumpkinseed were raised in cages without bluegill, or with a low density of bluegill, or with a high density of bluegill. Bluegill significantly decreased growth for all pumpkinseed, following the predicted ecological gradient. However, pumpkinseed derived from lakes with bluegill grew faster than those from lakes without bluegill under all treatments, following the predicted evolutionary response.

TI  - Contrasting dynamics from egg to adult in the life cycle of summer and overwintering generations of Baetis rhodani in a small stream
VL  - 58
IS  - 5
SP  - 866-879
AB  - 1.The chief objectives were as follows: (i) to describe and compare quantitatively the life cycles of the summer and overwintering generations of Baetis rhodani, including laboratory experiments to determine the number of eggs laid per female and the number of larval instars; (ii) to test Dyar's hypothesis; and (iii) to test for density dependence in the life cycle. Samples of larvae and downstream-drifting adults (newly emerged subimagines and spent female imagines) and counts of egg masses were taken every 2weeks over 39months in a small stony stream. 2.Although females from the summer generation were smaller than those from the overwintering generation and laid fewer eggs, the relationship between the number of eggs laid by a female and body length was the same for both generations, being described by a power function. An exponential equation described the relationship between the mean body length of each instar and instar number; hence, Dyar's hypothesis was validated. Adult males emerged after 17 or 18 larval instars and females after 18 or 19 instars in the summer generation, with higher values of 25 or 26 instars for males and 26 or 27 instars for females in the overwintering generation. Mean instar body length in the summer generation was always larger than that in the overwintering generation, but this did not produce larger final instar larvae because the fewer instars resulted in males and females being smaller on emergence than in the overwintering generation. 3.Male subimagines started to emerge before females, and their emergence patterns indicated that there were two cohorts in each generation. Ovipositing females in the first cohort were always larger than those in the second cohort. Therefore, four mean values for eggs/female (=eggs/egg mass) were used to convert egg masses per m2 to eggs laid per m2. Larvae were divided into six stages: I=instar 1, II=instars 25, III=instars 610, IV=instars 1116, V=instars 1724 (overwintering generation only) and VI=final instars prior to emergence. There were two clear modal densities for each larval stage in each generation, confirming the presence of two cohorts. 4.These modal densities were used to estimate loss rates between successive larval stages, and k-factor analysis' was used to examine the relationship between loss rates for a particular larval stage and the modal value for eggs or larvae at the start of that stage. Loss rates in larval stage II were density dependent and were when population regulation occurred. For all other larval stages, loss rates were density independent and fairly constant with no significant differences between the two generations. Life tables were constructed for egg densities close to the range of modal values found in the stream (133211512m2). The egg density that yielded the maximum number of final instar larvae, and hence adults, was 27002750m2 with poorer survival for initial egg densities below and above these values. 5.This study has shown that (i) the mechanism for population regulation was density-dependent survival in larval stage II (instars 25); (ii) the importance of obtaining information on egg densities and their role in density-dependent processes; (iii) the necessity of frequent sampling for a quantitative description of complex life cycles of aquatic insects.

VL  - 63

AB  - The phenotypic effects of genetic and environmental manipulations have been rarely investigated simultaneously. In addition to phenotypic plasticity, their effect on the amount and directions of genetic and phenotypic variation is of particular evolutionary importance because these constitute the material for natural selection. Here, we used heterozygous insertional mutations of 16 genes involved in the formation of the Drosophila wing. The flies were raised at two developmental temperatures (18 degrees C and 28 degrees C). Landmark-based geometric morphometrics was used to analyze the variation of the wing size and shape at different hierarchical levels: among genotypes and temperatures; among individuals within group; and fluctuating asymmetry (FA). Our results show that (1) the phenotypic effects of the mutations depend on temperature; (2) reciprocally, most mutations affect wing plasticity; (3) both temperature and mutations modify the levels of FA and of among individuals variation within lines. Remarkably, the patterns of shape FA seem unaffected by temperature whereas those associated with individual variation are systematically altered. By modifying the direction of available phenotypic variation, temperature might thus directly affect the potential for further evolution. It suggests as well that the developmental processes responsible for developmental stability and environmental canalization might be partially distinct.

TI  - Behavioural effects of temperature on ectothermic animals: unifying thermal physiology and behavioural plasticity
VL  - 92
IS  - 4
SP  - 1859-1876
AB  - Temperature imposes significant constraints on ectothermic animals, and these organisms have evolved numerous adaptations to respond to these constraints. While the impacts of temperature on the physiology of ectotherms have been extensively studied, there are currently no frameworks available that outline the multiple and often simultaneous pathways by which temperature can affect behaviour. Drawing from the literature on insects, we propose a unified framework that should apply to all ectothermic animals, generalizing temperature's behavioural effects into: (1) kinetic effects, resulting from temperature's bottom-up constraining influence on metabolism and neurophysiology over a range of timescales (from short to long term), and (2) integrated effects, where the top-down integration of thermal information intentionally initiates or modifies a behaviour (behavioural thermoregulation, thermal orientation, thermosensory behavioural adjustments). We discuss the difficulty in distinguishing adaptive behavioural changes from constraints when observing animals' behavioural responses to temperature. We then propose two complementary approaches to distinguish adaptations from constraints, and categorize behaviours according to our framework: (i) kinetic null modelling' of temperature's effects on behaviour; and (ii) behavioural ecology experiments using temperature-insensitive mutants. Our framework should help to guide future research on the complex relationship between temperature and behaviour in ectothermic animals.

TI  - Molecular ecophysiology of Antarctic notothenioid fishes
VL  - 362
IS  - 1488
SP  - 2215-2232
AB  - The notothenioid fishes of the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica are remarkable examples of organismal adaptation to extreme cold. Their evolution since the mid-Miocene in geographical isolation and a chronically cold marine environment has resulted in extreme stenothermality of the extant species. Given the unique thermal history of the notothenioids, one may ask what traits have been gained, and conversely, what characters have been lost through change in the information content of their genomes. Two dramatic changes that epitomize such evolutionary transformations are the gain of novel antifreeze proteins, which are obligatory for survival in icy seawater, by most notothenioids and the paradoxical loss of respiratory haemoproteins and red blood cells, normally deemed indispensable for vertebrate life, by the species of a highly derived notothenioid family, the icefishes. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of these traits and their evolution and suggest future avenues of investigation. The formerly coherent paradigm of notothenioid freeze avoidance, developed from three decades of study of antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP) based cold adaptation, now faces challenges stemming from the recent discovery of antifreeze-deficient, yet freeze-resistant, early notothenioid life stages and from definitive evidence that the liver is not the physiological source of AFGPs in notothenioid blood. The resolution of these intriguing observations is likely to reveal new physiological traits that are unique to the notothenioids. Similarly, the model of AFGP gene evolution from a notothenioid pancreatic trypsinogen-like gene precursor is being expanded and refined based on genome-level analyses of the linked AFGP loci and their ancestral precursors. Finally, the application of comparative genomics to study evolutionary change in the AFGP genotypes of cool-temperate notothenioids from sub-Antarctic habitats, where these genes are not necessary, will contribute to the mechanistic understanding of the dynamics of AFGP gene gain and loss. In humans and most vertebrates, mutations in the alpha- or beta-globin genes or defects in globin chain synthesis are causes of severe genetic disease. Thus, the 16 species of haemoglobinless, erythrocytenull icefishes are surprising anomalies-in fact, they could only have evolved and thrived due to relaxed selection pressure for oxygen-binding proteins in the cold, oxygen-rich waters of the Southern Ocean. Fifteen of the sixteen icefish species have lost most of the adult alpha beta-globin locus and retain only a small 3' fragment of the alpha-globin gene. The only exception to this pattern occurs in Neopagetopsis ionah, which possesses a disrupted alpha beta-globin gene complex that probably represents a non-functional intermediate on the evolutionary pathway to near total globin gene extinction. By contrast, six of the icefish species fail to express myoglobin. The absence of myoglobin expression has occurred by several independent mutations and distinct mechanisms. Haemoprotein loss is correlated with dramatic increases in cellular mitochondrial density, heart size, blood volume and capillary bed volume. Evolution of these compensatory traits was probably facilitated by the homeostatic activity of nitric oxide, a key modulator of angiogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis. These natural knockouts of the red blood cell lineage are an excellent genomic resource for erythroid gene discovery by comparative genomics, as illustrated for the newly described gene, bloodthirsty.

VL  - 138
SP  - 105-115
AB  - Pollutant effects on aquatic key species are confounded by multiple abiotic and biotic stressors. To better discriminate and understand the intrinsic and environmental correlates of changing aquatic ecosystems, we untangle in present study how the effects of a low-dosed fungicide on daphnids (via different exposure routes) becomes modified by increasing temperature and the presence of a predator. Using a fractional multifactorial test design, the individual growth, reproduction and population growth rate of Daphnia pulex were investigated under exposure to the fungicide pyrimethanil at an environmental relevant concentration - either directly (via the water phase), indirectly (via food), dually (via water and food) or for multiple generations (fungicide treated source population) - at three temperatures and in presence/absence of the predator kairomones of Chaoborus flavicans. Our results clearly illustrate that multiple stress factors can modify the response of an aquatic key species to pollutants. The environmentally relevant exposure of the contaminant via food or the medium is of same importance. Nevertheless, temperature and the presence of a predator are the dominant factors controlling the reproduction of D. pulex. We conclude that sublethal pyrimethanil pollution can disturb the zooplankton community at suboptimal temperature conditions, but the effects will become masked by low temperatures or if chaoborid larvae are present.

TI  - Enhanced salinity tolerance of Pomacea canaliculata through acclimation to lower salinities
VL  - 849
IS  - 13
SP  - 3015-3029
AB  - Invasive freshwater species are reported to have tolerance of salinity stress that allows them colonizing new sites in estuaries. Pomacea canaliculata, a gastropod that disperses from its native freshwater habitats to penetrate estuarine environments in invaded regions has raised considerable concern. Previous studies indicated P. canaliculata can survive a short period of exposure at certain environmental salinity. However, salinity tolerance of snails remains unknown in context of a possible long-term acclimation that may further facilitate dispersal into estuaries. Here, in a laboratory experiment, juvenile snails were first exposed to four different levels of pre-acclimation salinity (0, 2, 4 or 6 psu) for 30 days randomly. Snails in each level of pre-acclimation salinity were then transferred to five salinity treatments (8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 psu) separately, with three replicates for each salinity stressor. Pomacea canaliculata pre-acclimated in low salinity environments could survive at least 5 days when exposed to salinities less than 12 psu, with the maximum body weight gains rate (WG, 30.369 +/- 1.418%) and specific growth rate (SGR, 1.326 +/- 0.032% d(-1)). Half of the snails pre-acclimated at 6 psu survived over 25-31 days when exposed to a stressor of 8 psu. The upper limit of pre-acclimation (6 psu) was optimal for post-adaptation of P. canaliculata to stressful saline environments (from 8 to 16 psu). We determined the salinity stress tolerances of the invasive P. canaliculata and examined the effects of salinity pre-acclimation on its survival and growth. The results on enhanced salinity tolerance of P. canaliculata through gradual acclimation is of particular importance to brackish environments (e.g. alkaline lakes, mangrove habitats) of tropical and subtropical coasts. Given the high adaptability of P. canaliculata and its potential threats, early detection and management strategies should urgently be implemented in these regions.

TI  - Longevity for free? Increased reproduction with limited trade-offs in Drosophila melanogaster selected for increased life span
VL  - 48
IS  - 3
SP  - 349-357
AB  - Selection for increased life span in Drosophila melanogaster has been shown to correlate with decreased early fecundity and increased fecundity later in life. This phenomenon has been ascribed to the existence of trade-offs in which limited resources can be invested in either somatic maintenance or reproduction. In our longevity selection lines, we did not find such a trade-off. Rather, we find that females have similar or higher fecundity throughout life compared to non-selected controls. To determine whether increased longevity affects responses in other traits, we looked at several stress resistance traits (chill coma recovery, heat knockdown, desiccation and starvation), geotactic behaviour, egg-to-adult viability, body size, developmental time as well as metabolic rate. Longevity selected flies were more starvation resistant. However, in females longevity and fecundity were not negatively correlated with the other traits assayed. Males from longevity selected lines were slower at recovering from a chill induced coma and resting metabolic rate increased with age, but did not correlate with life span. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - The implications of nongenetic inheritance for evolution in changing environments
VL  - 5
IS  - 2
SP  - 192-201
AB  - Nongenetic inheritance is a potentially important but poorly understood factor in population responses to rapid environmental change. Accumulating evidence indicates that nongenetic inheritance influences a diverse array of traits in all organisms and can allow for the transmission of environmentally induced phenotypic changes (acquired traits), as well as spontaneously arising and highly mutable variants. We review models of adaptation to changing environments under the assumption of a broadened model of inheritance that incorporates nongenetic mechanisms of transmission, and survey relevant empirical examples. Theory suggests that nongenetic inheritance can increase the rate of both phenotypic and genetic change and, in some cases, alter the direction of change. Empirical evidence shows that a diversity of phenotypes spanning a continuum from adaptive to pathological can be transmitted nongenetically. The presence of nongenetic inheritance therefore complicates our understanding of evolutionary responses to environmental change. We outline a research program encompassing experimental studies that test for transgenerational effects of a range of environmental factors, followed by theoretical and empirical studies on the population-level consequences of such effects.

AB  - Experiments were conducted to study the life cycle of Dermestes maculatus and to establish the total developmental time and the developmental time of immature stages, in relation with six different temperatures. We also analyzed the variations in size, morphology, and other indicators of temporal variation during life cycle of D. maculatus, in relation with temperature. One hundred larvae were selected per experiment, reared individually. The remaining larvae were reared to evaluate and establish temporal variations among the instars (length, cephalic width, and dry weight). In all trials, survivorship was greater than 50% and seven larval instars were found. Data of the average developmental time of immature stages and of the total cycle, at different temperatures, are provided. This is of relevance when estimating particularly, a minimum PMI. No relation between morphometric parameters and temperature was found, suggesting that other random factors may have been involved. Thus, this indicates that the method of isomegalen diagrams could not be used for calculating PMI.

TI  - Estimation of Non-physiological Parameter for Electric Power Generation Using a Conventional Bicycle
VL  - 1195
SP  - 179-191
AB  - The need to find new alternative energy sources brings with it the use of unconventional power generation sources such as bicycles and the question arises as to how safe these sources are from the user's perspective. The present work consists in the estimation of a parameter of easy evaluation, for the safe use of a conventional bicycle in the generation of electrical energy. The generation of energy is achieved by coupling a bicycle to an electric alternator and this to an inverter. The load used was a 100 W lamp. The measurement of non-physiological parameters such as vibration, ambient temperature and pedaling speed as well as certain physiological parameters such as heart rate (HR) and body temperature, were used to determine both physiological and electrical signals when the user is overexerting. A protocol oriented to two routines was defined to evaluate the use of the bicycle in conditions of maximum effort and conditions of safe operation. Eight people between the ages of 22 and 32, body weights from 56 kg to 80 kg and heights from 1.59 m to 1.84 m participated. Voltage and current readings were taken to estimate the power and energy generated by the participants. In the process of user-bike interaction it was found that when the participant over-exerted, he/she resorted to compensatory postural movements to maintain the pedaling speed. These compensatory movements made it possible to observe a relationship between the first derivative of vibration and HR.

TI  - Individual-based modelling of Calanus sinicus population dynamics in the Yellow Sea
VL  - 503
SP  - 75-97
AB  - Calanus sinicus is the dominant copepod species in the coastal waters of China. We studied its population dynamics using an individual-based model (IBM) based on physiological processes at the individual level. The model includes modules describing development, growth, reproduction, mortality, diel vertical migration and diapause. Development, growth and reproduction are affected mainly by temperature and food concentration. Mortality includes routine mortality of stage plus density-dependent mortality, and weight-dependent mortality for N1-C6 stages. Control of seasonal diapause is based on lipid accumulation and lipid metabolism. The model was applied in a 1-dimensional water column located in the central Yellow Sea, and simulations showed that the population of C. sinicus peaks twice in 1 yr, with the earlier peak depending strongly on the phytoplankton bloom in spring, and the later (December) peak relying on lipid-stored energy from the over-summering population dominated by diapausing C5s. The model population of C. sinicus goes through 3 generations in 1 yr, and the over-summering population of diapausing C5s consists of both first (G1) and second (G2) generation individuals. Coupled with more extensive field observations of abundance and biomass of C. sinicus, an IBM can be forced using output from an integrated hydrodynamic-nutrient-phytoplankton model to examine the processes responsible for the spatial-temporal variation of C. sinicus throughout its range in the Yellow Sea.

TI  - Effects of Thelytokous Parthenogenesis-Inducing Wolbachia on the Fitness of Trichogramma dendrolimi Matsumura (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) in Superparasitised and Single-Parasitised Hosts
VL  - 9
AB  - Thelytokous Wolbachia-infected Trichogramma species have long been considered as biological control agents against lepidopteran pests in agriculture and forestry. Wolbachia has been suggested to increase the probability of the superparasitism of Trichogramma, but the fate of infected offspring in the superparasitised host is still unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate the fitness of thelytokous Wolbachia-infected (TDW) and bisexual Wolbachia-free (TD) Trichogramma dendrolimi Matsumura (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) lines in superparasitised or single-parasitised hosts. The results showed that irrespective of whether Trichogramma wasps were developed from superparasitised or single-parasitised hosts, the TDW line was characterized by reduced fitness, including lower fecundity, shorter longevity, and smaller body size of F1 offspring, and lower emergence rate of F2 offspring than the TD line. This was not true for the survival rate and developmental time of F1 offspring. Additionally, the fitness parameters of T. dendrolimi that developed from superparasitised hosts were lower compared with that of T. dendrolimi that developed from single-parasitised hosts. Interestingly, Wolbachia-infected females had higher dispersal capacity than bisexual females when they developed from superparasitised hosts. The results indicated that Wolbachia negatively affects fitness of T. dendrolimi, but enhance dispersal capacity of T. dendrolimi females in superparasitism condition. Further studies need to be carried out to select the best line that will allow Wolbachia and their host Trichogramma to be better adapted to one another.

VL  - 15

SP  - 146-155
AB  - The community structure and life cycle of dominant chaetognath species were studied in a 0-1000-m water column in the Oyashio region, western subarctic Pacific, six times during the year from March 2003 to February 2004. The abundance of chaetognaths ranged from 3235 to 6691 inds. m(-2). Throughout the study period, ten chaetognath species belonging to nine genera were identified. Among the chaetognaths, Eukrohnia hamata accounted for 39-62% of the abundance, followed by E. hamata/Eukrohnia bathypelagica juveniles, Parasagitta elegans, and E. bathypelagica. The species diversity (H') of chaetognaths varied between 1.12 and 1.50. For E. hamata, individuals had a body length ranging from 2.3-23.8 mm. The abundance of juveniles fluctuated from 22.0-48.3% and was higher in June 2003. Based on cohort analysis, recruitment of E. hamata juveniles occurred from spring to summer, and they reached a body length of 8 mm in one year. The overwintered population showed rapid growth from June to October, when they reached 15 mm in body length. Eukrohnia hamata showed little growth in winter and reproduced the subsequent spring. Thus, a two-year life cycle of E. hamata is proposed for the population in the Oyashio region. For comparable information about the life cycle of E. hamata, an eight to ten-month generation length was reported for the population in the eastern subarctic Pacific. These regional differences in the generation length of E. hamata are attributed to differences in habitat temperature, with much higher temperatures in the eastern (3.8-6.0 degrees C) than the western (2.3-2.9 degrees C) subarctic Pacific.

VL  - 61
IS  - 2
SP  - 163-171
AB  - The infaunal bivalve Ruditapes decussatus (L.) was collected from Ria Formosa, Fare, southern Portugal, and subjected to a range of selected temperatures (20-35 degrees C). Physiological measurements (clearance rate, respiration rate, excretion rate and absorption efficiency) for the calculation of scope-for-growth were under taken at 20, 27 and 32 degrees C after 48 hours acclimation. Experiments on tolerance to air exposure were performed at 20, 28 and 35 degrees C. Increasing temperature resulted in lower clearance rates, leading to a marked reduction of scope for growth. At 32 degrees C scope for growth was negative indicating that clams were having to utilize their energy reserves. Respiration rate and excretion rate were temperature independent in the range 20 - 32 degrees C; due to seasonal thermal acclimation to environmental fluctuating temperatures. When exposed to air, shell valve gaping was observed at all experimental temperatures, resulting in the utilisation of aerobic metabolic pathways and the utilisation of energy reserves, desiccation and consequently death. Median lethal times were ca. 72 h, 48 h and 10 h at 20, 28 and 35 degrees C, respectively. Temperatures above 28 degrees C can therefore significantly weaken clams resistance to air exposure and affect their performance in water. Even ii effects of exposure to high water and air temperatures, on the tidal flats in the summer, are unknown, raising temperatures constitute a significant physiological stress for the clams.

TI  - Climate predicts both visible and near-infrared reflectance in butterflies
VL  - 24

SP  - 1869-1879
AB  - Climatic gradients frequently predict large-scale ecogeographical patterns in animal coloration, but the underlying causes are often difficult to disentangle. We examined ecogeographical patterns of reflectance among 343 European butterfly species and isolated the role of selection for thermal benefits by comparing animal-visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavebands. NIR light accounts for similar to 50% of solar energy but cannot be seen by animals so functions primarily in thermal control. We found that reflectance of both dorsal and ventral surfaces shows thermally adaptive correlations with climatic factors including temperature and precipitation. This adaptive variation was more prominent in NIR than animal-visible wavebands and for body regions (thorax-abdomen and basal wings) that are most important for thermoregulation. Thermal environments also predicted the reflectance difference between dorsal and ventral surfaces, which may be due to modulation between requirements for heating and cooling. These results highlight the importance of climatic gradients in shaping the reflectance properties of butterflies at a continent-wide scale.

TI  - In vivo modulation of immune response and antioxidant defense in Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua following oral administration of oxolinic acid and florfenicol
VL  - 150
IS  - 4
SP  - 459-464
AB  - Oxolinic acid and florfenicol are the commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases in Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua. The changes in selected innate humoral immune response of the fish, bacterial proliferation in serum and transcriptional activity of selected immune and antioxidant defense-related genes following oral administration of these antimicrobial compounds were evaluated. Juvenile cod (75-100 g) were fed commercial feed coated with either florfenicol (10 mg kg(-1) fish, active ingredient) or oxolinic acid (20 mg kg(-1) fish, active ingredient) at a ration of 0.5% body weight for 10 days. Whole blood and serum samples were collected on the 10th day of feeding the antibiotics and at 3,5 and 10 days after their withdrawal. Serum protein was significantly higher in fish at the 10th day post-withdrawal of both antibiotics. Florfenicol-fed fish had lower myeloperoxidase activity at 3 days post-withdrawal, while there were differential effects on alkaline phosphatase activity. Vibrio anguillarum and Aeromonas salmonicida were significantly reduced in the sera of antibiotics-fed fish until the 5th day post-withdrawal. Florfenicol could inhibit V. anguillarum better than oxolinic acid, while A. salmonicida was more susceptible than V. anguillarum upon treatment with both antibiotics. Furthermore, transcriptional profiles of selected genes related to bacterial defense, inflammation and antioxidant defense were dependent on the type of antibiotics that was administered and the time of sampling. These results indicate that oral administration of antibiotics modulates the immune response and antioxidant defense in Atlantic cod and these may, in turn, affect their ability to resist bacterial pathogens.

TI  - Role of TRP channels and HSPs in thermal stress response in the aphid parasitoid Aphelinus asychis (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae)
VL  - 19
IS  - 6
SP  - 1530-1542
AB  - Aphelinus asychis is an important aphid endoparasitoid. Under field and greenhouse conditions, high temperature is one of the factors limiting the application of A. asychis for biological pest control. To explore the potential role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and heat shock proteins (HSPs) in this process, we identified 11 genes encoding TRP channels and nine genes encoding HSPs. Three proteins (AasyTRPA5, AasyPyrexia, AasyPainless) that belong to transient receptor potential ankyrin (TRPA) subfamily and nine HSPs are involved in the response to high temperature. We also investigated the survival of A. asychis and the response of the identified TRP channels and HSPs to high temperature. The results showed that the maximum temperature that allowed A. asychis survival was approximately 41 degrees C; females had higher survival rates than that of the males at 40 and 41 degrees C. Short-term heat-shock resulted in increased expression of Aasyshsp in males, and Aasyhsp40, Aasyhsp68, Aasyhsp70-4, Aasyhsp70-5 and Aasyhsp90 were upregulated and then downregulated, whereas Aasyhsp70-3 was upregulated at 41 degrees C. Moreover, Aasyhsp40 and Aasyhsp90 showed higher expression levels in females, while Aasyshsp and Aasyhsp70-3 presented opposite expression patterns. At temperature above 35 degrees C, expression of AasyPyrexia in females was significant higher than that in males, whereas AasyPainless and AasyTRPA5 presented higher expression in males at 40 and 41 degrees C, respectively. Altogether, these results indicate that protection against thermal stress in A. asychis is coordinated by TRP channels and HSPs. These findings provide a basis for understanding the potential mechanism of A. asychis in response to high temperatures.

TI  - Performance comparison of dwarf laying hens segregating for the naked neck gene in temperate and subtropical environments
VL  - 41
AB  - This study compares laying performances between two environments of dwarf laying hen lines segregating for the naked neck mutation (NA locus), a selected dwarf line of brown-egg layers and its control line. Layers with one of the three genotypes at the NA locus were produced from 11 sires from the control line and 12 sires from the selected line. Two hatches produced 216 adult hens in Taiwan and 297 hens in France. Genetic parameters for laying traits were estimated in each environment and the ranking of sire breeding values was compared between environments. Laying performance was lower, and mortality was higher in Taiwan than in France. The line by environment interaction was highly significant for body weight at 16 weeks, clutch length and egg number, with or without Box-Cox transformation. The selected line was more sensitive to environmental change but in Taiwan it could maintain a higher egg number than the control line. Estimated heritability values in the selected line were higher in France than in Taiwan, but not for all the traits in the control line. The rank correlations between sire breeding values were low within the selected line and slightly higher in the control line. A few sire families showed a good ranking in both environments, suggesting that some families may adapt better to environmental change.

TI  - Differences in feeding adaptations in intertidal and subtidal suspension-feeding gastropods: studies on Crepidula fornicata and Crepipatella peruviana
VL  - 162
IS  - 5
SP  - 1047-1059
AB  - Suspension-feeding organisms living in the intertidal zone experience reduced feeding times associated with periodic aerial exposure. The potential morphological and physiological adaptations to this reduced feeding time were investigated for two closely related gastropods, Crepidula fornicata and Crepipatella peruviana. Intertidal C. fornicata had heavier gills than subtidal conspecifics, a difference mediated by larger gill surface areas and greater numbers of gill filaments among intertidal individuals of a given size. In contrast, the gills of intertidal and subtidal C. peruviana were morphologically indistinguishable. Despite relatively larger food-collecting organs, individuals of C. fornicata from the intertidal zone had clearance rates (CR) that were not significantly different from those of subtidal conspecifics. In contrast, the CR of intertidal C. peruviana were significantly lower than those of subtidal conspecifics. The low CR of intertidal C. peruviana may be partially explained by significantly lower measured particle transport velocities across their gills. In the context of feeding, intertidal individuals of C. fornicata performed at least as well as subtidal conspecifics, resulting in a population whose adults were as large as those found subtidally. This suggests that C. fornicata has had a long interaction with the environmental heterogeneity associated with intertidal life. In contrast, intertidal individuals of C. peruviana were on average smaller than subtidal individuals and may be stressed in the intertidal.

TI  - Grandmaternal age at reproduction affects grandoffspring body condition, reproduction and survival in a wild population of lizards
VL  - 36

SP  - 826-836
AB  - Age at reproduction can influence the survival and future reproduction of an individual as well as that of their offspring. Remarkably, it has been shown that grandmaternal age at reproduction can also affect the characteristics of grandoffspring in humans and in laboratory or semi-captive animals. However, currently we do not know whether grandmaternal age effects exist in wild populations. We gathered data on female age at reproduction, offspring and grandoffspring characteristics using a 16-year long-term survey of a natural population of the common lizard, Zootoca vivipara. The dataset contains 579 grandoffspring from 135 litters. Body size at birth was not correlated with grandmaternal age at reproduction. However, grandoffspring body condition at birth, grandoffspring survival and reproductive performance of granddaughters were dependent on grandmaternal age. These relationships were independent of maternal age. An age-structured model showed that the global effect of grandmaternal age was nonlinear and was largely driven by its effect on grandoffspring survival. Fitness was higher for granddaughters produced by grandmothers of intermediate ages. The study shows that age can shape life-history traits for more than one generation, documenting the importance that grandmaternal age can have in wild populations.

TI  - Benefits, costs and reactivity of inducible defences: an experimental test with rotifers
VL  - 55
IS  - 10
SP  - 2114-2122
AB  - P>1. A key aspect of the ecology and evolution of adaptive prey responses to predator risk is the timing by which the former develop a defensive trait in response to inducing signals released by the latter. This property, called reactivity, has been shown to affect population stability and persistence. 2. Theoretically, the minimal predator density required by prey to exhibit induced defences is expected to increase with the effectiveness of the defence and decrease with its cost. Likewise, the time required for the prey population to exhibit an induced defence is expected to increase together with cost. 3. The freshwater rotifers Brachionus calyciflorus and B. havanaensis and their predator Asplanchna brightwelli were used to test the hypothesis that prey species exhibiting defences that offer a larger fitness benefit and lower fitness cost are more reactive to predator signals, in terms of requiring shorter exposure time and lower signal concentration to trigger a morphological defence reaction. 4. Our results showed that both prey species exhibited costly and effective defences after induction by predator infochemicals. Faster reactions were observed at higher levels of predator cues. Nevertheless, the observed relationship between reactivity and benefit/cost of defences did not agree with our expectations. 5. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which the timing of induction of morphological defences is experimentally assessed over a gradient of risk signals. We propose new research directions to disentangle the mechanisms and project the consequences of prey decisions at the morphological level.

TI  - Plastic and evolved responses of larval tracheae and mass to varying atmospheric oxygen content in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 207
IS  - 20
SP  - 3559-3567
AB  - Structural changes in the tracheal system during development have the potential to allow insects to compensate for varying oxygen availability. Despite possible compensation, oxygen level during development may also affect insect body size. We investigated how atmospheric oxygen level affects the dimensions of the main dorsal tracheae (DT) and masses of larval Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen) reared for up to six generations in 10%, 21% or 40% O-2 at 25degreesC. Wandering-stage third-instar larvae were weighed every other generation, and the dimensions of the DT were measured. Hypoxia produced significantly lighter larvae after one generation of exposure, while hyperoxia did not affect larval mass. Atmospheric oxygen content did not significantly change the diameters of the anterior portions of the main tracheae; however, the posterior diameters were strongly affected. During the first generation of exposure, tracheal diameters were inversely proportional to rearing oxygen levels, demonstrating that developmental plasticity in DT diameters can partially (8-15%) compensate for variation in atmospheric oxygen level. After multiple generations in differing atmospheres and two further generations in 21% O-2, larvae had tracheal diameters inversely related to their historical oxygen exposure, suggesting that atmospheric oxygen can produce heritable changes in insect tracheal morphology.

TI  - Coadaptation: A unifying principle in evolutionary thermal biology
VL  - 79
IS  - 2
SP  - 282-294
AB  - Over the last 50 yr, thermal biology has shifted from a largely physiological science to a more integrated science of behavior, physiology, ecology, and evolution. Today, the mechanisms that underlie responses to environmental temperature are being scrutinized at levels ranging from genes to organisms. From these investigations, a theory of thermal adaptation has emerged that describes the evolution of thermoregulation, thermal sensitivity, and thermal acclimation. We review and integrate current models to form a conceptual model of coadaptation. We argue that major advances will require a quantitative theory of coadaptation that predicts which strategies should evolve in specific thermal environments. Simply combining current models, however, is insufficient to understand the responses of organisms to thermal heterogeneity; a theory of coadaptation must also consider the biotic interactions that influence the net benefits of behavioral and physiological strategies. Such a theory will be challenging to develop because each organism's perception of and response to thermal heterogeneity depends on its size, mobility, and life span. Despite the challenges facing thermal biologists, we have never been more pressed to explain the diversity of strategies that organisms use to cope with thermal heterogeneity and to predict the consequences of thermal change for the diversity of communities.

AB  - Life-history traits or "fitness components"-such as age and size at maturity, fecundity and fertility, age-specific rates of survival, and life span-are the major phenotypic determinants of Darwinian fitness. Analyzing the evolution and genetics of these phenotypic targets of selection is central to our understanding of adaptation. Due to its simple and rapid life cycle, cosmopolitan distribution, ease of maintenance in the laboratory, well-understood evolutionary genetics, and its versatile genetic toolbox, the "vinegar fly" Drosophila melanogaster is one of the most powerful, experimentally tractable model systems for studying "life-history evolution." Here, I review what has been learned about the evolution and genetics of life-history variation in D. melanogaster by drawing on numerous sources spanning population and quantitative genetics, genomics, experimental evolution, evolutionary ecology, and physiology. This body of work has contributed greatly to our knowledge of several fundamental problems in evolutionary biology, including the amount and maintenance of genetic variation, the evolution of body size, clines and climate adaptation, the evolution of senescence, phenotypic plasticity, the nature of life-history trade-offs, and so forth. While major progress has been made, important facets of these and other questions remain open, and the D. melanogaster system will undoubtedly continue to deliver key insights into central issues of life-history evolution and the genetics of adaptation.

TI  - Can respiratory physiology predict thermal niches?
VL  - 1365
SP  - 73-88
AB  - Predicting species responses to global warming is the holy grail of climate change science. As temperature directly affects physiological rates, it is clear that a mechanistic understanding of species vulnerability should be grounded in organismal physiology. Here, we review what respiratory physiology can offer the field of thermal ecology, showcasing different perspectives on how respiratory physiology can help explain thermal niches. In water, maintaining adequate oxygen delivery to fuel the higher metabolic rates under warming conditions can become the weakest link, setting thermal tolerance limits. This has repercussions for growth and scaling of metabolic rate. On land, water loss is more likely to become problematic as long as O-2 delivery and pH balance can be maintained, potentially constraining species in their normal activity. Therefore, high temperatures need not be lethal, but can still affect the energy intake of an animal, with concomitant consequences for long-term fitness. While respiratory challenges and adaptive responses are diverse, there are clear recurring elements such as oxygen uptake, CO2 excretion, and water homeostasis. We show that respiratory physiology has much to offer the field of thermal ecology and call for an integrative, multivariate view incorporating respiratory challenges, thermal responses, and energetic consequences. Fruitful areas for future research are highlighted.

TI  - Fish growth and degree-days I: selecting a base temperature for a within-population study
VL  - 71

SP  - 47-55
AB  - Degree-days (DD) are an increasingly popular method for explaining variation in fish growth and development. By including a base temperature (T-o) the DD formula limits calculations T-o temperatures that are relevant T-o growth. However, our review of growth studies shows multiple T-o values in use for a given fish species. T-o determine how T-o affects the ability of DD T-o explain within-population growth variation, we first show that the ability of DD T-o describe a growing season is robust T-o low values of T-o. We then analyze immature length data from eight species and 85 water bodies in North America T-o show that there is a broad range of T-o values that effectively explain growth variation. Based on these results, we argue that precise T-o estimates are unwarranted for most single-population studies and recommend standard T-o values (0, 5, 10, 15 degrees C). Standardization facilitates comparative studies and promotes the use of DD in future research. To this end, we provide equations for converting annual DD at a given T-o to annual DD at a standard T-o.

TI  - Temporal instability of lake charr phenotypes: Synchronicity of growth rates and morphology linked to environmental variables?
VL  - 14
IS  - 4
SP  - 1159-1177
AB  - Pathways through which phenotypic variation among individuals arise can be complex. One assumption often made in relation to intraspecific diversity is that the stability or predictability of the environment will interact with expression of the underlying phenotypic variation. To address biological complexity below the species level, we investigated variability across years in morphology and annual growth increments between and within two sympatric lake charr Salvelinus namaycush ecotypes in Rush Lake, USA. A rapid phenotypic shift in body and head shape was found within a decade. The magnitude and direction of the observed phenotypic change were consistent in both ecotypes, which suggests similar pathways caused the variation over time. Over the same time period, annual growth increments declined for both lake charr ecotypes and corresponded with a consistent phenotypic shift of each ecotype. Despite ecotype-specific annual growth changes in response to winter conditions, the observed annual growth shift for both ecotypes was linked, to some degree, with variation in the environment. Particularly, a declining trend in regional cloud cover was associated with an increase of early-stage (ages 1-3) annual growth for lake charr of Rush Lake. Underlying mechanisms causing changes in growth rates and constrained morphological modulation are not fully understood. An improved knowledge of the biology hidden within the expression of phenotypic variation promises to clarify our understanding of temporal morphological diversity and instability.

TI  - Effect of Parental Photoperiod on Body Size and Developmental Time of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) in Buenos Aires City
VL  - 58
IS  - 4
SP  - 1638-1642
AB  - Many insects use photoperiod as a signal to anticipate upcoming unfavorable conditions. Photoperiod sensitivity may be a relevant factor in Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (L.) populations at the cool margins of the species' range, where winter conditions have a strong effect on population dynamics. In this study, we evaluated the effect of parental photoperiod on preimaginal survival and developmental time, and on wing length for the first generation of Ae. aegypti from a temperate region (Buenos Aires City, Argentina). Our experiment started with eggs from parents exposed to short-day (SD; 10:14 [L:D]) or long-day (LD; 14:10 [L:D]) photoperiods during their entire life span. Eggs were stored under the same photoperiod (SD or LD) as their parents for 91 d, until immersion. After hatching, larvae were reared until adult emergence in thermal baths at one of two constant temperatures (17 or 23 degrees C), at a photoperiod of 12:12 (L:D) h and fed ad libitum. Survival from larva I to adult emergence was not affected either by parental photoperiod or rearing temperature. At a rearing temperature of 23 degrees C, female offspring from the SD parental photoperiod developed faster and had shorter wings compared with those from the LD parental photoperiod. No effect of parental photoperiod was observed on female offspring reared at 17 degrees C. In male offspring, parental photoperiod had no effect on developmental time and wing length, independently of the rearing temperature. Results indicate that the parental photoperiod may affect some offspring traits. This effect may be a characteristic of Ae. aegypti populations in temperate regions to deal with the winter conditions.

AB  - 1. One of the central questions in evolutionary ecology is how different functional capacities impact fitness, and how it varies across populations. For instance, do phenotypic attributes influence fitness similarly across geographic gradients? Which traits (physiological, morphological and life history) are most likely to be targets of natural selection? Do particular combinations of traits maximize fitness? 2. In a semi-natural experiment, we analysed introduced populations of an invasive species, the garden snail (Cornu aspersum) in Chile, which show low levels of genetic differentiation in spite of the distance. Specifically, we addressed whether the magnitude, sign and form of selection in snail populations could explain the differentiation (or its absence) among populations. 3. A common garden/reciprocal transplant experiment was performed in three populations (La Serena, Constitucion and Valdivia) that span a 1300-km latitudinal gradient and differ markedly in climate (semi-arid north to humid south). We released c.450 individuals per population (two generations after field-captured snails) in replicated enclosures at the range extremes (La Serena and Valdivia). Morphological (size and shell darkness), physiological (standard metabolic rate and digestive efficiency) and life-history [growth rate (GR)] traits were measured in all snails before the release. Survival was recorded monthly during 1year. 4. Survival was significantly higher in snails from La Serena than in snails from Constitucion and Valdivia, when raised at La Serena. However, at Valdivia, survival was not different among source populations. Interestingly, we found negative correlational selection in M-B and SMRR at La Serena, whereas at Valdivia we only found directional selection on GR and M-B, and stabilizing selection on SMRR. 5. These results suggest that selection on physiological traits related with energy allocation is pervasive, irrespective of climate and distance.

TI  - EVOLUTION OF SPRINT SPEED IN LACERTID LIZARDS - MORPHOLOGICAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND BEHAVIORAL COVARIATION
VL  - 49
IS  - 5
SP  - 848-863
AB  - Organismal performance abilities occupy a central position in phenotypic evolution; they are determined by suites of interacting lower-level traits (e.g., morphology and physiology) and they are a primary focus of natural selection. The mechanisms by which higher levels of organismal performance are achieved during evolution are therefore fundamentally important for understanding correlated evolution in general and coadaptation in particular. Here we address correlated evolution of morphological, physiological, and behavioral characteristics that influence interspecific variation in sprint speed in a clade of lacertid lizards. Phylogenetic analyses using independent contrasts indicate that the evolution of high maximum sprinting abilities (measured on a photocell-timed racetrack) has occurred via the evolution of (1) longer hind limbs relative to body size, and (2) a higher physiologically optimum temperature for sprinting. For ectotherms, which experience variable body temperatures while active, sprinting abilities in nature depend on both maximum capacities and relative performance levels (i.e., percent of maximum) that can be attained. With respect to temperature effects, relative performance levels are determined by the interaction between thermal physiology and thermoregulatory behavior. Among the 13 species or subspecies of lizards in the present study, differences in the optimal temperature for sprinting (body temperature at which lizards run fastest) closely matched interspecific variation in median preferred body temperature (measured in a laboratory photothermal gradient), indicating correlated evolution of thermal physiology and thermal preferences. Variability of the preferred body temperatures maintained by each species is, across species, negatively correlated with the thermal-performance breadth (range of body temperatures over which lizards can run relatively fast). This pattern leads to interspecific differences in the levels of relative sprint speed that lizards are predicted to attain while active at their preferred temperatures. The highest levels of predicted relative performance are achieved by species that combine a narrow, precise distribution of preferred temperatures with the ability to sprint at near-maximum speeds over a wide range of body temperatures. The observed among-species differences in predicted relative speed were positively correlated with the interspecific variation in maximum sprinting capacities. Thus, species that attain the highest maximum speeds are (1) also able to run at near-maximum levels over a wide range of temperatures and (2) also maintain body temperatures within a narrow zone near the optimal temperature for sprinting. The observed pattern of correlated evolution therefore has involved traits at distinct levels of biological organization, that is, morphology, physiology, and behavior; and tradeoffs are not evident. We hypothesize that this particular trait combination has evolved in response to coadaptational selection pressures. We also discuss our results in the context of possible evolutionary responses to global climatic change.

TI  - Contemporary divergence in migratory timing of naturalized populations of chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, in New Zealand
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SP  - 45-54
AB  - Hypotheses: Recently established populations, sharing common ancestry but facing different reproductive habitat seasonality, will genetically diverge in the timing of their reproductive migrations. Organism: Exotic populations of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) established from common ancestors introduced to South Island of New Zealand between 1901 and 1907. Site of experiments: Early rearing at Silverstream Hatchery, Waimakariri River, New Zealand, followed by release to sea, growth in coastal ocean, and return to freshwater. Methods: We reared early- and late-spawned juveniles from two populations that differ in spawning time in the wild, and released those fish to mature at sea. We obtained dates of migratory return to freshwater, fish age, and experimental group identity from angler captures at river mouths. Analyses involved assessment of population, spawning date, and age at return effects for the current experiment, plus an expanded analysis of data from previous release experiments. Results: After 26 generations, the population that reproduces later in the wild now returns to freshwater an average of 18 days later than the early spawning population. This divergence is likely genetic, given the common-garden nature of our experimental design, and was apparent even after accounting for significant effects of age at return and marginal effects of initial spawning date.

SP  - 2077-2089
AB  - We conducted laboratory experiments to examine the functional response and conducted comparative laboratory and field studies to examine the prey selection of walleye, Stizostedion vitreum, larvae. Maximum consumption rate (C-max, micrograms per hour) increased exponentially with walleye mean length whereas the prey abundance at which 90% of C-max is attained (D-90, prey per litre) increased initially and then declined with mean length. Prey size had no significant effect on C-max whereas D-90 declined significantly with increasing prey size. Selection for relatively larger prey and selection for large cladocerans relative to cyclopoid copepods increased significantly with walleye mean length. Walleye larvae consistently selected most strongly for relatively uncommon prey. Selection for relatively smaller prey and selection for cyclopoid copepods relative to large cladocerans increased significantly with total prey abundance in field studies and some laboratory studies. Variance in prey selection showed a significant, negative relationship with prey abundance in laboratory studies. Selection for medium (greater than or equal to 0.3-0.6 mm body width) relative to smalt (<0.3 mm) prey declined significantly with increasing temperature in field studies. Our results suggest that the feeding success of walleye larvae may be limited by both the abundance and size composition of the zooplankton communities in natural environments.

TI  - Osteology of the Asian narrow-mouth toad Kaloula borealis (Amphibia, Anura, Microhylidae) with comments on its osteological adaptation to fossorial life
VL  - 101
IS  - 4
SP  - 366-383
AB  - Osteology of vertebrates plays an indispensable role in taxonomy, form-function evolution and ecological adaptations. The Asian narrow-mouth toad genus Kaloula is an interesting group that is known for many species having a fossorial life. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive osteological account of Kaloula. Herein, we present the osteology of K. borealis with the help of micro-CT scanning and double-staining technologies, which is the first detailed osteological description of the genus. Osteological comparisons with other members of Microhylinae indicate that K. borealis is characterized by the following traits: skull obviously wider than long; suture between frontoparietals narrow; parasphenoid posterior to vomer; premaxilla, maxilla and vomer edentate; clavicles absent; procoracoids small; omosternum and sternum cartilaginous; crista femoris present and large; femur longer than tibiofibula; prehallux including one element. Remarkably, the species possesses a series of osteological specializations that probably are adaptations for the hindlimbs-first burrowing and a fossorial life, including stout hindlimb, robust crista femoris, tibiofibula shorter than femur, enlarged prehallux, long anterior ramus of the pterygoid and branched bronchial processes of the cricoid. These findings will contribute to the systematics of microhylids and evolutionary interpretations of the osteological adaptation to fossorial life.

AB  - Coccinella septempunctata L. was reared under laboratory conditions using allogamy technique aiming to convert the natural local progeny to laboratory progeny for the purpose of continuing the predator production, as well to sustain numerical values of its biological and morphological parameters. The research was conducted on local C septempunctata strains collected from agro-ecosystems in the Syrian coast. The results proved the stability of the genetic structure of such progenies through three generations as all statistical differences were non-significant at 5% significance level. Also, the results confirmed the response of these progenies to the abovementioned method where fecundity raised (7.5%) from 98.2 +/- 20.8 in parent generation (Po) to 105.6 +/- 20.3 in 2(nd) generation (172). Predation rate of larvae raised (6.8%) from 88.8 +/- 2.87 in Po to 94.8 +/- 12.31 in F2. As well were the values of all other biological parameters (developmental period, reproductively, survival rates and female body length).

TI  - Genetic explorations of recent human metabolic adaptations: hypotheses and evidence
VL  - 87
IS  - 4
SP  - 838-855
AB  - Since humans and chimpanzees split from a common ancestor over 6 million years ago, human metabolism has changed dramatically. This change includes adaptations to a high-quality diet, the evolution of an energetically expensive brain, dramatic increases in endurance abilities, and capacity for energy storage in white adipose tissue. Human metabolism continues to evolve in modern human populations in response to local environmental and cultural selective forces. Understanding the nature of these selective forces and the physiological responses during human evolution is a compelling challenge for evolutionary biologists. The complex genetic architecture surrounding metabolic phenotypes indicates that selection probably altered allelic frequencies across many loci in populations experiencing adaptive metabolic change to fit their environment. A recent analysis supports this hypothesis, finding that classic selective sweeps at single loci were rare during the past 250 000 years of human evolution. Detection of selective signatures at multiple loci, as well as exploration of physiological adaptation to environment in humans, will require cross-disciplinary collaboration, including the incorporation of biological pathway analysis. This review explores the Thrifty Genotype Hypothesis, high-altitude adaptation, cold-resistance adaptation, and genetic evidence surrounding these proposed metabolic adaptations in an attempt to clarify current challenges and avenues for future progress.

VL  - 49
IS  - 6
SP  - 1097-1106
AB  - In three years, maximum seawater adaptability in 2-yr-old Baltic salmon (Salmo salar) was found during a period of about 2 wk in late May - early June. At this time the previously mature males developed in one of two directions, One group (8-44%) developed a seawater adaptability comparable with that of immature fish whereas the other did not. Previously mature males that did not adapt to seawater had larger gonadosomatic indices than males with good performance in seawater. Individually tagged previously mature males and immature fish released into the river in spring had a total adult recapture rate of 1.6 and 11.6%, respectively. In both groups the recapture rate was highest for fish released about 2 wk before the time of optimal seawater adaptability. The effect of size on recapture rate was more pronounced among previously mature males than among immature fish, with a particularly low recapture rate of small previously mature males. It is suggested that previously mature male parr can either mature sexually again or complete smoltification in spring and that the probability for smoltification and seaward migration is affected by body size and the conditions for growth during the previous autumn-winter.

VL  - 49

SP  - 864-873
AB  - The evolutionary significance of sex-determining mechanisms, particularly temperature-dependent sex de termination (TSD) in reptiles, has remained unresolved despite extensive theoretical work. To investigate the evolutionary significance of this unusual sex-determining mechanism, I incubated eggs of the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) at a male-producing temperature (26 degrees C), a female-producing temperature (30 degrees C), and an intermediate temperature that produced both sexes about equally (28 degrees C). Laboratory experiments indicated that two performance variables, but no morphological measurements, were significantly influenced by incubation temperature (P less than or equal to 0.05): hatchlings from cooler incubation treatments swam faster than turtles from warmer incubation treatments, and hatchlings from 28 degrees C exhibited a greater propensity to run than did individuals from 26 degrees C and 30 degrees C. In the field, hatchlings from the all-male and all-female producing temperatures had significantly higher first-year survivorship than did consexuals from the incubation temperature that produced both sexes (G = 6.622, P = 0.03). Significant directional selection was detected on propensity of hatchlings to run (beta' = -0.758, P = 0.05): turtles that tended to remain immobile had a higher probability of first-year survivorship than did individuals that moved readily. Thus, the effects of the gender x incubation temperature interaction on survivorship of hatchling turtles observed in the field experiment may have been mediated by temperature-dependent antipredator behavior. These results provide a possible functional explanation for the evolutionary significance of TSD in turtles that is consistent with predictions of theoretical models.

TI  - Species' thermal ranges predict changes in reef fish community structure during 8 years of extreme temperature variation
VL  - 24
IS  - 8
SP  - 1036-1046
AB  - Aim: To assess whether observed thermal bounds in species' latitudinal ranges (i.e., realized thermal niches) can be used to predict patterns of occurrence and abundance changes observed during a marine heatwave, relative to other important life history and functional traits. Location: Rottnest Island, Western Australia. Methods: A time series of standardized quantitative surveys of reef fishes spanning 8years of pronounced ocean temperature change is used to test whether accurate predictions on shifts in species occupancy and abundance are possible using species traits. Results: Species-level responses in occurrence and abundance were closely related to the mid-point of their realized thermal niche, more so than body size, range size or trophic level. Most of the species that disappeared from survey counts during the heatwave were characterized by geographic ranges that did not extend to latitudes with temperatures equivalent to the ocean temperature peak during the heatwave. We thus find support for the hypothesis that current distribution limits are set directly or indirectly by temperature and are highly responsive to ocean temperature variability. Main conclusions: Our study shows that reef fish community structure can change very quickly when exposed to extreme thermal anomalies, in directions predicted from the realized thermal niche of the species present. Such predictions can thus identify species that will be most responsive to changing ocean climate. Continued warming, coupled with periodic extreme heat events, may lead to the loss of ecosystem services and ecological functions, as mobile species relocate to more hospitable climes, while less mobile species may head towards extinction.

VL  - 30

SP  - 481-498
AB  - Local adaptation can occur at small spatial scales relative to the dispersal capacity of species. Alpine ecosystems have sharp environmental clines that offer an opportunity to investigate the effects of fine-scale shifts in species' niche breadth on adaptive genetic processes. Here we examine two grasshopper species endemic to the Australian Alps (Kosciuscola spp.) that differ in elevational niche breadth: one broader, K. usitatus (1400-2200 m), and one narrower, K. tristis (1600-2000 m). We examine signatures of selection with respect to environmental and morphological variables in two mountain regions using F-ST outlier tests and environmental association analyses (EAAs) applied to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data (K. usitatus: 9017 SNPs, n = 130; K. tristis: 7363 SNPs, n = 135). Stronger genetic structure was found in the more narrowly distributed K. tristis, which showed almost twice the number of SNPs under putative selection (10.8%) compared with K. usitatus (5.3%). When examining SNPs in common across species (n = 3058), 260 SNPs (8.5%) were outliers shared across species, and these were mostly associated with elevation, a proxy for temperature, suggesting parallel adaptive processes in response to climatic drivers. Additive polygenic scores (an estimate of the cumulative signal of selection across all candidate loci) were nonlinearly and positively correlated with elevation in both species. However, a steeper correlation in K. tristis indicated a stronger signal of spatially varying selection towards higher elevations. Our study illustrates that the niche breadth of co-occurring and related species distributed along the same environmental cline is associated with differences in patterns of microgeographical adaptation.

TI  - A dated molecular phylogeny of manta and devil rays (Mobulidae) based on mitogenome and nuclear sequences
VL  - 83
SP  - 72-85
AB  - Manta and devil rays are an iconic group of globally distributed pelagic filter feeders, yet their evolutionary history remains enigmatic. We employed next generation sequencing of mitogenomes for nine of the II recognized species and two outgroups; as well as additional Sanger sequencing of two mitochondria] and two nuclear genes in an extended taxon sampling set. Analysis of the mitogenome coding regions in a Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian framework provided a well-resolved phylogeny. The deepest divergences distinguished three clades with high support, one containing Manta birostris, Manta alfredi, Mobuki tarapacana, Mobula japanica and Mobula mobular; one containing Mobula kuhlii, Mobula eregoodootenkee and Mobula thurstoni; and one containing Mobula munkiana, Mobula hypostoma and Mobula rochebrunei. Mobula remains paraphyletic with the inclusion of Manta, a result that is in agreement with previous studies based on molecular and morphological data. A fossil-calibrated Bayesian random local clock analysis suggests that mobulids diverged from Rhinoptera around 30 Mya. Subsequent divergences are characterized by long internodes followed by short bursts of speciation extending from an initial episode of divergence in the Early and Middle Miocene (19-17 Mya) to a second episode during the Pliocene and Pleistocene (3.6 Mya - recent). Estimates of divergence dates overlap significantly with periods of global warming, during which upwelling intensity - and related high primary productivity in upwelling regions decreased markedly. These periods are hypothesized to have led to fragmentation and isolation of feeding regions leading to possible regional extinctions, as well as the promotion of allopatric speciation. The closely shared evolutionary history of mobulids in combination with ongoing threats from fisheries and climate change effects on upwelling and food supply, reinforces the case for greater protection of this charismatic family of pelagic filter feeders.

We included studies that either document phenotypic changes through time or space. Plasticity had a clear and ubiquitous role in promoting phenotypic changes in response to climate variation. For adaptive evolution, we found no direct evidence for evolution of amphibians or reptiles in response to climate change over time. However, we found many studies that documented adaptive responses to climate along spatial gradients. Plasticity provided a mixture of adaptive and maladaptive responses to climate change, highlighting that plasticity frequently, but not always, could ameliorate climate change. Based on our review, we advocate for more experiments that survey genetic changes through time in response to climate change. Overall, plastic and genetic variation in amphibians and reptiles could buffer some of the formidable threats from climate change, but large uncertainties remain owing to limited data.

TI  - Metal Thermal Interface Material for the Next Generation FCBGA
SP  - 613-618
AB  - Thermal interface materials (TIMs) have been widely adopted for improved thermal dissipation in flip chip ball grid array (FCBGA), flip chip lidded ball grid array (FCLGA) and flip chip pin grid array (FCPGA) packaging. As the next generation devices' requirements for power get even higher, enhanced thermal performance at the package level is increasingly important. A typical TIM applies a polymer type, but the current polymer TIM products are insufficient to meet the advanced product roadmap requirements due to lack of thermal conductivity, TIM delamination on large size die, unstable process workability and other reasons. Even potential candidates for a high thermal conductivity TIMs, such as silver (Ag)-Sintered TIM and graphite sheet have difficulties covering all the development goals of a large body package due to high thermal resistance, poor TIM coverage or too thick bond line thickness (BLT). To meet the high-end central processing unit (CPU) market's needs, an indium (In) TIM has been selected for FCLGA or FCPGA products. A pure indium TIM has a low liquidus point and provides a good way to reduce stress during In TIM soldering. However, this characterization of Indium TIM could be a weak point for FCBGAs which need an additional reflow process after TIM and lid attachment. TIM re-melting could occur during the reflow process and affect TIM coverage, cause delamination and create a component shortage issue. This is one of the main reasons that a pure indium TIM is hard to apply on FCBGA devices. In this paper, a metal TIM (In and tin (Sn) alloy) will be discussed as a solution for next generation FCBGAs that have a large body size and require high thermal conductivity. These new alloy TIMs are expected to provide better thermal dissipation performance due to both a "high liquid phase point" and a "low solid phase point.".

VL  - 28
IS  - 6
SP  - 1553-1563
AB  - To fully understand the evolution of sexual dimorphism, it is necessary to study how genetic and developmental systems function to generate sex-specific phenotype as well as sex-specific selection. Males and females show different patterns of energy storage and mitochondrial metabolism from early stages of life, and this may underlie sex-specific developmental pathway to shape both juvenile and adult phenotype. Here, we examined sex-specific relationships between juvenile morphology and behavior, and transcriptional profiles of 4 candidate genes related to mitochondrial function in the 3-spined stickleback. This study provides, for the first time to our knowledge, evidence for sex differences in melanin pigmentation and antipredator behavior as well as the expression of mitochondria-related genes in juvenile sticklebacks. Males were paler and bolder, and overexpressed genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and antioxidant enzymes compared to females. Relationships between phenotypic traits and gene expression were also sex-specific. In general, females showed stronger positive correlations between body size or pigmentation and the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and activity. In both sexes, more fearful individuals overexpressed those genes. Our results suggest that mitochondrial function may either facilitate or constrain sex-specific responses to selection on dimorphic phenotype, possibly generating intralocus sexual conflict on the transcriptional regulation of mito-nuclear genes during ontogeny. This study highlights that mitochondrial regulation plays an important role in the process of phenotypic differentiation between the 2 sexes from early stages of life before apparent sexual dimorphism appears.

VL  - 127
IS  - 1
SP  - 311-320
AB  - Stressful environments may increase quantitative genetic variation in populations by promoting the expression of genetic variation that has not previously been eliminated or canalized by natural selection. This "selection history" hypothesis predicts that novel stressors will increase quantitative genetic variation, and that the magnitude of this effect will decrease following continued stress exposure. We tested these predictions using Drosophila melanogaster and sternopleural bristle number as a model system. In particular, we examined the effect of high temperature stress (31 degrees C) on quantitative genetic variation before and after our study population had been reared at 31 degrees C for 15 generations. High temperature stress was found to increase both additive genetic variance and heritability, but contrary to the selection history hypothesis prediction, the magnitude of this effect significantly increased after the study population had been reared for 15 generations under high temperature stress. These results demonstrate that high temperature stress increases quantitative genetic variation for bristle number, but do not support the selection history hypothesis as an explanation for this effect.

AB  - The golden takin (Budorcas laxicolor bedfordt) is a large, forest-dwelling ungulate endemic to the Qingling Mountains, China. A recent Study showed that golden takin move to cifff'erent elevations depending oil the season, remaining at high elevations In Summer, intermediate elevations in winter. and at low elevations for short periods inSpring and autumn. We proposed the following hypotheses' seasonal movement of'golden takin is it response to it shitt in vegetation phenology, which affects forage quality, and uphill movement of golden takin in winter is an adaptation to select areas with higher thermal energy. To test tile I st hypothesis we used relative plienological development derived from the normalized difference vegetation index time series to link seasonal shifts in veoetation phenology to movement patterns Golden takin Golden takin descended to a low elevation with the greening of vegetation in early spring, ascended to it high elevation in late Spring, and descended agai in autumn ass vegetation sencsced To test the 2nd hypothesis we compared thermal energy in the winter habitat with that in other areas of the home range. Using the amount of solar radiation calculated by a solar radiation model. In winter. preterence of the golden takin for exposed Southern slopes at intermediate elevations correlated closely with areas of higher solar radiation Our results indicate that solar radiation and vegetation phenology are critical Eactors in driving seasonal movement of golden takin DOI: 10.1644/08-CMAMM-A-390R1

SP  - 5080-5091
AB  - Image matching and water-body-detection methodologies are essential parts of generating good-quality digital elevation model (DEM) data. It is one of the very important results for image matching where 1-D searching in the along-track direction is sufficient to find the maximum correlation point if reconstructed unprocessed Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection data (Level-1A data) are used as the source data for DEM products. This important situation is obtained from the general formulation of how to make 1-D searching possible. The image matching quality is evaluated for this 1-D searching method. An image correlation kernel size of 5 by 5 is recommended as the most suitable selection for better horizontal resolution with a slight sacrifice of the image matching error. The satellite pointing fluctuation effect on image matching is also evaluated, leading to the conclusion that it does not seriously affect DEM quality. The water-body-detection technique is another core of DEM generation. The low image correlation coefficient, the low reflectance of water in the near-infrared band 3N, and other spectral characteristics of water were used to identify surface water bodies. In addition, water-body size and the standard deviation of the water-body perimeter elevation are limited for consistent detection without misidentification. As a result, the minimum size of a detectable water body is 0.2km(2).

AB  - Climate change in terms of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide and temperature has impact on agriculture including insect pests that minimize the crop yields. To address these impacts, biological studies on aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover on Bt cotton was conducted for six generations during 2013-14 and 2014-15 under different climate change conditions. The results revealed that the biometry of aphid was influenced by increased carbon dioxide (550 ppm CO2) and temperature (rise in 2 degrees C of the prevailing temperature). This was evidenced by decrease in nymphal developmental time (3.67 +/- 0.21 days), longevity of adult (9.43 +/- 0.41 days), increased fecundity (32.46 +/- 0.95) and reduced life cycle (12.28 +/- 0.23 days) in the elevated conditions (both 550 ppm CO2 with 32 degrees C as well as in 550 ppm CO2 + 34 degrees C). However, morphometry of aphid showed slight variations in all the treatments but, aphids under elevated conditions showed reduced body size which indicated that the fitness of aphid was effected in the enriched carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature conditions.

TI  - Temperature-induced multi-species cohort effects in sympatric snakes
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
AB  - In reptiles, reproductive maturity is often determined by size rather than age. Consequently, growth early in life may influence population dynamics through effects on generation time and survival to reproduction. Because reproductive phenology and pre- and post-natal growth are temperature dependent, environmental conditions may induce multi-species cohort effects on body size in sympatric reptiles. I present evidence of this using 10 years of neonatal size data for three sympatric viviparous snakes, Dekay's Brown snakes (Storeria dekayi), Red-bellied Snakes (S. occipitomaculata), and Common Garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis). End-of-season neonatal size varied in parallel across species such that snout-vent length was 36%-61% greater and mass was 65%-223% greater in years when gestating females could achieve higher April-May (vs. June-July or August-September) operative temperatures. Thus, temperature had a larger impact during follicular enlargement and ovulation than during gestation or post-natal growth. Multi-species cohort effects like these may affect population dynamics and the magnitude of these effects may increase with climate change.

TI  - Environment and phenology shape local adaptation in thermal performance
VL  - 288
IS  - 1955
AB  - Populations within species often exhibit variation in traits that reflect local adaptation and further shape existing adaptive potential for species to respond to climate change. However, our mechanistic understanding of how the environment shapes trait variation remains poor. Here, we used common garden experiments to quantify thermal performance in eight populations of the marine snail Urosalpinx cinerea across thermal gradients on the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts of North America. We then evaluated the relationship between thermal performance and environmental metrics derived from time-series data. Our results reveal a novel pattern of 'mixed' trait performance adaptation, where thermal optima were positively correlated with spawning temperature (cogradient variation), while maximum trait performance was negatively correlated with season length (countergradient variation). This counterintuitive pattern probably arises because of phenological shifts in the spawning season, whereby 'cold' populations delay spawning until later in the year when temperatures are warmer compared to 'warm' populations that spawn earlier in the year when temperatures are cooler. Our results show that variation in thermal performance can be shaped by multiple facets of the environment and are linked to organismal phenology and natural history. Understanding the impacts of climate change on organisms, therefore, requires the knowledge of how climate change will alter different aspects of the thermal environment.

TI  - Wing morphological responses to latitude and colonisation in a range expanding butterfly
VL  - 8
AB  - Populations undergoing rapid climate-driven range expansion experience distinct selection regimes dominated both by increased dispersal at the leading edges and steep environmental gradients. Characterisation of traits associated with such expansions provides insight into the selection pressures and evolutionary constraints that shape demographic and evolutionary responses. Here we investigate patterns in three components of wing morphology (size, shape, colour) often linked to dispersal ability and thermoregulation, along latitudinal gradients of range expansion in the Speckled Wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria) in Britain (two regions of expansion in England and Scotland). We measured 774 males from 54 sites spanning 799 km with a 10-year mean average temperature gradient of 4 degrees C. A geometric morphometric method was used to investigate variation in size and shape of forewings and hindwings; colour, pattern, and contrast of the wings were examined using a measure of lightness (inverse degree of melanism). Overall, wing size increased with latitude by similar to 2% per 100 km, consistent with Bergmann's rule. Forewings became more rounded and hindwings more elongated with history of colonisation, possibly reflecting selection for increased dispersal ability. Contrary to thermal melanism expectations, wing colour was lighter where larvae developed at cooler temperatures and unrelated to long-term temperature. Changes in wing spot pattern were also detected. High heterogeneity in variance among sites for all of the traits studied may reflect evolutionary time-lags and genetic drift due to colonisation of new habitats. Our study suggests that temperature-sensitive plastic responses for size and colour interact with selection for dispersal traits (wing size and shape). Whilst the plastic and evolutionary responses may in some cases act antagonistically, the rapid expansion of P. aegeria implies an overall reinforcing effect between these two mechanisms.

TI  - Possible causes for growth variability and summer growth reduction in juvenile plaice Pleuronectes platessa L. in the western Dutch Wadden Sea
VL  - 111
SP  - 97-106
AB  - Growth variability within individuals and among groups and locations and the phenomenon of summer growth reduction has been described for juvenile flatfish in a variety of European coastal areas whereby the underlying causes still remain elusive. Potential mechanisms were tested for juvenile plaice Pleuronectes platessa L. in the western Dutch Wadden Sea, by analysing published and unpublished information from long-term investigations (1986-present). Growth variability did occur and could be explained by differences induced by environmental variability (water temperature), and by non-genetic irreversible adaptation and sex. Dynamic Energy Budget analysis indicated that especially sexually-dimorphic growth in combination with variability in sex ratio could explain most of the variability in growth and the increase in the range of the size of individuals within the population over time. Summer growth reduction was not only observed among 0-group plaice in the intertidal, but also in the subtidal and tidal gullies as well as among I- and II-group plaice. Intraspecific competition for food was not detected but some support for interspecific competition with other predators was found. Also resource competition (due to crowding) with the other abundant epibenthic species (0-, I- and II-group flounder Platichthys flesus; the brown shrimp Crangon crangon; the shore crab Carcinus maenas; the goby species Pomatoschistus minutus and Pomatoschistus microps) could not explain the summer growth reduction. The observed growth reduction coincided with a decrease in stomach content, especially of regenerating body parts of benthic prey items. It is hypothesised that macrozoobenthos becomes less active after the spring phytoplankton bloom, reducing prey availability for juvenile plaice in summer, causing a reduction in food intake and hence in growth.

SP  - 297-305
AB  - The ability of the recently described stem nematode of creeping thistle (Cirsium arvense L.), Ditylenchus weischeri, to develop on and parasitize yellow pea (Pisum sativum L.) is uncertain. The current study examined nematode life-stage progression and generation time on yellow pea as affected by temperature with the related pest, D. dipsaci, used as a positive control. Relationships for body length of the two nematode species and life stage were unaffected by rearing on plant hosts compared with carrot disks. Then plant-reared J4 individuals of both nematode species were used to determine the effect of temperature (17, 22, and 27 degrees C) on life-stage progression and minimum generation time with yellow pea. At 17 and 22 degrees C, D. weischeri 14 individuals progressed to only the adult stage whereas, at 27 degrees C, the minimum generation time from J4 to J4 was 30 days or 720 growing degree-days. The minimum generation time for D. dipsaci was 24, 18, and 22 days or 336, 342, and 528 growing degree-days at 17, 22, and 27 degrees C, respectively. The results indicate that development of D. weischeri is temperature dependent and reproduction is unlikely on yellow pea in the Canadian Prairies, where mean daily air temperatures of 27 degrees C are rare and not sustained.

TI  - Contrasting patterns of phenotypic variation linked to chromosomal inversions in native and colonizing populations of Drosophila subobscura
VL  - 23
IS  - 1
SP  - 112-123
AB  - In fewer than two decades after invading the Americas, the fly Drosophila subobscura evolved latitudinal clines for chromosomal inversion frequencies and wing size that are parallel to the long-standing ones in native Palearctic populations. By sharp contrast, wing shape clines also evolved in the New World, but the relationship with latitude was opposite to that in the Old World. Previous work has suggested that wing trait differences among individuals are partially due to the association between chromosomal inversions and particular alleles which influence the trait under consideration. Furthermore, it is well documented that a few number of effective individuals founded the New World populations, which might have modified the biometrical effect of inversions on quantitative traits. Here we evaluate the relative contribution of chromosomal inversion clines in shaping the parallel clines in wing size and contrasting clines in wing shape in native and colonizing populations of the species. Our results reveal that inversion-size and inversion-shape associations in native and colonizing (South America) populations are generally different, probably due to the bottleneck effect. Contingent, unpredictable evolution was suggested as an explanation for the different details involved in the otherwise parallel wing size clines between Old and New World populations of D. subobscura. We challenge this assertion and conclude that contrasting wing shape clines came out as a correlated response of inversion clines that might have been predicted considering the genetic background of colonizers.

TI  - The Evolution of Foraging Rate across Local and Geographic Gradients in Predation Risk and Competition
VL  - 186
IS  - 1
SP  - E16-E32
AB  - Multiple theories predict the evolution of foraging rates in response to environmental variation in predation risk, intraspecific competition, time constraints, and temperature. We tested six hypotheses for the evolution of foraging rate in 24 spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum) populations from three latitudinally divergent sites using structural equation models derived from theory and applied to our system. We raised salamander larvae in a common-garden experiment and then assayed foraging rate under controlled conditions. Gape-limited predation risk from marbled salamanders solely explained foraging rate variation among populations at the southern site, which was dominated by this form of selection. However, at the middle and northern sites, populations evolved different foraging rates depending on their unique responses to local intraspecific density. The coupling of gape-limited predation risk from marbled salamanders and high intraspecific density at the middle site jointly contributed to selection for rapid foraging rate. At the northernmost site, intraspecific density alone explained 97% of the interpopulation variation in foraging rate. These results suggest that foraging rate has evolved multiple times in response to varying contributions from predation risk and intraspecific competition. Predation risk often varies along environmental gradients, and, thus, organisms might often shift evolutionary responses from minimizing predation risk to maximizing intraspecific competitive performance.

TI  - Within- and Trans-Generational Effects of Variation in Dietary Macronutrient Content on Life-History Traits in the Moth Plodia interpunctella
VL  - 11
IS  - 12
AB  - It is increasingly clear that parental environment can play an important role in determining offspring phenotype. These "transgenerational effects" have been linked to many different components of the environment, including toxin exposure, infection with pathogens and parasites, temperature and food quality. In this study, we focus on the latter, asking how variation in the quantity and quality of nutrition affects future generations. Previous studies have shown that artificial diets are a useful tool to examine the within-generation effects of variation in macronutrient content on life history traits, and could therefore be applied to investigations of the transgenerational effects of parental diet. Synthetic diets varying in total macronutrient content and protein: carbohydrate ratios were used to examine both within-and trans-generational effects on life history traits in a generalist stored product pest, the Indian meal moth Plodia interpunctella. The macronutrient composition of the diet was important for shaping within-generation life history traits, including pupal weight, adult weight, and phenoloxidase activity, and had indirect effects via maternal weight on fecundity. Despite these clear within-generation effects on the biology of P. interpunctella, diet composition had no transgenerational effects on the life history traits of offspring. P. interpunctella mothers were able to maintain their offspring quality, possibly at the expense of their own somatic condition, despite high variation in dietary macronutrient composition. This has important implications for the plastic biology of this successful generalist pest.

AB  - Egg parasitoid rearing on factitious hosts is an important step to reduce costs and increase availability of the biocontrol agent but it requires quality control to achieve success in field conditions. To this end, this study evaluated the quality of Telenomus remus (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) reared on Corcyra cephalonica (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) for until 45 generations. In the first bioassay, we evaluated the body size of the laboratory-produced parasitoids. In the second bioassay, flight activity was examined, measuring the percentage of flyers', walkers' and deformed' parasitoids. The third bioassay assessed parasitism on Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) eggs. Our data indicate that the laboratory-reared parasitoid neither lost its ability to fly nor to parasitize S. frugiperda eggs. In conclusion, quality did not decrease significantly during 45 generations, and therefore rearing of T. remus on C. cephalonica as factitious host promises to be successful.

TI  - Quantitative-genetic analysis of wing form and bilateral asymmetry in isochromosomal lines of Drosophila subobscura using Procrustes methods
VL  - 82
IS  - 3
SP  - 95-113
AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is often used as a measure of underlying developmental instability (DI), motivated by the idea that morphological variance is maladaptive. Whether or not DI has evolutionary potential is a highly disputed topic, marred by methodological problems and fuzzy prejudices. We report here some results from an ongoing study of the effects of karyotype, homozygosity and temperature on wing form and bilateral asymmetry using isochromosomal lines of Drosophila subobscura. Our approach uses the recently developed methodologies in geometric morphometrics to analyse shape configurations of landmarks within the standard statistical framework employed in studies of bilateral asymmetries, and we have extended these methods to partition the individual variation and the variation in asymmetries into genetic and environmental causal components. The analyses revealed temperature-dependent expression of genetic variation for wing size and wing shape, directional asymmetry (DA) of wing size, increased asymmetries at suboptimal temperature, and a transition from FA to DA in males as a result of increase in the rearing temperature. No genetic variation was generally detected for FA in our samples, but these are preliminary results because no crosses between lines were carried out and, therefore, the contribution of dominance was not taken into account. In addition, only a subset of the standing genetic variation was represented in the experiments.

TI  - Ecological divergence and conservatism: spatiotemporal patterns of niche evolution in a genus of livebearing fishes (Poeciliidae: Xiphophorus)
VL  - 16
AB  - Background: Ecological factors often have a strong impact on spatiotemporal patterns of biodiversity. The integration of spatial ecology and phylogenetics allows for rigorous tests of whether speciation is associated with niche conservatism (constraints on ecological divergence) or niche divergence. We address this question in a genus of livebearing fishes for which the role of sexual selection in speciation has long been studied, but in which the potential role of ecological divergence during speciation has not been tested. Results: By combining reconstruction of ancestral climate tolerances and disparity indices, we show that the earliest evolutionary split in Xiphophorus was associated with significant divergence for temperature variables. Niche evolution and present day niches were most closely associated with each species' geographic distribution relative to a biogeographic barrier, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Tests for similarity of the environmental backgrounds of closely related species suggested that the relative importance of niche conservatism and divergence during speciation varied among the primary clades of Xiphophorus. Closely related species in the two swordtail clades exhibited higher levels of niche overlap than expected given environmental background similarity indicative of niche conservatism. In contrast, almost all species of platyfish had significantly divergent niches compared to environmental backgrounds, which is indicative of niche divergence. Conclusion: The results suggest that the relative importance of niche conservatism and divergence differed among the clades of Xiphophorus and that traits associated with niche evolution may be more evolutionarily labile in the platyfishes. Our results ultimately suggest that the taxonomic scale of tests for conservatism and divergence could greatly influence inferences of their relative importance in the speciation process.

TI  - AN EXPLANATION OF THE HIGH-STRAIN DIVERSITY OF A SELF-FERTILIZING HERMAPHRODITIC FISH
VL  - 76
IS  - 2
SP  - 593-605
AB  - The tropical and subtropical estuarine fish Rivulus marmoratus is known for its synchronous, self-fertilizing hermaphroditism. It matures within 3 mo and can produce eggs throughout the year These features would allow a particular strain to quickly colonize refuge such as crab holes in the high intertidal zone habitat. However, a high strain diversity has been found in the field. In order to explain this observation, we examined the phenotypic responses of R. marmoratus to variation in biotic and abiotic environmental factors over two consecutive generations and employed a modified Euler-Lotka equation to estimate and compare the net reproductive rate, R, among strains. We included five strains of R. marmoratus and manipulated levels of temperature, salinity, and food for the parental generation and levels of food only for the second generation. Low temperature (19 degrees C) inhibited sexual maturity, precluding any egg production during the entire 6-mo study. For individuals kept at high temperature (26 degrees C), salinity and food had an interactive effect on time to maturity, body size at maturity, and number of eggs produced. Using multivariate analysis of variance, we found a significant two-way interactive effect (food levels for the parental and the second generations) on the five reproductive traits studied in the second generation. When each trait was analyzed separately, we found significant three-way interactions for time to maturity and total length at maturity. We found that the fitness values for each strain varied in different environmental combinations (3 salinities x 3 incubation salinities for eggs x 2 food levels). However, four of five strains had similar overall fitness. Despite a lack of generic variation within each strain, X. marmoratus demonstrates considerable phenotypic variation in response to environmental changes. This feature and genetic variation among strains may explain how this species can survive and even prosper in an extremely variable and stressful environment.

TI  - Variation in cool temperature performance between populations of Neochetina eichhorniae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and implications for the biological control of water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes, in a temperate climate
VL  - 128
SP  - 85-93
AB  - Biological control of water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes, has resulted in variable outcomes in temperate regions where cool climates are thought to limit population growth and performance of the biological control agents. The weevil, Neochetina eichhorniae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), originating from Argentina, was introduced into northern California, USA, in 1982. The realized distribution and abundance of this weevil is limited, and the exotic weed remains a problem. In this study, we tested populations of N. eichhorniae from northern California, Australia, South Africa, and Uruguay to examine the effects of low temperature on life-history performance to determine if cold hardiness differs between populations. We measured the development time, fecundity, survivorship, and thermal tolerance (chill coma: CTmin and supercooling point SCP) of the four N. eichhorniae populations under two temperature treatments simulating fall and winter seasons of northern California. Results suggest that immature stages of all populations tested failed to survive and females did not reproduce in the winter treatment. In the fall treatment, all populations showed similar performance in most of the measured life history traits. The Australian population had the highest intrinsic rate of increase, net reproductive rate and doubling time, due to its longer oviposition period, and higher daily fecundity (2.1 +/- 0.2 eggs per day), twice that of the California population (1.0 +/- 0.2 eggs per day). Thus, the introduction of N. eichhorniae from Australia into northern California may increase weevil densities, distribution, and improve biological control of water hyacinth.

TI  - The first proof of a possibility of change of temperature norms of insect development as a result of artificial selection for fast or slow development by the example of the red soldier bug Pyrrhocoris apterus (Heteroptera, Pyrrhocoridae)
VL  - 44
IS  - 2
SP  - 190-197
AB  - For 3-4 generations, selection of the nymphs most rapidly and slowly developing at 28 degrees C was performed in four families of the red soldier bug Pyrrhocoris apterus L. In each generation, du- ration of development of nymphs was determined at 5 constant temperatures from 20 C to 28 degrees C. From these data the linear regression coefficient of the development rate against temperature ( the development thermolability coefficient) for each generation was calculated. As a result of the selection the average duration of the nymph development was shortened or increased statistically significantly depending on its direction. The artificial selection for the development duration has been established to change not only this parameter, but also the temperature norms of the insect develop ment. At selection for fast development the regression straight line slope (i.e., the regression coefficient value) increased statistically significantly, i.e., development became more dependent on temperature. As a rule, the temperature threshold of development increased. At selection for slow development the values of the regression coefficient and of the threshold decreased, but these differences were not statistically significant. The effect of artificial selection for the development duration on temperature norms of insect development has been revealed for the first time.

TI  - Do different rates of gene flow underlie variation in phenotypic and phenological clines in a montane grasshopper community?
VL  - 10
IS  - 2
SP  - 980-997
AB  - Species responses to environmental change are likely to depend on existing genetic and phenotypic variation, as well as evolutionary potential. A key challenge is to determine whether gene flow might facilitate or impede genomic divergence among populations responding to environmental change, and if emergent phenotypic variation is dependent on gene flow rates. A general expectation is that patterns of genetic differentiation in a set of codistributed species reflect differences in dispersal ability. In less dispersive species, we predict greater genetic divergence and reduced gene flow. This could lead to covariation in life-history traits due to local adaptation, although plasticity or drift could mirror these patterns. We compare genome-wide patterns of genetic structure in four phenotypically variable grasshopper species along a steep elevation gradient near Boulder, Colorado, and test the hypothesis that genomic differentiation is greater in short-winged grasshopper species, and statistically associated with variation in growth, reproductive, and physiological traits along this gradient. In addition, we estimate rates of gene flow under competing demographic models, as well as potential gene flow through surveys of phenological overlap among populations within a species. All species exhibit genetic structure along the elevation gradient and limited gene flow. The most pronounced genetic divergence appears in short-winged (less dispersive) species, which also exhibit less phenological overlap among populations. A high-elevation population of the most widespread species, Melanoplus sanguinipes, appears to be a sink population derived from low elevation populations. While dispersal ability has a clear connection to the genetic structure in different species, genetic distance does not predict growth, reproductive, or physiological trait variation in any species, requiring further investigation to clearly link phenotypic divergence to local adaptation.

TI  - Laboratory maintenance does not alter ecological and physiological patterns among species: a Drosophila case study
VL  - 31
IS  - 4
SP  - 530-542
AB  - Large comparative studies in animal ecology, physiology and evolution often use animals reared in the laboratory for many generations; however, the relevance of these studies hinges on the assumption that laboratory populations are still representative for their wild living conspecifics. In this study, we investigate whether laboratory-maintained and freshly collected animal populations are fundamentally different and whether data from laboratory-maintained animals are valid to use in large comparative investigations of ecological and physiological patterns. Here, we obtained nine species of Drosophila with paired populations of laboratory-maintained and freshly collected flies. These species, representing a range of ecotypes, were assayed for four stress-tolerance, two body-size traits and six life-history traits. For all of these traits, we observed small differences in species-specific comparisons between field and laboratory populations; however, these differences were unsystematic and laboratory maintenance did not eclipse fundamental species characteristics. To investigate whether laboratory maintenance influence the general patterns in comparative studies, we correlated stress tolerance and life-history traits with environmental traits for the laboratory-maintained and freshly collected populations. Based on this analysis, we found that the comparative physiological and ecological trait correlations are similar irrespective of provenience. This finding is important for comparative biology in general because it validates comparative meta-analyses based on laboratory-maintained populations.

TI  - Climate change-mediated temperature extremes and insects: From outbreaks to breakdowns
VL  - 26
IS  - 12
SP  - 6685-6701
AB  - Insects are among the most diverse and widespread animals across the biosphere and are well-known for their contributions to ecosystem functioning and services. Recent increases in the frequency and magnitude of climatic extremes (CE), in particular temperature extremes (TE) owing to anthropogenic climate change, are exposing insect populations and communities to unprecedented stresses. However, a major problem in understanding insect responses to TE is that they are still highly unpredictable both spatially and temporally, which reduces frequency- or direction-dependent selective responses by insects. Moreover, how species interactions and community structure may change in response to stresses imposed by TE is still poorly understood. Here we provide an overview of how terrestrial insects respond to TE by integrating their organismal physiology, multitrophic, and community-level interactions, and building that up to explore scenarios for population explosions and crashes that have ecosystem-level consequences. We argue that TE can push insect herbivores and their natural enemies to and even beyond their adaptive limits, which may differ among species intimately involved in trophic interactions, leading to phenological disruptions and the structural reorganization of food webs. TE may ultimately lead to outbreak-breakdown cycles in insect communities with detrimental consequences for ecosystem functioning and resilience. Lastly, we suggest new research lines that will help achieve a better understanding of insect and community responses to a wide range of CE.

TI  - Realized evolvability: quantifying phenotypic evolution in a Drosophila clade
VL  - 49
IS  - 1
SP  - 32-43
AB  - Understanding the evolutionary potential of morphological evolution is still a major problem in evolutionary biology. In this study, we tried to quantify the amount of variation of different traits among species of a Drosophila clade reared under standard conditions. Nineteen different traits have been measured on nine species of the same clade, the Neotropical saltans group of Drosophila. Measured traits can be distributed into five categories: size-traits (wing and thorax), shape indices (ratios among the size traits), number of sternopleural bristles on the thorax, number of abdominal bristles on successive sternites, and dorsal pigmentation of abdomen. All species are of medium size with a generally dark pigmentation. A remarkable feature is the presence of numerous bristles on the 6th sternite of the males, while this segment is bare in other Drosophila species. A multivariate analysis revealed that it was possible to discriminate all the investigated species by using the complete set of measured traits. For each trait, phenotypic variability was investigated at the within- and between-species levels. As a rule, the interspecific coefficient of variation (CV) was much greater than the within species CV, and it is proposed to call it realized evolvability. All possible correlations were calculated between traits across species, providing many unexpected results. Size traits were highly correlated among them, but not correlated with shape indices. Abdominal traits (bristles and pigmentation) were correlated, but often in opposite directions, with thoracic shape indices. Tergite pigmentation was negatively correlated with bristle number on sternite. For the moment, most of the correlations cannot be explained by developmental processes or parallel selective pressures. Nonetheless, mapping the evolution of the two characters on a molecular phylogeny of the studied species revealed two opposite phylogenetic trends for abdominal pigmentation and setation, respectively. Our data suggest a need for similar studies in other well-defined Drosophila clades.Resume Comprendre le potentiel evolutif des caracteres morphologiques constitue un probleme majeur de la biologie de l'evolution. Dans cet article, nous essayons de quantifier la variation de differents caracteres entre les especes d'un clade de Drosophilaelevees dans les conditions standard du laboratoire. Dix neuf traits differents ont ete mesures sur 9 especes appartenant au meme clade, le groupe saltans de Drosophila. Les caracteres mesures peuvent etre repartis en cinq categories: des caracteres de taille (aile et thorax) des indices de forme (rapports entre les caracteres de taille); le nombre de soies sternopleurales sur le thorax, le nombre des sois abdominales sur le sternites successifs et finalement la pigmentation des tergites. Toutes les especes sont de taille moyenne avec une pigmentation generale sombre. Une caracteristique remarquable est la presence de nombreuses soies sur le 6eme sternite des males, alors que ce segment est completement nu chez les autres especes de Drosophila. Une analyse multivariee a montre qu'il etait possible de discriminer toutes les especes etudiees en utilisant l'ensemble des caracteres mesures. Pour chaque trait, la variabilite phenotypique a eteetudiee aux niveaux intra et interspecifique. En regle generale, le coefficient de variation (CV) interspecifique etait beaucoup plus grand que le CV intraspecifique, et il est propose de l'appeler evolvabilite realisee. Toutes les correlations possibles entre les differents caracteres des especes ont ete calculees, conduisant souvent a des resultats inattendus. Les caracteres de taille sont fortement correles entre eux, mais non avec les indices de forme. Les caracteres de l'abdomen (soies et pigmentation) sont correles, mais souvent de facon opposee, avec les indices de forme. La pigmentation des tergites est negativement correlee avec le nombre des soies sur les sternites. Pour le moment, il ne semble pas possible d'explique la plupart des correlations par des processus de developpement ou bien par des pressions selectives paralleles. Cependant, la comparaison de deux caracteres avec le phylogenie moleculaire a revele des tendances phylogenetiques opposees concernant la pigmentation et la setation de abdomen. Ces resultats suggerent la necessite d'etudes comparatives similaires dans d'autres clades bien definis de Drosophila.

TI  - Thermal plasticity in young snakes: how will climate change affect the thermoregulatory tactics of ectotherms?
VL  - 213
IS  - 2
SP  - 242-248
AB  - Climate change will result in some areas becoming warmer and others cooler, and will amplify the magnitude of year-to-year thermal variation in many areas. How will such changes affect animals that rely on ambient thermal heterogeneity to behaviourally regulate their body temperatures? To explore this question, we raised 43 captive-born tiger snakes Notechis scutatus in enclosures that provided cold (19-22 degrees C), intermediate (19-26 degrees C) or hot (19-37 degrees C) thermal gradients. The snakes adjusted their diel timing of thermoregulatory behaviour so effectively that when tested 14 months later, body temperatures (mean and maximum), locomotor speeds and anti-predator behaviours did not differ among treatment groups. Thus, the young snakes modified their behaviour to compensate for restricted thermal opportunities. Then, we suddenly shifted ambient conditions to mimic year-to-year variation. In contrast to the earlier plasticity, snakes failed to adjust to this change, e. g. snakes raised at cooler treatments but then shifted to hot conditions showed a higher mean body temperature for at least two months after the onset of the new thermal regime. Hence, thermal conditions experienced early in life influenced subsequent thermoregulatory tactics; the mean selected temperature of a snake depended more upon its prior raising conditions than upon its current thermoregulatory opportunities. Behavioural plasticity thus allows snakes to adjust to suboptimal thermal conditions but this plasticity is limited. The major thermoregulatory challenge from global climate change may not be the shift in mean values (to which our young snakes adjusted) but the increased year-to-year variation (with which our snakes proved less able to deal).

TI  - THE INFLUENCE OF INCUBATION-TEMPERATURE AND FAMILY ON EGGS, EMBRYOS, AND HATCHLINGS OF THE SMOOTH SOFTSHELL TURTLE (APALONE-MUTICA)
VL  - 66

SP  - 349-373
AB  - I incubated eggs of the smooth softshell turtle (Apalone mutica) at 26-degrees, 28-degrees, and 30-degrees-C in 2 yr to investigate the physiological significance of temperature on developing embryos and hatchlings. In particular, I tested the hypothesis that temperature has a direct effect on physiology of developing embryos independent of the hydric environment, specifically as expressed through its effects on hatchling size and locomotor performance. Hatching success was lowest at 26-degrees but did not differ significantly among treatments or between years. Survivorship of turtles to 2 wk posthatching varied significantly among temperature treatments, because relatively few individuals from 26-degrees-C survived. Duration of incubation was negatively related to incubation temperature. However, sex determination of hatchling turtles was independent of incubation temperature. All but one measure of body size of turtles varied positively with incubation temperature in both years, which suggests that temperature directly affected embryonic growth. Body size of hatchlings also differed significantly among clutches, even after accounting for initial egg mass, which implies maternal or genetic variation in embryonic development. Measures of locomotor performance (running and swimming speed) were significantly influenced by incubation temperature in both years, such that warmer temperatures produced faster hatchlings. In 1989, but not in 1990, larger turtles ran and swam faster than smaller individuals. Clutch exhibited a significant influence on running and swimming speed in both years, which suggests maternal or genetic effects underlying performance. Both measures of locomotor performance were positively correlated in both years, and the correlations were significant, which indicates that faster runners were also faster swimmers. Running and swimming speed were highly repeatable within the 1-d trials in both years and exhibited significant heritable variation. These findings highlight the pervasive influence of environmental and genetic factors on the physiological ecology of embryonic and hatchling turtles and indicate that growth and locomotor performance may possess the genetic variation necessary to evolve in response to selection pressures in nature. Experimental field studies of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of variation in these traits would prove valuable in elucidating the pervasive impact of environmental conditions during embryonic development.

TI  - Developmental stability in yellow dong flies (Scathophaga stercoraria): fluctuating asymmetry, heterozygosity and environmental stress
VL  - 13
IS  - 6
SP  - 919-926
AB  - The genetic basis for developmental stability, the ability of an organism to withstand genetic and environmental disturbance of development, is poorly understood. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA: small random deviations from symmetry in paired, bilateral traits) is the most widely used measure of developmental stability, and evidence suggests FA is weakly and negatively associated with genome-wide heterozygosity. We investigated the genetic basis of developmental stability in the yellow dung fly. Fly lines were inbred for 16 generations at which time they were homozygous at the phosphoglucomutase (PGM) loci and PGM appears to influence FA in at least one other taxon. After 16 generations of inbreeding, lines homozygous for different PGM alleles were crossed and levels of FA for four metric traits were compared in the inbred and crossed flier. We also compared FA levels in these flies with previously gathered data on wild-type (second generation outcrossed) flies, and additionally looked at the effects of two environmental stresses (larval food limitation and increased temperature) on FA. There were no significant differences in any measure of FA, nor in mean FA, in any trait when inbred and crossed flies were compared. Comparison of FA in these and wild flies also revealed no significant differences. Food limitation had no influence on I;A, whereas heat stress increased FA of naturally, but not sexually, selected traits. Our results do not show a negative relationship between heterozygosity and FA, but support the notion that FA levels are stress, trait and taxon specific.

TI  - Identification of molecular markers for superior quantitative traits in a novel sea cucumber strain by comparative microRNA-mRNA expression profiling
VL  - 35
AB  - To investigate the adaptability of Apostichopus japonicus (A. japonicus) strain "Anyuan No. 1" in the South China Sea, field monitoring and microRNA-mRNA integrated analyses were conducted between "Anyuan No. 1" and a regular A. japonicus population from Wendeng (Shandong Province, as a control) in the Xiapu farming area in Fujian Province, China. The results showed that "Anyuan No. 1" exhibited greater body weight increase and a higher number of papillae compared to the control during two and a half months of field monitoring. Comparative microRNA (miRNA) and mRNA transcriptome analyses identified 12 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and 165 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in "Anyuan No. 1" compared to the control. Long-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADL), transmembrane protein 251 (TMEM251), dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family protein 7-like (Dhrs7), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 (IGFBP-7), CDK5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1 (CDK5RAP1), visual pigment-like receptor peropsin, 39S ribosomal protein, miR-10, miR-153, miR-7, and miR-3529 were identified as gene and miRNA candidates correlated with superior economic traits in "Anyuan No. 1". Collectively, "Anyuan No. 1" is suitable for large-scale cultivation extension due to its better adaptability to the South China Sea area. Furthermore, we identified "miR10-ACADL" as a potential module for further molecular marker-assisted selective breeding of A. japonicus.

TI  - Adaptation and acclimatization to ocean acidification in marine ectotherms: an in situ transplant experiment with polychaetes at a shallow CO2 vent system
VL  - 368
IS  - 1627
AB  - Metabolic rate determines the physiological and life-history performances of ectotherms. Thus, the extent to which such rates are sensitive and plastic to environmental perturbation is central to an organism's ability to function in a changing environment. Little is known of long-term metabolic plasticity and potential for metabolic adaptation in marine ectotherms exposed to elevated pCO(2). Consequently, we carried out a series of in situ transplant experiments using a number of tolerant and sensitive polychaete species living around a natural CO2 vent system. Here, we show that a marine metazoan (i.e. Platynereis dumerilii) was able to adapt to chronic and elevated levels of pCO(2). The vent population of P. dumerilii was physiologically and genetically different from nearby populations that experience low pCO(2), as well as smaller in body size. By contrast, different populations of Amphiglena mediterranea showed marked physiological plasticity indicating that adaptation or acclimatization are both viable strategies for the successful colonization of elevated pCO(2) environments. In addition, sensitive species showed either a reduced or increased metabolism when exposed acutely to elevated pCO(2). Our findings may help explain, from a metabolic perspective, the occurrence of past mass extinction, as well as shed light on alternative pathways of resilience in species facing ongoing ocean acidification.

TI  - Studying the evolutionary significance of thermal adaptation in ectotherms: The diversification of amphibians' energetics
VL  - 68
SP  - 5-13
AB  - A fundamental problem in evolutionary biology is the understanding of the factors that promote or constrain adaptive evolution, and assessing the role of natural selection in this process. Here, comparative phylogenetics, that is, using phylogenetic information and traits to infer evolutionary processes has been a major paradigm. In this study, we discuss Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models (OU) in the context of thermal adaptation in ectotherms. We specifically applied this approach to study amphibians's evolution and energy metabolism. It has been hypothesized that amphibians exploit adaptive zones characterized by low energy expenditure, which generate specific predictions in terms of the patterns of diversification in standard metabolic rate (SMR). We complied whole-animal metabolic rates for 122 species of amphibians, and adjusted several models of diversification. According to the adaptive zone hypothesis, we expected: (1) to find "accelerated evolution" in SMR (i.e., diversification above Brownian Motion expectations, BM), (2) that a model assuming evolutionary optima (i.e., an OU model) fits better than a white-noise model and (3) that a model assuming multiple optima (according to the three amphibians's orders) fits better than a model assuming a single optimum. As predicted, we found that the diversification of SMR occurred most of the time, above BM expectations. Also, we found that a model assuming an optimum explained the data in a better way than a white-noise model. However, we did not find evidence that an OU model with multiple optima fits the data better, suggesting a single optimum in SMR for Anura, Caudata and Gymnophiona. These results show how comparative phylogenetics could be applied for testing adaptive hypotheses regarding history and physiological performance in ectotherms.

TI  - An assessment of the spatial scale of local adaptation in brown trout (Salmo trutta L.): footprints of selection at microsatellite DNA loci
VL  - 106
IS  - 3
SP  - 488-499
AB  - Local adaptation is considered a paradigm in studies of salmonid fish populations. Yet, little is known about the geographical scale of local adaptation. Is adaptive divergence primarily evident at the scale of regions or individual populations? Also, many salmonid populations are subject to spawning intrusion by farmed conspecifics that experience selection regimes fundamentally different from wild populations. This prompts the question if adaptive differences between wild populations and hatchery strains are more pronounced than between different wild populations? We addressed these issues by analyzing variation at 74 microsatellite loci (including anonymous and expressed sequence tag- and quantitative trait locus-linked markers) in 15 anadromous wild brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) populations, representing five geographical regions, along with two lake populations and two hatchery strains used for stocking some of the populations. F-ST-based outlier tests revealed more outlier loci between different geographical regions separated by 522 228 km (mean +/- s.d.) than between populations within regions separated by 117 +/- 79 km (mean +/- s.d.). A significant association between geographical distance and number of outliers between regions was evident. There was no evidence for more outliers in comparisons involving hatchery trout, but the loci under putative selection generally were not the same as those found to be outliers between wild populations. Our study supports the notion of local adaption being increasingly important at the scale of regions as compared with individual populations, and suggests that loci involved in adaptation to captive environments are not necessarily the same as those involved in adaptive divergence among wild populations.

TI  - Longevity and growth strategies of the desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) in two American deserts
VL  - 73
IS  - 4
SP  - 463-471
AB  - The desert tortoise occurs in two strikingly different desert regimes in the southwestern United States In. the Mojave Desert, rainfall is more irregular and resources are more limited than in the Sonoran Desert. We examined the age structure of tortoise populations from these two deserts to determine whether the difference in resource availability has driven an evolutionary divergence in life history strategies, Age and growth rates strongly reflect the ecological adaptation of the two populations. The oldest Sonoran males reached 54 years, compared to only 43 years in females. The oldest West Mojave (WM) males reached 56 years, compared to only 27 years in females. WM tortoises grew faster than Sonoran ones, and females reached sexual maturity at earlier ages (similar to 17-19 years) than Sonoran females (similar to 22-26 years). These traits and the higher rate of clutch production in the WM population are likely the evolutionary adaptation for low juvenile survivorship and a significantly shorter life span. Frequent droughts in the WM Desert and the lowest annual rainfall area within the range of the desert tortoise cause chronic physiological stress, likely annually, and are proposed as a major selection force producing contrasting life-history strategies.

TI  - Cellular basis of morphological variation and temperature-related plasticity in Drosophila melanogaster strains with divergent wing shapes
VL  - 142
IS  - 6
SP  - 495-505
AB  - Organ shape evolves through cross-generational changes in developmental patterns at cellular and/or tissue levels that ultimately alter tissue dimensions and final adult proportions. Here, we investigated the cellular basis of an artificially selected divergence in the outline shape of Drosophila melanogaster wings, by comparing flies with elongated or rounded wing shapes but with remarkably similar wing sizes. We also tested whether cellular plasticity in response to developmental temperature was altered by such selection. Results show that variation in cellular traits is associated with wing shape differences, and that cell number may play an important role in wing shape response to selection. Regarding the effects of developmental temperature, a size-related plastic response was observed, in that flies reared at 16 A degrees C developed larger wings with larger and more numerous cells across all intervein regions relative to flies reared at 25 A degrees C. Nevertheless, no conclusive indication of altered phenotypic plasticity was found between selection strains for any wing or cellular trait. We also described how cell area is distributed across different intervein regions. It follows that cell area tends to decrease along the anterior wing compartment and increase along the posterior one. Remarkably, such pattern was observed not only in the selected strains but also in the natural baseline population, suggesting that it might be canalized during development and was not altered by the intense program of artificial selection for divergent wing shapes.

TI  - Phenotypic plasticity in locomotor performance of a monophyletic group of weevils accords with the 'warmer is better' hypothesis
VL  - 222
IS  - 9
AB  - Ectotherms may respond to variable environmental conditions by altering their phenotypes. Phenotypic plasticity was initially thought to be beneficial to an organism's physiological fitness but several alternative hypotheses have been proposed with growing empirical support. In this study, we tested the full suite of hypotheses by investigating acclimation responses of locomotor performance for nine populations of five species of sub-Antarctic weevils, using static and fluctuating temperatures. Species showed typical locomotion thermal performance curves with temperature of the maximum speed (T-opt) ranging between 22.3 +/- 1.7 degrees C (mean +/- s.e.m.) and 31.1 +/- 0.7 degrees C. For most species, T-opt was not affected by acclimation. For maximum speed (U-max), significant, positive effects of acclimation were found for all species except a supralittoral one. Individuals acclimated to 0 degrees C showed much lower values than the other two acclimation treatments (15 degrees C and fluctuating 0-15 degrees C). Performance breadth (the index of the breadth of the curve, T-br) typically showed little response to acclimation. None of the traits of the supralittoral species was affected by acclimation treatment. Responses to stable and fluctuating temperature treatments were similar. Our findings also revealed that the mean estimated activation energy 0.40 +/- 0.015 eV (mean +/- s.e.m.) was lower than for other herbivores, the category to which these weevils belong, suggesting that some form of compensation in the rate-temperature relationship may be evident. Thus, we typically found support for the 'warmer is better' hypothesis for acclimation of locomotor performance, although some compensation was evident.

TI  - Measuring performance in nature: Implications for studies of fitness within populations
VL  - 43
IS  - 3
SP  - 396-407
AB  - Significant relationships among morphology, behavior, performance and fitness have long served as bona fide evidence for the role of selection in shaping natural populations. Here, I discuss how studies of ecological performance, or how organisms perform in nature, provide an ecological context for such selection studies. Laboratory studies assume that the level of performance expressed under "optimal" conditions accurately reflects the level of performance used in nature, but I show here that this assumption is not always borne out. A review of how various factors affect ecological performance (ontogeny, microhabitat, and macrohabitat) show that animals often express very different levels of movement speed both among different tasks, and when comparing laboratory versus field performance. Thus, a failure to take this variation into account could lead to negative, or even misleading significant fitness-character correlations. While laboratory performance studies should continue to play a key role in studies of selection, recent technological (Le., portable high-speed cameras) and methodological developments should enable researchers to measure performance in nature to high degrees of accuracy. Thus, I encourage researchers to measure performance both in the laboratory and in the field, and thus expand the traditional paradigm of morphology --> performance --> fitness to morphology --> ecological performance --> fitness.

TI  - Evolutionary genomics of gypsy moth populations sampled along a latitudinal gradient
VL  - 28
IS  - 9
SP  - 2206-2223
AB  - The European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) was first introduced to Massachusetts in 1869 and within 150 years has spread throughout eastern North America. This large-scale invasion across a heterogeneous landscape allows examination of the genetic signatures of adaptation potentially associated with rapid geographical spread. We tested the hypothesis that spatially divergent natural selection has driven observed changes in three developmental traits that were measured in a common garden for 165 adult moths sampled from six populations across a latitudinal gradient covering the entirety of the range. We generated genotype data for 91,468 single nucleotide polymorphisms based on double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing and used these data to discover genome-wide associations for each trait, as well as to test for signatures of selection on the discovered architectures. Genetic structure across the introduced range of gypsy moth was low in magnitude (F-ST = 0.069), with signatures of bottlenecks and spatial expansion apparent in the rare portion of the allele frequency spectrum. Results from applications of Bayesian sparse linear mixed models were consistent with the presumed polygenic architectures of each trait. Further analyses indicated spatially divergent natural selection acting on larval development time and pupal mass, with the linkage disequilibrium component of this test acting as the main driver of observed patterns. The populations most important for these signals were two range-edge populations established less than 30 generations ago. We discuss the importance of rapid polygenic adaptation to the ability of non-native species to invade novel environments.

TI  - Earlier or delayed seasonal broodstock spawning changes nutritional status and metabolic programming of growth for next-generation Atlantic salmon
VL  - 554
AB  - Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) breeding companies depend on changing light, temperature and feeding regimes to achieve new generations outside the natural spawning season. However, there have been few conducted trials reported that have studied whether this shift affects important traits. We test whether an induced shift of two months earlier or two months later than normal spawning season affects the nutritional status (folate, methio-nine, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, free amino acids, N-metabolites and lipids) in broodstock liver and muscle and whether this affects the levels of the same nutrients in the offspring. The results showed significant seasonal differences in the Cahill cycle (glucose-alanine cycle), 1C metabolism and for free amino acids catabolized in the citric acid cycle all which are important for embryonic growth The broodstock nutritional status was reflected in the eggs. Nutritional status of broodstock liver and muscle and newly fertilized eggs showed two general sce-narios: Advanced spawning period did not obtain optimal deposition of nutrients in the eggs. Delayed spawning broodstock displayed a metabolic profile which indicated that it had enhanced catabolization of muscle protein which led to accumulation of aminogroups from muscle breakdown to such a degree that these amino groups were increased in the eggs. The total body weight at start-feeding stage revealed best growth for both the normal and late spawning compared to early spawning. We show here that environmental alterations in broodstock husbandry influence the nutrient status of the next generation via nutritional and metabolic programming. This is an important concept which needs more careful awareness as the metabolism compensate and regulate the energy between catabolism and anabolism through the early stages of cell divisions which give rise to changes in permanent traits for the next generation.

TI  - Multidimensional analysis of Drosophila wing variation in Evolution Canyon
VL  - 87
IS  - 4
SP  - 407-419
AB  - Environmental stress has been suggested to be a major evolutionary force, both through inducing strong selection and because of its direct impact on developmental buffering processes that alter the evolvability of organisms. In particular, temperature has attracted much attention because of its importance as an ecological feature and the relative ease with which it can be experimentally manipulated in the lab. Evolution Canyon, Lower Nahal Oren, Israel, is a well studied natural site where ecological parameters are suspected to drive evolutionary differentiation. In this study, using Drosophila melanogaster isofemale lines derived from wild flies collected on both slopes of the canyon, we investigated the effect of developmental temperature upon the different components of phenotypic variation of a complex trait: the wing. Combining geometric and traditional morphometrics, we find only limited evidence for a differentiation among slopes. Investigating simultaneously phenotypic plasticity, genetic variation among isofemale lines, variation among individuals and fluctuating asymmetry, we could not identify a consistent effect of the stressful conditions encountered on the south facing slope. The prevailing structuring effect is that of the experimentally manipulated temperature which clearly influences wing mean size and shape. Variability, in contrast, is not consistently affected by temperature. Finally, we investigated the specific relationship between individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry. Using metric multi-dimensional scaling we show that the related patterns of wing shape variation are not identical, supporting the view that the underlying developmental processes are to a certain extent different.

TI  - Selection for starvation resistance in Drosophila melanogaster: physiological correlates, enzyme activities and multiple stress responses
VL  - 12
IS  - 2
SP  - 370-379
AB  - Correlated responses to artificial selection for stress tolerance can provide insight into underlying genetic variation and the physiological basis of stress resistance. Lines of Drosophila melanogaster held in the absence of food or with an unsuitable resource, specifically decomposing lemon, responded to selection by becoming starvation resistant. The lemon-selected lines also adapted by evolving a resource-based induction response. Compared to control lines, the selected lines tended to store more lipid, develop slower and have a larger body size. Additional responses included resistance to desiccation and acetone fumes, suggesting multiple stress resistance is a correlated result of selection for starvation resistance. The specific metabolic rate was lower in the starvation selected lines and enzyme activities changed in response to selection. In particular, enzyme activities indirectly associated with lipid biogenesis increased in both types of selected lines. The correlated responses to the two selection regimes were sufficiently consistent to indicate a common basis for starvation resistance. Specific responses to starvation selection appeared to oppose the short-term phenotypic responses to starvation. Thus, a common response to stress selection may be to ameliorate the immediate physiological impact of the stress factor.

TI  - In search of clinal variation in the period and clock timing genes in Australian Drosophila melanogaster populations
VL  - 19
IS  - 2
SP  - 551-557
AB  - Clinal variation for repeat number in the Thr-Gly region of the period circadian timing gene in Drosophila melanogaster was described in Europe and has subsequently been used as evidence of thermal selection on period alleles. To test for clinal variation in this gene along the east coast of Australia, the period polymorphism was scored on flies from multiple samples collected repeatedly over a 5-year interval, along with variation at another circadian rhythm locus, clock. For period, there was no consistent evidence of clinal variation in the 17 and/or 20 repeat alleles, although when average allele length was examined a weak consistent clinal pattern was detected. For clock there was no evidence of clinal variation in the two most common alleles or in average repeat size. These data are inconsistent with the reported patterns in Europe and suggest that clinal variation in timing genes needs to be re-examined in this region.

VL  - 93

AB  - We investigated the effect of temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) on fecundity, life span and morphology of the rotifer Brachionus caudatus f. apsteini. For each temperature, short posterior-spined and long posterior-spined clones of H. caudatus f apsteini were individually cultured for up to six generations. The rotifers were fed Chlorella sp. at a density of 1 x 10(6) cells ml(-1). Morphometric data (body size and spine length) were collected. Total number of offspring producing by a single female per life cycle at high temperature was higher than at low temperature. The duration of juvenile period, reproductive period, post-reproductive period and life span of both clones of B. caudatus f. apsteini decreased with increasing temperature. All offspring of short posterior-spined clone produce posterior spines at 20 and 25 degrees C, with an average length of 19.8 +/- 6.6 and 11.9 +/- 2.6 mu m, respectively. In contrast, they cannot develop posterior spines at 30 degrees C, at which the average length of the posterior spine remnant was 6.4 +/- 1.3 mu m. On the other hand, all offspring of long posterior-spined clone have long posterior spines with average lengths of 36.8 +/- 6.1, 36.3 +/- 5.2 and 36.6 +/- 6.2 mu m at 20, 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively. This study indicated that the production of posterior spines can be induced by low temperature and that short posterior-spined and long posterior-spined clones are genetically different.

TI  - Genetic differentiation between alpine and lowland populations of a butterfly is related to PGI enzyme genotype
VL  - 32
IS  - 3
SP  - 488-496
AB  - Understanding the ecological process of population differentiation and identifying the molecular changes that contribute to adaptation is a central aspect of evolutionary biology. In this study we analyzed the geographic variation in allozyme allele frequencies (based on 15 enzyme systems representing 18 loci) across 18 populations of the butterfly Lycaena tityrus from different altitudes. Population genetic analyses showed that within population genetic diversity (e.g. mean number of alleles per loci: 1.8; expected heterozygosity: 12%) was within the typical value range for the Lepidoptera. The populations of L. tityrus investigated showed a remarkable genetic differentiation (F-ST: 0.065), being clearly divided into an alpine (high-altitude) and a non-alpine (low-altitude) cluster. This differentiation was almost entirely caused by variation at a single enzyme locus, PGI. Although the involvement of historical events cannot be ruled out, several lines of evidence suggest that the specific pattern of allozyme (and in this case particularly PGI) variation found is caused by thermal selection. For example, genetic variation was highly locus-specific rather than relatively uniform, as should be expected for effects of natural selection. Further, the PGI 2-2 genotype dominating in alpine (in contrast to low-altitude) populations is known to exhibit increased cold stress resistance and relatively long development times typical of alpine populations. Thus, PGI (or possibly a closely linked gene) is an obvious target for thermal selection in L. tityrus. This study exemplifies how allozyme analyses can be used to detect candidate loci likely to be under selection.

VL  - 137

SP  - 731-738
AB  - We measured the rate at which the metabolic enzymes lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), citrate synthase (CS), and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) acclimate in the response to lowered temperature in the axial muscle of tadpoles of Limnodynastes peronii (Anura: Myobatrachidae) over 6 weeks. In addition, we measured growth rates of the tadpoles kept at both temperatures and examined the activities of these enzymes in the liver tissue of the control group and cold-acclimated group at the end of the experiment. We found that LDH acclimates in axial muscle; the differences between the control and cold-acclimated group became apparent after 21 days. After 42 days, the activity of LDH in axial muscle in the cold-acclimated group was 30% greater than the control group. Growth rates were maintained at 0.7 mm/week within both treatments despite the 10 degreesC difference in temperature between experimental groups. Both LDH and CS were increased in activity in the liver (5 and 1.3 times greater, respectively, in the cold-acclimated group). The thermal sensitivity (Q(10)) of LDH was between 20 and 30 degreesC in the cold-acclimated group (1.2+/-0.01) when compared to the control group (1.6+/-0.15). The rate at which acclimation in this species occurs is appropriate for seasonal changes in temperature, and these animals may not be able to respond to a rapid drop in temperature.

TI  - Anatomy of a cline: dissecting anti-predatory adaptations in a marine gastropod along the US Atlantic coast
VL  - 40
IS  - 11
SP  - 1285-1299
AB  - The scope of anti-predatory adaptation is expected to be greater in warm than in cold environments. High temperatures lower the costs associated with the production and maintenance of energetically expensive traits and enable ecological interactions to intensify. We tested this hypothesis by characterizing the expression of anti-predatory morphology within a marine gastropod species (the knobbed whelk Busycon carica) over a large (> 1400 km) geographic area that spans more than 10 degrees C annual temperature variation. We also conducted experimental predation studies with a powerful durophagous predator, the stone crab Menippe, to verify the anti-predatory advantages of a heavily ornamented shell morphology (e.g. increased thickness, pronounced spines), and we used repair scar data to assess clinal variation in selective pressure from predators. We predicted that repair scar rates would be greatest in warm southernmost latitudes, and that expression of energetically costly anti-predatory morphology would peak in concert with elevated predation pressures. Experiments confirmed that whelks with energetically costly, heavily ornamented shells had higher survivorship rates than those with weakly ornamented shells. As predicted, we also found that the expression of anti-predatory traits was greatest in the southern part of B. carica's range. After standardizing shells for size, shape, and exposure time to enemies, repair scar rates also peaked to the south. Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of anti-predatory traits along the geographic cline is governed by the interaction of two selective factors: temperature and predation, with the former acting as the ultimate control on the scope of adaptation both by escalating predation pressure in the southern part of B. carica's range and by physically limiting (to the north) and facilitating (to the south) the production of anti-predatory traits. Feedbacks between temperature and predation thus causally interact to enable and drive, respectively, the observed geographic cline in energy-intensive anti-predatory shell traits.

VL  - 5

SP  - 195-201
AB  - Modular hip prostheses are increasing in variety and utilization. Component stability, high endurance limit, and minimal particulate debris generation are critical for long-term clinical success. The purpose of this study was to characterize the fatigue response and evaluate the in vitro potential for component motion and wear of the S-ROM(TM), a Ti-6Al-4V hip prosthesis with a modular design based on a Morse taper connection. A fatigue jig was designed to simulate fixation of the device at the sleeve-bone interface only with distal support mainly against the lateral endosteal cortex. Two series of tests were performed in air at room temperature: one with direct vertical loading (to produce high bending moments in the coronal plane) and one with a compound loading angle directed at 15 degrees out-of-plane (to include torsional physiological loads). Applied loads using a servohydraulic test machine ranged from 5 X BW (body weight) to 9 X BW (1 x BW = 73 kg, approximate to 160 Ib) at 10 Hz on an Instron apparatus. No mechanical failures were observed on the 11-mm size stems below 6 X BW for in-plane vertical loading, and at or below 7 X BW for out-of-plane loading. Using displacement monitoring with a sensitivity of 35 mu m, no measurable slippage or relative motion was detected between the stem and sleeve when they were properly assembled. Examination of the contact areas with scanning electron microscopy revealed random surface modification (an indication of fretting or burnishing) with occasional evidence of transfer of material between stem and sleeve. At loads under 7 X BW there was no visual evidence of loose wear debris in the presence of gross stability. Overall, the extent of surface change or wear was relatively small in all components tested at physiological load levels. (C) 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of adaptation in comparative physiology and biomechanics: overview and a case study of thermal physiology in treefrogs
VL  - 225
AB  - Comparative phylogenetic studies of adaptation are uncommon in biomechanics and physiology. Such studies require data collection from many species, a challenge when this is experimentally intensive. Moreover, researchers struggle to employ the most biologically appropriate phylogenetic tools for identifying adaptive evolution. Here, we detail an established but greatly underutilized phylogenetic comparative framework - the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process - that explicitly models long-term adaptation. We discuss challenges in implementing and interpreting the model, and we outline potential solutions. We demonstrate use of the model through studying the evolution of thermal physiology in treefrogs. Frogs of the family Hylidae have twice colonized the temperate zone from the tropics, and such colonization likely involved a fundamental change in physiology due to colder and more seasonal temperatures. However, which traits changed to allow colonization is unclear. We measured cold tolerance and characterized thermal performance curves in jumping for 12 species of treefrogs distributed from the Neotropics to temperate North America. We then conducted phylogenetic comparative analyses to examine how tolerances and performance curves evolved and to test whether that evolution was adaptive. We found that tolerance to low temperatures increased with the transition to the temperate zone. In contrast, jumping well at colder temperatures was unrelated to biogeography and thus did not adapt during dispersal. Overall, our study shows how comparative phylogenetic methods can be leveraged in biomechanics and physiology to test the evolutionary drivers of variation among species.

TI  - Environmental origins of sexually selected variation and a critique of the fluctuating asymmetry-sexual selection hypothesis
VL  - 59
IS  - 3
SP  - 577-585
AB  - Identifying sources of phenotypic variability in secondary sexual traits is critical for understanding their signaling properties. role in sexual selection, and for predicting their evolutionary dynamics. The present study tests, for till effects of genotype, developmental temperature, and their interaction, on size and fluctuating asymmetry of the male sex comb. a secondary sexual character, in Drosophila bipectinata Duda. Both the size and symmetry of elements of the sex comb have been shown previously to be under sexual selection in a natural population in northeastern Australia. Two independent reciprocal crosses were conducted at 25 degrees and 29 degrees C between genetic lines extracted from this Population that differed in the size of the first (TC1) and third (TC3) comb segments. These temperatures are within the documented range experienced by the species in nature. Additive and dominance genetic effects were detected for TC1. whereas additive genetic, and Y-chromosomal effects were detected for TC3. TC2 and TC3 decreased sharply with increasing temperature, by 10% and 22%, respectively. In contrast, positional fluctuating asymmetry (PFA) significantly increased with temperature, by up to 38%. The results (1) document an important source of environmental variance in a sexual ornament expected to reduce trait heritability in field populations, and thus act to attenuate response to sexual selection, (2) suggest that variation in ornament size reflects differences in male condition; and (3) Support the general hypothesis that asymmetry in a sexual ornament is indicative of developmental instability arising from environmental stress. The "environmental heterogeneity'' (EH) hypothesis is proposed, and supportive evidence for it presented, to explain negative size-FA correlations in natural populations. Data and theory challenge the use of negative size-FA correlations observed in nature to support the FA-sexual selection hypothesis, which posits that such correlations are driven by differences in genetic quality among individuals.

TI  - Climatic adaptation in Drosophila: phenotypic plasticity of morphological traits along a seasonal cycle
VL  - 55
IS  - 1
SP  - 48-60
AB  - Drosophila species often exhibit latitudinal clines for morphological traits, frequently interpreted as adaptations to local climates conditions, especially to temperature. While there are many works on climatic data and genetic variations, the precise effects of temperature in natural conditions are not known. Here, we investigated the phenotypic variations of wild collected Drosophila simulans adults over 12 successive months during which average air temperature varied from 14 to 30 degrees C. Three kinds of traits were measured each month on random samples of 50 flies from two sites and, as control, in laboratory cultures grown at several constant temperatures ranging for 12 to 31 degrees C. All traits exhibited major changes in their mean values. For size-related traits and abdomen pigmentation, a maximum was observed during the coldest months and a minimum in summer. For sternopleural bristles number, a reverse shape was observed with a maximum in July. The shapes of these curves match the shapes of the reaction norms observed under laboratory conditions. For size and pigmentation, mean values are negatively correlated to temperature, but the magnitude of the variation was far less important in nature than in the laboratory. We suggest that the air temperature is not a convenient indicator of the real developmental temperature in nature, especially for low temperatures. Our results show that thermal seasonal variations produce different phenotypes, which may be submitted to natural selection. However, temperature is not the only source of variation and nutritional effects on larvae play also an important role. The impact of temperature in nature is clearly less important than when investigated in the laboratory. Such a result should be considered in ecological genetic studies, especially when biological data are correlated with a diversity of abiotic climatic factors.

TI  - Differential Habitat Use between Adult European Sea Bass and North Atlantic Cod in the Inner Oslo Fjord: Influence of Abiotic Environmental Variables
VL  - 76
SP  - 265-288
AB  - Environmental variables and interspecific interactions influence fishes' habitat use. The eurythermic and euryhaline European sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax is increasing in Norwegian waters. We compare diel- and seasonal habitat use and home ranges of this species with Atlantic cod Gadus morhua in the Oslofjord, Norway. Individual depth and horizontal positions were obtained using acoustic telemetry. Fish were tracked using both portable and stationary receivers. Both species displayed high site fidelity from June to October. In late October, the sea bass migrated out of the core area whereas the cod remained. Cod home ranges (11.4 +/- 5.5 ha) were smaller than sea bass home ranges (42.6 +/- 26.1 ha) throughout the study. Home range increased with individual body size in sea bass, but not cod. The two species had differential diel- and seasonal depth use. Sea bass used depths shallower than 4 m during June through September, with diel vertical migrations rarely exceeding 2 m. After September, sea bass sought deeper waters; stabilizing at 11 m in November with a diel migration amplitude of 7 m. Cod stayed deeper than the 9-10 m thermocline in August with vertical migration amplitude of 7 m and moved into daytime depths of 6.5 m with diel amplitude of 4.5 m in December. Sea bass actively selected warmer temperatures and the lowest salinities available, whereas cod avoided temperatures higher than 13 degrees C and salinities below 24 ppt. The differential temperature preference for these species is likely the main driver for the differential depth utilization. A model using air temperatures as a predictor was constructed predicting daytime and night-time depth use. This study provides novel insights to the habitat use of the two species under Nordic fjord conditions-information to be included in upcoming management programs emerging due to the continuing northward colonization of sea bass along the Norwegian coast.

TI  - Development and growth in synanthropic species: plasticity and constraints
VL  - 101
IS  - 7
SP  - 565-575
AB  - Urbanization poses serious extinction risks, yet some species thrive in urban environments. This may be due to a pronounced developmental plasticity in these taxa, since phenotypically, plastic organisms may better adjust to unpredictable urban food resources. We studied phenotypic plasticity in Nuctenea umbratica, a common European forest and urban vegetation spider. We subjected spiderlings to low (LF), medium (MF) and high (HF) food treatments and documented their growth and developmental trajectories into adulthood. Spiders from the three treatments had comparable numbers of instars and growth ratios, but differed in developmental periods. Longest developing LF spiders (a (TM) EuroaEuro parts per thousand= 390, a (TM),aEuro parts per thousand= 320 days) had the smallest adults, but MF (a (TM) EuroaEuro parts per thousand= 300, a (TM),aEuro parts per thousand= 240 days) and HF (a (TM) EuroaEuro parts per thousand= 240, a (TM),aEuro parts per thousand= 210 days) spiders reached comparable adult sizes through shorter development. While males and females had comparable instar numbers, females had longer development, higher growth ratios, adult sizes and mass; and while males adjusted their moulting to food availability, female moulting depended on specific mass, not food treatment. We discussed the patterns of Nuctenea sex-specific development and compared our results with published data on two other Holarctic urban colonizers (Larinioides sclopetarius, Zygiella x-notata) exhibiting high plasticity and fast generation turn-over. We conclude that despite relatively unconstrained developmental time in the laboratory enabling Nuctenea to achieve maximal mass and size-main female fitness proxies-their relatively fixed growth ratio and long generation turn-over may explain their lower success in urban environments.

TI  - Altitudinal gradient in species richness and composition of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) in an eastern Euro-Mediterranean locality: Functional, seasonal and habitat influences
VL  - 116
SP  - 309-319
AB  - The altitudinal gradient in diversity of dung beetles (Scarabaeidae) was studied in a Mediterranean mountain chain located in Central Anatolia to (i) determine if there are altitudinal differences between the main taxonomic groups, (ii) describe the seasonal variations in these assemblages and (iii) assess whether closed habitats influence dung beetle diversity differentially at different altitudes. Beetles were collected throughout a year at 14 localities between 469 and 1810 m above sea level in three different types of habitats. Dung beetle assemblages at 400 to 1200 m did not vary greatly in species richness, abundance and biomass. However, they varied in composition, with the assemblages dominated by species of Scarabaeinae up to 900 m, whereas in the mid-mountain assemblages (from 900 m to 1600 m) the numbers of species of Aphodiinae was higher. The decline with increase in altitude in richness, abundance and biomass of both small and large species of Scarabaeinae up to 1500 m, together with the constancy of these parameters in the case of Aphodiinae, accounts for the changes in the composition from the lowland to mid-mountain localities. Unlike at other Mediterranean localities, the open/closed structure of the habitat only slightly influences these assemblages independently of altitude or season. The general seasonal pattern follows the classical Mediterranean bimodal pattern associated with summer drought, but the patterns are more complex when the seasonal responses of the different groups and at different localities are analysed separately. We propose that the interplay between local climatic conditions (mainly temperature) and evolutionary conserved species preferences accounts for both the current seasonal and altitudinal gradients and the changes in species composition in terms of Aphodiinae and Scarabaeinae.

TI  - Understanding the individual to implement the ecosystem approach to fisheries management
VL  - 4
AB  - Ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management (EAFMs) have emerged as requisite for sustainable use of fisheries resources. At the same time, however, there is a growing recognition of the degree of variation among individuals within a population, as well as the ecological consequences of this variation. Managing resources at an ecosystem level calls on practitioners to consider evolutionary processes, and ample evidence from the realm of fisheries science indicates that anthropogenic disturbance can drive changes in predominant character traits (e.g. size at maturity). Eco-evolutionary theory suggests that human-induced trait change and the modification of selective regimens might contribute to ecosystem dynamics at a similar magnitude to species extirpation, extinction and ecological dysfunction. Given the dynamic interaction between fisheries and target species via harvest and subsequent ecosystem consequences, we argue that individual diversity in genetic, physiological and behavioural traits are important considerations under EAFMs. Here, we examine the role of individual variation in a number of contexts relevant to fisheries management, including the potential ecological effects of rapid trait change. Using select examples, we highlight the extent of phenotypic diversity of individuals, as well as the ecological constraints on such diversity. We conclude that individual phenotypic diversity is a complex phenomenon that needs to be considered in EAFMs, with the ultimate realization that maintaining or increasing individual trait diversity may afford not only species, but also entire ecosystems, with enhanced resilience to environmental perturbations. Put simply, individuals are the foundation from which population-and ecosystem-level traits emerge and are therefore of central importance for the ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management.

TI  - SACQ Solder Board Level Reliability Evaluation and Life Prediction Model for Wafer Level Packages
SP  - 1058-1064
AB  - Wafer Level Chip Scale Packaging (WLCSP) designs, including Wafer Level Fan-Out (WLFO) technologies, are gaining more and more applications for next generation small and thin devices. Since the WLCSP and WLFO packages are mounted directly on the motherboard without a substrate as a buffer, the large coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between the silicon die and the motherboard makes the temperature cycle board level reliability (BLR) of WLCSP and WLFO a tremendous challenge, especially for large body sizes. Currently, a tin (Sn)-silver (Ag)-copper (Cu) solder alloy such as SAC405 is commonly used in WLCSP and WLFO designs, but it has difficulty meeting the board level reliability when the footprint exceeds a certain size. As a result, a new type of solder alloy, SACQ, has been developed in recent years to enhance BLR performance. However, there is little published reliability data of how this new SACQ solder performed in actual package applications. There is also lack of a BLR life prediction model for SACQ solder, unlike the other typical eutectic or leadfree solders. In this paper, the board level temperature cycle reliability of SACQ solder is tested with various WLCSP and WLFO packages configurations. The failure modes associated with SACQ solder are evaluated in detail as well. The temperature cycle performance of SACQ solder is also compared to SAC405 solder, and shows significant improvement consistently over all the packages tested. In addition to the empirical study, a BLR life prediction model for SACQ is also developed based on finite element model (FEM). The required SACQ creep material properties, finite element model setup, damage indicator selection, and life prediction model correlation are all described with details in the paper.

TI  - Characterization of Fine-Pitch Solder Bump Joint and Package Warpage for Low K High-Pin-Count Flip-Chip BGA through Shadow Moire and Micro Moire Techniques
SP  - 431-440
AB  - Flip chip-substrate interconnect joint reliability using either leaded, lead-free solder bumps or more recent Cu pillar, has been well recognized since the first flip chip package was developed and started volume production. Recently the relative displacement between the bump and bump pad, induced by package warpage, has received significantly increasing interest, especially for those devices with low K dielectric and fine-pitch interconnects (solder bump, eutectic tin-lead, lead free or Cu pillar), as the pitch becomes smaller and the package body size becomes larger. In order to quantitatively characterize the physical relation between package micron-level warpage and solder bump nano-level displacement, a systematic study of warpage characteristics of 1112-ball flip-chip BGA with and without a heat spreader was carried out in this study, using both Shadow Moire technique and Micro Moire interferometry. Shadow Moire technique was used to characterize the overall package warpage between room temperature and solder ball reflow temperature of 230 degrees C. Micro Moire interferometry was carried out at temperature range from room temperature to 114 degrees C. Effects of a heat spreader on the total package warpage were characterized through Shadow Moire measurement which clearly showed it is effective to alter the warpage pattern of a package from convex(w/o) to concave(w/), while the package warpage of both types of packages were well-controlled under 16um. Furthermore, the correlation between Shadow Moire and Micro Moire is also described in this study. A close correlation between two interferometry results is established. This study develops a very useful physical method enables a direct and quantitative estimation of solder bump displacement in terms of package-level warpage. Results can be used to evaluate chip-level interconnect reliability, packaging design and materials selection, particularly, for the next generation of Si nodes and the implementation of new low-K dielectric.

TI  - METABOLISM AND FEEDING OF MESOZOOPLANKTON IN THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN (HELLENIC COASTAL WATERS)
VL  - 126
IS  - 1
SP  - 39-48
AB  - Respiration, ammonium and phosphate excretions and phytoplankton consumption of mesozooplankton were examined biweekly in a coastal area of the eastern Mediterranean from January 1989 to January 1990. Taking into account the ambient temperature, the metabolic rates estimated (4 to 31.2 mu l O-2 mg(-1) dw h(-1), 0.4 to 3.5 mu g NH4-N mg(-1) dw h(-1) and 0.1 to 0.6 mu g PO4-P mg(-1) dw h(-1)) were lower than those reported for the western Mediterranean, which might be related to the higher oligotrophy in the eastern Mediterranean. Maxima for these metabolic rates and that for zooplankton community respiration (7 mg O-2 m(-3) d(-1)) were all observed during the period of higher temperatures; some degree of acclimation was also inferred and this may be attributed to the high abundance of cladocerans in the summer. Simple and multiple regression models, the latter based on stepwise variable selection, suggested that temperature was the most significant variable affecting zooplankton metabolism. Body weight and population composition were also important variables. Feeding activity, sometimes showing an increase with food concentration, seemed to increase metabolic rate, but temperature may mask this effect. The low O:N ratio indicated a protein-oriented metabolism. Furthermore, the O:N, N:P and O:P fluctuations indicated a dissimilarity in zooplankton dietary pattern, probably due to the low phytoplankton levels and differing exploitation of other supplementary food sources. The results stress the importance of temperature, rather than food or other factors, for zooplankton metabolism in coastal areas of the oligotrophic eastern Mediterranean, which during summer is comparable to oligotrophic tropical seas.

TI  - GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION IN THE OVIPOSITOR LENGTH OF A CRICKET
VL  - 76
IS  - 5
SP  - 1473-1482
AB  - Females of many insects possess an ovipositor, which in crickets is usually used to place eggs deep into the soil. Ovipositor length in female striped ground crickets (Allonemobius socius) increased at higher latitudes and altitudes in North America, despite an opposing trend in overall body size. Crickets inhabiting regions with short growing seasons and long, cold winters invariably had longer ovipositors than crickets inhabiting warmer regions. The only exception to this observation was for first generation crickets in bivoltine populations where there was no pattern of geographic variation in ovipositor length. However, second generation females from these same populations always had longer ovipositors than their first generation ancestors, and followed a pattern of geographic variation similar to that found for univoltine crickets. Overall, these results support Masaki's (1986) model, which predicts that longer ovipositors will evolve in northern cricket populations as an evolutionary response to the selective advantages of overwintering eggs being oviposited deep in the soil in cold habitats. In order to determine the mechanisms underlying patterns of phenotypic variation in the wild, and to test the hypothesis that interpopulation variation reflects genetic differentiation while intergeneration variation within a population reflects environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity, crickets from eight populations were brought to the laboratory and reared through three generations in a common garden. It was found that laboratory-reared populations varied significantly in ovipositor length, with the pattern of variation mimicking that found for field-collected crickets. This finding supports the hypothesis that geographic variation in the wild has a significant genetic basis. The influence of environment on ovipositor length was examined in 20 full-sib families from a bivoltine population. Crickets reared in ''autumn-like'' conditions (30 degrees C, 15:9 h, L:D), such as might be experienced by second generation bivoltine crickets in the wild, were generally larger and had significantly longer ovipositors than siblings reared under ''spring-like'' conditions (27 degrees C, 11:13 h, L:D). This pattern corresponds to that observed for bivoltine populations in the wild and suggests the importance of environmental cues for phenotypic plasticity, or polyphenism in ovipositor length in bivoltine populations of this cricket.

TI  - Maternal provisioning and fluctuating thermal regimes enhance immune response in a reptile with temperature-dependent sex determination
VL  - 224
IS  - 5
AB  - The Charnov-Bull model of differential fitness is often used to explain the evolution and maintenance of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). Most tests of the model focus on morphological proxies of fitness, such as size traits, whereas early life physiological traits that are closely related to lifetime fitness might provide a framework for generalizing the Charnov-Bull model across taxa. One such trait is the strength of the early-life immune response, which is strongly linked to early-life survival and fitness. Here, we manipulated temperature, variance in temperature, and sex to test the Charnov-Bull model using a physiological trait, immune system strength, in the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina). We found no evidence of sex-specific differences in bactericidal capacity of hatchling blood, and no evidence that mean temperature influences bactericidal capacity. However, we did find that fluctuating incubation temperature (i.e. a more naturalized incubation regime) is associated with a greater bactericidal capacity compared with constant temperature incubation. We also found that egg mass, a proxy for maternal provisioning, is positively associated with bactericidal capacity. Our findings suggest that the evolution of temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles is unrelated to our measure of early-life innate immunity. Our study also underlines how immune response is condition dependent in early life, and questions the biological relevance of constant temperature incubation in experimental studies on ectotherm development.

TI  - Conserved and Divergent Aspects of Plasticity and Sexual Dimorphism in Wing Size and Shape in Three Diptera
VL  - 9
AB  - The ability of powered flight in insects facilitated their great evolutionary success allowing them to occupy various ecological niches. Beyond this primary task, wings are often involved in various premating behaviors, such as the generation of courtship songs and the initiation of mating in flight. These specific functions imply special adaptations of wing morphology, as well as sex-specific wing morphologies. Although wing morphology has been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen, 1830), a comprehensive understanding of developmental plasticity and the impact of sex on wing size and shape plasticity is missing for other Diptera. Therefore, we raised flies of the three Diptera species Drosophila melanogaster, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann, 1824) and Musca domestica (Linnaeus, 1758) at different environmental conditions and applied geometric morphometrics to analyze wing shape. Our data showed extensive interspecific differences in wing shape, as well as a clear sexual wing shape dimorphism in all three species. We revealed an impact of different rearing temperatures on wing shape in all three species, which was mostly explained by plasticity in wing size in D. melanogaster. Rearing densities had significant effects on allometric wing shape in D. melanogaster, while no obvious effects were observed for the other two species. Additionally, we did not find evidence for sex-specific response to different rearing conditions in D. melanogaster and C. capitata, while a male-specific impact of different rearing conditions was observed on non-allometric wing shape in M. domestica. Overall, our data strongly suggests that many aspects of wing morphology underly species-specific adaptations and we discuss potential developmental and functional implications of our results.

TI  - Unraveling the World's Longest Non-stop Migration: The Indian Ocean Crossing of the Globe Skimmer Dragonfly
VL  - 9
AB  - Insect migration redistributes enormous quantities of biomass, nutrients and species globally. A subset of insect migrants perform extreme long-distance journeys, requiring specialized morphological, physiological and behavioral adaptations. The migratory globe skimmer dragonfly (Pantala flavescens) is hypothesized to migrate from India across the Indian Ocean to East Africa in the autumn, with a subsequent generation thought to return to India from East Africa the following spring. Using an energetic flight model and wind trajectory analysis, we evaluate the dynamics of this proposed transoceanic migration, which is considered to be the longest regular non-stop migratory flight when accounting for body size. The energetic flight model suggests that a mixed strategy of gliding and active flapping would allow a globe skimmer to stay airborne for up to 230-286 h, assuming that the metabolic rate of gliding flight is close to that of resting. If engaged in continuous active flapping flight only, the flight time is severely reduced to similar to 4 h. Relying only on self-powered flight (combining active flapping and gliding), a globe skimmer could cross the Indian Ocean, but the migration would have to occur where the ocean crossing is shortest, at an exceptionally fast gliding speed and with little headwind. Consequently, we deem this scenario unlikely and suggest that wind assistance is essential for the crossing. The wind trajectory analysis reveals intra- and inter-seasonal differences in availability of favorable tailwinds, with only 15.2% of simulated migration trajectories successfully reaching land in autumn but 40.9% in spring, taking on average 127 and 55 h respectively. Thus, there is a pronounced requirement on dragonflies to be able to select favorable winds, especially in autumn. In conclusion, a multi-generational, migratory circuit of the Indian Ocean by the globe skimmer is shown to be achievable, provided that advanced adaptations in physiological endurance, behavior and wind selection ability are present. Given that migration over the Indian Ocean would be heavily dependent on the assistance of favorable winds, occurring during a relatively narrow time window, the proposed flyway is potentially susceptible to disruption, if wind system patterns were to be affected by climatic change.

TI  - Temperature effects on copepod egg hatching: does acclimatization matter?
VL  - 32
IS  - 3
SP  - 305-315
AB  - This report investigates female sizes, egg sizes and egg hatching rates in relation to temperature for the near-shore calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa cultured at 6, 9, 14 and 24 degrees C for several generations to achieve acclimatization. Inverse size relationships of eggs and females were revealed with increasing temperature. Eggs produced at 6 degrees C were 85 +/- 4 mu m in diameter, but decreased to 80 +/- 3 mu m at 24 degrees C. Female cephalothorax length was 840 +/- 52 and 692 +/- 39 mu m at 9 and 24 degrees C, respectively. Parallel hatching experiments were performed between non-acclimatized and acclimatized cultures across a range of temperatures reflecting natural conditions in Danish waters. A greater fraction of eggs enter quiescence as temperature declines. Eggs were able to hatch at temperatures as low as 1.5 degrees C. Final egg hatching success increased with temperature. Acclimatization of the copepods resulted in a lower maximum hatching rate, but a higher final hatching success at 9 and 6 degrees C compared with egg hatching from non-acclimatized copepods. Eggs develop significantly better at low temperatures when compared with females in culture. This adaptation suggests that the observed annual population fluctuations in, for example, Danish waters can be explained as follows: the population of copepods in the pelagic virtually die out during the autumn-winter months; the population the following year emerges from resting eggs from the sediment and is produced by the pelagic copepods the previous year(s).

AB  - Caprella mutica (Amphipoda) has been successfully reared through several generations per year for public exhibition in a tank of 500 L, more than five year after introduction of the species into the Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium, Japan. The tank was equipped with a coral sand bed filter, a circulation system, and a heater/chiller unit. Artificial seawater (Reef Crystals) was used as a medium. The diatom Phaeodactylum and hatched juveniles of Artemia were provided as food for C. mutica. Two years after the introduction, the sex ratio (females/(females + males)) was 0.50. Males reached body lengths up to 20.5 rum, while the largest female was 10.4 mm long. The average number of embryos/female was 33.0. Embryos were 0.38 to 0.41 mm in the long axis, and 0.30 to 0.33 mm in the short axis. These reproductive characters enable the production of multiple generations in a single year.

TI  - Temperature responses of mutation rate and mutational spectrum in an Escherichia coli strain and the correlation with metabolic rate
VL  - 18
AB  - Background: Temperature is a major determinant of spontaneous mutation, but the precise mode, and the underlying mechanisms, of the temperature influences remain less clear. Here we used a mutation accumulation approach combined with whole-genome sequencing to investigate the temperature dependence of spontaneous mutation in an Escherichia coli strain. Experiments were performed under aerobic conditions at 25, 28 and 37 degrees C, three temperatures that were non-stressful for the bacterium but caused significantly different bacterial growth rates. Results: Mutation rate did not differ between 25 and 28 degrees C, but was higher at 37 degrees C. Detailed analyses of the molecular spectrum of mutations were performed; and a particularly interesting finding is that higher temperature led to a bias of mutation to coding, relative to noncoding, DNA. Furthermore, the temperature response of mutation rate was extremely similar to that of metabolic rate, consistent with an idea that metabolic rate predicts mutation rate. Conclusions: Temperature affects mutation rate and the types of mutation supply, both being crucial for the opportunity of natural selection. Our results help understand how temperature drives evolutionary speed of organisms and thus the global patterns of biodiversity. This study also lend support to the metabolic theory of ecology for linking metabolic rate and molecular evolution rate.

TI  - LEPTIN IS THE MODULATOR OF HSP60 GENE EXPRESSION IN AR42J CELLS
VL  - 57
SP  - 135-143
AB  - Leptin, circulating protein involved in the control of body weight and energy expenditure received attention as a modulator of immune response of the organism. Leptin receptors have been detected in the pancreas and experimental studies have shown that leptin protects the pancreas against the damage induced by caerulein overstimulation. Heat shock proteins (HSP) are endogenous proteins produced by various cells exposed to high temperature or to the noxious agents. HSP protect the cells against various environmental and endogenous stressors. The implication of HSP60 in the leptin-induced pancreatic protection has not been examined yet. The aim of this study was: to investigate the changes of HSP60 mRNA signal in the pancreatic AR42J cells subjected to caerulein and leptin. AR42J cells were incubated in standart medium at 37 degrees C for: 0, 1, 3, 5, 12 or 24 h, under basal conditions. Incubation time of 3 h was selected for the next experiments. AR42J cells were incubated in presence of caerulein (10(-11), 10(-9) or 10(-7)M), leptin (10(-8) or 10(-6)M), or combination of above. Gene expression for HSP60 was determined by RT-PCR. The mRNA signal for HSP60 has been observed in AR42J pancreatic cells under basal conditions. Incubation of AR42J cells in presence of leptin (10(-8) or 10-(6)(M)) resulted in the significant increase of gene expression for HSP60 in both groups of AR42J cells. Caerulein stimulation reduced mRNA signal for HSP60. The strongest mRNA signal for HSP60 has been observed after the exposition of AR42J cells to combination of leptin and caerulein. We conclude that: 1. Gene expression for HSP60 has been detected in pancreatic AR42J cells under basal conditions. 2. HSP60 gene expression was significantly increased in pancreatic AR42J cells stimulated by leptin whereas caerulein reduced this signal. 3. The strongest gene expression for HSP60 has been detected in the cells incubated with combination of caerulein and leptin.

TI  - Evidence of Countergradient Variation in Growth of Spotted Gars from Core and Peripheral Populations
VL  - 144
IS  - 4
SP  - 837-850
AB  - Peripheral populations occupy the edge of a species' range and may exhibit adaptations to potentially "harsher" marginal environments compared with core populations. The peripheral population of Spotted Gar Lepisosteus oculatus in the Great Lakes basin represents the northern edge of the species' range and is completely disjunct from the core Mississippi River basin population. Age-0 Spotted Gars from the peripheral population experience a growing season approximately half that of the core population but reach similar sizes by winter, suggesting potential for countergradient variation in growth, i.e. an evolutionary response to an environmental gradient such as latitude to compensate for the usual phenotypic effect of that gradient. In this study we used two common garden experiments to investigate potential countergradient variation in growth of young-of-year Spotted Gars from peripheral populations in comparison with those from core populations. Our first experiment showed that in a common environment under temperatures within the first growing season (22-24 degrees C), Spotted Gars from the peripheral population had significantly higher growth rates than those from the core population. Final Spotted Gar weight-length ratio was also higher in the peripheral versus core population. In our second experiment, under three temperature treatments (16, 23, and 30 degrees C), maximum growth occurred at the highest temperature, whereas growth ceased at the lowest temperature for both populations. These results suggest that important genetic and physiological differences could exist between the two population groups, consistent with countergradient variation. Our findings indicate that countergradient growth variation can occur even in relatively slowly evolving fishes, such as gars (family Lepisosteidae), and that protection of peripheral populations should be a key component of fish conservation planning.

TI  - Geometric Morphometrics of Nine Field Isolates of Aedes aegypti with Different Resistance Levels to Lambda-Cyhalothrin and Relative Fitness of One Artificially Selected for Resistance
VL  - 9
IS  - 5
AB  - Aedes aegypti, a mosquito closely associated with humans, is the principal vector of dengue virus which currently infects about 400 million people worldwide. Because there is no way to prevent infection, public health policies focus on vector control; but insecticide-resistance threatens them. However, most insecticide-resistant mosquito populations exhibit fitness costs in absence of insecticides, although these costs vary. Research on components of fitness that vary with insecticide-resistance can help to develop policies for effective integrated management and control. We investigated the relationships in wing size, wing shape, and natural resistance levels to lambda-cyhalothrin of nine field isolates. Also we chose one of these isolates to select in lab for resistance to the insecticide. The main life-traits parameters were assessed to investigate the possible fitness cost and its association with wing size and shape. We found that wing shape, more than wing size, was strongly correlated with resistance levels to lambda-cyhalothrin in field isolates, but founder effects of culture in the laboratory seem to change wing shape (and also wing size) more easily than artificial selection for resistance to that insecticide. Moreover, significant fitness costs were observed in response to insecticide-resistance as proved by the diminished fecundity and survival of females in the selected line and the reversion to susceptibility in 20 generations of the non-selected line. As a practical consequence, we think, mosquito control programs could benefit from this knowledge in implementing efficient strategies to prevent the evolution of resistance. In particular, the knowledge of reversion to susceptibility is important because it can help in planning better strategies of insecticide use to keep useful the few insecticide-molecules currently available.

TI  - Unique Genomic and Phenotypic Responses to Extreme and Variable pH Conditions in Purple Urchin Larvae
VL  - 60
IS  - 2
SP  - 318-331
AB  - Environmental variation experienced by a species across space and time can promote the maintenance of genetic diversity that may be adaptive in future global change conditions. Selection experiments have shown that purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, populations have adaptive genetic variation for surviving pH conditions at the "edge" (pH 7.5) of conditions experienced in nature. However, little is known about whether populations have genetic variation for surviving low-pH events beyond those currently experienced in nature or how variation in pH conditions affects organismal and genetic responses. Here, we quantified survival, growth, and allele frequency shifts in experimentally selected developing purple sea urchin larvae in static and variable conditions at three pH levels: pH 8.1 (control), pH 7.5 (edge-of-range), and pH 7.0 (extreme). Variable treatments recovered body size relative to static treatments, but resulted in higher mortality, suggesting a potential tradeoff between survival and growth under pH stress. However, within each pH level, allele frequency changes were overlapping between static and variable conditions, suggesting a shared genetic basis underlying survival to mean pH regardless of variability. In contrast, genetic responses to pH 7.5 (edge) versus pH 7.0 (extreme) conditions were distinct, indicating a unique genetic basis of survival. In addition, loci under selection were more likely to be in exonic regions than regulatory, indicating that selection targeted protein-coding variation. Loci under selection in variable pH 7.5 conditions, more similar to conditions periodically experienced in nature, performed functions related to lipid biosynthesis and metabolism, while loci under selection in static pH 7.0 conditions performed functions related to transmembrane and mitochondrial processes. While these results are promising in that purple sea urchin populations possess genetic variation for surviving extreme pH conditions not currently experienced in nature, they caution that increased acidification does not result in a linear response but elicits unique physiological stresses and survival mechanisms.

TI  - Correlational selection on size and development time is inconsistent across early life stages
VL  - 34
IS  - 5
SP  - 681-691
AB  - Size and development time are universally important traits. Yet evolutionary trends in development time are often viewed as allometric and physiological by-products of initial size, when life-history theory predicts that both traits are targets of selection and evolve adaptively through opposing effects on fitness. Surprisingly, this prediction has rarely been tested by disentangling the direct and indirect effects of size and development time on fitness, as necessary to understand selection on each trait. Here, in a marine external fertiliser that provides novel scope for such tests, we measure directional, quadratic, and correlational selection acting on early size (of embryos and post-hatch larvae) and development time (from fertilisation to hatching) through survival of juveniles in the field. We find little directional selection acting on traits during this selective episode. Rather, selection is primarily correlational, targeting combinations of development time and post-development size in a way that acts against their already-weak positive correlation, and could eventually drive a negative correlation between them if persistent enough. Lack of correlational selection on combinations of embryo size and development time, in contrast, suggests that physiological or allometric constraints more likely explain their positive association. Hence, neither life-history theory nor principles of allometry and physiology alone may predict the evolution of size and development time, warranting greater appreciation of the tension between adaptive and non-adaptive explanations for evolutionary trends in these traits.

SP  - 375-382
AB  - Tadpoles and adults of American toads, Bufo americanus, were forced to sprint at different body temperatures. Tadpoles sprint at 80%, or better, of their maximal sprint rate between 17 and 36 C, whereas adults achieve the same performance level over a narrower range of 21-34 C. In a laboratory thermal gradient with a wet sandy substratum, presumably well-hydrated juvenile toads preferentially select body temperatures that tend to optimize sprint performance. In a thermal gradient with a dry substratum, presumably dehydrated juvenile toads select body temperatures that minimize loss of water. In a thermal gradient with both wet and dry substrata, juvenile toads generally remain on wet substrata and select temperatures available in those wetter environments at which they can best approach maximal sprint performance. They typically avoid dry substrata that would result in dehydration, even when those environments off er temperatures conducive to better sprint performance. juvenile toads, owing to their diurnal habit and small body size, are more able than adults to regulate body temperature through behavioral selection of thermal microsites. Indeed, adult American toads in nature likely rarely achieve body temperatures necessary for optimal locomotor performance. We hypothesize that the thermal optimum for locomotion in B. americanus evolved in response to selective pressures on juveniles.

TI  - Investigating trends in the growth of five demersal fish species from the Firth of Clyde and the wider western shelf of Scotland
VL  - 177
SP  - 71-81
AB  - Demersal fish landings from the Firth of Clyde peaked in 1973, then declined rapidly until the targeted demersal fishery ceased in 2005. The abundance of large fish decreased during this period, and their numbers have not recovered since 2005. We aim to determine whether changing growth rates have contributed to the decline in the abundance of large fish. Bottom trawl survey data from 1980 to 2012 was used to calculate the annual mean length-at-age and time series of von Bertalanffy growth parameters of five demersal species; cod, haddock, whiting, Norway pout and saithe. Two regions were considered: the Firth of Clyde and the neighbouring seas west of Scotland (the western shelf). There have been substantial decreases in the lengths of most age groups of Clyde haddock and whiting due to declines in both asymptotic length and von Bertalanffy growth rate. Lengths-at-age have also declined in western shelf populations, but at markedly slower rates than within the Clyde. Trends in temperature and year class strength tended to contribute little to changes in the growth parameters, so declines in length-at-age have been largely due to other factors. Fishing intensity is greater in the Clyde than western shelf, and the size selectivity of the fisheries differ as more Clyde vessels use Nephrops trawling gear. Since trends in growth were also more extreme in the Clyde, it appears as though size-selective fishing may have caused reductions in the lengths of these fish. If the changes in growth are partially due to fishing induced evolution then it may take many generations for the changes to reverse. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Does behavioural hypothermia promote post-exercise recovery in cold-submerged frogs?
VL  - 202
IS  - 5
SP  - 609-622
AB  - At the low temperatures of the overwintering environment of the frog Rana temporaria, small changes in ambient temperature have large effects on metabolism and behaviour, especially since Q(10) values are often greatly elevated in the cold. How the overwintering aquatic frog copes with variable thermal environments in terms of its overall activity metabolism and recovery from pursuit by predators is poorly understood, as is the role of behavioural thermoregulation in furthering recovery from intense activity, Exhaustive exercise was chosen as the method of evaluating activity capacity (defined by time to exhaustion, total distance swum and number of leg contractions before exhaustion) and was determined at 1.5 and 7 degrees C, Other cohorts of frogs were examined at both temperatures to determine the metabolic (acid-base, lactate, glucose, ATF and creatine phosphate) and respiratory responses to exercise in cold-submerged frogs. Finally, temperature preference before and after exercise was determined in a thermal gradient to define the importance of behavioural thermoregulation on the recovery rates of relevant metabolic and respiratory processes. Activity capacity was significantly reduced in frogs exercised at 1.5 versus 7 degrees C, although similar levels of tissue acid-base metabolites and lactate were reached, Blood pH, plasma PCO2 and lactate levels recovered more rapidly at 1.5 degrees C than at 7 degrees C; however, intracellular pH and the recovery of tissue metabolite levels were independent of temperature. Resting aerobic metabolic rates were strongly affected by temperature (Q(10)=3.82); however, rates determined immediately after exercise showed a reduced temperature sensitivity (Q(10)=1.67) and, therefore, a reduced factorial aerobic scope, Excess oxygen consumption recovered to resting values after 5-6.25 h, and 67% recovery times tended to be slightly faster at the lower temperatures, Exercise in the cold, therefore, provided an immediately higher factorial scope, which could be involved in the faster rate of recovery of blood lactate levels in the colder frogs, In addition, exercise significantly lowered the preferred temperature of the frogs from 6.7 to 3.6 degrees C for nearly 7 h, after which they returned to their normal, unstressed preferred temperatures. Thus, a transient behavioural hypothermia in the skin-breathing, overwintering frog may be an important strategy for minimising post-exercise stress and maintaining aerobic metabolism during recovery from intense activity.

VL  - 55
IS  - 1
SP  - 205-209
AB  - We explored the extent to which a phenotypic trait (walking speed) of Drosophila melanogaster is influenced by population, developmental temperature, adult temperature, and age. Our goals were to estimate the importance of these factors and to test the beneficial acclimation hypothesis. We measured speed of flies from two populations (the Congo and France) that developed at different temperatures (18, 25, and 29 degreesC) and were tested at different temperatures (18, 25, and 29 degreesC) and ages (2, 7, 13 days). Not surprisingly, speed increased strongly with test temperature. Speed was generally greatest for flies reared at an intermediate developmental temperature, contrary to the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, which predicts that speed would be greatest when influenced by interactions involving population. For example, speed was greatest for flies from France that developed at a low temperature, but for flies from the Congo that developed at a high temperature. The impact of developmental temperature declined with age. Surprisingly, speed actually increased with age for flies raised and maintained at a low temperature, but decreased with age for flies raised and maintained at an intermediate or at a high temperature. Thus, walking performance is highly dynamic phenotypically, complicating potential attempts to predict responses to selection on performance.

TI  - Understanding variation in metabolic rate
VL  - 221
IS  - 1
AB  - Metabolic rate reflects an organism's capacity for growth, maintenance and reproduction, and is likely to be a target of selection. Physiologists have long sought to understand the causes and consequences of within-individual to among-species variation in metabolic rates - how metabolic rates relate to performance and how they should evolve. Traditionally, this has been viewed from a mechanistic perspective, relying primarily on hypothesis-driven approaches. A more agnostic, but ultimately more powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of phenotypic variation is through use of the breeder's equation, because variation in metabolic rate is likely to be a consequence of underlying microevolutionary processes. Here we show that metabolic rates are often significantly heritable, and are therefore free to evolve under selection. We note, however, that 'metabolic rate' is not a single trait: in addition to the obvious differences between metabolic levels (e.g. basal, resting, free-living, maximal), metabolic rate changes through ontogeny and in response to a range of extrinsic factors, and is therefore subject to multivariate constraint and selection. We emphasize three key advantages of studying metabolic rate within a quantitative genetics framework: its formalism, and its predictive and comparative power. We make several recommendations when applying a quantitative genetics framework: (i) measuring selection based on actual fitness, rather than proxies for fitness; (ii) considering the genetic covariances between metabolic rates throughout ontogeny; and (iii) estimating genetic covariances between metabolic rates and other traits. A quantitative genetics framework provides the means for quantifying the evolutionary potential of metabolic rate and why variance in metabolic rates within populations might be maintained.

TI  - Quantifying the relative contributions of the X chromosome, autosomes, and mitochondrial genome to local adaptation
VL  - 73
IS  - 2
SP  - 262-277
AB  - During local adaptation with gene flow, some regions of the genome are inherently more responsive to selection than others. Recent theory predicts that X-linked genes should disproportionately contribute to local adaptation relative to other genomic regions, yet this prediction remains to be tested. We carried out a multigeneration crossing scheme, using two cline-end populations of Drosophila melanogaster, to estimate the relative contributions of the X chromosome, autosomes, and mitochondrial genome to divergence in four traits involved in local adaptation (wing size, resistance to heat, desiccation, and starvation stresses). We found that the mitochondrial genome and autosomes contributed significantly to clinal divergence in three of the four traits. In contrast, the X made no significant contribution to divergence in these traits. Given the small size of the mitochondrial genome, our results indicate that it plays a surprisingly large role in clinal adaptation. In contrast, the X, which represents roughly 20% of the Drosophila genome, contributes negligiblya pattern that conflicts with theoretical predictions. These patterns reinforce recent work implying a central role of mitochondria in climatic adaptation, and suggest that different genomic regions may play fundamentally different roles in processes of divergence with gene flow.

TI  - The interactive effects of temperature, food level and maternal phenotype on offspring size in Daphnia magna
VL  - 107
IS  - 2
SP  - 189-196
AB  - Invertebrate offspring are usually larger in colder environments. To test for possible effects of covariates (e.g. maternal phenotype and feeding conditions) on this pattern, we performed a laboratory experiment to look at the effect of temperature on newborn weight in the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna. Three temperatures (12 degrees C, 16 degrees C and 22 degrees C) and two food levels (10,000 cells ml(-1) and 150,000 cells ml(-1)) were used, and offspring were examined from the first five clutches of mothers that had been maintained under the constant experimental conditions for three generations. Preliminary analysis suggested that newborn weight was significantly affected by temperature although patterns ill the data were not clear cut. In addition, the covariates mother weight and clutch size were positively and negatively correlated with newborn weight, respectively; and later clutches tended to contain heavier offspring. Therefore, in an effort to control for the effects of the covariates, repeated-measures analysis of covariance was performed using ratio values of newborn weight/mother weight (relative newborn weight) as the dependent variable. clutch size as the covariate and clutch number as the repeated measures term. Now, temperature as a main effect in an ANCOVA model did not significantly influence relative newborn weight. The repeated measure term clutch number also became non-significant, indicating that when differences in mother weight due to age were accounted for there were no overall differences in relative newborn weight between clutches from a particular mother. Temperature effects on relative newborn weight were only significant as part of interaction terms with food concentration and with clutch number. Thus there were different weight responses to temperature within food levels, and between clutch numbers within food levels. Under the low-food conditions newborn were heaviest at 16 degrees C, lightest at 12 degrees C and intermediate at 22 degrees C. Conversely, under the high-food condition newborn were lightest at 16 degrees C, heaviest at 12 degrees C and again intermediate at 22 degrees C. However, newborn tended to be heavier under the low food condition, and food concentration was highly significant as a main effect. Mother growth rate showed no significant relationship with newborn weight. It is concluded that direct temperature effects on relative newborn weight are marginal and non-significant. Temperature effects through interactions with food concentration and clutch number are important determinants of newborn weight, but relatively speaking account for only a small proportion of observed variance in newborn weight (25%), compared with the direct effect of food concentration (67%).

VL  - 97

SP  - 4588-4597
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the effects of seven oligosaccharides on the growth rate and stress tolerance of Lactobacillus plantarum ZLP001 in vitro, and the potential synbiotic effects of the most effective oligosaccharide [fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS)] and L. plantarum ZLP001 on the growth performance, apparent nutrient digestibility, fecal microbiota, and serum immune index in weaning piglets. Most oligosaccharides were utilized as carbohydrate sources by L. plantarum ZLP001, but we observed obvious differences in the bacterial growth depending on oligosaccharide type and concentration. Oligosaccharides and glucose significantly alleviated the decrease in L. plantarum ZLP001 viability in artificial gastric fluid, whereas none of the sugars affected viability in artificial intestinal fluid. FOS and galacto-oligosaccharide significantly improved the viability of L. plantarum ZLP001 under heat stress (65 degrees C for 15 and 30 min). FOS and soybean oligosaccharide significantly increased the viability of L. plantarum ZLP001 in response to cold stress (4 degrees C for 30 and 60 days). On the basis of the findings of in vitro experiments, we selected FOS for in vivo studies. Eighty-four weaned piglets were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: control (basal diet, no additives), freeze-dried L. plantarum ZLP001 (4.2 x 10(9) CFU/g, 2 g/kg diet), FOS (5 g/kg diet), and combination (0.2% L. plantarum ZLP001 + 0.5% FOS). Body weight and feed consumption were recorded for determinations of the average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed-to-gain ratio (F/G). On day 28, fresh fecal samples were collected to evaluate the apparent digestibility of nutrients and microbiota, and serum samples were collected to determine the immune status. L. plantarum ZLP001 plus FOS significantly increased ADG and decreased the F/G ratio compared with the no-additive control. The combination treatment also increased the apparent nutrient digestibility of dry matter and crude protein. Compared with the control and single supplementation, the combination treatment had a significant regulatory effect on the intestinal microbiota, as evidenced by increases in Lactobacillus spp. and a decrease in Enterobacteriaceae. In addition, the combination treatment increased the concentrations of serum IFN-gamma and immunoglobulin G. In conclusion, FOS can be utilized well by L. plantarum ZLP001 and can be combined with it as a potential synbiotic that shows synergistic effects in weaning piglets.

VL  - 49

SP  - 676-684
AB  - We investigated the heat tolerance of adults of three replicated lines of Drosophila melanogaster that have been evolving independently by laboratory natural selection for 15 yr at ''nonextreme'' temperatures (18 degrees C, 25 degrees C, or 28 degrees C). These lines are known to have diverged in body size and in the thermal dependence of several life-history traits. Here we show that they differ also in tolerance of extreme high temperature as well as in induced thermotolerance (''heat hardening''). For example, the 28 degrees C flies bad the highest probability of surviving a heat shock, whereas the 18 degrees C flies generally had the lowest probability. A short heat pretreatment increased the heat tolerance of the 18 degrees C and 25 degrees C lines, and the threshold temperature necessary to induce thermotolerance was lower for the 18 degrees C line than for the 25 degrees C line. However, neither heat pretreatment nor acclimation to different temperatures influenced heat tolerance of the 28 degrees C line, suggesting the loss of capacity for induced thermotolerance and for acclimation. Thus, patterns of tolerance of extreme heat, of acclimation, and of induced thermotolerance have evolved as correlated responses to natural selection at nonextreme temperatures. A genetic analysis of heat tolerance of a representative replicate population each from the 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C lines indicates that chromosomes 1, 2, and 3 have significant effects on heat tolerance. However, the cytoplasm has little influence, contrary to findings in an earlier study of other stocks that had been evolving for 7 yr at 14 degrees C versus 25 degrees C. Because genes for heat stress proteins (hsps) are concentrated on chromosome 3, the potential role of hsps in the heat tolerance and of induced thermotolerance in these naturally selected lines is currently unclear. In any case, species of Drosophila possess considerable genetic variation in thermal sensitivity and thus have the potential to evolve rapidly in response to climate change; but predicting that response may be difficult.

VL  - 161
IS  - 7
SP  - 1667-1676
AB  - Some studies have demonstrated that elevated CO2 concentrations in ocean waters negatively impact metabolism and development of marine fish. Particularly, early developmental stages are probably more susceptible to ocean acidification due to insufficient regulations of their acid-base balance. Transgenerational acclimation can be an important mechanism to mediate impacts of increased CO2 on marine species, yet very little is known about the potential of parental effects in teleosts. Therefore, transgenerational effects were investigated on life history in juvenile three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus by acclimating parents (collected in April 2012, 55A degrees 03'N, 8A degrees 44'E) and offspring to ambient (similar to 400 A mu atm) and elevated (similar to 1,000 A mu atm) CO2 levels and measured parental fecundity as well as offspring survival, growth and otolith characteristics. Exposure to elevated CO2 concentrations led to an increase in clutch size in adults as well as increased juvenile survival and growth rates between 60 and 90 days post-hatch and enlarged otolith areas compared with fish from ambient CO2 concentrations. Moreover, transgenerational effects were observed in reduced survival and body size 30 days post-hatch as well as in enlarged otoliths at the end of the experiment, when fathers or both parents were acclimated to the high-CO2 environment. These results may suggest that elevated CO2 concentrations had rather positive effects on life-history traits of three-spined sticklebacks, but that parental acclimation can modify these effects without improving offspring fitness. Although the mechanistic basis of such transgenerational acclimation remains unclear, selective gradients within generations seem to determine the direction of transgenerational effects.

TI  - Potential Response to Selection of HSP70 as a Component of Innate Immunity in the Abalone Haliotis rufescens
VL  - 10
IS  - 11
AB  - Assessing components of the immune system may reflect disease resistance. In some invertebrates, heat shock proteins (HSPs) are immune effectors and have been described as potent activators of the innate immune response. Several diseases have become a threat to abalone farming worldwide; therefore, increasing disease resistance is considered to be a long-term goal for breeding programs. A trait will respond to selection only if it is determined partially by additive genetic variation. The aim of this study was to estimate the heritability (h(2)) and the additive genetic coefficient of variation (CVA) of HSP70 as a component of innate immunity of the abalone Haliotis rufescens, in order to assess its potential response to selection. These genetic components were estimated for the variations in the intracellular (in haemocytes) and extracellular (serum) protein levels of HSP70 in response to an immunostimulant agent in 60 full-sib families of H. rufescens. Levels of HSP70 were measured twice in the same individuals, first when they were young and again when they were pre-harvest adults, to estimate the repeatability (R), the h(2) and the potential response to selection of these traits at these life stages. High HSP70 levels were observed in abalones subjected to immunostimulation in both the intracellular and extracellular haemolymph fractions. This is the first time that changes in serum levels of HSP70 have been reported in response to an immune challenge in molluscs. HSP70 levels in both fractions and at both ages showed low h(2) and R, with values that were not significantly different from zero. However, HSP70 induced levels had a CVA of 13.3-16.2% in young adults and of 2.7-8.1% in pre-harvest adults. Thus, despite its low h(2), HSP70 synthesis in response to an immune challenge in red abalone has the potential to evolve through selection because of its large phenotypic variation and the presence of additive genetic variance, especially in young animals.

TI  - Climate Change and Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae): Impacts of Temperature and Carbon Dioxide on Life History
VL  - 107
IS  - 5
SP  - 933-943
AB  - Climate change is relevant to life around the globe. A rise in ambient temperature and carbon dioxide (CO2) may have various impacts on arthropods such as altered life cycles, modified reproductive patterns, and changes in distribution. The sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), is a global pest responsible for significant losses of agricultural yields annually. This study was conducted to determine the impacts of changing temperature and CO2 levels on selected life history parameters of B. tabaci biotype B. Populations were established at three temperature regimes (25, 28, and 33 degrees C), and each population was evaluated in all three environments. Collard, Brassica oleracea ssp. acephala de Condolle (Brassicaceae), was used as the host. These results were based on data from 5 to approximate to 30 generations. Oviposition, nymphal survival, and reproduction were significantly affected by temperature, with net reproductive success declining to 36.4% at 33 degrees C. Overall, 28 degrees C was most favorable for whitefly fitness. However, the optimal temperature for B. tabaci reproduction may be between 28 and 33 degrees C. There were no temperature effects on total nonstructural carbohydrate concentrations in collard, and impacts of the host plant on whitefly development in the different environments were determined to be minimal. An environment of enriched CO2 (750 ppm) was not observed to have an adverse effect on whitefly reproduction. Temperature was negatively correlated with adult body size. Length and width of males and females were affected by temperature. Data regarding population dynamics of B. tabaci in response to climate change are important for accurate predictions and improving management practices.

TI  - High-quality reference genome of Fasciola gigantica: Insights into the genomic signatures of transposon-mediated evolution and specific parasitic adaption in tropical regions
VL  - 15
IS  - 10
AB  - Author summary Fascioliasis is a neglected zoonotic tropical disease of humans, which reduces the productivity of animal industries, and imposes an economic burden of at least 3.2 billion dollars annually. Although there are four assemblies for F. hepatica and two assemblies for F. gigantica at NCBI, the inherent limited ability of short reads based assemblies made the completeness of genome sequences and the quality of gene annotation challenging. Here, we report the Pacbio assembly of reference genome for F. gigantica, and the quality of assembly and gene annotation are significantly improved compared with previous assemblies. Besides, we found the evidence of transposon-mediated evolution, especially for LINE insertions into gene regions between 41 Ma and 62 Ma, contributing to the speciation and adaption of the Fasciola ancestors. Furthermore, we identified F. gigantica specific gene duplication including 98 gene families, and 3300 protein-protein interactions between F. gigantica and the host in the small intestine and liver environment. These results illustrate the genomic and gene evolution of F. gigantica potentially shaping multiple parasitic characters. Fasciola gigantica and Fasciola hepatica are causative pathogens of fascioliasis, with the widest latitudinal, longitudinal, and altitudinal distribution; however, among parasites, they have the largest sequenced genomes, hindering genomic research. In the present study, we used various sequencing and assembly technologies to generate a new high-quality Fasciola gigantica reference genome. We improved the integration of gene structure prediction, and identified two independent transposable element expansion events contributing to (1) the speciation between Fasciola and Fasciolopsis during the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary mass extinction, and (2) the habitat switch to the liver during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, accompanied by gene length increment. Long interspersed element (LINE) duplication contributed to the second transposon-mediated alteration, showing an obvious trend of insertion into gene regions, regardless of strong purifying effect. Gene ontology analysis of genes with long LINE insertions identified membrane-associated and vesicle secretion process proteins, further implicating the functional alteration of the gene network. We identified 852 predicted excretory/secretory proteins and 3300 protein-protein interactions between Fasciola gigantica and its host. Among them, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase genes, with specific gene copy number variations, might play a central role in the phase I detoxification process. Analysis of 559 single-copy orthologs suggested that Fasciola gigantica and Fasciola hepatica diverged at 11.8 Ma near the Middle and Late Miocene Epoch boundary. We identified 98 rapidly evolving gene families, including actin and aquaporin, which might explain the large body size and the parasitic adaptive character resulting in these liver flukes becoming epidemic in tropical and subtropical regions.

TI  - Resource partitioning among Myoxocephalus sculpins, and their predator-prey relationships with Chionoecetes crabs in the eastern Bering Sea
VL  - 464
SP  - 221-235
AB  - Interspecific and intraspecific variation in the distributions and diets of congeneric sculpins, Myoxocephalus jaok, M. polyacanthocephalus, and M. scorpius, were described from data collected during summer trawl surveys of the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) continental shelf between 2000 and 2010 by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC). Generalized additive models (GAMs) of abundance (count) and presence-absence data were applied separately for each species to examine the influence of selected factors (depth, bottom temperature, substrate type and location) on distribution and abundance. The final models indicated strong predictive relationships, suggesting habitat partitioning between species. Ontogenetic distributions were observed as larger individuals of each species tended to be associated with deeper depths and lower latitudes. Analysis of stomach contents indicated that these species consume a wide variety of prey and that the diet composition also shifted ontogenetically. Multivariate analyses of the mean percent weight (%W) of 23 diet categories indicated that the diets differed among and within species. The diet of M. jaok consisted primarily of mysids, shrimps, and flatfish, with larger sculpins feeding on a greater amount of flatfish prey and less benthic infauna. Both M. polyacanthocephalus and M. scorpius fed considerably on commercially important Chionoecetes crabs, particularly C. opilio; however, similar-sized M. polyacanthocephalus consumed larger Chionoecetes prey than M. scorpius. Diets were more variable among smaller sculpins of these 2 species, and piscivory was more common among M. polyacanthocephalus. Habitat and diet partitioning were evident among species within this genus, as each species exhibited distinct spatial boundaries and diets, possibly avoiding inter-and intraspecific competition in this environment.

TI  - Area, climate heterogeneity, and the response of climate niches to ecological opportunity in island radiations of Anolis lizards
VL  - 25
IS  - 7
SP  - 781-791
AB  - Aim Rates of climate niche evolution underlie numerous fundamental ecological processes and patterns. However, while climate niche conservatism varies markedly among regions and clades, the source of this variation remains poorly understood. We tested whether ecological opportunity can stimulate radiation within climate niche space at biogeographic scales, predicting that rates of climate niche evolution will scale with geographic area and climate heterogeneity. Location Caribbean Methods We quantified two temperature axes (mean temperature and temperature seasonality of species' localities) of the climate niche for 130 Anolis species on Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Jamaica and the northern and southern Lesser Antilles. Using a species-level phylogeny, we fitted macroevolutionary models that either constrained rates of climate niche evolution or allowed them to vary among regions. Next, we regressed region-specific evolutionary rates against area, species richness and climate heterogeneity. We evaluated whether results were robust to uncertainty in phylogenetic and biogeographic reconstructions and the assumed mode of evolution. Results For both niche axes, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model that allowed the net rate of evolution (sigma(2)) to vary among island groups fit the data considerably better than a single-rate Brownian motion model. Nagelkerke pseudo-R-2 values of the fit of these OU models to mean temperature and seasonality axes were 0.43 and 0.66, respectively. Evolutionary rates for both axes were higher in larger areas, which also have more species. Only the rate of mean occupied temperature evolution was positively related to climate heterogeneity, and only after accounting for region size. Conclusions Rates of climate niche evolution scale consistently with the area available for radiation, but responses to climate heterogeneity vary among niche axes. For the mean temperature axis, climate heterogeneity generated additional opportunities for radiation, but for seasonality it did not. Overall, the physical setting in which a clade diversifies can influence where it falls on the evolutionary continuum, from climate niche conservatism to radiation.

TI  - Resistance to Streptococcus iniae and its genetic associations with traits of economic importance in Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer)
VL  - 42
IS  - 12
SP  - 1657-1666
AB  - Streptococcus iniae is one of the most serious aquatic pathogens, causing significant economic losses in marine and freshwater species, including Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer). Controlling this gram-positive bacterial pathogen has been an issue in aquaculture systems, due to the combined effects of aquaculture intensification and climatic impacts. To date, there have not been any genetic parameter estimates for S. iniae resistance in Asian seabass. The main aim of this study was to examine genetic variation in S. iniae resistance and its genetic correlations with growth and cannibalism in Asian seabass families produced from a breeding programme for high growth in 2016 and 2017. The study included a total of 5,835 individual fish that were offspring of 41 sires and 60 dams (31 half-sib and 34 full-sib families). The experimental fish were challenged by intraperitoneal injection with a volume containing 10(5) CFU (colony-forming unit)/fish. Resistance to S. iniae was measured as survival rate at 6 hr, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 days post-challenge test. There were significant variations in S. iniae resistance among families at different observation periods (ranging from 24.4% to 80%). Restricted maximum-likelihood method and mixed model analysis were applied to estimate heritability for S. iniae resistance. The heritability for S. iniae resistance ranged from 7% to 18% across different statistical models used. The common full-sib effects accounted for 0.1%-2% of the total variation in resistance to S. iniae. Genetic correlations of the S. iniae resistance at 6 hr and 3 days with later post-challenge test periods were low to moderate. However, these estimates for S. iniae resistance between successive measurement times (5, 7, 10 and 15 days) were high and close to 1. The genetic correlations of resistance with body weights at 180, 270 and 360 days post-hatch were not significant as well with cannibalism. It is concluded that there is substantial additive genetic variation in resistance to S. iniae, suggesting there is potential for genetic improvement of Asian seabass for resistance to S. iniae through selective breeding.

TI  - Optimum temperatures for growth and feed conversion in cultured hapuku (Polyprion oxygeneios) - Is there a link to aerobic metabolic scope and final temperature preference?
VL  - 430
SP  - 107-113
AB  - As temperature-based growth trials are lengthy, expensive and laborious to run, juvenile hapuku (Polyprion oxygeneios) were employed to assess whether respirometric tests and behavioural preference methods could be used to resolve the optimum temperature for growth and feed conversion efficiency in novel culture species. On the basis that the energetic costs of rapid growth are substantial and need to be accommodated physiologically, it was hypothesised that maximal growth and optimal feed conversion (feed conversion ratio, FCR) would be maximised at temperatures where aerobic metabolic scope (AMS) was also maximised. It was further hypothesised that hapuku would behaviourally self-select temperatures that lead to the greatest level of AMS, growth and FCR performance. Acclimating hapuku juveniles to 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 degrees C for 4 weeks resulted in a peak in specific growth rate (SGR) at 18 and 21 degrees C with slower growth at lower and higher temperatures. AMS was also maximal between 18 and 21 degrees C and was therefore tightly linked with SGR. The behavioural thermal preference (T-pref) range of hapuku also fell within the optimum range for growth. FCR, however, was inversely related to temperature with the most and least efficient rates of conversion occurring at 12 degrees C and 24 degrees C respectively. Though AMS and Tpref had no utility in predicting the optimal range for FCR, standard metabolic rate (SMR) showed a positive linear relationship to FCR. The conclusions of the study are threefold: 1) Hapuku select temperatures that optimise both AMS and growth. 2) AMS and T-pref appear tightly linked with SGR and could possibly be used to predict the optimum temperature for growth in novel species. 3) AMS and Tpref have no utility in predicting the optimum temperature for FCR.

TI  - Isopod distribution and climate change
IS  - 801
SP  - 25-61
AB  - The unique properties of terrestrial isopods regarding responses to limiting factors such as drought and temperature have led to interesting distributional patterns along climatic and other environmental gradients at both species and community level. This paper will focus on the exploration of isopod distributions in evaluating climate change effects on biodiversity at different scales, geographical regions, and environments, in view of isopods' tolerances to environmental factors, mostly humidity and temperature. Isopod distribution is tightly connected to available habitats and habitat features at a fine spatial scale, even though different species may exhibit a variety of responses to environmental heterogeneity, reflecting the large interspecific variation within the group. Furthermore, isopod distributions show some notable deviations from common global patterns, mainly as a result of their ecological features and evolutionary origins. Responses to human disturbance are not always traceable, but a trend towards community homogenisation is often found under strong global urbanisation processes. In general, even though it is still not clear how predicted climate change will affect isopod distribution, there is evidence that mixed effects are to be expected, depending on the region under study. We still lack robust and extensive analyses of isopod distributions at different scales and at different biomes, as well as applications of distribution models that might help evaluate future trends.

TI  - What does not kill it does not always make it stronger: High temperatures in pyriproxyfen treatments produce Aedes aegypti adults with reduced longevity and smaller females
VL  - 23
IS  - 2
SP  - 529-535
AB  - Aedes aegypti control in Brazil comprises integrated actions, in which larvicide application is a supplementary measure. Despite the importance of analyzing the effects of temperature on the efficiency of larvicides to control mosquito populations, there is still a lack of information regarding the sublethal effect of larvicides. We hypothesized that mosquitoes which survived pyriproxyfen exposure, during their immature development, have small body sizes and live less than mosquitoes that were not exposed to this larvicide. We investigated the sublethal effects of five different pyriproxyfen concentrations (0.0001; 0.001; 0.01; 0.1 and 1 mg.L-1), under three different temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). As we increased the larvicide concentration, less larvae survived and developed into adults. However, at 30 degrees C the survival was higher than at 25 degrees C and 20 degrees C comparing the concentrations of 0.001 mg.L-1 and 0.01 mg.L-1 (10% and 16% high, respectively). Mosquito survivors to pyriproxyfen exposure, in all thermal conditions, had shorter adult life spans than mosquitoes not exposed to pyriproxyfen during the larval stage. The females exposed at 30 degrees C showed smaller wings than females from experiments at 20 degrees C. These findings provide evidence that the biological parameters of the adult lifespan and wing centroid size are impaired due to larval exposure to pyriproxyfen, even at high temperatures. Reduced longevity and small wing size are fitness costs to survive this larvicide exposure. These findings provide support to assess resistance development to larvicides through future generations and contribute to the discussion on improving the rational application of larvicides.

TI  - Plastic patterns in larval development of Endangered endemic Atelognathus patagonicus: implications for conservation strategies
VL  - 23
IS  - 1
SP  - 83-92
AB  - The Patagonia frog Atelognathus patagonicus (Anura, Ceratophryidae) is endemic to north-western Patagonia where it inhabits permanent and temporary water bodies in a system of endorheic ponds on the basaltic plateau in and around Laguna Blanca National Park, northwestern Patagonia, Argentina. This Endangered species is emblematic of the decline and extinction of amphibian populations as a result of the introduction of fish to Laguna Blanca. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the patterns of larval development in ponds with different hydroperiods and to evaluate the occurrence of different developmental strategies and their implications for conservation management. In penlianent ponds, A. patagonicus tadpoles showed a double strategy, with the presence of both seasonal (short larval period; metamorphs in the same growing season) and overwintering tadpoles (undergoing metamorphosis the following spring). In temporary ponds, desiccation seems to exert great pressure, with accelerated larval development, resulting in short larval periods. Atelognathus patagonicus showed plasticity in the length of larval development, adjusting to the different hydroperiods observed in these wetlands. As a result of this dual strategy, overwintering tadpoles in permanent ponds are larger than seasonal tadpoles. This notable plasticity in developmental strategy enables this species to colonize widely varying environments. These results highlight the importance of preserving a variety of wetlands, including both temporary and permanent ponds, to allow this species to continue to breed and develop in the face of current and potential anthropogenic disturbance, in particular that caused by the activity of local native pastoralists.

VL  - 52
IS  - 1
SP  - 134-143
AB  - Heritable variation for fitness components is normally measured under favorable laboratory conditions, but organisms in the held experience variable conditions that are often stressful and may affect the expression of heritable variation. We examined heritable variation for early fecundity in three samples of Drosophila melanogaster from the field. Flies were obtained from a rotting fruit pile in summer, autumn, and spring, and progeny were reared under laboratory conditions. Field parents were tested for fecundity at 14 degrees C or 28 degrees C depending on ambient temperatures. Wing/thorax length ratios measured on flies from the spring collection suggested that flies had developed at around 20 degrees C. Progeny were reared and tested at 14 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 28 degrees C. In the summer collection, parent-offspring regression coefficients were high and significant, compared to nonsignificant values obtained in two of three autumn comparisons. In the spring collection, parent-offspring regressions were negative regardless of testing temperature, suggesting that field females with a high fecundity produced offspring with low scores. Comparisons of F-1 and F-2 laboratory generations indicated intermediate heritabilities for fecundity in the laboratory. The lower bound heritability estimate for fecundity in field individuals was 37% in summer and 59% in autumn. Estimates of field heritability and evolvability for wing length measured in the spring collection were lower than in the laboratory. The results indicate that heritabilities and additive genetic variances for fecundity can be high in field-reared flies, but that results may vary between field collections.

SP  - 4-9
AB  - Individuals of Pterochloroides persicae reared under controlled conditions were used to describe the morphometry and biological parameters of instars of this aphid. Our results showed that P. persicae developed four instars before reaching the adult stage. The first and the second larval instars both have five antennal segments, although the others have six segments. A significant difference was observed between instars in the first antennal segment (F = 56.11; df = 4, P = 0.026), in the body length (F = 115.38; df = 4, p = 0.014) and in the cauda length (F = 72, 77; df = 4, p = 0.021). The study of developmental and reproductive performance of P. persicae showed that the first instar lasted for 3.17 days, the second instar 2.35 days, the third instar 4.68 days, the fourth instar 5.035 days and the adult 6.86 days. We demonstrate also that the generation time lasted for 15.26 days. The life span was 22.11 days. As for fecundity, a single female of P. persicae gave birth to 29.68 7.38 nymphs with an average reproductive rate per day of 4.32 +/- 2.16.

TI  - Comprehensive Utilization of Land Resources for Photovoltaic Power Generation to Culture Chinese Mitten Crab (Eriocheir sinensis): Growth Performance, Nutritional Composition and Tissue Color
VL  - 7
IS  - 4
AB  - The assertive growth of photovoltaics (PV) will occupy a lot of land resources. There is also a needed land resource to expand the culturing area of Eriocheir sinensis. The aquavoltaic systems offer a potential solution to integrate PV power and E. sinensis culturing. In this study, we cultured E. sinensis in an area of PV panels (PV group) and an area with no PV panels (control group), respectively. The results showed that the weight gain rate, body length, body width, and meat yield of male crabs in the PV group significantly increases. In addition, the moisture of muscles, hepatopancreas, and testes in the PV group has significantly increased, and the total lipids of the hepatopancreas and muscles in the PV group were significantly decreased. Moreover, the PV panels affected the content of eight amino acids in different tissues, including Met, Arg, Cys, Pro, Gly, Leu, Tyr, and His. In addition, several saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) had been significantly influenced by the PV panels. n-ary sumation MUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), n-ary sumation n-3 PUFA, n-ary sumation n-6 PUFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio (p < 0.05) in the PV group had significantly decreased. The results of tissue color showed that the L* value of ovaries was significantly higher than in the control group, and a* and b* values of hepatopancreas were significantly lower. In conclusion, PV panels could promote growth performance and amino acid nutrition of crabs. However, the PV panels had a few negative influences on the fatty acid composition and tissue color.

TI  - The evolutionary consequences of habitat fragmentation: Body morphology and coloration differentiation among brook trout populations of varying size
VL  - 7
IS  - 17
SP  - 6850-6862
AB  - A reduction in population size due to habitat fragmentation can alter the relative roles of different evolutionary mechanisms in phenotypic trait differentiation. While deterministic (selection) and stochastic (genetic drift) mechanisms are expected to affect trait evolution, genetic drift may be more important than selection in small populations. We examined relationships between mature adult traits and ecological (abiotic and biotic) variables among 14 populations of brook trout. These naturally fragmented populations have shared ancestry but currently exhibit considerable variability in habitat characteristics and population size (49<N-c<10,032; 3<N-b<567). Body size, shape, and coloration differed among populations, with a tendency for more variation among small populations in both trait means and CV when compared to large populations. Phenotypic differences were more frequently and directly linked to habitat variation or operational sex ratio than to population size, suggesting that selection may overcome genetic drift at small population size. Phenotype-environment associations were also stronger in females than males, suggesting that natural selection due to abiotic conditions may act more strongly on females than males. Our results suggest that natural and sexual-selective pressures on phenotypic traits change during the process of habitat fragmentation, and that these changes are largely contingent upon existing habitat conditions within isolated fragments. Our study provides an improved understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of habitat fragmentation and lends insight into the ability of some small populations to respond to selection and environmental change.

TI  - Constructal design of conducting body cooled by open cavity
VL  - 85
IS  - 4
SP  - 220-226
AB  - This paper investigates the constructal design of a body where a rectangular open cavity intruded into a trapezoidal solid by taking the maximum dimensionless thermal resistance minimisation as the optimisation objective in the most fundamental sense. Two cases, i.e. body with heat generation and body heated externally, are considered. The numerical results indicate that for the two cases, the more slender the cavity, the safer the thermal system. In addition, in thermal design and management, the effect of heat origin on the system safety should be taken into account sufficiently. The triple optimisation results show that the optimum ratio of left body height to right body height for the two cases approach each other relatively; the double optimum ratios of right body height to body length for body with heat generation are smaller than those for body heated externally when the ratio of cavity height to cavity length is from 0.01 to 2, while the former are equal or similar to the latter when the ratio of cavity height to cavity length is from 2 to 4, and the former are bigger than the latter when the ratio of cavity height to cavity length is from 4 to 10.

TI  - Plankton community properties determined by nutrients and size-selective feeding
VL  - 413
SP  - 1-15
AB  - The potential impacts of climate change on marine planktonic ecosystems remain difficult to predict. Climate forcing can alter nutrient availability and predator community composition, and here we show that these shifts may dramatically alter plankton trophic structure, size distributions and biomass. We modeled phytoplankton and zooplankton as a highly resolved size spectrum with size-dependent nutrient uptake and predation and analyzed the model both as a size spectrum and as a food web. Model results identified 2 distinct regimes defined by the average zooplankton feeding preferences. Regime I communities, where planktonic predators are specialists or large relative to prey, had low omnivory, many top predators, low connectance and relatively flat size spectra. Regime II communities, where predators are generalists or small relative to prey, had a high degree of omnivory, no top predators, high connectance and steep size spectra. Model ecosystems with generalist predators had lower size diversity, smaller plankton and gappier size distributions than ecosystems with specialist predators. Nutrient availability had little influence on trophic structure but strongly impacted size structure and biomass. Most surprisingly, phytoplankton biomass sometimes decreased with added nutrients if predators were small relative to prey, implying that both predators and nutrients mediate shifts between bottom-up and top-down control. Based on our synthesized estimates of size-selective feeding parameters, we infer that size and trophic structure should be strongly affected by abundances of generalist, bloom-forming taxa such as salps and jellyfish, many of which are responsive to ocean temperature. Size-selective feeding fundamentally affects community structure and is a likely mechanism of change in planktonic ecosystems where community composition varies with temperature.

VL  - 52

SP  - 666-677
AB  - Many aquarium fish species have diverse morphotypes. Since different morphotypes may have different preferences for various prey items, offering a single prey species is inadequate for successful aquaculture.Poecilia reticulata, a popular aquarium species, occurs in different morphotypes. To test whether the four morphotypes (yellow tail YT, red tail RT, metallic blue tail MBT and black tail BT) of this fish prefer different items, we quantified somatic growth, feeding behaviour, zooplankton selectivity and functional responses. Standard length (4.5 vs. 11.7 mm) and gape size (0.37 vs. 0.91 mm) of four morphotypes increased linearly with larval age; YT and RT had 25% longer body length and larger gape than the others. Prey encounters, attacks, captures and ingestions increased with larval age. Lowest ingestion rates were recorded for the RT morphotype on rotifers. At any given larval age, prey consumption increased with increasing prey availability. During the fourth and fifth weeks, larval YT and RT consumed higher number (37 +/- 1 ind./predator/30 min) of cladocerans compared with other two morphotypes (24 +/- 1 ind./predator/30 min). Prey selectivity data showed that larvae of MBT and BT continued to prefer rotifers up to 4 weeks, while those of YT and RT preferred cladocerans during the 4th week.

TI  - Higher Temperatures Do Not Always Achieve Better Antibiotic Resistance Gene Removal in Anaerobic Digestion of Swine Manure
VL  - 85
IS  - 7
AB  - This study employed high-throughput quantitative PCR and 16S rRNA sequencing to evaluate the effect of temperature and residual antibiotics on the dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microbial communities during anaerobic digestion of swine manure. The abundances of total ARGs and 16S rRNA genes significantly decreased in all of four treatments (25 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 37 degrees C with 50 mg of wet weight antibiotics of body weight, and 55 degrees C). The abundances of most ARG types were significantly correlated with those of the 16S rRNA gene and transposase gene (P < 0.01). However, the abundances of total ARGs at 55 degrees C were much higher than those of other treatments. Meanwhile, the microbial communities at 55 degrees C, where the Streptococcus pathogen remained at a relatively high abundance and cellulose degraders and hydrogen producers, such as Ethanoligenens and Coprococcus bacteria, increased, were markedly different from those of other treatments. Redundancy analysis indicates that temperature, pH, and the genus Streptococcus had the highest explanation for ARG variation among experimental factors, chemical properties, and representative genera, respectively. Network analysis further showed that the genus Streptococcus contributed greatly to the higher ARG abundance at 55 degrees C. The moderate antibiotic residue only caused a slight and transitory inhibition for microbially diverse populations and promotion for ARG abundance, probably due to the degradation of antibiotics and microbial adaptability. Our results clarify the cooperativity of gene transfer-related items on ARG variation and intensively prove that higher temperature cannot always achieve better ARG removal in anaerobic digestion unless pathogens and gene transfer elements are more efficiently inhibited.

TI  - Pentium 4 processor package design and development
SP  - 1431-1439
AB  - Intel Pentium(R) 4 ushered a new IA-32 architecture with a jump in performance from. the previous generation microprocessors. Higher core frequency, higher bus speed and new architecture features needed very competitive package designs. The demand on packaging to match such product performance necessitated development of new technologies. This paper describes development and implementation of package technologies for two generations of silicon processes of Pentium 4 as well as for intra-process shrink variations of the die for various applications. Pentium 4 is the new IA-32 architecture processor for use in multiple platforms. In addition to Desktop and Mobile segments, enhanced versions are for use in workstation and server systems also. The Mobile market segment is further divided into Full Feature, Thin & Light and Mini-Note sub-segments with the respective Performance and Value subdivisions. Likewise, the Desktop segment is divided into Performance, Mainstream and Value sub-segments whereas the IA-32 Server segment is subdivided into UP (Uni-Processor), DP (Dual-Processor) & MP (Multi-Processor) catering different market sub-segments. Pentium 4 debuted in 0.18 mum Si process with successive migration to 0.13 mum process. It had a roadmap of progressively higher clock frequencies and bus frequencies. The initial packaging for 0.18 mum process Pentium 4 was done using an Interposer type package, which consisted of an OLGA substrate with (flip-chip-attached die) surface mounted on a (through-pin type) PGA interposer at 1.21 mm diagonal pitch. This two-part solution looked unattractive from overall package parasitics as well as line item management perspectives. Therefore, a new organic PGA package called FCPGA was employed with surface mount attached pins at 1.27 mm square pitch. This enabled achieving a socketable package with a single piece part. In addition to eliminating 2 piece parts for packaging, this new package allowed the body size reduction from 53.3 mm to 35.0 mm. It also dramatically improved the package and pin parasitics to allow more robust electrical performance. The product architecture employs the Netburst architecture for turbo performance. The overall power associated with the processor, along with the di/dt posed a challenge for the package design. The methodology of designing decoupling capacitor schemes for the packages is described. Power delivery improvement was a major part of the design analysis activities with the package and system level issues considered. I/O performance was analyzed for different design feature parameters ensuring signal integrity. Optimization of design rules for balancing the layout and cost drivers is described. The product performance and cost in the 0.18 mum Si process were optimized by successive die shrinks. The packaging approach to address such cases is also discussed. The socket parameters for the two package types are also compared. The package model and simulation results for package parameter variation are shown. The thermal-electrical reliability aspects of the package parameters were considered to ensure that the package would perform reliably both on a global and local basis. This was especially important in view of the significant power density variation and current demand variation over the die area. Thermal power management was challenging due to the system level cost constraints. Thermal interface material development done for improved thermal resistances is described with the thermal solutions of the packages described briefly. Finally, the future direction of packaging for Intel processors is discussed.

TI  - Assessment of changes in the ichthyofauna in a tropical reservoir in south-eastern Brazil: Consequences of global warming?
VL  - 31
IS  - 1
SP  - 45-59
AB  - Increases in temperatures over the last century, more intensively after the eighties, were recorded in several databases for the south-eastern Brazil. These increases are likely to change fish communities in aquatic systems by decreasing abundances, biomass and sizes of some species more sensitive to climate change. Reservoirs may be particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change, as they isolate previously connected areas limiting fish dispersal and migration, as well as increasing water temperature and thermal stratification. We assessed temporal changes in the abundance and biomass of the ichthyofauna in an isolate reservoir (inflowing waters from small tributaries in a highland region) aiming to associate changes with climate effects over three decades (1990, 2000, 2010). Two abundant native species, a loricariid Loricariichthys castaneus (Castelnau, 1855) and a cichlid Geophagus brasiliensis (Quoy & Gaimard, 1824), were selected to assess eventual response to climate changes in their geographical distribution in the Southeast Atlantic Hydrographic Region, considering different carbon emission scenarios using ecological niche models. A decrease in the densities and biomass of the ichthyofauna and of the two selected species were observed in both summer and winter over the three decades, coinciding with increases in temperatures. These decreases were correlated with increases in positive anomalies of temperature, which may be an indicator of climatic changes, although with low explanation of the data variation. The mean size of L. castaneus decreased between the nineties and 2010, whereas no significant trend was found for the size of G. brasiliensis. Our predictions of new area for future adequacy indicated a loss in the distribution area for both species (mainly for G. brasiliensis), considering the most pessimistic scenario for 2050 and 2070, possibly due to climatic changes. Both hydroelectric dams and global warming pose threats to freshwater fish diversity, and both will interact. Changes observed in the fish assemblage over the last decades were essential for an assessment of the consequences of global warming in this type of reservoir combining larger scale studies with future projections.

TI  - Morphological variation in the cosmopolitan fish parasite Neobenedenia girellae (Capsalidae: Monogenea)
VL  - 48
IS  - 2
SP  - 125-134
AB  - Intra-species morphological variation presents a considerable problem for species identification and can result in taxonomic confusion. This is particularly pertinent for species of Neobenedenia which are harmful agents in captive fish populations and have historically been identified almost entirely based on morphological characters. This study aimed to understand how the morphology of Neobenedenia girellae varies with host fish species and the environment. Standard morphological features of genetically indistinct parasites from various host fish species were measured under controlled temperatures and salinities. An initial field-based investigation found that parasite morphology significantly differed between genetically indistinct parasites infecting various host fish species. The majority of the morphological variation observed (60%) was attributed to features that assist in parasite attachment to the host (i.e. the posterior and anterior attachment organs and their accessory hooks) which are important characters in monogenean taxonomy. We then experimentally examined the effects of the interaction between host fish species and environmental factors (temperature and salinity) on the morphology of isogenic parasites derived from a single, isolated hermaphroditic N. girellae infecting barramundi, Lates calcarifer. Experimental infection of L. calcarifer and cobia, Rachycentron canadum, under controlled laboratory conditions did not confer host-mediated phenotypic plasticity in N. girellae, suggesting that measured morphological differences could be adaptive and only occur over multiple parasite generations. Subsequent experimental infection of a single host species, L calcarifer, at various temperatures (22, 30 and 32 degrees C) and salinities (35 and 40 parts per thousand) showed that in the cooler environments (22 degrees C) N. girellae body proportions were significantly smaller compared with warmer temperatures (30 and 32 degrees C; P < 0.0001), whereas salinity had no effect. This is evidence that temperature can drive phenotypic plasticity in key taxonomic characters of N. girellae under certain environmental conditions.

TI  - Morphological Variation and Its Environmental Correlates in the Taihangshan Swelled-Vented Frog across the Qinling Mountains
VL  - 12
IS  - 18
AB  - Simple Summary Amphibians have weak dispersal abilities and are sensitive to environmental changes, resulting in their disproportionately high risk of extinction, with many species' populations rapidly declining. Therefore, it is critical for amphibian conservation to understand their adaptive potential by exploring how amphibians respond to environmental changes based on morphological variations. Our results showed that morphological traits of Feirana taihangnica significantly differed among ages. Along with the increase in annual mean temperature, snout-vent length showed an anti-hump trend, indicating no support for Bergmann's rule. Mean ultraviolet-B of the highest and lowest months were positively and negatively correlated with head width, thigh length and tibia width, respectively. The present study can help understand the effects of environmental changes on morphological variations of this mountain frog species and its adaptive potential, providing important implications for species conservation. The Taihangshan swelled-vented frog (Feirana taihangnica), an endemic species to the Qinling Mountains, central China, has experienced a dramatic population decline over the last few decades. The aim of this work was to quantify morphological variation in F. taihangnica across the Qinling Mountains and examine environmental correlates of this variation of morphological traits. We implemented a hierarchical partitioning to estimate the independent contribution of each environmental variable on morphological variations. Temperature seasonality was the greatest contributor in variations of snout-vent length (SVL) and head width, and ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation of the lowest month was the most influential on both thigh length and tibia width. Then, we used generalized additive models to analyze the relationship between each environmental factor and morphological trait variations. Along the increasing of annual mean temperature, SVL decreased firstly and then increased, indicating no support for Bergmann's rule. Furthermore, SVL was negatively correlated with annual precipitation, while positively with temperature seasonality. The mean UV-B of the highest and lowest months was positively and negatively correlated with head width, thigh length and tibia width, respectively. The results of this study help us to understand adaptive potential of this mountain frog species via morphological variations in the light of environmental changes.

TI  - Locomotor performance at low temperature and the evolution of nocturnality in GECKOS
VL  - 53
IS  - 2
SP  - 580-599
AB  - Nocturnal geckos are active at body temperatures 10-35 degrees C below the thermal optima for maximum rate of aerobic metabolism ((V) over dot (o2max)) of diurnal lizards. Therefore, given ancestral (diurnal) lizard physiology, nocturnality causes a substantial thermal handicap in locomotor performance. In prior studies, we hypothesized that a low minimum cost of locomotion (C-min) in geckos was an adaptation that increased locomotor endurance capacity at low, nocturnal temperatures. However, C-min is only part of an integrated system that, in conjunction with the maximum rate of oxygen consumption, sets the maximum speed that can be sustained aerobically (termed the maximum aerobic speed or MAS). We conducted the first phylogenetic analysis of MAS and (V) over dot (o2max) in lizards and found that the greatest changes in MAS, C-min and (V) over dot (o2max) (at activity temperatures) in the evolutionary history of lizards all coincided with the evolution of nocturnality in geckos. Geckos active at 15-25 degrees C did not become optimized for nocturnal temperatures, or fully offset the thermal effects of nocturnality by evolving maximal rates of oxygen consumption comparable to diurnal lizards active at 35 degrees C. Geckos did evolve MAS twice that of diurnal lizards running at low temperatures by evolving a remarkably low C-min. Allometric analysis and phylogenetically independent contrasts of (V) over dot (o2max), C-min, and MAS indicate a 72% evolutionary decrease in (V) over dot (o2max) (at activity temperatures) and a 50% evolutionary decrease in C-min concordant with the evolution of nocturnality in geckos. Experimental measurements show that decreased C-min in six species of gecko increased MAS by 50-120% compared to diurnal lizards at low temperatures; Thus, geckos sufficiently overcame the near paralyzing effects of nocturnal temperatures, but only offset about 50% of the decrease in MAS resulting from the low maximum rate of oxygen consumption. Although the nocturnal environment remains severely suboptimal, the evolution of a low cost of locomotion in the ancestor of geckos was highly adaptive for nocturnality. We also present a generalized approach to ecophysiological evolution that integrates phylogeny with the causal relationships among environment, physiology, and performance capacity. With respect to a clade, two hypotheses are central to our integrative approach: (1) a change of an environmental variable (e.g., temperature) causes a performance handicap; and (2) evolution of a physiological variable (e.g., minimum cost of locomotion [C-min]) increases performance in the derived environment. To test the hypothesis that evolution of a physiological variable is adaptive in nature, we suggest determining if individuals in nature perform at levels exceeding the performance capacity of their hypothetical ancestors and if this additional performance capacity is due to the evolution of the physiological variable in question.

VL  - 491
SP  - 232-238
AB  - Increasing abalone growth rates and their physiological efficiency in the use of energy through selective breeding could improve abalone production. High potential responses to selection for growth traits have been estimated in several abalone species; however, the genetic bases underlying individual differences in physiological performance are unknown. The aims of this study were to estimate the heritable variation of physiological traits associated with energy intake and allocation for the red abalone Haliotis rufescens; and the potential correlated responses to selection between growth and physiological traits at three developmental stages. Growth traits (shell length and width, and total mass) and physiological traits [energy intake, standard metabolic rate (SMR), and energy losses by ammonia excretion and feces] were measured in individuals belonging to 60 full-sib families in 2-years old juveniles, 3-y old young adults, and 4-y old near-harvest adult (n = 500-380 individuals/age; total n = 1300). Food intake showed significant h(2) in juveniles and young adults (0.37 and 0.14, respectively); but near zero h(2) in near-harvest adults. Variation in energy required for SMR showed low but significant h(2) (0.13) in young and near-harvest adults. Variation in energy lost through ammonia excretion showed significant h2 in juveniles (0.33) and in near-harvest adults (0.14). Heritability for variation in the energy losses through feces was not significant. Heritabilities for growth traits were all moderate to high and significant for young and pre-harvest adults, but were not significant for juveniles. At the young adult stage, food intake was negatively and highly genetically correlated with each of the growth traits (-0.70 to -0.85); and at the near-harvest adult stage both SMR and ammonia excretion showed high-negative genetic correlations with each growth trait (-0.88 to -1.00). Thus, estimated correlated response to selection indicated that if selection was exerted for higher growth (choosing 5% best individuals), we would be indirectly selecting for abalones with lower food intake (correlated responses of -11 to -15%); or lower metabolic demands of (-14 to -24%), if the selection was applied to young or near-harvest adults, respectively. In turn, shell length could be enhanced up to 18% per generation. These results suggest that higher growth in red abalone is genetically associated with a more efficient use of food and a lower metabolic demand. The possibility to reduce food intake or metabolic demands by selecting for faster growing abalones would be a very positive development for the sustainability of this culture.

TI  - Flight and fecundity of Colorado potato beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) fed on different diets
VL  - 89
IS  - 2
SP  - 297-306
AB  - Overwintered and summer generation adult female Colorado potato beetles, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), were reared on 8 different diets (7 plant species and no food) for 30 d, during which time individual fecundity and Bight mill performance were measured. Diet did not affect survival of overwintered females, but strongly affected survival of the newly eclosed summer generation. Fecundity was related positively for both generations to larval success on the different plant species. Tethered flight was greatest amongst starved overwintered females and generally greater in the overwintered generation than in the summer generation. Across treatments, total flight duration was related positively to fecundity for summer generation females; in contrast, it was related negatively to fecundity for the overwintered generation. However, there was no relationship between flight and fecundity within any of the treatments in either generation. Flight was greatest on days 3-6 for overwintered females, peaking later after eclosion for the summer generation, and continuing throughout the 30 d in at least some individuals. Flight was greater for summer generation females with greater emergence weight, and for overwintered females which emerged earlier. Among females nearer to death, or smaller females of tile summer generation, reproduction took precedence over flight. The temporal patterns of fecundity and flight in female L. decemlineata constitute a flexible life history, which seems to represent an adaptation against disappearance of host plants when this risk is highest.

TI  - Exposure to copper during larval development has intra- and trans-generational influence on fitness in later life
VL  - 207
AB  - Anthropogenic pollution has a disadvantageous influence on various life-history traits. Although direct effects are well known, potential fitness-related trans-generational costs are less studied. Previously, empirical findings have demonstrated that environmental conditions faced by the parental generation have an effect on the traits expressed by their offspring. Here, to study this conjecture larvae of the common fruit fly (Drosophila mela-nogaster) were either exposed to a sub-lethal concentration of copper or reared on uncontaminated larval medium. Adult flies were kept under uncontaminated conditions. For the next generation, individuals were mated with their own group and their offspring were either exposed to copper or fed with uncontaminated larval medium. We found that in the parental generation copper exposure reduced fecundity compared with uncontaminated controls. In the progeny, females suffered impaired fecundity only if their larval condition differed from the conditions experienced by their parents. If the progeny was raised under similar conditions than the parental generation, no effect on fecundity was discovered, suggesting acclimatization to the prevailing conditions after short-time copper exposure (two generations). Our results demonstrate that exposure to an environmental stressor like heavy metals causes intra-and trans-generational fitness costs. Further, individuals may be able to acclimatize in prevailing contaminated conditions, but this might in turn debase fitness under uncontaminated conditions. Our findings are consistent with the prediction of the adaptive parental effects hypothesis which states that parents may produce offspring that are more successful under conditions faced by their parents.

TI  - Multigenerational downregulation of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in adulthood improves lineage survival, reproduction, and fitness in Caenorhabditis elegans supporting the developmental theory of ageing
AB  - Adulthood-only downregulation of insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS), an evolutionarily conserved pathway regulating resource allocation between somatic maintenance and reproduction, increases life span without fecundity cost in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. However, long-term multigenerational effects of reduced IIS remain unexplored and are proposed to carry costs for offspring quality. To test this hypothesis, we ran a mutation accumulation (MA) experiment and downregulated IIS in half of the 400 MA lines by silencing daf-2 gene expression using RNA interference (RNAi) across 40 generations. Contrary to the prediction, adulthood-only daf-2 RNAi reduced extinction of MA lines both under UV-induced and spontaneous MA. Fitness of the surviving UV-induced MA lines was higher under daf-2 RNAi. Reduced IIS increased intergenerational F1 offspring fitness under UV stress but had no quantifiable transgenerational effects. Functional hrde-1 was required for the benefits of multigenerational daf-2 RNAi. Overall, we found net benefit to fitness from multigenerational reduction of IIS and the benefits became more apparent under stress. Because reduced daf-2 expression during development carries fitness costs, we suggest that our findings are best explained by the developmental theory of ageing, which maintains that the decline in the force of selection with age results in poorly regulated gene expression in adulthood.

TI  - Rearing the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, on a tapioca-based artificial diet
VL  - 7
AB  - The impact of a tapioca-based artificial diet on the developmental rate, life history parameters, and fertility was examined over five consecutive generations for the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a highly polyphagous pest of many agricultural crops. The study showed that when fed the tapioca-based artificial diet during larval stage, larval and pupal developmental period, percent pupating, pupal weight, emergence rate of male and female, longevity, fecundity and hatching were non-significantly different than that of the control agar-based artificial diet. Moreover, the cost to rear on tapioca-based diet approached 2.13 times less than the cost of rearing on the agar-based artificial diet. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and potential cost savings of the tapioca-based artificial diet for rearing H. armigera.

TI  - Microevolution or wide tolerance? Level of stress proteins in the beet armyworm Spodoptera eqigua hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) exposed to cadmium for over 150 generations
VL  - 178
SP  - 1-8
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate whether the cadmium tolerance developed in the beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua selected for over 150 generations may be related to synthesis of the stress proteins metallothioneins (Mts) and 70 kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70). To achieve this, six S. exigua strains (control, k), 150-generation Cd exposure strain (cd), and four 18-generation Cd exposure strains differing in Cd concentration (cd44, cd22, cdll, cd5) were reared. Stress protein level was measured in the midgut of the 5th larval stage after 1-6, 12 and 18 generations. Cd contents was measured in the pupae. Unlike Cd concentration, which depended on metal contents in food but was not generation-dependent, the pattern of Mts and HSP70 concentrations changed in experimental strains from generation to generation. Stress protein levels in the insects exposed to the highest Cd concentration (the same as in the 150-generation Cd exposure strain), initially higher than in the control strain, after the 12th generation did not differ from the level measured in the control strains. It seems therefore that stress proteins play a protective role in insects of lower tolerance to cadmium. The tolerance developed during multigenerational exposure probably relies on mechanisms other than Mt and HSP70 synthesis.

TI  - Genetic basis of a between-environment trade-off involving resistance to cadmium in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 53
IS  - 3
SP  - 826-836
AB  - In a replicated, laboratory, natural selection experiment Drosophila melanogaster populations were maintained for 20 generations either on unpolluted medium or on polluted medium containing cadmium chloride at a concentration of 80 mu g/ml. Lines maintained on polluted medium evolved resistance. In comparison with unpolluted lines, their juvenile survivorship increased from 35% to 46%, developmental period decreased from 13.7 days to 13.0 days, and fecundity increased from 3 to 29 eggs per two-day period. Emergence weights, however, did not change. By contrast the "environmental" effect of moving susceptible flies onto polluted medium was that after two generations survivorship fell 62%, developmental period increased 40%, and fecundity fell 97%. Emergence weights fell 31% in females and 28% in males. Resistant lines paid a fitness cost in unpolluted environments, with fecundity being reduced by 44% and emergence weights being reduced by 4% in females and 6% in males. Developmental period, however, was unaffected. Analyses of crosses and backcrosses between the lines suggested that the evolved cadmium resistance was due to a single sex-linked gene. Levels of dominance were calculated, and in each life-history character the resistant allele was found to be completely dominant. Because the life-history effects appear to be produced by a single gene, it is probable that they all depend on the same metabolic pathway. Metallothionein production is a likely candidate because this is known to be controlled by genes on the X-chromosome. The study adds to a small number of examples of single or closely linked genes with large antagonistic pleiotropic effects on life histories. The result here is a between-environment trade-off, allowing animals increased fitness in polluted environments, but only at the cost of reduced growth and reproduction in unpolluted environments.

TI  - A new set of laboratory-selected Drosophila melanogaster lines for the analysis of desiccation resistance: response to selection, physiology and correlated responses
VL  - 209
IS  - 10
SP  - 1837-1847
AB  - Artificial selection experiments provide insights into the evolutionary factors that can shape adaptive responses and have previously been utilized to examine the physiological adaptations that can improve survival to desiccation in Drosophila melanogaster. While such studies demonstrate that multiple resistance mechanisms may arise via different base populations and selection regimes, water retention emerges as a key mechanism for desiccation survival. Here, we present the physiological, correlated response and life history data for a new set of selection lines designed for the genetic dissection of desiccation resistance. After 26 generations of selection for desiccation resistance, female survival increased twofold. In contrast to previous studies, the altered resistance was associated primarily with enhanced dehydration tolerance and increased mass and less consistently with decreased rates of water loss. Life history tradeoffs and correlated selection responses were examined and overlap with previously published data. We crossed the resistant selected lines to desiccation-sensitive lines from the same control background to examine how each heterozygous resistant chromosome (excluding four) may improve desiccation resistance and observed that most of the resistance was due to genes on the third and first chromosomes, although interaction effects with the second chromosome were also detected. Results are compared to other selection responses and highlight the multiple evolutionary solutions that can arise when organisms are faced with a common selection pressure, although water loss rate remains a common mechanism in all studies.

TI  - Adaptation and correlated fitness responses over two time scales in Drosophila suzukii populations evolving in different environments
VL  - 34
IS  - 8
SP  - 1225-1240
AB  - The process of local adaptation involves differential changes in fitness over time across different environments. Although experimental evolution studies have extensively tested for patterns of local adaptation at a single time point, there is relatively little research that examines fitness more than once during the time course of adaptation. We allowed replicate populations of the fruit pest Drosophila suzukii to evolve in one of eight different fruit media. After five generations, populations with the highest initial levels of maladaptation had mostly gone extinct, whereas experimental populations evolving on cherry, strawberry and cranberry media had survived. We measured the fitness of each surviving population in each of the three fruit media after five and after 26 generations of evolution. After five generations, adaptation to each medium was associated with increased fitness in the two other media. This was also true after 26 generations, except when populations that evolved on cranberry medium developed on cherry medium. These results suggest that, in the theoretical framework of a fitness landscape, the fitness optima of cherry and cranberry media are the furthest apart. Our results show that studying how fitness changes across several environments and across multiple generations provides insights into the dynamics of local adaptation that would not be evident if fitness were analysed at a single point in time. By allowing a qualitative mapping of an experimental fitness landscape, our approach will improve our understanding of the ecological factors that drive the evolution of local adaptation in D. suzukii.

AB  - Rain-out shelters provide an effective tool to establish controlled water-stress environments by excluding undesired rain events and have been widely used in the selection and breeding of cool-season turfgrass for improved drought tolerance. However, the efficiency of recurrent selection using rain-out shelters has seldomly been investigated. In this study, we documented the selection process of tall fescue in one cycle of recurrent selection, compared the drought tolerance of two consecutive generations and estimated selection gain of tall fescue using rain-out shelters. Depending on days of drought, relative selection gain ranges from -4.20% to 3.60%, indicating small and unstable improvement from the parental generation. A subsequent analysis of experimental data using Bayesian mixed linear model revealed low narrow-sense heritability estimations (0.18 for parental generation and 0.08 for progeny generation), providing an explanation for this observation.

SP  - 239-250
AB  - The life cycle of the amphipod, Corophium volutator (Pallas), is described from an intertidal mudflat in Maine, near the southern limit of the species' range in the western Atlantic Ocean. This population has two generations per year, with one generation born in May to mid-June and growing to reproduce and give rise to a second generation in August. The individuals born in August form the over-wintering generation. Comparison to sites in the Bay of Fundy, where different populations of C. volutator display one and two generations per year, rejects the hypothesis that episodic predation by shorebirds selects for the life history with two generations per year. Water temperatures during the summer may control the number of generations per year for C. volutator in the western Atlantic.

VL  - 123

SP  - 1365-1370
AB  - Given the current rapid climate change, understanding the mechanisms underlying heat tolerance and its plasticity is an important goal of global change biology. Soil fauna communities are especially vulnerable because of their limited dispersal ability. It is generally recognized that transgenerational effects can contribute to the expression of phenotypic plasticity. Nevertheless, transgenerational plasticity in belowground organisms has received relatively little attention in the context of climate change, despite their major role in soil functioning. Here we test for transgenerational effects of heat shock exposure in the soil arthropod Orchesella cincta, a springtail species that regularly experiences heat stress conditions in its natural environment. We exposed females to heat stress, and subsequently investigated the effects of the same stress on the survival of their offspring. Thermal resistance of the progeny from treated and untreated mothers was compared at three life stages: egg, juvenile and adult. We provide evidence that exposure to heat shock induces a life stage-dependent increase in thermal resistance in the subsequent generation. The induced adaptive maternal effect persisted into the adult stage of the progeny. However, there is also a tradeoff resulting in reduced clutch size of treated females. These results are of broad significance to understanding the potential of organisms to cope with a changing climate.

VL  - 101
IS  - 6
SP  - 1760-1770
AB  - Storage of Gonatocerus ashmeadi Girault (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) adults at 2, 5, and 10 degrees C showed that these parasitoids do not survive at 2 degrees C for 5 d, and exposure to 5 and 10 degrees C shortens their life span. The lethal time (LT)(50) (i.e., length of storage time for 50% wasp Survival) at 5 degrees C was 14 d for males and approximate to 29 d for females, whereas at 10 degrees C was 32 and 39 d, respectively. Effects of adult storage at 10 degrees C on other factors indicating fitness, such as fecundity, developmental time, parasitism, emergence, and sex ratio, were examined on female wasps and their progeny at 10-d intervals for up to 60 d. Glassy-winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca vitripennis (Germar), eggs were used as hosts for propagation of this wasp and for assessing its oviposition and fecundity. Increasing adult storage time decreased the length of the ovipositional period for the maternal generation, and oviposition was decreased by 90% after 60-d storage. A significant reduction in maternal lifetime fecundity occurred after 20-d storage and in the incidence of parasitism after 40 d. We also found a carryover effect caused by storage of the maternal generation that was expressed in the F-1 generation. When cold storage of the adult parents was >= 20 d, we observed delayed development, decreased fecundity, reduced longevity, and increased male production occurring in the F-1 generation. Reduced fitness of the F-1 generation was also expressed as a decrease in net reproductive rate (R-0) and an increase in mean generation time (T-c). However, none of these deleterious effects were evident in the F-2 progeny that descended from grandparents that had experienced cold storage. Damage caused by indirect chilling injury and/or induced maternal aging occurring during storage can account for the decreased fitness of maternal and F-1 generations. Providing that the limits of cold tolerance of G. ashmeadi as defined in this study are not exceeded, our results show that short-term cold storage of adults could be used in a mass-rearing program.

SP  - 185-192
AB  - Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko is used throughout Europe as an effective biological control agent against the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner). However, in certain climatic regions, the biological control exerted by this parasitoid is less effective. High temperatures inside the released capsules are suspected to have a negative influence on the parasitoids. To simulate these adverse conditions, we applied heat shocks (35-degrees-C and 44-degrees-C) for 6 hours to pupae of Trichogramma brassicae at two periods: white pupae and melanized pupae. The results showed the susceptibility of both the white pupae and melanized pupae, especially at 44-degrees-C. At this temperature, the adults (G0 generation) derived from pupae treated at any age showed reduced longevity and fecundity. Moreover, those descended from treated melanized pupae showed an emergence rate lower than that of the control. These effects reduced to half and more the parasitic efficiency of the G, generation. For the progeny (G1 generation), we observed a decrease of the female ratio : 38 % for the progeny of adults derived from treated melanized pupae ; 88 % for the progeny of those derived from treated white pupae. In that condition, the G1 generation, almost totally male, could not have any parasitic activity.

TI  - Adaptation of Habrobracon hebetor (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) to Rearing on Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)
VL  - 16
AB  - Food characteristics strongly regulate digestive enzymatic activity of insects through direct influences on their midgut mechanisms. Insect performance is better on diets that contain nutrients in proportions that fit its digestive enzymes. Little is known about the influences of rearing history on parasitism success of Habrobracon hebetor Say. This research focused on the effect of nutrient regulation on survival, development, and parasitism of H. hebetor. Life history and digestive enzyme activity of fourth-stage larvae of H. hebetor were studied when reared on Ephestia kuehniella Zeller. This parasitoid was then introduced to Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner), and above-mentioned parameters were also studied in the first and fourth generations after transfer. In term of parasitism success, H. hebetor preferred E. kuehniella over He. armigera. When the first and fourth generations of He. armigera-reared H. hebetor were compared, the rearing history affected the life history and enzymatic activity of the parasitoid. A better performance of H. hebetor was achieved after it was reared on He. armigera for the four generations. Because, digestive alpha-amylase and general protease of the parasitoid were matched with the new host, it used reserve energy for a better performance. Thus, a better performance of H. hebetor could be obtained when the parasitoid was reared on its original host for at least four generations.

TI  - Using Solar Irradiation for Steam Generation in Bioethanol Production: an Initial Study
AB  - This paper proposes a solar-based steam generation for Bioethanol production. Aspen Hysys (R) and Matlab (R) are integrated to perform a simulation-based analysis by using dynamic models that have been already validated in related literature. Real environment data is used to feed solar collector field model in order to analyze steam generation viability. It is shown that solar collector field is able to provide the necessary steam flow for the considered scenario.

VL  - 80
SP  - 326-335
AB  - Wild-collected Drosophila melanogaster females were isolated in culture vials to initiate isofemale lines in the laboratory. Wing length and body pigmentation (thorax, abdominal segments 5, 6 and 7 and their sum) were measured in wild flies and in successive laboratory generations. Heritability was estimated by parent-offspring regression between wild-living flies and laboratory progeny or by calculating intraclass correlation between lines in each laboratory generation. For wing length, phenotypic variability was much higher in nature than in the laboratory, and the estimated heritability with parent-offspring regression (0.14) was significant but quite low. Within laboratory generations? intraclass correlation was much higher, on average 0.34. For pigmentation characteristics, variability in nature was similar to that measured in the laboratory. Parent-offspring regressions produced significant and high heritability values (range 0.40-0.62), except for abdomen segment 5. Intraclass correlations were also significantly greater than zero for all traits (range 0.22-0.47), including segment 5. The stability of the lines over successive laboratory generations was shown by the stability of the overall mean and by a strong positive correlation between family means of successive generations. The correlation across generations demonstrates a genetic repeatability of the trait and should be useful in experiments using isofemale lines.

VL  - 94

SP  - 257-264
AB  - We employed common-garden experiments to test for genetic variation in responses of larval life-history traits to temperature between two populations of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L., 1758) that naturally experience contrasting thermal environments during early life due to spatial and temporal differences in spawning. Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence cod larvae experienced faster growth in warmer water and low, uniform survival across all experimental temperatures (3, 7, 11 degrees C), consistent with previous studies on this spring-spawning population. In contrast, larvae from fall-spawning Southwestern Scotian Shelf cod collected near Sambro, Nova Scotia, lacked plasticity for growth but experienced much lower survival at higher temperatures. Phenotypes that are positively associated with fitness were observed at temperatures closest to those experienced in the wild, consistent with the hypothesis that these populations are adapted to local thermal regimes. The lack of growth plasticity observed in Sambro cod might be due to costly maintenance of plasticity in stable environments or energy savings at cold temperatures. However, additional experiments need to be conducted on Sambro cod and other fall-spawning marine fishes to determine to what extent responses to projected changes in climate will differ among populations.

TI  - Effect of exposure to short-term heat stress on survival and fecundity in Drosophila ananassae
VL  - 84
IS  - 6
SP  - 895-899
AB  - In ectothermic organisms, temperature plays a vital role in survival and reproductive success. Founding isofemale lines from wild-collected females is a basic tool for characterizing quantitative traits in a natural population. The effects of heat shock, i.e., short exposure to heat stress, on survival and reproductive success in 10 recently collected isofemale lines of Drosophila ananassae Doleschall, 1858 were compared. Flies were treated as follows: (i) unstressed control; (ii) placed at 37 degrees C for 90amin (pre-treatment); (iii) placed at 40 degrees C for 60amin 24ah before the fecundity test; and (iv) placed at 40 degrees C for 60 min with pre-treatment 16ah before they were exposed to 40 degrees C. The heat stress strongly affected survival. However, there was no significant difference between the survival of males and females. Furthermore, the female fecundity, measured as F(1) offspring produced over the next 12adays, was also reduced. Heat pre-treatment improved survival of both male and female and also improved female productivity. We found significant variation in female fecundity among isofemale lines, and intraclass correlations increased for stress treatments. The results suggest that a small increase in environmental stress may affect fitness traits, and there is enough genetic variation for thermal adaptation in D.aananassae.

TI  - Municipal solid waste management and economic feasibility for electricity generation from landfill gas and anaerobic reactors in a Brazilian state
VL  - 22
AB  - This study aims to estimate the potential of the municipal solid waste management consortiums in Minas Gerais for electricity generation from Landfill Gas (LFG) and from anaerobic reactors for organic fractions of this waste. Economic viability studies were conducted for both types of enterprises. Projections for landfill biogas generation were made using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) LandGem?R 3.02 software program. Estimates for anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste were performed based on theoretical generation from this substrate's chemical oxygen demand. The power, electricity, and investment values for both projects were calculated, and the respective Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and payback time were also obtained for the various consortiums. The results show that there is economic viability potential for electric energy generation for landfill biogas at the CIAS CENTRO OESTE, CIDES, CISAB Zona da Mata, CONVALE, and CORESAB Boa Vista municipal solid waste consortiums. Electric Energy obtained for the state of Minas Gerais would be about 3,900,000 MWh/year, and the total installed power capacity would be approximately 4500 kW for a Thermal Power Plant (TPP) using LFG for all consortiums. These values were nearly 15,400 MWh/year and 3200 kW for biogas energy derived from the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) anaerobic digestion. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Genetic variance for diapause expression and associated life histories in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 59
IS  - 12
SP  - 2616-2625
AB  - The dipteran Drosophila melanogaster can express a form of reproductive quiescence or diapause when exposed to low temperature and shortened photoperiod. Among natural populations in the eastern United States, the frequency of lines that express reproductive diapause in the laboratory varies substantially and predictably with latitudinal origin. The goals of the present study were twofold: (1) to examine the impact of genetic variance for diapause expression on multiple traits associated with organismal fitness; and (2) to evaluate the potential for fitness trade-offs between diapause and nondiapause phenotypes that may result in the observed cline. Even prior to diapause entry or expression, inbred lines that express and do not express reproductive diapause in laboratory assays were constitutively distinct for life span, age-specific mortality rates, fecundity profiles, resistance to cold and starvation stress, lipid content, development time, and egg-to-adult viability. Furthermore, estimates of genetic correlations based on line means revealed significant differentiation for genetic variance/covariance matrices between diapause and nondiapause lines. The data indicate the potential for life-history trade-offs associated with variation for the diapause phenotype. The observed cline in diapause incidence in the eastern United States may be generated by these trade-offs and the associated spatial and/or temporal variation in relative fitness of these two phenotypes in natural populations.

AB  - The whiteflies belonging to the species groupBemisia tabacitransmit viruses that are the greatest constraint to the production of cassava, Africa's most important food security crop. We studied the life history of an endemic African population ofB. tabaciSSA-ESA at six constant temperatures (16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36 degrees C) in controlled environment chambers, and for 10 generations in the field. Oviposition occurred between 20 and 28 degrees C, with highest fecundity (114.5 +/- 88.2) eggs per female at 20 degrees C. Similarly,B. tabaciadult females average survival time was longest (19.7 days) at 24 degrees C, and shortest (8.5 days) at 36 degrees C. Immature development time decreased with increasing temperature from 59.3 days at 16 degrees C to 16.3 days at 28 degrees C, and increased above 28 degrees C. A constant temperature of 36 degrees C was lethal to eggs and first instars and no immature stage developed further to adults at this temperature. Several temperature-driven models were fitted for describing the species development, survival and reproduction using Insect Life Cycle Modelling (ILCYM (R)) software. Median temperature-dependent development rates in individual immature life stages were statistically described by Taylor, Briere 1 and Tb (Logan) models. Temperature-dependent mortality and senescence rates in immature stages were described by using parabolic nonlinear models. The longevity of adult females and oviposition time was best described by the Weibull distribution. Maximum population growth was predicted between 26 and 28 degrees C. These results will be useful for spatio-temporal analysis of climate change impacts on the distribution and abundance of this pest.

VL  - 40

SP  - 140-150
AB  - Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) biotype B and Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) are invasive whitefly species that often co-occur on greenhouse-grown vegetables in northern China. Although B. tabaci biotype B has been present in China for a relatively short period of time, it has become dominant over T. vaporariorum. We studied the interspecific competitive interactions between the two species in single or mixed cultures at 24 +/- 1 degrees C, 40 +/- 5% RH, and L14:D10 h photoperiod. Female longevity on tomato was not significantly different between species, but B. tabaci reproduced 4.3 to 4.9 fold more progeny. The ratio of female to male progeny in both instances was greater for B. tabaci. When cultured on tomato, cotton, and tobacco, B. tabaci developed 0.8, 3.3, and 4.7 d earlier in single culture, and 1.8, 3.9, and 4.3 d earlier in mixed culture. B. tabaci displaced T. vaporariorum in four, five and six generations when the initial ratios of B. tabaci to T vaporariorum were 15:15,20:10, or 10:20 on tomato. Populations of B. tabaci were 2.3 fold higher than that of T. vaporariorum on tomato plants for seven consecutive generations in single culture. B. tabaci performed better in development, survival, fecundity, and female ratio. We conclude that B. tabaci could displace T. vaporariorum in as short as four generations in a controlled greenhouse environment when they start at equal proportions. Warmer greenhouse conditions and an increase in total greenhouse area could be contributing factors in the recent dominance of B. tabaci.

VL  - 43

SP  - 51-58
AB  - Cross-generation effects on the cold resistance of Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans were investigated by exposing adults to different levels of cold stress and testing the resistance of female F1s and F2s. Maternal and paternal treatments had different effects on progeny resistance. Maternal effects were not detected for either species when progeny were held at 25-degrees-C, but were detected when progeny were acclimated at 13-degrees-C prior to testing. When dams were exposed to a non-lethal cold stress following acclimation, the cold resistance of their progeny was increased, particularly in D. simulans. Grandmaternal exposure to 13-degrees-C and a non-lethal stress led to a small decrease in the cold resistance of D. melanogaster, and a small increase in the resistance of D. simulans. When sires of D. melanogaster and D. simulans were exposed to a cold stress, the resistance of their progeny decreased when progeny were tested without acclimation at 13-degrees-C, but decreased only in D. melanogaster when progeny were acclimated. Paternal effects were smaller than maternal effects and were not evident in the F2 generation.

TI  - Embryonal life histories: Desiccation plasticity and diapause in the Argentinean pearlfish Austrolebias bellottii
VL  - 8
IS  - 22
SP  - 11246-11260
AB  - Embryos of annual killifish diapause in soil egg banks while ponds are dry. Their rates of development and survival in different developmental stages determine the numbers and stages of embryos at rewetting. In the Argentinean pearlfish Austrolebias bellottii, we investigated plasticity for desiccation in such embryonal life history components across phases of mild desiccation and rewetting and also effects of life history on hatching. In comparison with nonannuals, our data suggest that incidences of diapause have become relatively independent of the occurrence of desiccation, as if they have become genetically assimilated. We found limited survival effects of desiccation, limited developmental delays, and an acceleration of development into the prehatching stage. This response can be adaptive when desiccation informs that an opportunity to hatch approaches. Embryos arrest development in the prehatching stage (diapause DIII) or in the dispersed-cell phase (diapause DI). Parental pair variation in rates of development and survival in the earliest developmental stages affects the fraction of embryos that are in DI at rewetting and the number surviving. Given such effects on life history fitness components, rates during embryonal development seem "visible" to selection and the developmental system can thus adapt when pair variation contains a heritable component. In agreement with expectations for the presence of diversified bet-hedging, some embryos hatched and others not in over half of the clutches with several developed embryos at the moment of rewetting. Hatching probabilities increased for eggs produced later in the experiment, and they increased when embryos were rewetted a second time after two months. This response is opposite of what is expected when age-dependent hatching would be adapted to exploit opportunities for completing another generation before the dry season.

AB  - Most organisms have complex life cycles, and in marine taxa, larval life-history stages tend to be more sensitive to environmental stress than adult (reproductive) life-history stages. While there are several models of stage-specific adaptation across the life history, the extent to which differential sensitivity to environmental stress (defined here as reductions in absolute fitness across the life history) affects the tempo of adaptive evolution to change remains unclear. We used a heuristic model to explore how commonly observed features associated with marine complex life histories alter a population's capacity to cope with environmental change. We found that increasing the complexity of the life history generally reduces the evolutionary potential of taxa to cope with environmental change. Our model also predicted that genetic correlations in stress tolerance between stages, levels of genetic variance in each stage, and the relative plasticity of different stages, all interact to affect the maximum rate of environmental change that will permit species persistence. Our results suggest that marine organisms with complex life cycles are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic global change, but we lack empirical estimates of key parameters for most species.

TI  - Effects of cadmium on life-cycle parameters in a multi-generation study with Chironomus riparius following a pre-exposure of populations to two different tributyltin concentrations for several generations
VL  - 19
IS  - 7
SP  - 1174-1182
AB  - So far only a few studies have been performed to assess the effects of dynamic pollutant exposure on life-history parameters of invertebrates. In a previous multi-generation approach with the midge Chironomus riparius we tested if a chronic tributyltin pre-exposure alters the ability of a population to cope with subsequent cadmium stress. In the experiment two separate chironomid populations were exposed via sediments to different TBT-concentrations (4.46 and 8.93 mu g Sn/kg dw) for several generations, followed by subsequent cadmium exposure (1.2 mg Cd/kg dw) for three generations. While the TBT-exposure to 4.46 mu g Sn/kg dw had only small effects on the development and reproduction of C. riparius the higher TBT-concentration of 8.93 mu g Sn/kg dw led to negative effects on life-history traits. Therefore, a higher adverse effect of the higher TBT-concentration and thus a higher susceptibility to other stressors could be assumed. Within, this paper only the results of the second stressor experiment were presented; clear effects of Cd on development and reproduction of C. riparius were determined independent of the pre-exposure scenario. While no differences in Cd-sensitivity were found between the population without pre-exposure to TBT and the population pre-exposed to the low TBT-concentration (4.46 mu g Sn/kg dw), the pre-exposure of midges to the higher TBT-concentration (8.93 mu g Sn/kg dw) resulted in a significantly higher susceptibility to subsequent Cd-stress. These results document that the exposure history may influence the reaction to altered chemical stress. Our findings are relevant to understand and predict the evolutionary fate of populations in rapidly changing, human-impacted environments. However, the fact that chemical-induced reduced genetic diversity, which is not necessarily linked to genetic adaptation, leads to a reduced fitness under altered stress conditions, is to our knowledge a novel finding.

TI  - Assessing the relative importance of environmental effects, carry-over effects and species differences in thermal stress resistance: a comparison of Drosophilids across field and laboratory generations
VL  - 216
IS  - 20
SP  - 3790-3798
AB  - There is increasing interest in comparing species of related organisms for their susceptibility to thermal extremes in order to evaluate potential vulnerability to climate change. Comparisons are typically undertaken on individuals collected from the field with or without a period of acclimation. However, this approach does not allow the potential contributions of environmental and carry-over effects across generations to be separated from inherent species differences in susceptibility. To assess the importance of these different sources of variation, we here considered heat and cold resistance in Drosophilid species from tropical and temperate sites in the field and across two laboratory generations. Resistance in field-collected individuals tended to be lower when compared with F1 and F2 laboratory generations, and species differences in field flies were only weakly correlated to differences established under controlled rearing conditions, unlike in F1-F2 comparisons. This reflected large environmental effects on resistance associated with different sites and conditions experienced within sites. For the 8 h cold recovery assay there was no strong evidence of carry-over effects, whereas for the heat knockdown and 2 h cold recovery assays there was some evidence for such effects. However, for heat these were species specific in direction. Variance components for inherent species differences were substantial for resistance to heat and 8 h cold stress, but small for 2 h cold stress, though this may be a reflection of the species being considered in the comparisons. These findings highlight that inherent differences among species are difficult to characterise accurately without controlling for environmental sources of variation and carry-over effects. Moreover, they also emphasise the complex nature of carry-over effects that vary depending on the nature of stress traits and the species being evaluated.

VL  - 8

AB  - Temperature-driven development and survival rates of the mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Tinsley (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) were examined at nine constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 27, 30, 32, 35 and 40 degrees C) on hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L.). Crawlers successfully completed development to adult stage between 15 and 35 degrees C, although their survival was affected at low temperatures. Two linear and four nonlinear models were fitted to describe developmental rates of P. solenopsis as a function of temperature, and for estimating thermal constants and bioclimatic thresholds (lower, optimum and upper temperature thresholds for development: T-min, T-opt and T-max, respectively). Estimated thresholds between the two linear models were statistically similar. Ikemoto and Takai's linear model permitted testing the equivalence of lower developmental thresholds for life stages of P. solenopsis reared on two hosts, hibiscus and cotton. Thermal constants required for completion of cumulative development of female and male nymphs and for the whole generation were significantly lower on hibiscus (222.2, 237.0, 308.6 degree-days, respectively) compared to cotton. Three nonlinear models performed better in describing the developmental rate for immature instars and cumulative life stages of female and male and for generation based on goodness-of-fit criteria. The simplified beta type distribution function estimated T-opt values closer to the observed maximum rates. Thermodynamic SSI model indicated no significant differences in the intrinsic optimum temperature estimates for different geographical populations of P. solenopsis. The estimated bioclimatic thresholds and the observed survival rates of P. solenopsis indicate the species to be high-temperature adaptive, and explained the field abundance of P. solenopsis on its host plants.

SP  - 88-94
AB  - The efficacy of one new modified and two old meridic diets on Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) for rearing six successive generations was studied. Duration of larval development for insects fed on the modified diet was considerably shortened as most of them went through only five stadia before pupation, while the per cent pupation and per cent eclosion were relatively higher than on other diets. The lowest pupal mortality (6.33 +/- 0.13%) was recorded in the F-1 generation reared on the modified diet, whereas the highest pupal mortality (19.49 +/- 0.15%) was observed in insects reared on a natural diet in the F-6 generation. Blending of chickpea Cicer arietinum L. and red kidney bean Phaseolus vulgaris L. flours with tomato paste proved highly favorable for adult reproduction. These results suggest that the vitality of the tomato fruitworm did not decline obviously after rearing on a modified diet for several generations.

VL  - 158

SP  - 1523-1535
AB  - The spatial scale of life-history and demographic variation was investigated in the opportunistic polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica La Greca and Bacci. Individuals were collected along the Italian coasts from three thermally different biogeographical regions of the Mediterranean Sea. For each region, populations from four harbours were considered, and for each harbour, two sites were examined. Life-history and demographic traits were investigated after one generation under a common garden experiment, and their variation at the three spatial scales was assessed. All the traits showed high variability with regard to site. A number of life-history and all demographic traits also varied according to the biogeographical region. Conversely, no differences were found between harbours, suggesting that geographical isolation did not contribute to phenotypic variation. Results confirmed the central role of local conditions for the evolution of life history in species colonizing heterogeneous environments, but they also pointed to the importance of large-scale factors in shaping the phenotypic responses of O. labronica, demonstrating the need for a multi-scale approach for obtaining a good measure of natural variation in widespread opportunistic species.

VL  - 3
IS  - 3
SP  - 221-243
AB  - We use a state dependent life history model to predict the life history strategies of female steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in altered environments. As a case study of a broadly applicable approach, we applied this model to the American and Mokelumne Rivers in central California, where steelhead are listed as threatened. Both rivers have been drastically altered, with highly regulated flows and translocations that may have diluted local adaptation. Nevertheless, evolutionary optimization models could successfully predict the life history displayed by fish on the American River (all anadromous, with young smolts) and on the Mokelumne River (a mix of anadromy and residency). The similar fitness of the two strategies for the Mokelumne suggested that a mixed strategy could be favored in a variable environment. We advance the management utility of this framework by explicitly modeling growth as a function of environmental conditions and using sensitivity analyses to predict likely evolutionary endpoints under changed environments. We conclude that the greatest management concern with respect to preserving anadromy is reduced survival of emigrating smolts, although large changes in freshwater survival or growth rates are potentially also important. We also demonstrate the importance of considering asymptotic size along with maximum growth rate.

SP  - 231-235
AB  - Lucilia sericata has a facultative diapause in the third larval instar after cessation of feeding. Induction of the diapause is influenced by the photoperiod and temperature conditions experienced by insects in the parental generation as well as those experienced by the larvae themselves. The sensitive stage of the parental generation for induction of diapause was examined using diapause-averting conditions of 16 h light : 8 h darkness (LD 16:8) at 25degreesC and diapause-inducing conditions of LD 12:12 at 20degreesC. The incidence of diapause in the progeny was predominantly determined by the conditions experienced by the parents in the adult stage. Moreover, the results of reciprocal crosses showed that only the mother's experience is involved in the induction of diapause in the progeny.

TI  - Comparative Life History Parameters of Three Stink Bug Pest Species
VL  - 51
IS  - 2
SP  - 430-439
AB  - California pistachios are threatened by several stink bug species (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), including the native Thyanta pallidovirens (Stal) and Chlorochroa uhleri (Stal), as well as the invasive Nezara viridula (L.). In pistachio, control tactics often target specific life stages, which makes knowledge about life histories fundamental to successful IPM programs. For that purpose, life history parameters of these stink bug species were assessed. Nymphal development and survivorship at seven constant temperatures, upper and lower development thresholds, thermal constants, adult longevity and fecundity, and life table parameters were evaluated. No species completed development at 15 degrees C or 35 degrees C. For N. viridula, egg to adult development was fastest at 30 degrees C, whereas for T. pallidovirens there was no significant difference between 27.5 and 30 degrees C and C. uhleri development was similar between 25 and 30 degrees C. Egg to adult survival was highest at 22.5 degrees C and 27.5 degrees C. The thermal requirements as degree-days (DD) to complete immature development were estimated to be 714.3, 370.4, and 434.8 for C. uhleri, T. pallidovirens, and N. viridula, respectively. For C. uhleri, life table calculations produced a value of 56.7 d for mean generation time (T-o), 24.89 for net reproductive rate (R-o) and 0.057 for the intrinsic rate of increase (r). Thyanta pallidovirens had a T-o of 39.9 d, a R-o of 81.10 and a r of 0.11. The results are discussed with respect to the improvement of IPM in California pistachios, and the information presented may contribute to the control of these pest species in other ecosystems.

TI  - Transgenerational responses to heat and fasting acclimation in the Angoumois grain moth
VL  - 97
AB  - Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) is a physiological mechanism where environmental experiences of parents affect phenotypes of the offspring, and potentially facilitates organisms' survival in stressful environments. The Angouimois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier), is a dominant primary grain pest in Africa, particularly affecting sorghum and maize staples. Despite its widely known economic significance, little is known on its thermal responses, particularly how acclimation in one generation impacts fitness in successive generations. We tested how heat (acute and dynamic) as well as fasting acclimation in one generation affects physiological tolerance (i.e., critical thermal maxima [CTmax] and heat knock down time [HKDT]) using laboratory-reared S. cerealella populations. Specifically, we assessed whether pre-exposure to heat or fasting stress confers fitness costs or benefits in subsequent generations (i.e., through TGP). Results showed acclimation had significant effects in interaction with temperature ramping rates on CTmax. Moderate acute heat (34 C) and dynamic temperature (28-38 C) acclimations reduced F1 CTmax and HKDT, particularly at low ramping rates (for CTmax). We did not find fasting acclimation to significantly affect CTmax, indicating a lack of evidence for cross tolerance and/or susceptibility. For HKDT, all acclimation treatments (including fasting) showed significantly lower HKDT compared to controls, and mostly so, for the 38 C and dynamic acclimation (28-38 C) treatments, indicating a transgenerational fitness cost of acclimation. This is the first report of the costs of transgenerational plasticity in a stored product pest of economic significance and has implications in designing heat-based phytosanitary grain treatments.

TI  - Effects of husbandry parameters on the life-history traits of the apple snail, Marisa cornuarietis: effects of temperature, photoperiod, and population density
VL  - 125
IS  - 1
SP  - 9-20
AB  - These experiments are part of a larger study designed to investigate the influence of husbandry parameters on the life history of the apple snail, Marisa cornuarietis. The overall objective of the program is to identify suitable husbandry conditions for maintaining multi-generation populations of this species in the laboratory for use in ecotoxicological testing. In this article, we focus on the effects of photoperiod, temperature, and population density on adult fecundity and juvenile growth. Increasing photoperiod from 12 to 16 h of light per day had no effect on adult fecundity or egg hatching and relatively minor effects on juvenile growth and development. Rearing snails at temperatures between 22 degrees C and 28 degrees C did not influence the rates of egg production or egg clutch size. However, the rates of growth and development (of eggs and juveniles) increased with increasing temperature in this range, and when temperatures were reduced to 22 degrees C egg-hatching success was impaired. Juvenile growth and development were more sensitive to rearing density than adult fecundity traits. On the basis of the present results, we conclude that rearing individuals of M. cornuarietis at a temperature of 25 degrees C, a photoperiod of 12L:12D, and a density of < 0.8 snails L-1 (with lower densities for juvenile snails) should provide favorable husbandry conditions for maintaining multi-generation populations of this species.

TI  - Climate change and the evolution of reef fishes: past and future
VL  - 18
IS  - 1
SP  - 22-39
AB  - Predicting the impacts of ocean warming and acidification on marine ecosystems requires an evolutionary perspective because, for most marine species, these environmental changes will occur over a number of generations. Acclimation through phenotypic plasticity and adaptation through genetic selection could help populations of some species cope with future warmer and more acidic oceans. Coral reef species are predicted to be some of the most vulnerable to climate change because they live close to their thermal limits. Yet, their evolutionary history may indicate that they possess adaptations that enable them to cope with a high CO2 environment. Here, we first explore the evolutionary history of reef fishes and how their history has shaped their physiological adaptations to environmental temperatures and pCO(2). We examine current-day thermal and CO2 environments experienced by coral reef fishes and summarize experimental studies that have tested how they respond to elevated temperatures and pCO(2) levels. We then examine evidence for acclimation and adaptation to projected ocean warming and acidification. Indeed, new studies have demonstrated the potential for transgenerational plasticity and heritable genetic variation that would allow some fishes to maintain performance as the oceans warm and become more acidic. We conclude by outlining management approaches - specifically those that can help preserve genetic variation by maintaining population size - to enhance the potential for genetic adaptation to climate change.

TI  - Reversal of resistance to pyriproxyfen in the Q biotype of Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera : Aleyrodidae)
VL  - 63
IS  - 8
SP  - 761-768
AB  - Pyriproxyfen, a juvenile hormone (JH) mimic, is a biorational insecticide that disrupts insect development. It is one of the principal insecticides being used to control Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) on cotton, and has many environmentally positive attributes that make it compatible with integrated pest management (IPM) programs. In Israel, a high level of resistance to pyriproxyfen has been observed in several isolated regions. Here, tests were conducted to establish whether temporal refuges from exposure to pyriproxyfen could be useful for restoring the effectiveness of the compound. Resistance was found to decrease by a factor of 8 when exposure to pyriproxyfen was ceased for 13 generations. Reversal of resistance was accompanied with increased biotic fitness of the revertant colony. By incorporating experimental estimates of nymph survival, sex ratio, fecundity, egg hatching rate and developmental time, the seasonal cost per generation for resistant insects was estimated to be 25%. A genetic simulation model, optimized by empirical data from bioassays, predicted fitness cost per generation of 19% for resistant homozygous (RR) females and hemizygous (R) males, and produced rates of reversal similar to the experimental results. The model also predicted that, even after 5 years (similar to 55 generations) without pyriproxyfen treatments, the frequency of the resistance allele (R) will still remain high (0.02). It is therefore concluded, on the basis of experimental and modeling results, that the effectiveness of temporal refuges for reversing development of resistance to pyriproxyfen in B. tabaci may be limited.

TI  - Geographic Variation of Photoperiodic Diapause but Not Adult Survival or Reproduction of the Invasive Mosquito Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) in North America
VL  - 104
IS  - 6
SP  - 1309-1318
AB  - Climate differences across latitude can result in seasonal constraints and selection on life-history characters. Because Aedes albopictus (Skuse) invaded North America in the mid-1980s, it has spread across a range of approximate to 14 degrees latitude and populations in the north experience complete adult mortality because of cold winter temperatures that are absent in the south. Life-table experiments were conducted to test for differences in the adult survival and reproductive schedules of Ae. albopictus females from three populations from the northern (Salem, NJ; Springfield, IL; Eureka, MO; approximate to 39 degrees N) and southern (Palm Beach, Palmetto, Tampa, FL; approximate to 27-28 degrees N) extremes of the species distribution in North America. There were consistent differences between northern and southern populations in incidence of photoperiodically-induced egg diapause. Under short daylength, diapause eggs constituted twice the proportion of total viable eggs from northern females (81.9-92.1%) than southern females (35.9-42.7%). There were no consistent differences between northern and southern populations in resource allocation between reproduction and maintenance, reproduction over time, and reproductive investment among offspring, and no apparent trade-offs between diapause incidence with reproduction or longevity. Our results suggest that the main response of North American Ae. albopictus to unfavorable winter climates is via the life history strategy of producing diapausing eggs, rather than quantitative variation in reproduction, and that there are no detectable costs to adult survival. Inherent geographic variation in the expression of diapause, consistent with the latitudinal extremes of A. albopictus, indicates evolutionary loss of diapause response in southern populations because of the invasion of A. albopictus in North America.

VL  - 51
IS  - 3
SP  - 856-864
AB  - Spontaneous mutations were allowed to accumulate for 104-161 generations in 113-176 inbred lines, independently maintained by a single brother-sister mating per generation, all of them derived from a completely homozygous population of Drosophila melanogaster. In each of two to three consecutive generations, all lines were scored for fecundity, egg-to-pupa and pupa-to-adult viabilities, both in the standard laboratory culture medium (ST) and in three harsh media differing from the former by a single factor: higher temperature (HT), higher NaCl concentration (HSC), or a much reduced concentration of nutrients (D). Relative to the standard medium, productivity (fecundity x viability) decreased by 25% (HT), 66% (HSC), and 80% (D). In each medium, mutational variances of those traits and mutational covariances between all possible pairs were calculated from the between-line divergence (codivergence). Mutational correlations between character states in different media were also obtained. Because we used inbred lines, those estimates were mainly due to the accumulation of mildly detrimental mutations, deleterious mutations of large effect being underrepresented. For all traits, mutational heritabilities ranged from 1.41 x 10(-4) to 11.24 x 10(-4), and did not increase with intensified environmental harshness. Mutational correlations between character states in different media were usually not large (average absolute value 0.31), reflecting a high degree of environmental specificity of the mutations involved. In our results, mutations quasi-neutral in ST conditions and mildly detrimental in more stressful media were not, as a class, important. Mutational correlations between fecundity and egg-to-pupa viability were small and positive in all media. Those involving pupa-to-adult viability were positive in HT, nonsignificant in HSC, and negative in ST and D, showing how the genetic covariance structure of quantitative traits in populations may change in variable environments.

AB  - A comparative study of life history traits of two clones (CDMr01 and CDMr02) of a triploid thelytokous apomictic population of the eutardigrade Macrobiotus richtersi has been carried out. Both clones were reared under the same lab conditions: temperature of 14 degrees C, photoperiod of 12 h/12 h (L/D), and nematodes ad libitum as food. Statistical analysis of the life history traits considered has indicated interclonal variability. The two clones were significantly different in the number of eggs per clutch (fertility), number of eggs laid per female per life span (fecundity), hatching percentage of eggs and hatching time. Similarities between clones have been observed with regard to life span, total number of ovipositions per life span, and age at first oviposition. In addition, significant differences in hatching time, with eggs hatched over a long period, were found within each clone. Interclonal variability in life history traits indicated the effects of genetic factors, whereas intraclonal variability reflected the effects of environmental factors. The evolutionary and adaptive significance of the life history phenotypic variations is discussed.

AB  - Effects of high temperature on insecticide susceptibility and fitness were studied in the field population of Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) (R DBM) and a susceptible field-insectarium population of P. xylostella (S DBM). R DBM displayed 18.3-fold resistance to methamidophos and 74.0-fold resistance to avermectin. The population growth tendency index (1) values were 41.8 (S DBM) and 27.7 (R DBM) at 25 degrees C, and 1.19 (S DBM) and 0.23 (R DBM) at 33.5 degrees C. The level of methamidophos resistance in the progenies of R DBM declined sharply when reared at high temperature for one generation. The increase of susceptibility to methamidophos appeared to pass from generation to generation. S DBM displayed higher up-regulation of Hsp70 expression at high temperature than R DBM. It was suggested that low fitness in R DBM caused by high temperature might be involved in the sharp decline of methamidophos resistance under high temperature conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Chromosome set manipulation and sex control in common carp: a review
VL  - 16
IS  - 5
SP  - 408-415
AB  - The development of techniques for production of gynogenetic, androgenetic, polyploid, and monosex progenies in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) is described from a chronological perspective. Gynogenetic progenies were obtained either by suppression of the second meiotic division in eggs (meiotic gynogenesis) or by suppression of the first mitotic division in haploid embryos (mitotic gynogenesis). As a rule, gynogenetic progenies of common carp were all-female, revealing female homogamety (females-XX, males-XY) in this species. Induced gynogenesis results in increased homozygosity; the rate of increase depends on the type of gynogenesis. Inbreeding coefficient (F) for one generation of meiotic gynogenesis in common carp is about 0.6, while diploids obtained by mitotic gynogenesis are homozygous for all genes (F = 1.0). Mitotic gynogenesis was used for production of clones in common carp. In androgenetic progenies of common carp, YY males were identified, that after crossing with normal females (XX) produced all-male progenies. Triploids of common carp are characterized by a significant reduction in gonad development (especially ovaries). However, the reduction in gonad development did not result in an increase of somatic growth rate of fish. The procedure for androgen treatment to induce phenotypic sex reversal in genotypic females (XX) was elaborated. All-female progenies of common carp were produced on a large scale by crossing normal females (XX) with hormonally sex-reversed males (XX). Rearing of all-female progenies in conditions when fish normally reach sexual maturity before reaching of market size increased production yield by 7-8%. In a few cases distant hybridization resulted in polyploidy of fish without application of any physical treatment. The ability of hybrid females between crucian carp (Carassius auratus) and common carp to produce diploid (with unreduced chromosome number) gametes resulted in opportunities to produce triploid and tetraploid hybrid progenies.

TI  - Latitudinal variation in Dendroctonus ponderosae (Coleoptera : Scolytidae) development time and adult size
VL  - 133
IS  - 3
SP  - 375-387
AB  - Dendroctonus ponderosae (Hopkins) is widely distributed across western North America, feeding in at least 12 native species of Pinus L. (Pinaceae). We investigated the existence of heritable differences in two life-history parameters (adult size and development time) of D. ponderosae from a northern population (central Idaho, Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon) and a southern population (southern Utah, Pinus ponder osa Douglas ex P. and C. Lawson). We attempted to separate heritable from environmental effects by rearing individuals from both populations through two generations (F-1 and F-2) in a common standardized laboratory environment with a constant temperature. Two treatment effects were tested for in the F-2 generation: (I) geographic location (source host) for F-0 D. porderosae; and (2) the F-2 brood host. We hypothesized that, if differences were observed and the F-0 source host and region had a greater effect on F-2 brood development time and adult size than did the host in which F-2 brood were reared, a heritable factor related to the F-0 parents was responsible. Time to emergence was significantly shorter for second-generation offspring of the northern population than for second-generation offspring of the southern population, regardless of the F-2 brood host. Although both the F-2 brood host and F-0 source parents were significant in explaining differences observed in the developmental-time distribution of F-2 brood, the F-0 source effect was round to be much greater. Also, F-2 males and females from southern source parents were sig nificantly larger than F-2 brood from northern source parents when reared in both F-2 brood hosts. Geographic region and original host of F-0 source parents had a significant effect on F-2 offspring size, whereas the immediate food for F-2 brood was not significant in explaining differences. These results suggest genetically based regional differences in D. ponderosae populations.

TI  - Evolution of thermal tolerance and phenotypic plasticity under rapid and slow temperature fluctuations
VL  - 289
IS  - 1980
AB  - Global warming is associated with an increase in sea surface temperature and its variability. The consequences of evolving in variable, fluctuating environments are explored by a large body of theory: when populations evolve in fluctuating environments the frequency of fluctuations determines the shapes of tolerance curves (indicative of habitats that organisms can inhabit) and trait reaction norms (the phenotypes that organisms display across these environments). Despite this well-established theoretical backbone, predicting how trait and tolerance curves will evolve in organisms at the foundation of marine ecosystems remains a challenge. Here, we used a globally distributed phytoplankton, Thalassiosira pseudonana, and show that fluctuations in temperature on scales of 3-4 generations rapidly selected for populations with enhanced trait plasticity and elevated thermal tolerance. Fluctuations spanning 30-40 generations selected for the formation of two stable, genetically and physiologically distinct populations, one evolving high trait plasticity and enhanced thermal tolerance, and the other, akin to samples evolved under constant warming, with lower trait plasticity and a smaller increase in thermal tolerance.

TI  - Big dams and salmon evolution: changes in thermal regimes and their potential evolutionary consequences
VL  - 1
IS  - 2
SP  - 286-299
AB  - Dams designed for hydropower and other purposes alter the environments of many economically important fishes, including Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We estimated that dams on the Rogue River, the Willamette River, the Cowlitz River, and Fall Creek decreased water temperatures during summer and increased water temperatures during fall and winter. These thermal changes undoubtedly impact the behavior, physiology, and life histories of Chinook salmon. For example, relatively high temperatures during the fall and winter should speed growth and development, leading to early emergence of fry. Evolutionary theory provides tools to predict selective pressures and genetic responses caused by this environmental warming. Here, we illustrate this point by conducting a sensitivity analysis of the fitness consequences of thermal changes caused by dams, mediated by the thermal sensitivity of embryonic development. Based on our model, we predict Chinook salmon likely suffered a decrease in mean fitness after the construction of a dam in the Rogue River. Nevertheless, these demographic impacts might have resulted in strong selection for compensatory strategies, such as delayed spawning by adults or slowed development by embryos. Because the thermal effects of dams vary throughout the year, we predict dams impacted late spawners more than early spawners. Similar analyses could shed light on the evolutionary consequences of other environmental perturbations and their interactions.

TI  - Supportive breeders of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar have reduced fitness in nature
VL  - 1
IS  - 9
AB  - Wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are in decline over the entire distribution area, and populations are enhanced by supportive breeding. Parental fish are sampled in rivers, crossed and the offspring reared in hatcheries until smolting when released, ready for ocean migration. Naturally reproducing salmon entering the River Imsa from the ocean were monitored from 1976 through 2013, and since 1982, supportive breeders spawning in the river were also monitored. The supportive breeders were first-generation salmon, reared for 1-2 years in a hatchery before being released at the mouth of the river so they could migrate to sea (i.e., sea-ranching). Wild and sea-ranched salmon live in the ocean for 1-2 years before they return to the river for spawning. In years when only wild adults were present, mean number of smolts produced per 100 m(2) river area and female breeder was 0.47. When there were 5% wild females, the mean production was only 0.088 (19%). The gradual decrease in offspring production with decreasing proportion of wild females (r(2) = .41) indicates that the reduced offspring production was caused by inferior spawning behavior of hatchery females or reduced survival of their offspring in nature. Previous experimental evidence suggests that wild males fertilize the eggs of wild but also hatchery females. It is discussed how epigenetic effects caused by hatchery environments influence the developing juveniles, lead to phenotypic changes that may reduce their fitness in nature even after free ranging for a year or more in the ocean before they return and spawn.

TI  - Evolutionary impact assessment of the North Sea plaice fishery
VL  - 73
IS  - 7
SP  - 1126-1137
AB  - There is growing evidence that fishing causes evolution in life-history traits that affect the productivity of fish stocks. Here we explore the impact of fisheries-induced evolution (FIE) on the productivity of North Sea plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) using an ecogenetic, individual-based model by comparing management scenarios with and without an evolutionary response. Under status-quo management, plaice evolve towards smaller size at age, earlier maturation, and higher reproductive investment. Current reference points of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and corresponding fishing-mortality rate (FMSY) that ignore FIE will decrease and cannot be considered sustainable. The nature and extent of the change through FIE depend on fishing effort and selectivity. The adverse evolutionary effects can be reduced - and even reversed - by implementing a dome-shaped exploitation pattern protecting the large fish. The evolutionarily sustainable maximum yield can be obtained by combining such a dome-shaped exploitation pattern with a reduction in fishing mortality and an increase in mesh size; it is similar to the MSY that would apply if life-history traits were static. Fisheries managers will need to trade off the short-term loss in yield associated with evolutionarily informed management with the long-term loss in yield FIE causes under evolutionarily uninformed management.

TI  - Effect of Prolonged Coldness on Survival and Fertility of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 9
IS  - 3
AB  - The laboratory fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is used widely in biological research, but the requirement to maintain stocks with a roughly biweekly generation time imposes substantial burdens of labor, potential cross-contamination and mutation accumulation. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of prolonged cold stress or milder cooling on survivorship and fertility. The hypothesis was that cold storage would result in postponement of reproduction and a longer generation time. Flies of several genotypes were maintained continuously at 4-11 degrees C; recovery rates and subsequent yields of adult progeny were recorded. Adults and pupae of a relatively long-lived y w lineage were more resistant to severe cold stress than embryos and larvae. Adults exhibited minimal mortality up to at least 5 d at 4 degrees C, 20 d at 8 degrees C and 12 weeks at 11 degrees C. Reproduction did not occur at these temperatures, but progeny were obtained after recovery at 25 degrees C. At all temperatures, chilling caused a rapid, severe and progressive decrease in fertility during the first 2 d of recovery. The impact on fertility during the subsequent 2-4 d was much milder and it occurred only after prolonged incubation at low temperatures. The total reproductive output during the first 6 d of recovery was sufficient to replace the parental population after 12 weeks at 11 degrees C. Food spoilage had an unexpectedly low impact on survivorship and fertility, and the reproductive output of F1 progeny was not affected by storing parental flies at 11 degrees C for 8-10 weeks. In the case of w(1118) flies, replacement of the parents within 6 d of recovery was possible for up to 60 d at 11 degrees C. Among less fertile genotypes, replacement of the parents was possible within 18 d after 4-10 weeks at 11 degrees C. These results show that the 2-week maintenance interval of stocks of D. melanogaster can be extended 3-7 fold, at least for 1 generation, by storing adult flies at 11 degrees C.

TI  - Ontogenetic stage-dependent effect of temperature on developmental and metabolic rates in a holometabolous insect
VL  - 56
IS  - 11
SP  - 1679-1684
AB  - Different hypotheses attempt to explain how different stages of organisms with complex life cycles respond to environmental changes. Most studies have focused at the among-species level showing similar responses to temperature throughout ontogeny. However, there is no agreement about the pattern expected at the intraspecific scale where a strong selective effect is expected. In this paper, we studied the effects of thermal treatments on a life history trait (developmental rate) and a physiological trait (metabolic rate) during development in the fruitfly Drosophila buzzatii. First, we estimated the rate of development during larval life (LDR) and the pupal stage (PDR) in flies derived from two natural populations exposed to several thermal treatments. Our results showed that the developmental rate ratio, LDR/PDR, did not vary between populations, and that the effects of thermal treatments were stage specific. Second, we studied the relationship between developmental rate (DR) and metabolic rate (MR) in each life cycle stage. We found that allometric relationships between DR and MR varied throughout ontogeny, a pattern that shed light on the mechanisms responsible for thermal plasticity. We conclude that, although different populations may show developmental rate isomorphy; larvae and pupae may choose alternative "decisions" in terms of life-history evolution and physiological traits when confronted to different thermal environments.

AB  - The effect of cold storage at 0.5,5, 10 and 13degreesC on the developmental rates and survival of the pteromalid parasitoids Muscidifurax raptor Girault & Sanders, Muscidifurax zaraptor Kogan & Legner, and Trichomalopsis sarcophagae Gahan was examined in the laboratory. Immature M. raptor underwent development at 13degreesC, but not at 10, 5, or 0.5degreesC. Immature M. zaraptor and T sarcophagae did not develop at temperatures ranging from 0.5 to 13degreesC. Parasitoid survival varied among storage temperatures and was lowest at 0.5degreesC for M. raptor and M. zaraptor and highest at 10degreesC. Survival of T.sarcophagae was highest at 5degreesC and was higher than either species of Muscidifurax at temperatures less than or equal to5degreesC. M. raptor had the highest survival at 10 and 13degreesC. A simple model was used to examine the effects of cold storage and stockpiling parasitoids for tip to three generations on parasitoid availability. Storage of M. raptor at 10degreesC for three generations could result in a 3.5-fold increase in availability. Storage of M, zaraptor at 10degreesC could result in a 2.6-fold increase in availability, and storage of T sarcophagae at 5degreesC could result in a 3.2-fold increase in availability. Results suggest that cold storage could be a useful method for increasing the rearing efficiency of these parasitoids.

TI  - Population dynamics of Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae): application of a biophysical model to understand phenological variation in an agricultural pest
VL  - 108
IS  - 3
SP  - 283-294
AB  - Understanding pest population dynamics and seasonal phenology is a critical component of modern integrated pest-management programs. Accurate forecasting allows timely, cost-effective interventions, including maximum efficacy of, for example, biological control and/or sterile insect technique. Due to the variation in life stage-related sensitivity toward climate, insect pest population abundance models are often not easily interpreted or lack direct relevance to management strategies in the field. I sere we apply a process-based (biophysical) model that incorporates climate data with life stage-dependent physiology and life history to attempt to predict Eldana saccharina life stage and generation turnover in sugarcane fields. Fitness traits are modelled at two agricultural locations in South Africa that differ in average temperature (hereafter a cold and a warm site). We test whether the life stage population structures in the field entering winter and local climate during winter directly affect development rates, and therefore interact to determine the population dynamics and phenological responses of E. saccharina in subsequent spring and summer seasons. The model predicts that: (1) E. saccharina can cycle through more generations at the warm site where fewer hours of cold and heat stress are endured, and (2) at the cold site, overwintering as pupae (rather than larvae) confer higher relative fitness and fecundity in the subsequent summer adult moths. The model predictions were compa red with a large dataset of field observations from scouting records. Model predictions for larval presence (or absence) generally overlapped well with positive (or negative) scout records. These results are important for integrated pest management strategies by providing a useful foundation for future population dynamics models, and are applicable to a variety of agricultural landscapes, but especially the sugarcane industry of South Africa.

VL  - 49

SP  - 651-659
AB  - Water loss rate, percentage total body water content (%TBW), cuticular permeability (CP), and desiccation tolerance were investigated in adult and immature stages of the invasive kudzu bug, Megacopta cribraria (Fab.) (Hemiptera: Plataspidae), a serious soybean pest and an urban nuisance. Adults and all five nymphal instars were weighed prior to and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 24 h after desiccated at 30 +/- 1 degrees C and 0-2% RH. Both % initial mass and %TBW loss increased linearly with time of desiccation. Rates of loss ranged from approximately 1-7%/h. Mortality occurred at 10 h after desiccation. Desiccation tolerance (%TBW lost at death) ranged between 25.6% for first-generation adult females and 75% for first-generation fifth-instar nymphs. First-generation first-instar nymphs had significantly greater %TBW (88.9%) than the other generations and instars, whereas second-generation fifth instars had the lowest %TBW (62.4%). The CP value of first-generation adult females (12.3 +/- 1.6 mu g cm(-1) h(-1) mmHg(-1)) was the greatest across generations. First-generation first instars had the greatest mass loss (111.11 mg/g) among all instars and generations, whereas overwintered second-generation adult females had the lowest mass loss (18.39) across generations.This study demonstrated that desiccation stress differentially affected the survival of adult and nymphal kudzu bugs and may imply that environmental stress can affect the relative abundance of this species in the fields and around homes.

TI  - Transgenerational exposure to marine heatwaves ameliorates the lethal effect on tropical copepods regardless of predation stress
VL  - 12
IS  - 8
AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are emerging as a severe stressor in marine ecosystems. Extreme warm sea surface temperatures during MHWs often exceed the optimal thermal range for more than one generation of tropical coastal zooplankton. However, it is relatively unknown whether transgenerational plasticity (TGP) to MHWs may shape the offspring's fitness, particularly in an ecologically relevant context with biotic interactions such as predation stress. We addressed these novel research questions by determining the survival, reproductive success, and grazing rate of the copepod Pseudodiaptomus incisus exposed to MHW and fish predator cues (FPC) for two generations (F1 and F2). The experiment was designed in a full orthogonal manner with 4 treatments in F1 and 16 treatments in F2 generation. In both generations, MHW reduced P. incisus survival, reproductive parameters, and grazing by 10%-62% in MHW, but these parameters increased by 2%-15% with exposure to FPC, particularly at control temperature. F2 reproductive success and grazing rate as indicated by cumulative fecal pellets were reduced by 20%-30% in F1-MHW, but increased by similar to 2% in F1-FPC. Strikingly, MHW exposure reduced 17%-18% survival, but transgenerational exposure to MHWs fully ameliorated its lethal effect and this transgenerational effect was independent of FPC. Increased survival came with a cost of reduced reproductive success, constrained by reduced grazing. The rapid transgenerational MHW acclimation and its associated costs are likely widespread and crucial mechanisms underlying the resilience of coastal tropical zooplankton to MHWs in tropical coastal marine ecosystems.

TI  - Contrasts in Habitat Characteristics and Life History Patterns of Oncorhynchus mykiss in California's Central Coast and Central Valley
VL  - 141
IS  - 3
SP  - 747-760
AB  - Oncorhynchus mykiss exhibit high plasticity in their life history patterns. Individual life history decisions are hypothesized to result from genetic thresholds shaped by local adaptation, with variation in environmental factors influencing the trajectories of growth and condition (e.g., Fulton's K, lipid content). We compared growth rates and life history patterns in two coastal creeks (Scott and Soquel) and two Central Valley (CV) rivers (American and Mokelumne) in California. The two regions differed markedly in habitat and physical factors, including hydrograph timing and amplitude, temperature regime, and food availability (measured as drift). Growth rates of coastal age-0 fish averaged 0.1 mm/d in summer-fall and 0.2 mm/d in winter-spring. Growth rates of CV fish were up to 10 times faster than those of fish on the coast and had the opposite seasonal pattern, in which growth in summer-fall was faster than that in winter-spring. Fish growth also differed between CV rivers; the mean growth rates were 1.0 mm/d in summer-fall and 0.7 mm/d in winter-spring among American River fish and 0.7 mm/d in summer-fall and 0.5 mm/d in winter-spring among Mokelumne River fish. The life history expression and age structures of O. mykiss in the coastal creeks were similar, with populations being dominated by age-0 fish but including mature residents up to age 6. The two CV populations were strikingly different in life history expression. In the American River, a single cohort was present and nearly all fish emigrated in the spring following their birth year. In the Mokelumne River, a broad diversity of ages (up to 4 years) was present, with a large proportion of presumed residents. The observed variation in life histories aligned with predictions based on state-dependent life history models developed for the four streams, further demonstrating the adaptability of O. mykiss to contrasting rearing environments.

VL  - 30
IS  - 3
SP  - 442-452
AB  - 1. Thermal tolerance influences the distribution and abundance of many species, but the adaptive capacity of species to increase upper thermal tolerance is poorly understood. Given that patterns of heat tolerance can strongly depend on assay method, it is crucial to get a better understanding of genetic variances and correlations among different heat tolerance components. 2. This study tests for correlated responses in different heat tolerance assays in Drosophila melanogaster lines selected for increased heat tolerance following exposure to a static high temperature. Traits tested included heat tolerance measured under static (basal and hardened) and ramping assays (using different starting temperatures and ramping rates), with lines exposed to fluctuating conditions (3days of a cycling temperature regime) and a variable food treatment. 3. Selected lines had higher heat tolerance than control lines in all static and ramping assays. The upper thermal tolerance was up to 0.5 degrees C higher in the selected compared to control lines after ten generations of strong selection. 4. Selection using a static assay therefore leads to correlated responses in other heat-resistant components, suggesting that traits are genetically correlated and not influenced strongly by assay conditions. 5. While the D.melanogaster population we studied harboured additive genetic variation to evolve increased upper thermal tolerance, the level detected may be insufficient to keep up with temperature increases predicted under climate change.

TI  - Biomass gasification for decentralized power generation: The Indian perspective
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SP  - 73-92
AB  - This article attempts to highlight the technical and economical issues related to decentralized power generation in India using biomass gasification. Biomass-based energy has several distinct advantages such as wide availability and uniform distribution that puts it ahead among the renewable energy options for India. The estimated potential of power generation through renewable sources in India is 85 GW with biomass power contributing approximately 20 GW. Especially, in the remote areas and hilly terrains of India, biomass gasification-based power generation offers a highly viable solution for meeting energy demands of small villages and hamlets, which would not only make them independent but will also reduce burden on state electricity boards. This paper reviews various technical options for biomass gasification-based low-, medium- and large-scale power generation. We essentially discuss the merits and demerits (operational and other problems) of different systems. Further, we also deal with economics of these systems and discuss principal factors influencing the viability of the biomass-based power generation. Finally, we review some case studies of biomass-based power generation for meeting energy needs, both thermal and electrical. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Hydrokinetic turbines for power generation in Nigerian river basins
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SP  - 71-80
AB  - This work presents a design for Hydrokinetic Renewable Energy (HRE), for off grid power generation for remote riverine regions in developing nations. The uniqueness of this technique for power generation using streams and other marine currents to generate electric energy is detailed. The problem of the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, rapid increase in human population, industries, modernization and our lifestyle put immense pressure on most power generation plants and infrastructures. Thus, global warming and carbon footprints of using fossil fuels to generate energy has driven the interest for energy generation from renewable sources. The Upper River Benue and Lower River Niger coastal basins, as well as the River Niger Basin on the Lower Niger sub-basin area of southeastern Nigeria was selected as a case study for the design of the hydrokinetic power generation technology. The results show that for a hydrokinetic turbine the level of power output is directly proportional to the flow velocity. Therefore the cost of its installation is reduced drastically from about $7,900 per installed kW to about $2,500 per kW, is easily assessable, less technical and a familiar motor technology for most of these communities. It is also a predictable form of energy in comparison to other emerging renewable energy fields like wind, solar and wave. Also this form of renewable energy is less harmful to the environment, has a lower noise emission and produces no greenhouse gases or any solid waste. HRE will bring energy security that is essential for the riverine dweller and curb rural urban migration and both improves the rural communities' standard of living and enhances their productivity.

TI  - The cumulative impacts of climate change on Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and implications for management
VL  - 68
IS  - 4
SP  - 718-737
AB  - Anadromous Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) are vulnerable to climate change in both freshwater and marine habitats. I use a qualitative model to assess the cumulative effects of climate change across life stages and generations of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and other salmon species. The effects of climate change most relevant to Fraser River sockeye include warming of freshwater and marine habitats, altered hydrology in spawning rivers, reduced productivity in nursery habitats, and changed distribution and phenology of predator and prey species. The weight of evidence indicates that these changes will negatively affect growth and survival of Fraser River sockeye at all life stages. Effects on one life stage will also carry forward to heighten adverse effects at subsequent life stages and across generations so that the cumulative impact is greater than the impact on individual stages. Salmon can adapt to climate change but probably not enough to sustain productivity. In the south, focus of policy and management on conserving and enhancing resilience is needed to retain some salmon production. At the same time, Arctic habitats are becoming accessible to salmon. Management in the Arctic should protect potentially productive habitats from development and facilitate their colonization by Pacific salmon.

VL  - 22

AB  - 1. Features of life history strategies of Antarctic terrestrial invertebrates are reviewed and compared with the predictions of two widely-used general life history models. 2. Many Features observed are consistent with the predictions of "adversity-" or "stress-selected" life histories, although "ruderal" characteristics are also observed. 3. Many features are plesiotypic for the taxonomic groups concerned, suggesting a lack of evolved adaptations within the Antarctic biota. 4. A large degree of flexibility is found in the life histories; this flexibility itself may allow passage of environmentally-imposed selective filters limiting colonisation and development in isolated and extreme terrestrial habitats. 5. In general. Antarctic terrestrial invertebrates may be regarded as pre-adapted for survival of the various stresses imposed by their extreme environment. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

VL  - 8

SP  - 7014-7021
AB  - Organismal performance in a changing environment is dependent on temporal patterns and duration of exposure to thermal variability. We experimentally assessed the time-dependent effects of thermal variability (i.e., patterns of thermal exposure) on the hatching performance of Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were collected in central Chile and maintained for four generations in laboratory conditions. Fourth generation eggs were acclimated to different thermal fluctuation cycles until hatching occurred. Our results show that the frequency of extreme thermal events has a significant effect on hatching success. Eggs exposed to 24hr cycles of thermal fluctuation had a higher proportion of eggs that hatched than those acclimated to shorter (6 and 12hr) and longer cycles (48hr). Furthermore, eggs subjected to frequent thermal fluctuations hatched earlier than those acclimated to less frequent thermal fluctuations. Overall, we show that, egg-to-adult viability is dependent on the pattern of thermal fluctuations experienced during ontogeny; thus, the pattern of thermal fluctuation experienced by flies has a significant and until now unappreciated impact on fitness.

TI  - Optimisation of marker assisted selection for abalone breeding programs
VL  - 265
IS  - 1
SP  - 61-69
AB  - A computer simulation model was used to optimise strategies for marker assisted selection with best linear unbiased prediction (MBLUP) for quantitative traits in a selective breeding program for the southern Australian abalone industry. The simulation model assumed five marker loci associated with genes affecting growth rate explained 50% of the genetic variance for this trait. Use of markers associated with improved disease resistance was also modelled. Parameters and simulation scheme used are described. The simulations accounted for the possibility of early induction of reproductive condition to reduce generation intervals and for selective genotyping. Affects on profitability were calculated using estimates from the industry of income and expenses for a typical farm and accounting for the costs associated with marker testing. While the extra genetic gains from MAS were in the order of 15%, if the cost of genotyping each marker per animal was $10 AUS, then M BLUP for growth was only profitable when 75 progeny per family were genotyped. Early selection (halving the generation interval) was advantageous for MBLUP and BLUP provided the number of progeny per family was greater 5, as the advantage of two generations of selection more than compensated for the decreased accuracy of selection for early growth. However accurate estimates of parameters, such as the genetic correlation between early growth rate and growth and age at first spawning, would need to be obtained before considering implementing this strategy. The advantage of MBLUP was greater for disease resistance than for growth rate. Selective genotyping, which would greatly reduced genotyping costs of implementing MBLUP to improve disease resistance, did not greatly reduce the additional response achieved with marker assisted selection.

TI  - Development and performance evaluation of a single stage travelling-wave thermo-acoustic generator
SP  - 174-179
AB  - Thermo-acoustic systems are being considered as a potential solution for electricity generation. This work describes the construction of a single stage travelling-wave thermo-acoustic generator. Secondly, an experimental investigation into the effect of the heat source on the potential of the device for electricity generation is performed. The magnitude of the sound generated by the engine, the onset time and the magnitude of electricity generated by the linear alternator have been considered as performance indicators for the device developed. This paper provides clarity on the potential for thermo-acoustic system for sound-to-electricity conversion. Clear trends showing the effect of inputs parameters on device performance have been disclosed. The minimum/maximum amount of heat that has produced a sound was 339/634 degrees C corresponding to sound of 114.0/114.13 dB and a voltage of 278/319 mV. Although the efficiency of the sound-to -electricity conversion was low, this work proves the viability of thermo-acoustic as the alternative solution for electricity generation.

TI  - Effects of inbreeding and environmental stress on fitness - using Drosophila buzzatii as a model organism
VL  - 4
IS  - 4
SP  - 453-465
AB  - Wild endangered populations can suffer from adverse effects on fitness due to inbreeding and environmental stress. Often, both genetic and environmental stress factors may be present in populations at the same time. Therefore knowledge on the potential interactions between these factors is important for the conservation of wild populations. When measuring fitness (e. g. survival and reproductive potential) of individuals in the laboratory, and in nature, inbreeding by environment interactions are now being reported more often. The increased focus on environmental dependency of inbreeding depression will therefore enable conservation biologists to include this knowledge in the management of endangered populations in the wild. In this study, the effects of environmental stress and inbreeding on fitness are estimated in a laboratory population of Drosophila buzzatii. Random- or full-sib mating were used to generate independent replicate lines of four different inbreeding levels (F = 0, F = 0.25, F = 0.50, F = 0.672) in four different environments. The environments were thermal and dimethoate stress separately and in combination, as well as a non-stressful control environment. Two experiments were carried out to measure productivity (a multiplicative measure of fecundity and viability) using a full factorial design. In the first experiment, productivity was estimated for all lines and inbreeding levels in the environment in which flies were inbred and reared for several generations. In the second experiment, productivity of the lines reared in the control environment was tested in all four environments and for all inbreeding levels. Our results show a significant effect of inbreeding and environmental stress on productivity in both experiments and the effect increased when flies were exposed to novel environmental conditions. Productivity was not affected by the interaction between inbreeding and environmental stress when flies were tested in the environments in which they were reared, whereas there was a tendency towards a stress by inbreeding interaction when flies were exposed to novel environments. The variance and the coefficient of variation in productivity were each affected by environmental stress and inbreeding, indicating that environmental conditions as well as genetic background are important for variation in productivity. However, the two measures of variation often showed opposite trends. The results obtained in this study indicate that the environmental conditions under which inbreeding occurs are important. This is relevant for the maintenance and management of populations in captivity and in relation to reintroduction of endangered species in nature.

AB  - In this paper, the thermodynamic investigation on the use of geothermal water (130 degrees C as maximum) for power generation through a basic Rankine has been presented together with obtained main results. Six typical organic working fluids (i.e., R245fa, R141b, R290, R600, R152a, and 134a) were studied with modifying the input pressure and temperature to the turbine. The results show that there are no significant changes taking place in the efficiency for these working fluids with overheating the inlet fluid to the turbine, i.e., efficiency is a weak function of temperature. However, with the increasing of pressure ratio in the turbine, the efficiency rises more sharply. The technical viability is shown of implementing this type of process for recovering low temperature heat resource.

TI  - Coupling of an individual-based population dynamic model of Calanus finmarchicus to a circulation model for the Georges Bank region
VL  - 7
IS  - 3
SP  - 219-234
AB  - An individual-based life history and population dynamic model for the winter-spring dominant copepod of the subarctic North Atlantic, Calanus Finmarchicus, is coupled with a regional model of advection for the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank. Large numbers of vectors, each representing individual copepods with elements for age, stage, ovarian status and other population dynamic variables, are carried in a computation through hourly time steps. Each vector is updated at each time step according to development rate and reproductive functions derived from experimental data. Newly spawned eggs are each assigned new vectors as needed. All vectors are subject to random mortality. Thus, Loch life history progression and population dynamics of C. finmarchius are represented for the temperatures in the Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank region in the active season. All vectors include elements representing depth, latitude and longitude. This allows coupling of the population dynamics to the tide- and wind-driven Dartmouth model of New England regional circulation. Summary data from the physical model are used to advance vectors from resting-stock locations in Gulf of Maine basins through two generations to sites of readiness for return to rest. Supply of Calanus stock to Georges Bank comes from all of the gulf and from the Scotian Shelf. The top of the bank is stocked from western gulf basins; the North-east Peak is stocked from Georges Basin and the Scotian Shelf. All sources contribute to stock that accumulates in the SCOPEX gyre off the north-west shoulder of Georges Bank, explaining the high abundance recurrently seen in that region. There is some return of resting stock to Wilkinson Basin in the western gulf, but other basins must mostly be restocked from upstream sources to the north-east.

VL  - 68

SP  - 195-202
AB  - A newly established culture method was evaluated for application in mass-propagation of a photoperiod-temperature sensitive genic male sterile rice strain. It was found that the new culture method was very efficient for the regeneration of plants from callus of this strain, and a high concentration of 6-benzyladenine necessary for highly efficient plant regeneration culture did not seem to have negative effects on some agronomic traits investigated of the regenerated plants and their progenies. By the new culture method, a large number of plants could be regenerated in a relatively short time (approximately 8x10(12) plants within 300 days) from one naked seed-explant. Because of this, prominent drift of the PTGMS rice strain, which accumulates gradually during the course of propagation of the seeds through generations, in the response to photoperiod-temperature conditions could be avoided when this in vitro culture protocol is employed instead of seed propagation. Differences in rates of pollen fertility and seed setting were found between regenerated plants and seed-grown plants, and between their respective first and second progenies. These differences are also of important application value in two-line rice production: Higher pollen fertility of the regenerated plants can be applied with higher efficiency for the propagation of the strain seeds because they have much higher seed setting by self-fertilization; lower pollen fertility of the regenerated plant progenies will result in much lower seed setting by self-fertilization and is, therefore, conducive to the production of hybrid seeds of higher purity by natural crossing with the other line in the two-line system.

TI  - Economics of Implementing Solar Thermal Heating Systems in the Textile Industry
VL  - 15
IS  - 12
AB  - This paper analyzes the potential of solar thermal systems for being employed for process heating in cotton-based textile industries. The technological capability of a flat plate collector (FPC) to meet the solar industrial process heating (SIPH) requirement in yarn production is assessed. Moreover, the usability of a parabolic trough collector (PTC) in meeting the technological mandates of SIPH in fabric processing units is critically examined. Further, this paper reports the findings of a study on the potential cost advantage of solar process heating over the conventional process heating practices in cotton-based textile industries. The approach involves the selection of the locations of sample textile industries and the employable solar collector technologies, as well as assessment of financial reward, if any. Eight different cotton-based textile industries located in different geographical domains (in India) are selected. The selected textile industries are situated within the textile hubs existing in different states across India. Analysis of technoeconomic benefit derivable in selected textile industries using FPC for hot water generation and PTC for steam generation is presented. In the case of FPC-based SIPH systems, the maximum value of solar fraction is estimated to be 0.30 and the corresponding estimation for the levelized cost of useful thermal energy (LCUTE) delivered comes out as INR 790/GJ to INR 1020/GJ. On the other hand, in case of parabolic-trough-solar-concentrator-based SIPH systems, LCUTE is estimated in the range of INR 1030/GJ to INR 1610/GJ. From a critical analysis of financial viability in consideration of related factors such as payback time and return on investment in SIPH, it appears that the SIPH systems for hot water generation may be a good choice, whereas SIPH systems for steam generation are seen to have longer payback periods and lower returns on investment, and, therefore, it seems that adequate financial support from central and state governments with additional supports from bilateral or multilateral organizations may enable them to become a sustainable technology option.

TI  - Stock assessment for eastern oyster seed production and field grow-out in Louisiana
VL  - 466
SP  - 9-19
AB  - There is little information on the performance of oyster populations from Louisiana estuaries limiting the ability to choose stocks for hatchery seed production and field grow-out. The objectives of this study were therefore to compare the mortality, growth, dermo (Perkinsus marinus) infection intensity and condition index of the progeny of wild oysters collected from three Louisiana estuaries differing in salinity regime and oysters specifically selected for dermo resistance. Progeny were deployed in cages in the field, along a salinity gradient in coastal Louisiana. Overall, salinity and temperature had major impacts on the mortality, growth, dermo infection intensity and condition index of oysters of all four stocks and a few differences between stocks could be shown at some sites. At the lowest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Sister Lake, a low salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality suggesting enhanced tolerance to low salinity conditions compared to the other stocks. At the highest salinity site, the progeny of wild oysters from Lake Calcasieu, a high salinity estuarine lake, had the lowest mortality during summer concomitant with increasing dermo infection intensities suggesting a better resistance to dermo disease compared to the other wild stocks and confirming an earlier finding. This initial result suggests that the stocks used are genetically differentiated with respect to low salinity tolerance as well as dermo-related mortality at high salinity and that stock selection for aquaculture grow-out or restoration effort will benefit from being site-specific and dependent on the dominant environmental conditions. Statement of relevance: Assessment of eastern oyster stocks in Louisiana or other Gulf of Mexico estuaries for seed production and field grow-out is lacking. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 320
IS  - 1
SP  - 85-97
AB  - The extent to which dormancy in large freshwater branchiopods is controlled endogenously (diapause) or exogenously (quiescence) is not always clear. It is assumed that both processes occur even within the same brood. Based on the effectiveness of common diapause-deactivating processes such as desiccation, hibernation, and resting, it can be stated that diapause is not a general process controlling responsiveness of large freshwater branchiopod eggs. Only in limited cases unequivocal evidence for the positive influence of these treatments is found. With few exceptions, hatching of activated cysts is effected by specific conditions that may even differ among conspecific populations. Generally, each species (or even population) has a specific temperature range or regime for optimal hatching performance. In a suitable thermal environment with sufficient light and oxygen, hatching is invariably invoked by a low osmotic medium. The erratic hatching pattern in most species is thought to be an adaptation to the variable temporary habitat. Hatching is generally spread over several days or even weeks, but the highest peak usually occurs on the first or second day of hatching. Low hatching percentages were found only in subtropical/desert species and may be a reflection of the low chances for successful reproduction. Generation carry-over of propagules in the egg bank by dormancy, and hatching at low conductivity, are, together with obligate oviparity and absence of an asexual life cycle phase, thought to be highly adaptive to the temporary environment. This enabled large branchiopods to survive since the Upper Cambrian.

TI  - Four Transgenerational Demographic Performance of Moina macrocopa Exposed to Chronic Levels of Cadmium
VL  - 15
IS  - 3
AB  - In this study, we quantified intergenerational, demographic variability of Moina macrocopa subjected to cadmium stress. Exposure of M macrocopa to cadmium (0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mg/Las CdCl2) through 4 consecutive generations revealed changes in demographic responses not only in survivorship variables but also in reproductive parameters. Long-term demographic responses varied differently, depending on the demographic trait and the concentration of heavy metal in the medium. With the exception of generation time, all life history traits were significantly and adversely influenced due to increase in Cd concentrations. The average life span of M macrocopa varied up to 40% depending on Cd level and the generation of exposure. The highest gross reproductive rates were recorded in controls, while the lowest (similar to 30% less) were recorded at the highest Cd level. Survival-weighted net reproductive rates were reduced by nearly 50% due to Cd toxicity. The rate of population increase per day of M macrocopa was also significantly affected (similar to 25%) by Cd as compared to controls. This cladoceran showed a dose-response to Cd toxicity with a significance in both magnitude and frequency of offspring production.

VL  - 37
IS  - 1
SP  - 72-82
AB  - In the existing genetic sexing strains for the medfly, Ceratitis capitata, male recombination leads to breakdown of the sexing mechanism under mass rearing conditions. The rate of breakdown depends on the recombination frequency and on the fitness of the recombinants. We have tested two different sexing genes, white pupa and a temperature sensitive lethal, in combination with the translocation T(Y;5)30C. Both sexing strains broke down, although at very different rates. In the case of the white pupa strain, 3.5% recombinants were observed after rearing the strain for 15 generations. The second strain, utilizing white pupa and the temperature sensitive lethal as selectable markers, already reached a comparable level after six generations and was broken down completely in the ninth generation. In these strains the frequency of recombination is high because the breakpoint of T(Y;5)30C and the sexing gene(s) are far apart. To remedy the situation, we have isolated four new translocations with breakpoints located closer to the sexing genes. Mass rearing was simulated for several generations with strains based on these translocations and no breakdown was observed under the conditions used.

VL  - 98
IS  - 2
SP  - 526-536
AB  - Subsequent to their introduction in the 1950s, Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus have been able to establish a self-sustaining population that has adapted to the unique conditions of the sub-Antarctic Kerguelen Islands. Here, 48 individuals (198-415 mm) were caught with gillnets and their basic biology and feeding ecology were examined using stable isotope analysis. The Lac des Fougeres population split use of littoral and pelagic resources evenly, although larger fish relied more heavily on littoral production and appear to follow the size-dependent life history habitat template seen in many Scandinavian lakes where smaller sized individuals occupy the pelagic zone and larger individuals dominate the littoral habitat. In Kerguelen, Arctic charr mature at the same ages (5.6 years) as Arctic charr in both sub-Arctic and Arctic lakes. Although mortality was average in comparison to comparator sub-Arctic lakes, it was high in comparison to Arctic lakes. Maximal age (>7+) was at the lower end of the range typically seen in sub-Arctic lakes. Although they inhabit a resource-poor environment, Kerguelen Arctic charr showed no evidence of cannibalism. Thus, while Arctic charr can survive and reproduce in the relatively unproductive Kerguelen lake environments, survival and growth nevertheless appear to be traded off against survival and longevity. The uniqueness of the population location and the recency of its introduction suggest that further monitoring of the population has the potential to yield valuable insights into both the adaptability of the species and its likely responses to ongoing large-scale environmental change as represented by climate change.

VL  - 137
IS  - 2
SP  - 453-459
AB  - The paper reports experimental results concerning the influence of the support nature (TiO2, ZnO, Al2O3 and Al2O3-Fe2O3) of nickel catalysts on their activity, selectivity and coking phenomenon in the steam reforming of ethanol in the range of 570-870 K. The chemical transformations of ethanol occurring on the catalyst support make its chemical nature an important factor affecting the productivity and selectivity of the process. It was found that the most suitable supports in nickel catalysts designed for hydrogen generation in the steam reforming of ethanol are ZnO and TiO2. Taking into consideration both the efficiency of hydrogen generation and the intensity of carbon deposition, the optimum temperature of the process of the steam reforming of ethanol is below 750 K. An improvement in the selectivity of hydrogen generation and diminishing of the formation of undesirable products may be obtained by promoting nickel catalysts with sodium. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 25

SP  - 3183-3192
AB  - Organismal chemical tolerance is often used to assess ecological risk and monitor water quality, yet tolerance can differ between field- and lab-raised organisms. In this study, we examined how tolerance to copper (Cu) and tributyltin oxide (TBTO) in two species of marine copepods, Tigriopus japonicus and T. californicus, changed across generations under benign laboratory culture (in the absence of pre-exposure to chemicals). Both copepod species exhibited similar chemical-specific changes in tolerance, with laboratory maintenance resulting in increased Cu tolerance and decreased TBTO tolerance. To assess potential factors underlying these patterns, chemical tolerance was measured in conjunction with candidate environmental variables (temperature, UV radiation, diet type, and starvation). The largest chemical-specific effect was found for starvation, which decreased TBTO tolerance but had no effect on Cu tolerance. Understanding how chemical-specific tolerance can change in the laboratory will be critical in strengthening bioassays and their applications for environmental protection and chemical management.

TI  - Temperature and Natural Parasitism in the Population Dynamics of the Pear Pest Phyllonorycter corylifoliella Hb
SP  - 961-+
AB  - Phyllonorycter corylifoliella Hb. is one of the pests which has produced significant damage in Romanian pear orchards during the last few years. For this reason, knowledge of the thermal developmental constants, the determination of the degree day accumulation (DD) necessary for each stage of development and each generation and the role of the biotic factors in the dynamics of populations of this pest are of special importance. The development of P. corylifoliella Hb. occurs according to the formula of Savescu (1965). Thus, the threshold value is T-0=6 degrees C, the thermal constant K=630 degrees C, the prolificacy threshold value O=11 degrees C, the optimum thermal O-1=28,3 degrees C and the upper threshold T=31.1 degrees C. Of practical interest for the control of this pest are the degree day (DD) accumulated to the start of adult flights, the maximum of the flight curve and egg laying period. The medium values of these were: 21.5 degrees C and 157.3 degrees C for the overwintered generation (the 3(rd) generation), 423.7 degrees C, 807.9 degrees C and 37.71C for the 1(st) generation, 979.2 degrees C, 1790.6 degrees C and 46.9 degrees C for the 2(nd) generation. The average degree day (DD) accumulation, corresponding to each point of the insect phenology are: for the Is' generation - egg - 37.70 degrees C, larva 88.35 degrees C, pupa - 286.73 degrees C, adult 423.70 degrees C; for the 2(nd) generation - egg - 469.00 degrees C, larva - 628.98 degrees C, pupa - 850.13 degrees C, adult - 979.20 degrees C; for the 3(rd) generation - pupa 9.53 degrees C, adult - 21.48 degrees C. The main parasitoids identified were the Hymenoptera Apanteles circumscriptus, Holcothroax ss p. and Sympiesis ssp. The parasitism rate varied between 11 and 60%. A. circumscriptus gave the highest rate of parasitism.

AB  - One unit of Sardar Patel Renewable Energy Research Institute (SPRERI's) 1.25GJh(-1) capacity open core down draft gasifier burner system, suitable for thermal application was installed at M/s Dinesh Pharmaceutical Pvt. Ltd., Nandesari, for steam generation. Producer gas burner was used in dual fuel mode (60% LDO (light diesel oil) + 40% producer gas). Gasifier consumed 78-80 kg h(-1) of wood, and replaced 40% (201 h(-1)) LDO. The system was tested for a cumulative period of 600 h using sawmill woody waste as feedstock in test runs of 15-18 h. Financial analysis of the gasifier system showed that user could save about Rs. 221.8 per hour by using dual fuel (60% LDO + 40% producer gas) for steam generation. Economic analysis of the system tested in the field indicated the viability of the gasifier-based operation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 80

SP  - 406-421
AB  - In this study, we use the bacterium Escherichia coli to examine evolutionary responses to environmental acidity fluctuating temporally among pH 5.3, 6.3, 7.0, and 7.8 (5,000-15 nM [H+]). Two experimental protocols of temporal variation were used. One group (six replicate lines) of populations evolved for 2,000 generations during exposure to a cycled regime fluctuating daily between pH 5.3 and 7.8. The other group ( also in six replicate lines) evolved during exposure for 2,000 generations to a randomly shifting regime fluctuating stochastically each day among pH 5.3, 6.3, 7.0, and 7.8. Adaptation to these fluctuating acidity regimes was measured as a change in fitness relative to the common ancestor by direct competition experiments in both constant and fluctuating pH regimes. For comparisons with constant pH evolution, a group evolved at a constant pH of 5.3 and another group evolved at pH 7.8 were also tested. This study initiated the first long-term laboratory natural selection experiment on adaptation to variable acidity and addressed key questions concerning patterns of adaptation (trade-offs, specialists, generalists, plasticity, transitions, and acclimation) in temporally fluctuating environments.

VL  - 51
IS  - 4
SP  - 965-973
AB  - Trends in abundance of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) of the Nechako River, a tributary of the Fraser River, were analyzed to quantify the ecological effects of water abstraction for electricity generation. In years when the majority of returning chinook adults used the upper Nechako River for spawning, the survival of offspring for the entire river was poorer than in years when spawning was concentrated in the lower reaches. Relative to the historical discharge, the upper Nechako River has experienced the greatest degree of water abstraction, and the lower survival of chinook broods originating from the upper river may be due to early emergence of fry caused by elevated fall and winter water temperatures or to higher rates of predation on juveniles and loss of rearing habitat caused by the elimination of the spring freshet. Poor recruitment resulting from broods spawning predominately in the upper river has caused the trend in the abundance of Nechako River chinook to diverge from the trend of chinook populations of similar life history from unregulated tributaries of the Fraser River. Additional reductions in flow may further affect the capacity of the upper Nechako River to produce chinook salmon.

AB  - In this paper an alternative set-up generation system is developed for a tandem cold mill to be used during emergency operation in case of shut-down of the main operating mode. The system is based on a cost function that evaluates the mill quality and productivity for each set-up. This cost function is minimized using the Nelder and Mead simplex method. Despite to be simpler than the main set-up generation system, it is faster, more accurate and safer than the usual emergency mode, which is based on a set of tables.

VL  - 103

SP  - 101-108
AB  - Ocean acidification (OA), induced by rapid anthropogenic CO2 rise and its dissolution in seawater, is known to have consequences for marine organisms. However, knowledge on the evolutionary responses of phytoplankton to OA has been poorly studied. Here we examined the coccolithophore Gephyrocapsa oceanica, while growing it for 2000 generations under ambient and elevated CO2 levels. While OA stimulated growth in the earlier selection period (from generations similar to 700 to similar to 1550), it reduced it in the later selection period up to 2000 generations. Similarly, stimulated production of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen reduced with increasing selection period and decreased under OA up to 2000 generations. The specific adaptation of growth to OA disappeared in generations 1700 to 2000 when compared with that at 1000 generations. Both phenotypic plasticity and fitness decreased within selection time, suggesting that the species' resilience to OA decreased after 2000 generations under high CO2 selection. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Solar thermal power cycles assisted multi-stage flash brine recycle (MSF-BR) distillation process are thermo-economically analyzed and evaluated. In this work, the analyses are compared according to three different configurations via two techniques of solar thermal power cycles. The first technique is considered for only desalination process; however, the second is considered for desalination and electric power generation via organic Rankine cycle. Solar parabolic trough concentrator (PTC) field is considered to dominate sufficient thermal power for MSF plant. Water steam working fluid is used for a direct vapor generation (DVG); however, Therminol-VP1 working substance is used for an indirect vapor generation (IDVG) through the PTC field. Moreover, the optimized configuration from the first technique is compared with the power generation and desalination (the second technique). The comparisons are proceeding for the MSF-BR desalination plant with total productivity in the range of 5,000m(3)/d which the gain ratio is increased up to 12 with 40 stages. The thermo-economic results reveal that first technique achieves remarkable results related to the PTC area, the SPC, kWh/m(3), and the thermo-economic product cost, $/GJ.

TI  - Responses to Developmental Temperature Fluctuation in Life History Traits of Five Drosophila Species (Diptera: Drosophilidae) from Different Thermal Niches
VL  - 12
IS  - 10
AB  - Simple Summary Most laboratory experiments on insects to date have been conducted using constant temperature settings. Even when the purpose of the study was to investigate effects of temperature, insects have mostly been kept at different but constant temperatures ignoring natural variation in temperature. Here we investigated effects of simple daily temperature fluctuation (22.5/27.5 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C) on some development characteristics in five species of fruit flies (Drosophila) originating from areas with different temperature profiles. We demonstrated how species of the same genus can show substantial differences when developing at fluctuating temperatures not always predictable by development at comparable constant temperature (25 degrees C). Temperature has profound effects on biochemical processes as suggested by the extensive variation in performance of organisms across temperatures. Nonetheless, the use of fluctuating temperature (FT) regimes in laboratory experiments compared to constant temperature (CT) regimes is still mainly applied in studies of model organisms. We investigated how two amplitudes of developmental temperature fluctuation (22.5/27.5 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C, 12/12 h) affected several fitness-related traits in five Drosophila species with markedly different thermal resistance. Egg-to-adult viability did not change much with temperature except in the cold-adapted D. immigrans. Developmental time increased with FT among all species compared to the same mean CT. The impact of FT on wing size was quite diverse among species. Whereas wing size decreased quasi-linearly with CT in all species, there were large qualitative differences with FT. Changes in wing aspect ratio due to FT were large compared to the other traits and presumably a consequence of thermal stress. These results demonstrate that species of the same genus but with different thermal resistance can show substantial differences in responses to fluctuating developmental temperatures not predictable by constant developmental temperatures. Testing multiple traits facilitated the interpretation of responses to FT in a broader context.

SP  - 153-157
AB  - The evaluation of utilizing corn cob as a primary energy resource for electricity generation in Northern Thailand was described. Maize is one of the main crops produced in all provinces of the territory. The productivity of maize is over 2,000,000 ton/year. Therefore, more than 9,000 GJ/ of energy can be obtained from this agricultural residue annually. In this study, an equilibrium model was developed for evaluation purposes. The effect of moisture content and gasification temperature was also discussed. Besides, the derating of the engine utilized with producer gas was also calculated.

VL  - 125

SP  - 179-184
AB  - The effects of global warming on the life cycle and life-history traits of the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae), were investigated in Fukui, Japan. Our previous studies showed that the Fukui population had a predominantly bivoltine life cycle, but recently the life cycle has changed. In the present study, the life-history traits of individuals collected in 2002 in Fukui were clarified and compared to those in the previous studies. The lower threshold temperature for development and the thermal constant for one generation were 10.6 degrees C and 724.4 degree days, respectively. Although these developmental parameters were not investigated in the previous studies, the difference of the developmental period between the present and previous results was negligible in the larval and pupal stages at 20 degrees C. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction was 14 h 29 min at 20 degrees C and 14 h 10 min at 25 degrees C. The critical photoperiod at 25 degrees C was shortened to 14 min from that of the previous studies for individuals collected in 1995. The incidence of pupal diapause in the second generation was investigated in individuals that were collected as fourth and fifth instars in the field. Some portion of individuals averted diapause even if they were kept under a short photoperiod of L14:D10 at 25 degrees C after collection. These results, together with climate data and field observations in Fukui, suggest that at least a part of the population has three generations per year at present. This shift of the life cycle occurred within 7 years and is probably related to global warming in recent years.

AB  - The effects of climate change on the northern limit of the trivoltine area were clarified in the fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (Drury) (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae). The Takaoka and Kanazawa populations used in the present study occur in locations to the north of Fukui (36.07 degrees N), where H. cunea has recently shifted from a bivoltine to a predominantly trivoltine life cycle. The life-history traits of these populations were investigated and compared to those in the Fukui population. The lower threshold temperature for development and the thermal constant for one generation were 11.3 degrees C and 674.5 degrees d in the Takaoka population, and 11.2 degrees C and 680.7 degrees d in the Kanazawa population. The critical photoperiod for diapause induction at 25 degrees C was 14 h 34 min in the Takaoka population and 14 h 28 min in the Kanazawa population. These critical photoperiods at 25 degrees C were longer by 24 min and 18 min than the Fukui population, respectively. These results, together with climate data, suggest that the Takaoka population maintains a bivoltine life cycle, and a small part of the Kanazawa population has three generations per year, a predominantly bivoltine life cycle. Thus, the present northern limit of the trivoltine area lies around Fukui in districts along the Japan Sea.

TI  - Perennial tree pruning biomass waste exploitation for electricity generation: The perspective of Greece
VL  - 31
SP  - 77-85
AB  - Today's electricity generation relies heavily on fossil fuels. Emissions of conventional thermal power plants affect adversely air quality and intensify the greenhouse effect. Renewable energy technologies for electricity generation present perhaps a possible alternative. The purpose of this research is to investigate the viability of electricity generation using agricultural biomass residues from both a techno-economic and an environmental perspective. The biomass residues considered in this work concern tree pruning in nine different geographically dispersed prefectures of the Greek territory. An integrated methodology is proposed for assessing the potential of tree pruning biomass fired power plants. A systematic sensitivity analysis is also carried out in order to examine the effect of various economic parameter values on investment recovery time. It is shown that an increase in energy sale prices and/or a reduction in either the investment cost or the 'bio-fuel' price are crucial for the sustainable operation of biomass fired power plants in the country. Calculated results, based on real-world data, show that the direct combustion of pruning residues for electricity generation is very beneficial not only by economizing fossil fuels and providing new income opportunities, but also by leading to a low CO2 power generation.

TI  - Application of JAYA Algorithm to Tune Fuzzy-PIDF Controller for Automatic Generation Control
SP  - 94-98
AB  - Fuzzy-PID controller with derivative filter (Fuzzy-PIDF) is suggested in this article for automatic generation control in a two area multi-unit hydro thermal system. The controller scaling coefficients are tuned with a simple and a new powerful optimization technique called JAYA algorithm. Integral time absolute error (ITAE) is used as a fitness function to achieve the optimal parameters of the Fuzzy-PIDF controller with an abrupt load disturbance of 0.01p.u. applied in area 1. Further, this controller is scrutinized for robustness by increasing the loading in the system. The dynamic responses of this implemented controller being optimized by JAYA algorithm are evaluated and compared with the results of previously published article such as hybrid firefly algorithm and pattern search technique based PID controller in terms of peak undershoot, overshoot and settling time and supremacy is proved.

VL  - 26

SP  - 150-159
AB  - Salmon from different locations in a watershed can have different life histories. It is often unclear to what extent this variation is a response to the current environmental conditions an individual experiences as opposed to local-scale genetic adaptation or the environment experienced early in development. We used a mark-recapture transplant experiment in the Shasta River, CA, to test whether life-history traits of juvenile Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha varied among locations, and whether individuals could adopt a new life history upon encountering new habitat type. The Shasta River, a Klamath River tributary, has two Chinook salmon spawning and juvenile rearing areas, a lower basin canyon (river km 0-12) and upper basin spring complex (river km 40-56), characterised by dramatically different in-stream habitats. In 2012 and 2013, we created three experimental groups: (i) fish caught, tagged and released in the upper basin; (ii) fish caught at the river mouth (confluence with the Klamath River, river km 0), tagged and released in the upper basin; and (iii) fish caught at the river mouth, tagged and released in the lower basin. Fish released in the upper basin outmigrated later and at a larger size than those released in the lower basin. The traits of fish transplanted to the upper basin were similar to fish originating in the upper basin. Chinook salmon juvenile life-history traits reflected habitat conditions fish experienced rather than those where they originated, indicating that habitat modification or transportation to new habitats can rapidly alter the life-history composition of populations.

VL  - 92
IS  - 2
SP  - 222-229
AB  - Male and female codling moths, Cydia pomonella (L.), were heated with increasing doses of gamma radiation, and the moths were either inbred or outcrossed with fertile counterparts. Fecundity of untreated females mated with heated males declined slowly with increasing doses of radiation. However, fecundity of treated females declined almost linearly with dose at approximate to 22% per 100 Gy. The minimum dose at which treated females were found to be 100% sterile when mated to untreated males was 100 Gy. This dose was much lower than previously suggested. Fertility of treated males declined almost linearly to approach 0 near 400 Gy. Inherited effects resulting from irradiation of P-1 males at selected doses were recorded for the F-1 generation. As the dose of radiation increased, F-1 fecundity and fertility decreased, mortality increased, and the F-1 sex ratio shifted in favor of male progeny. The effect of releasing partially sterile codling moth males and fully sterile females at a 10:1 overflooding ratio in conjunction with untreated codling moths was examined in field cages each containing a single apple tree. Fruit damage was significantly reduced in all treatments when compared with controls, and production of F-1 progeny were seen in cages containing moths treated with 100 Gy.

TI  - Humidity-controlled cold storage of Neoseiulus californicus (Acari: Phytoseiidae): effects on male survival and reproductive ability
VL  - 137
IS  - 5
SP  - 376-382
AB  - Humidification can suppress water loss from an organism and has great potential for improving the cold storage of short-lived arthropods, such as predatory mites. The effectiveness of humidity-controlled cold storage was recently verified for Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) females but was not examined for males. Combining both males and females in one storage protocol might increase the predator population because it would enhance the opportunity for multiple mating, which is necessary for females to maximize their egg production. Newly emerged adult males were stored at an air temperature of 5 degrees C and relative humidity (RH) of 100% or 80%. The median survival time (LT50) was 32days at 100% RH and 14days at 80% RH; the survival curves differed significantly. Males stored at 100% RH for 0, 10, 20 and 30days were introduced to virgin females for mating at 25 degrees C to evaluate their reproductive ability. The pre-oviposition period was significantly prolonged in the females mated with males stored for 20days. No negative effects of storage were observed on the oviposition period, total number of eggs or net reproduction rate (R0) in the females mated with males stored for 20days or on the mean generation time (T) for those stored for 30days. A slight decrease in the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was observed in the females mated with males stored for 20days. Our storage method can preserve N.californicus males for 20days with only a minor reduction in their survival and reproductive ability.

TI  - Phenotypic plasticity and population viability: the importance of environmental predictability
VL  - 277
IS  - 1699
SP  - 3391-3400
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity plays a key role in modulating how environmental variation influences population dynamics, but we have only rudimentary understanding of how plasticity interacts with the magnitude and predictability of environmental variation to affect population dynamics and persistence. We developed a stochastic individual-based model, in which phenotypes could respond to a temporally fluctuating environmental cue and fitness depended on the match between the phenotype and a randomly fluctuating trait optimum, to assess the absolute fitness and population dynamic consequences of plasticity under different levels of environmental stochasticity and cue reliability. When cue and optimum were tightly correlated, plasticity buffered absolute fitness from environmental variability, and population size remained high and relatively invariant. In contrast, when this correlation weakened and environmental variability was high, strong plasticity reduced population size, and populations with excessively strong plasticity had substantially greater extinction probability. Given that environments might become more variable and unpredictable in the future owing to anthropogenic influences, reaction norms that evolved under historic selective regimes could imperil populations in novel or changing environmental contexts. We suggest that demographic models (e.g. population viability analyses) would benefit from a more explicit consideration of how phenotypic plasticity influences population responses to environmental change.

VL  - 9
IS  - 5
SP  - 379-392
AB  - Sepia pharaonis, the pharaoh cuttlefish was cultured through multiple generations in the laboratory (5 consecutive generations) using closed, recirculating water filtration systems. The eggs of the original parental generation (G(P)) were spawned by a wild caught Gulf of Thailand female in a local fisheries laboratory, then packed and shipped air cargo to Texas where hatching occurred. The culture temperature ranged 25degrees- 28 degreesC, except for one generation that was chilled intentionally to 21 degreesC and then warmed to 25 degreesC after 9.6 months. Spawning occurred as early as day 161. Spawning output was high in all generations except the group that was cultured at 21 degreesC. Egg fertility was low in captivity (< 20%), but hatchling survival was high (> 70%). The average egg incubation time was 13.6 d at 25-28 degreesC. The largest spawn resulted in 600 viable hatchlings and the smallest resulted in 11 hatchlings. The cuttlefish ate a wide variety of estuarine crustaceans and fishes as well as frozen shrimp. There were no apparent disease problems since survival from hatching to maturity was over 70%. The average life span for cuttlefish cultured at 25-28 degreesC was 8.9 months and 12.3 months at 21 degreesC. Size at hatching was measured for fourth generation (G(4)) hatchlings; the mean weight at hatching was 0.103 g and the mean mantle length was 6.4 mm. The largest cuttlefish cultured was a male 300 mm ML and 3,045 g; the oldest cuttlefish lived 340 d. This cuttlefish species presents an excellent choice for commercial mariculture because of its rapid growth, short life span, tolerance to crowding and handling, resistance to disease and feeding habits.

TI  - Low temperature heat source for power generation: Exhaustive analysis of a carbon dioxide transcritical power cycle
VL  - 36
IS  - 9
SP  - 5497-5507
AB  - The main results of a theoretical work on the use of a low temperature heat source for power generation through a carbon dioxide transcritical power cycle are reported in this paper. The procedure for analyzing the behaviour of the proposed cycle consisted in modifying the input pressure to the turbine from 66 bar, maintained constant each evaluated temperature (60 degrees C, 90 degrees C, 120 degrees C and 150 degrees C) until the net work was approximately zero. As a result, the maximum exergy efficiency was 50%, while the energy efficiencies obtained were 9.8%, 7.3%, 4.9% and 2.4% and the net specific work was 18.2 kJ/kg, 12.8 kJ/kg, 7.8 kJ/kg and 3.5 kJ/kg, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of the addition of an internal heat exchanger, which obviously supposed an increase in the efficiency, was analyzed. The analysis of the proposed system shows the viability of implementing this type of process as an energy alternative and/or strengthener of non-conventional energy sources in non-provided zones, or for increasing the energy efficiency in the industry.

TI  - The evolution of virulence of West Nile virus in a mosquito vector: implications for arbovirus adaptation and evolution
VL  - 13
AB  - Background: Virulence is often coupled with replicative fitness of viruses in vertebrate systems, yet the relationship between virulence and fitness of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) in invertebrates has not been evaluated. Although the interactions between vector-borne pathogens and their invertebrate hosts have been characterized as being largely benign, some costs of arbovirus exposure have been identified for mosquitoes. The extent to which these costs may be strain-specific and the subsequent consequences of these interactions on vector and virus evolution has not been adequately explored. Results: Using West Nile virus (WNV) and Culex pipiens mosquitoes, we tested the hypothesis that intrahost fitness is correlated with virulence in mosquitoes by evaluating life history traits following exposure to either non-infectious bloodmeals or bloodmeals containing wildtype (WNV WT) or the high fitness, mosquito-adapted strain, WNV MP20 derived from WNV WT. Our results demonstrate strain-specific effects on mosquito survival, fecundity, and blood feeding behavior. Specifically, both resistance to and infection with WNV MP20, but not WNV WT, decreased survival of Cx. pipiens and altered fecundity and bloodfeeding such that early egg output was enhanced at a later cost. Conclusions: As predicted by the trade-off hypothesis of virulence, costs of infection with WNV MP20 in terms of survival were directly correlated to viral load, yet resistance to infection with this virulent strain was equally costly. Taken together, these results demonstrate that WNV MP20 infection decreases the transmission potential of Cx. pipiens populations despite the increased intrahost fitness of this strain, indicating that a virulence-transmission trade-off in invertebrates could contribute significantly to the adaptive and evolutionary constraint of arboviruses.

TI  - Feeding Drosophila a biotin-deficient diet for multiple generations increases stress resistance and lifespan and alters gene expression and histone Biotinylation patterns
VL  - 137
IS  - 9
SP  - 2006-2012
AB  - Energy restriction increases stress resistance and lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster and other species. The roles of individual nutrients in stress resistance and longevity are largely unknown. The vitamin biotin is a potential candidate for mediating these effects, given its known roles in stress signaling and gene regulation by epigenetic mechanisms, i.e. biotinylation of histones. Here, we tested the hypothesis that prolonged culture of Drosophila on biotin-deficient (BD) medium increases stress resistance and lifespan. Flies were fed a BD diet for multiple generations; controls were fed a biotin-normal diet. In some experiments, a third group of flies was fed a BID diet for 12 generations and then switched to control diets for 2 generations to eliminate potential effects of short-term biotin deficiency. Flies fed a BID diet exhibited a 30% increase in lifespan. This increase was associated with enhanced resistance to the DNA-damaging agent hydroxyurea and heat stress. Also, fertility increased significantly compared with biotin-normal controls. Biotinylation of histones was barely detectable in biotin-deprived flies, suggesting that epigenetic events might have contributed to effects of biotin deprivation.

VL  - 51

AB  - The southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.), and its congeneric species, Nezara antennata Scott, are major agricultural pests in Japan. Here, I investigated seasonal trends in light trap capture rates, as well as female ovarian development of these two species from 2009 to 2014 in Kumamoto, Japan. Each year, both species first appeared in the traps in May, and large numbers were caught between July and August. Both mature and immature females were caught. For both species, ovarian development followed a similar seasonal pattern in 2009 and 2010, but the patterns differed between the species. The development of reproductive organs was similar to that in previous reports from wild populations, demonstrating the usefulness of light-trapped females in clarifying their life-history traits (e.g., the number of generations per year, the timing of oviposition, and timing of occurrence for each generation). The trap capture data of N. viridula until the end of July and its preceding winter temperatures were positively related. Thus, winter temperature is a useful predictor of the relative abundance of N. viridula in wild populations.

VL  - 23

SP  - 151-157
AB  - The variegated ladybird, Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is a newly recorded species in Egypt, as such a little information is available on its biology. Certain reproductive and life history attributes of H. variegata were studied under laboratory conditions on five aphid species, i.e. Aphis fabae Scpoli, A gossypii Glover, A nerii Boyer de Fonscolombe, Brevicoryne brassicae (Linn.) and Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas) (Homoptera: Aphididae). Amongst the tested preys, H. variegata developed and reproduced successfully On all preys except A. nerii. The latter caused high mortality (> 90%) of immature stages. Preimaginal developmental time was the longest (17.62 days), when the beetle was fed on B. brassicae while the shortest (14.88 days) was on A. gossypii. A significant increase in the number of prey consumption by the 3rd and 4th larval instars of H. variegata was observed. Total number of consumed preys during the entire larval stage was highest (279.80 nymphs) for M euphorbiae and lowest (178.16 nymphs) for B. brassicae. The prey species had significant effect on larval and generation survival. As for adult stage, the values of ovipositional periods, male and female longevities, daily and lifetime fecundity as well as number of preys consumed differed significantly at different aphid prey species. However, total number of preys consumed by males did not differ on different prey species. Females of H. variegata that fed on M euphorbiae had the highest net reproductive rate (R-o), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), finite rate of increase (lambda) with subsequent shortest mean generation time (T) and doubling time (DT). However, the life table attributes of H. variegata were lowest, when fed on B. brassicae. Therefore, M euphorbiae and A. gossypii seemed to be the most suitable prey species among the tested aphid species for rearing H variegata.

TI  - Effects of food type, feeding frequency, and temperature on juvenile survival and growth of Marisa cornuarietis (Mollusca : Gastropoda)
VL  - 125
IS  - 2
SP  - 106-116
AB  - The present experiments are part of a larger study designed to investigate the influence of husbandry parameters on the life history of the ramshorn snail, Marisa cornuarietis, in order to identify suitable husbandry conditions for maintaining multi-generation populations in the laboratory for use in ecotoxicological testing. In this paper we focus on the effects of a combination of food types and feeding frequencies (i.e., the frequency with which the snails were offered food) on juvenile growth and survival at different temperatures. Offspring produced in the laboratory by wild specimens of M. cornuarietis, from Puerto Rico, were used to test the effects of three types of food (lettuce, alginate with fish food, alginate with snail mix) fed at three frequencies (given ad libitum on 4/4, 2/4, or 1/4 d) on juvenile survival and growth. The 4-d feeding regimens were repeated four times, giving a total of 16 d for the experiments. The experiments were conducted at two temperatures (22 degrees and 25 degrees C) under a 12 h light:12 h dark photoperiod. Juvenile growth rates increased with increasing feeding frequency for all food types. The most rapid growth rates occurred in the high-frequency lettuce treatments and the slowest growth rates in the low-frequency lettuce and alginate with snail mix treatments. Juvenile snails grew faster at 25 degrees than at 22 degrees C, and mortality was about twice as high at the lower temperature. Growth rates were used to provide a rough estimate of time to maturity, which was determined to take about twice as long at 22 degrees than at 25 degrees C. The results showed that lettuce is the best food if supplied in abundance, but effects on growth are very dependent on feeding frequency and temperature. We conclude that 25 degrees C is a more appropriate temperature for maintaining populations than 22 degrees C, that lettuce provides a suitable food source, and that food should be supplied continuously for husbandry and toxicity testing of populations of M. cornuarietis.

TI  - Testing for local adaptation in brown trout using reciprocal transplants
VL  - 12
AB  - Background: Local adaptation can drive the divergence of populations but identification of the traits under selection remains a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Reciprocal transplant experiments are ideal tests of local adaptation, yet rarely used for higher vertebrates because of the mobility and potential invasiveness of non-native organisms. Here, we reciprocally transplanted 2500 brown trout (Salmo trutta) embryos from five populations to investigate local adaptation in early life history traits. Embryos were bred in a full-factorial design and raised in natural riverbeds until emergence. Customized egg capsules were used to simulate the natural redd environment and allowed tracking the fate of every individual until retrieval. We predicted that 1) within sites, native populations would outperform non-natives, and 2) across sites, populations would show higher performance at 'home' compared to 'away' sites. Results: There was no evidence for local adaptation but we found large differences in survival and hatching rates between sites, indicative of considerable variation in habitat quality. Survival was generally high across all populations (55% +/- 3%), but ranged from 4% to 89% between sites. Average hatching rate was 25% +/- 3% across populations ranging from 0% to 62% between sites. Conclusion: This study provides rare empirical data on variation in early life history traits in a population network of a salmonid, and large-scale breeding and transplantation experiments like ours provide powerful tests for local adaptation. Despite the recently reported genetic and morphological differences between the populations in our study area, local adaptation at the embryo level is small, non-existent, or confined to ecological conditions that our experiment could not capture.

TI  - Evolutionary dynamics of 'the' bdelloid and monogonont rotifer life-history patterns
VL  - 546
SP  - 55-70
AB  - Substantial differences in both life-table characteristics and reproductive patterns distinguish bdelloid from monogonont rotifers. Bdelloids reproduce only asexually, whereas most monogononts are cyclical parthenogens. We explore some of the adaptive consequences of these life-history differences using a computer model to simulate the evolutionary acquisition of new beneficial mutations. A one-locus mutation-selection regime based on the life-history characteristics of bdelloids indicates that asexuals can maintain higher levels of both allelic and genotypic diversity over a longer time period than obligate sexuals. These results are produced by differences in the magnitude of random genetic drift (RGD) associated with the different types of reproduction. Cyclical parthenogens have significantly higher evolutionary rates than sexual forms in a single-locus model, but incorporate beneficial mutations more slowly than sexuals in a two-locus simulation. Our results are therefore strongly influenced by the number of loci being evaluated as well as the pattern of reproduction. The asexual life history was found to maintain higher levels of allelic diversity than any pattern including sexual reproduction. This intriguing finding is amplified as the number of loci undergoing selection is increased. We end by considering the adaptive consequences of the remarkably divergent life histories found in typical bdelloid and monogonont rotifers.

TI  - Tracking changes in chromosomal arrangements and their genetic content during adaptation
VL  - 29
IS  - 6
SP  - 1151-1167
AB  - There is considerable evidence for an adaptive role of inversions, but how their genetic content evolves and affects the subsequent evolution of chromosomal polymorphism remains controversial. Here, we track how life-history traits, chromosomal arrangements and 22 microsatellites, within and outside inversions, change in three replicated populations of Drosophila sub-obscura for 30 generations of laboratory evolution since founding from the wild. The dynamics of fitness-related traits indicated adaptation to the new environment concomitant with directional evolution of chromosomal polymorphism. Evidence of selective changes in frequency of inversions was obtained for seven of 23 chromosomal arrangements, corroborating a role for inversions in adaptation. The evolution of linkage disequilibrium between some microsatellites and chromosomes suggested that adaptive changes in arrangements involved changes in their genetic content. Several microsatellite alleles increased in frequency more than expected by drift in targeted inversions in all replicate populations. In particular, there were signs of selection in the O3+4 arrangement favouring a combination of alleles in two loci linked to the inversion and changing along with it, although the lack of linkage disequilibrium between these loci precludes epistatic selection. Seven other alleles increased in frequency within inversions more than expected by drift, but were not in linkage disequilibrium with them. Possibly these alleles were hitchhiking along with alleles under selection that were not specific to those inversions. Overall, the selection detected on the genetic content of inversions, despite limited coverage of the genome, suggests that genetic changes within inversions play an important role in adaptation.

TI  - INFLUENCE OF CONSANGUINITY ON THE SEX-RATIO AND DIAPAUSE OF DIPRION-PINI L (HYM, DIPRIONIDAE) POPULATIONS .2. EFFECT OF INBREEDING ON DIAPAUSE
VL  - 119
IS  - 1
SP  - 35-43
AB  - Experiments were undertaken in 1990 and 1992 to prove the effect of consanguinity on diapause and to study its links with sex determinism and possible genetic factors. These experiments were realized on the progenies of colonies collected in Fontainebleau forest. From adult emergences in April different ways of breeding were comparatively carried out during two generations: inbred brother-sister crosses, non-inbred crosses with insects from another origin, in particular with a reference rearing strain reared for many generations; and breedings of virgin females. The progenies of these crossings were reared in the same standard laboratory conditions favourable to development without diapause (16 degrees C, 15 h L-9 h D photoperiod for the young larvae, 20 degrees C, 16 h 30 L-7 h 30 D thereafter). Diapause rates and sex-ratio were simultaneously observed. The results show an important increase in diapause rates and male rates in the progenies of inbred insects. We also found a link between sex and diapause, its rates being higher in males. On the other hand, crossings with the rearing strain corroborate the existence of a genetic factor strengthening diapause which would be eliminated in reared populations if only the without diapause insects are bred from generation to generation. Some hypotheses about the interaction between consanguinity, sex determinisms and the existence of this genetic factor are drawn from these results. It is suggested that these phenomena may have a noticeable importance for population dynamics ofD. pini.

TI  - A rapid method for the generation of uniform acellular bone explants: a technical note
VL  - 5
AB  - Background: Bone graft studies lack standardized controls. We aim to present a quick and reliable method for the intra-operative generation of acellular bone explants. Methods: Therefore, ovine cancellous bone explants from the iliac crest were prepared and used to test several methods for the induction of cell death. Over night heat inactivation was used as positive treatment control, methods to be investigated included UV light, or X-ray exposure, incubation in a hypotonic solution (salt-free water) and a short cycle of repeated freezing and thawing. Results: Viability of treated and 2 days cultured bone explants was investigated by lactate dehydrogenase assay. Non-treated cultured control explants maintained around 50% osteocyte viability, while osteocyte survival after the positive treatment control was abolished. The most dramatic loss in cell viability, together with a low standard deviation, was a repeated cycle of freezing and thawing. Conclusions: To summarize, we present a freeze-thaw method for the creation of acellular bone explants, which is easy to perform, not time-consuming and provides consistent results.

TI  - Integrating genomic information and productivity and climate-adaptability traits into a regional white spruce breeding program
VL  - 17
IS  - 3
AB  - Tree improvement programs often focus on improving productivity-related traits; however, under present climate change scenarios, climate change-related (adaptive) traits should also be incorporated into such programs. Therefore, quantifying the genetic variation and correlations among productivity and adaptability traits, and the importance of genotype by environment interactions, including defense compounds involved in biotic and abiotic resistance, is essential for selecting parents for the production of resilient and sustainable forests. Here, we estimated quantitative genetic parameters for 15 growth, wood quality, drought resilience, and monoterpene traits for Picea glauca (Moench) Voss (white spruce). We sampled 1,540 trees from three open-pollinated progeny trials, genotyped with 467,224 SNP markers using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). We used the pedigree and SNP information to calculate, respectively, the average numerator and genomic relationship matrices, and univariate and multivariate individual-tree models to obtain estimates of (co)variance components. With few site-specific exceptions, all traits examined were under genetic control. Overall, higher heritability estimates were derived from the genomic- than their counterpart pedigree-based relationship matrix. Selection for height, generally, improved diameter and water use efficiency, but decreased wood density, microfibril angle, and drought resistance. Genome-based correlations between traits reaffirmed the pedigree-based correlations for most trait pairs. High and positive genetic correlations between sites were observed (average 0.68), except for those pairs involving the highest elevation, warmer, and moister site, specifically for growth and microfibril angle. These results illustrate the advantage of using genomic information jointly with productivity and adaptability traits, and defense compounds to enhance tree breeding selection for changing climate.

TI  - Do mothers producing large offspring have to sacrifice fecundity?
VL  - 19

SP  - 380-391
AB  - We artificially selected on egg size in a butterfly to study the consequences for fecundity, reproductive effort and offspring fitness. Correlated responses in either pupal mass, larval or pupal development time were virtually absent. Offspring size was positively related to fitness, but only partly traded off against fecundity. Rather, total reproductive effort (measured as fresh mass), egg water content and the decline of egg size with female age increased in the large-egg selected lines compared to either small-egg or control lines. Accounting for these effects showed that reproductive investment (in dry mass) was in fact similar across lines. Such mechanisms may enable increased investment in (early) offspring without a reduction in their number, revealing a much more complex picture than a simple trade-off between offspring size and number. Substantial variation among replicates suggests that there are different underlying mechanisms for change, rather than any single, unitary pathway.

TI  - Genetic Variation in Metabolic Rate and Correlations with Other Energy Budget Components and Life History in Daphnia magna
VL  - 46
IS  - 2
SP  - 170-178
AB  - Much is known about the genetic variance in certain components of metabolism, most notably resting and maximum metabolic rate. This is in stark contrast to the lack of information on genetic variance in the metabolic rate of individuals that feed and express routine activity, and how this rate correlates with other components of the energy budget or life history traits. Here we quantify genetic variance in metabolic rate (MR) under such conditions, as well as food consumption, juvenile somatic growth rate and age at maturation under ad lib food availability in a set of 10 clones of Daphnia magna from a natural population. Broad sense evolvabilities (0.16 0.56%) were on the same order of magnitude as those typically observed for physiological and life history traits, and suggest that all these traits have the potential to evolve within this population. We did not find support for the previously hypothesized positive genetic correlation between metabolic rate and growth rate. Rather, the patterns of genetic correlations suggest that genetic variance in food consumption is the single most influential trait shaping somatic growth rate, but that additional variance in growth can be explained by considering the joint effect of consumption and MR. The genetic variance in consumption and MR also translated into genetic variance in age at maturation, creating a direct link between these energy budget components and a life history trait with strong fitness effects. Moreover, a weak positive correlation between MR and food consumption suggests the presence of substantial amounts of independent genetic control of these traits, consistent with results obtained using genomic approaches.

TI  - A Novel Approach for Automatic Generation Control of Multi Area Power Systems with Nonlinearity Using General Relativity Search Algorithm
AB  - In this paper, a novel approach based on General Relativity Search Algorithm (GRSA) for Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of a two area interconnected thermal-thermal power system is described. In the investigated power system, governor dead-band is considered as a nonlinearity. At first, AGC of the power system is analyzed with Proportional Integral (PI) controller and further Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller is also utilized. The parameters of the PI and PID controllers are optimized by GRSA. The gain multiplied Integral Time Absolute Error (g-ITAE) fitness function is employed to find the best solution for the PI and PID based controller design using the novel technique. The superiority of the GRSA optimized PI, and PID controllers are presented by comparing its results with the published results of modern soft computing technique i.e. Craziness based Particle Swarm Optimization(C-PSO) tuned PI controller. Numerical simulation results validate the efficiency of the GRSA for AGC design applications.

TI  - A comparison of maternal effects and current environment on vital rates of Aphis nerii, the milkweed-oleander aphid
VL  - 32
IS  - 2
SP  - 172-180
AB  - 1. Non-Mendelian maternal effects, the effects of maternal phenotype or environment on offspring phenotype, have been documented in numerous taxa. By affecting offspring vital rates (birth, death, and movement), maternal effects have the potential to influence population dynamics. However, relatively few studies have directly linked maternal phenotype or environment to offspring vital rates. Additionally, even fewer studies have compared the magnitude of across-generation effects (i.e. maternal effects) to within-generation effects. 2. Because of their telescoping generations, aphids can be strongly influenced by maternal effects. The effects of maternal density and maternal host-plant species on offspring survival, fecundity, and alate formation were investigated experimentally in Aphis nerii, the milkweed-oleander aphid. 3. Additionally, the relative strength of maternal effects were compared with those operating within a generation. Therefore, in another set of experiments, the effects of current density and host-plant species (within-generation effects) on aphid vital rates were examined. 4. While maternal effects were present, within-generation effects were much stronger and more strongly influenced aphid vital rates. Within a generation, aphids exhibited density-dependent survival, fecundity, and alate formation and these effects varied among host-plant species. 5. These results indicate that while maternal effects have the potential to affect population dynamics, this potential is not always met. Additionally, the current environment, not the environment of previous generations, more strongly impacts population dynamics.

SP  - 415-420
AB  - Purpose: Detect any deviation in biologic and technologic characters of eight ameiotic-parthenogenetically cloned lines of Bombyx mori L. from different origins from a normal sexually reproduced control line in three generations. Methods: Comparative study of the three generations was conducted in SES, Vratza, unit of the National Center for Agrarian Sciences of Bulgaria after fixing all environmental rearing conditions. Results: The ameiotic-parthen-clones displayed good parthenogenetic development, although total hatchability was significantly less than the sexually reproducing control populations. Survival rates between clones and control were not significantly different. All clones displayed significantly longer larval periods. Slight decline in second generation, and a steeper one in the third generation were observed for all eight cloned lines in cocoon weight, shell weight, and shell ratio and these differences were statistically significant. Cocoon yield was significantly lower than the control throughout the three generations. Conclusions: Our parthen-cloning method has a high rate of success in comparison to other cloning methods, the cloned progeny populations although were weaker technologically (cocoon weight, shell weight, and shell ratio), the biological characters (parthenogenetic development and survival rate) were not compromised. Further study is needed to determine the thermal needs of the cloned embryos and metabolic rate of all stages.

TI  - Population differentiation in Pacific salmon: Local adaptation, genetic drift, or the environment?
VL  - 52
IS  - 12
SP  - 2762-2777
AB  - Morphological, behavioral, and life-history differences between Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) populations are commonly thought to reflect local adaptation, and it is likewise common to assume that salmon populations separated by small distances are locally adapted. Two alternatives to local adaptation exist: random genetic differentiation owing to genetic drift and founder events, and genetic homogeneity among populations, in which differences reflect differential trait expression in differing environments. Population genetics theory and simulations suggest that both alternatives are possible. With selectively neutral alleles, genetic drift can result in random differentiation despite many strays per generation. Even weak selection can prevent genetic drift in stable populations; however, founder effects can result in random differentiation despite selective pressures. Overlapping generations reduce the potential for random differentiation. Genetic homogeneity can occur despite differences in selective regimes when straying rates are high. In sum, localized differences in selection should not always result in local adaptation. Local adaptation is favored when population sizes are large and stable, selection is consistent over large areas, selective differentials are large, and straying rates are neither too high nor too low. Consideration of alternatives to adaptation would improve both biological research and salmon conservation efforts.

TI  - Cinnamon Firewood as a Biofuel for Electricity Generation
VL  - 51
IS  - 1
SP  - 31-38
AB  - Biomass based electricity generation is now a well-established concept and in Sri Lanka, gliricidia has been accepted as the most suitable biofuel. Considering this and the fertilizer displacement benefits, the Government of Sri Lanka has given prominence for cultivating gliricidia on a large scale by declaring it as the fourth plantation crop. The objective of this paper is to discuss the use of cinnamon firewood as a biofuel for electricity generation. Thus, analysing cinnamon wood's heat characteristics, examining its availability and assessing its potentiality for electricity generation are matters of paramount importance. Cinnamon wood is the residue left from peeling the cinnamon bark. The villagers in cinnamon growing areas were the first to identify the superior heat generating properties of cinnamon wood as compared to other types of firewood. However, its effectiveness as a biofuel for electricity generation could be best assessed by comparing its heat characteristics and other properties with those of gliricidia. Cinnamon grows in most parts of the country and cinnamon wood is available year-round as a by-product. The process is sustainable, and the 32,345ha of cinnamon plantations presently available have the potential to add at least 80GWh annually to the national grid. Hence, there may not be a need to devote land purely for cultivation of biofuels.

TI  - Trait specific consequences of fast and slow inbreeding: lessons from captive populations of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
SP  - 479-488
AB  - The increased homozygosity due to inbreeding leads to expression of deleterious recessive alleles, which may cause inbreeding depression in small populations. The severity of inbreeding depression has been suggested to depend on the rate of inbreeding, with slower inbreeding being more effective in purging deleterious alleles of smaller effect. The effectiveness of purging is however dependent on various factors such as the effect of the deleterious, recessive alleles, the genetic background of inbreeding depression and the environment in which purging occurs. Investigations have shown inconclusive results as to whether purging efficiently diminish inbreeding depression. Here we used an ecologically relevant inbreeding coefficient (f a parts per thousand 0.25) and generated ten slow and ten fast inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster by keeping the effective population size constant at respectively 32 and 2 for 19 or 2 generations. These inbred lines were contrasted to non-inbred control lines. We investigated the effect of inbreeding and inbreeding rate in traits associated with fitness including heat, cold and desiccation stress resistance, egg-to-adult viability, development time, productivity, metabolic rate and wet weight under laboratory conditions. The results showed highly trait specific consequences of inbreeding and generally no support for the hypothesis that slow inbreeding is less deleterious than fast inbreeding. Egg-to-adult viability and development time were investigated under both benign and heat stress conditions. Reduced viability and increased developmental time were observed at stressful temperatures and inbreeding depression was on average more severe at stressful compared to benign temperatures.

VL  - 150

SP  - 103-110
AB  - Many species of tsetse flies are infected by a virus that causes salivary gland hypertrophy (SGH) and the virus isolated from Glossina pallidipes (GpSGHv) has recently been sequenced. Flies with SGH have a reduced fecundity and fertility. To better understand the impact of this virus in a laboratory colony of G. pallidipes, where the majority of flies are infected but asymptomatic, and to follow the development of SGH in the offspring of symptomatic infected flies, we examined the progeny of tsetse flies reared under different conditions. The results show that the progeny of asymptomatic parents did not develop SGH, while the progeny of symptomatic female flies mated with asymptomatic males developed a high rate of SGH (65% in male and 100% in females) and these flies were sterile. Stress in the form of high fly density in holding cages (180 flies/cage) and high temperature (30 degrees C) in the holding room did not affect the prevalence of the SGH. The virus is excreted in the saliva and there is a strong correlation between the infection status (negative, slight or strong by PCR) and the numbers of virus particles released into the blood on which the flies were fed. On average, around 10(2) and 10(7) virus particles were found in the blood after feeding asymptomatic or symptomatic infected flies respectively. Feeding the flies on new blood at every feed for three generations caused a significant reduction in the virus copy number in these flies when compared with the virus copy number in flies fed under the normal feeding regime. The results of these studies allowed the initiation of colony management protocols that aim to minimize the risk of horizontal transmission and to enable the establishment of colonies with a low virus prevalence or possibly even those that are virus free.

TI  - Assessing vulnerability and adaptive capacity of the fisheries sector in Dominica: long-term climate change and catastrophic hurricanes
VL  - 76

SP  - 1353-1367
AB  - The Commonwealth of Dominica is a Small Island Developing State in the eastern Caribbean, that has been subject to a wide variety of natural hazards over the past century, most recently the Category 5-Hurricane Maria on 18-19 September 2017. In Dominica fishing remains important for income generation and for local food security. While there are small-scale reef and demersal fisheries, pelagic fisheries have tended to dominate in recent years and fishers make extensive use of Fish Aggregating Devices. Climate Vulnerability Assessments (CVAs) provide a coherent framework for evaluating potential impacts over a broad range of species, and also socio-ecological systems. These methods assess the "exposure" to a stressor (climate change and/or hurricane events), the "sensitivity" to that stressor, and the "adaptive capacity" within fishing communities faced with potential threats. These three components are then combined to estimate overall "vulnerability". In this study we make use of fisheries catch data from landing ports around Dominica, to assess how each of Dominica's ten parishes differ in terms of climate vulnerability. We examine information on species' temperature preferences and life-history traits as well as data on social vulnerability. We then compare our predictions with observed damage following Hurricane Maria, using the 2017 Post-disaster Needs Assessment.

AB  - With the rapid development of economy, People's living standard is improving and people are also more and more high to the requirement of environmental protection. Now used in most countries is coal-fired power generation way, this way of electricity will be massive emissions of polluting substances into the air, for example: SO2, NO,,which can destroy the self-regulation of nature and cause great damage to our living environment. Use of nuclear power is not only clean, but also, does not produce sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and other toxic gases, and the economy, save resources. From using nuclear power to now, the plant has experienced the change of generation after generation, continuously improving all kinds of equipment and the methods of combustion, to make nuclear power safer. This paper introduces the development history of nuclear power plant from set up to now and the development of nuclear power plant in the future expectations. Energy is indispensable to the survival of humans upon earth and necessary conditions. The replacement of energy will cause the progress of human society. With the rapid development of social economy, the social productive forces in the continuously improve and human demand for energy is becoming more and more big. However, coal, oil and natural gas are non-renewable energy, and the earth reserves is limited. And the burning of fossil fuels may cause pollution to the environment, and influence the survival of the human environment. Nuclear energy has advantages of clean, low pollution and high thermal efficiency, and slowing down the temperature [1]. Use of nuclear power, 1 kg 235U all fission releases energy equivalent to 2700 tons of standard coal burning out of energy[2], which has a great development potential. Today, most countries in the world have dedicated to the study in the use of nuclear power. The table below for some countries in the use of nuclear power generation accounts for the total generating capacity of 2016.

VL  - 107
IS  - 4
SP  - 1411-1418
AB  - Biological characteristics of corn leaf aphid, Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch), on barley, Hordeum vulgare L., were examined for two generations under four different elevated temperature and CO2 combinations. The developmental duration for each life stage was significantly reduced under the elevated temperature (+4 degrees C). The elevated CO2 (700-750 mu l/liter) reduced only the development time of fourth-instar nymph. The overall duration of nymphal stage was reduced in the second generation. Thus, the temperature was the dominant factor to development duration of corn leaf aphid. The fecundity of corn leaf aphid was significantly increased under the elevated temperature and CO2, as well as in the later generation. Elevated temperature and CO2 increased the number of alate production, which may enhance the aphid migration or dispersal and the spread of plant viruses. Corn leaf aphid had the highest intrinsic rate of increase under the elevated temperature and CO2 combination in the second generation. These results indicate that the combined effects of both elevated temperature and CO2 on aphid biology may exacerbate aphid damage on barley under the climate change in accompany with elevated temperature and CO2 level.

TI  - Effects of ocean acidification over successive generations decrease resilience of larval European sea bass to ocean acidification and warming but juveniles could benefit from higher temperatures in the NE Atlantic
VL  - 225
IS  - 9
AB  - European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is a large, economically important fish species with a long generation time whose longterm resilience to ocean acidification (OA) and warming (OW) is not clear. We incubated sea bass from Brittany (France) for two generations (>5 years in total) under ambient and predicted OA conditions (PCO2: 650 and 1700 mu atm) crossed with ambient and predicted OW conditions in F1 (temperature: 15-18 degrees C and 20-23 degrees C) to investigate the effects of climate change on larval and juvenile growth and metabolic rate. We found that in F1, OA as a single stressor at ambient temperature did not affect larval or juvenile growth and OW increased developmental time and growth rate, but OAW decreased larval size at metamorphosis. Larval routine and juvenile standard metabolic ratewere significantly lower in cold compared with warm conditioned fish and also lower in F0 compared with F1 fish. We did not find any effect of OA as a single stressor on metabolic rate. Juvenile PO2, crit was not affected by OA or OAW in both generations. We discuss the potential underlying mechanisms resulting in the resilience of F0 and F1 larvae and juveniles to OA and in the beneficial effects of OW on F1 larval growth and metabolic rate, but contrastingly in the vulnerability of F1, but not F0 larvae to OAW. With regard to the ecological perspective, we conclude that recruitment of larvae and early juveniles to nursery areas might decrease under OAWconditions but individuals reaching juvenile phase might benefit from increased performance at higher temperatures.

TI  - Deciphering lifelong thermal niche using otolith delta O-18 thermometry within supplemented lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) populations
VL  - 65
IS  - 6
SP  - 1114-1127
AB  - The selection of thermal habitat by fish is strongly regulated by physiology and behaviour. However, delineation of a species lifelong thermal niche remains technically challenging. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) survival and productivity are recognised as being tightly linked to a somewhat restricted thermal habitat. The factors guiding temperature selection during each life stage remain poorly understood. In this study, we tested the significant factors controlling the realised thermal niche of lake trout from two southern Quebec small boreal lakes that experienced supplementation stocking during the last 20 years. We used oxygen stable isotope (delta O-18) thermometry of otolith calcium carbonates (aragonite) using secondary-ion mass spectrometry to estimate experienced lifelong temperatures. We investigated the thermal habitat of lake trout with known genotypes (local, hybrid, and stocked). Ontogeny and genetic origin influenced temperature selection in both studied lake trout populations. Young-of-the-year consistently used warmer, shallower habitats (10.7 +/- 2.6 degrees C, 7.5 m depth) prior to a juvenile transition to colder and deeper waters (8.5 +/- 3.3 degrees C, 10 m depth). Stocked lake trout, originating from a genetically distinct ecotype, exhibited a more variable thermal niche, with some individuals consistently using warmer habitat (10.4 +/- 1 degrees C) than local fish. Their hybrid progeny also occupied a warmer thermal niche, intermediate to the parental strains. We propose that increased fat content and genetic origin are potential explanatory factors for warmer temperature use. This study reiterates that high-resolution otolith delta O-18 thermometry is a uniquely well-suited approach for unravelling the multiple factors that influence lifelong temperature selection in fish. Our results illustrate that the realised thermal niche is influenced by a genetic-environment interaction.

TI  - Optimum Unit Commitment for Thermal Power Plants - A Genetic Algorithm Approach
SP  - 529-532
AB  - This paper presents genetic algorithm method for unit commitment of thermal power plant. The optimum allocation of generations (for a given plant load) to different units of a plant is called unit commitment (UC). It can be easily shown that the optimal operation of the units at a thermal power station can be achieved when the incremental fuel cost (incremental cost) of all the units are equal. A new fitness function is defined in this paper, which combines (i) equal incremental cost (IC) criteria, and (ii) generation and load balance constraint. Generation of each unit is taken as variable. The minimum and maximum generation limits of the units are incorporated with the help of lower and upper bounds of variable. The genetic algorithm (GA) optimization method is employed to estimate the optimum allocation of generations to different units of plant, making use of the fitness function. Computer programs (using MATLAB) have been developed for optimum UC, using GA technique.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF HEAT-RESISTANCE IN THE 1ST GENERATION OF TILAPIA AFTER LOW-TEMPERATURE TREATMENT OF FEMALES WITH GONADS OF MATURITY STAGE-III
IS  - 4
SP  - 535-541
AB  - The heat resistance of larvae and their somatic cells was studied in the first generation of Tilapia obtained from females treated with low temperature at the age of 105-121 days. The optimal temperature for development of Tilapia is 26-28-degrees, while the low temperature treatment was effected at 20-22-degrees. No death of fish was recorded after the treatment. The female gonads retained all oocytes of the older generation, while some previtellogenic oocytes died. The heat resistance of 18-20-day old larvae and their muscle to the damaging effect of 40-degrees was determined. The experimental larvae did not differ from the control ones by their heat resistance and that of their cells. We can conclude that there are only few sensitive stages of gem cell development during the proembryonic period (primordial germ cells and gonia), when the low temperature treatment of females determines the heat resistance of the first generation progeny.

TI  - Consistent differences in fitness traits across multiple generations of Olympia oysters
VL  - 8
AB  - Adaptive evolution and plasticity are two mechanisms that facilitate phenotypic differences between populations living in different environments. Understanding which mechanism underlies variation in fitness-related traits is a crucial step in designing conservation and restoration management strategies for taxa at risk from anthropogenic stressors. Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) have received considerable attention with regard to restoration, however there is limited information on adaptive population structure. Using oysters raised under common conditions for up to two generations (F1s and F2s), we tested for evidence of divergence in reproduction, larval growth, and juvenile growth among three populations in Puget Sound, Washington. We found that the population with the fastest growth rate also exhibited delayed and reduced reproductive activity, indicating a potential adaptive trade-off. Our results corroborate and extend upon a previous reciprocal transplant study on F1 oysters from the same populations, indicating that variation in growth rate and differences in reproductive timing are consistent across both natural and laboratory environments and have a strongly heritable component that cannot be entirely attributed to plasticity.

TI  - A new mechanism for DNA alterations induced by alpha particles such as those emitted by radon and radon progeny
VL  - 105
SP  - 1095-1101
AB  - The mechanism(s) by which alpha (alpha) particles like those emitted from inhaled radon and radon progeny cause their carcinogenic effects in the lung remains unclear Although direct nuclear traversals by alpha-particles may be involved in mediating these outcomes, increasing evidence indicates that a particles can cause alterations in DNP, in the absence of direct hits to cell nuclei. Using the occurrence of excessive sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) as an index of DNA damage in human lung fibroblasts, we investigated the hypothesis that alpha-particles may induce DNA damage through the generation of extracellular factors. We have found that a relatively low dose of alpha-particles can result in the generation of extracellular factors, which, upon transfer to unexposed normal human cells, can cause excessive SCE to an extent equivalent to that observed when the cells are directly irradiated with the same irradiation dose. A short-lived, SCE-inducing factor(s) is generated in alpha-irradiated culture medium containing serum in the absence of cells. A more persistent SCE-inducing factor(s), which can survive freeze-thaw and is heat labile is produced by fibroblasts after exposure to the alpha-particles. These results indicate that the initiating target for alpha-particle-induced genetic changes can be larger than a cell's nucleus or even a whole cell. How transmissible factors like those observed here in vitro may extend to the in vivo condition in the context of alpha-particle-induced carcinogenesis in the respiratory tract remains to be determined.

TI  - The effect of vegetation patterns on oviposition habitat preference: A driving mechanism in terrestrial chironomid (Diptera : Chironomidae) succession?
VL  - 39
IS  - 2
SP  - 207-213
AB  - Relationships between changes of two species of terrestrial chironomids (Smittia cf. aterrima and Bryophaenocladius cf. virgo) and changes of vegetation cover during succession were studied with respect to plant - chironomid interaction in particular stages of chironomid life cycle. Several vegetation types forming vegetation mosaics in suburban fallow were distinguished according to their spatial architecture (height; density etc.). Abundance of chironomid larvae in particular type of vegetation and an area covered by these vegetation types were studied for three years. During one year the effect of vegetation types on density of aerial drift, oviposition habitat preference and adult emergence was studied in detail. Aerial drift was studied using pan traps, oviposition using soil sampling and adult emergence using emergence trap. Main results were similar for both species. Chironomid larvae were abundant in soil in initial years of succession. They were concentrated in patches with open and low height vegetation. Later their abundance decreased corresponding to a reduction of open and low vegetation areas. Greater density of aerial drift and oviposition preference was observed in areas of open and low vegetation. The success of larval development agreed with oviposition preference for winter larval generation only. The less preferred habitats seemed to be more suitable for summer generation. The results indicated that successional changes of terrestrial chironomids can be explained by the effect of vegetation cover on oviposition habitat preference.

SP  - 787-793
AB  - Trichogramma ostriniae Pang and Chen (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) was reared continuously for seven generations on its native host, the Asian corn borer, Ostrinia-furnacalis (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae). It took 6.7 d at 33degreesC and 20 d at 17degreesC from oviposition to adult emergence with no differences between sexes. Several theoretic models were used to fit the temperature-dependent growth curves of T. ostriniae. A transformed day-degree model and the Hilbert-Logan model were the most reliable for predicting temperature development of T ostriniae. The wasps reared on O. furnacalis at 27degreesC by the seventh generation had a lower level of parasitism than wasps from other generations and at other temperatures (17-33degreesC). The number of wasps emerged from individual parasitized egg, and percentage of females produced did not differ for any generations and temperatures The differences among different generations for the amount and proportion of time female wasp spent drumming host eggs did not show any host-and generation-related trends. The time spent drumming by T ostriniae female wasps reared for three generations on O. furnacalis and then four and six generations on the rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton), differed slightly from the other generations. High variability among the tested wasps indicated that a large number of replicates would be needed to detect the probable differences among generations.

AB  - The acute whole sediment bioassay with the estuarine and marine amphipod Corophium volutator (Pallas) is broadly used within Europe. Hitherto, the test is carried out with field-collected animals. In order to provide a more standardized and continuously available test organism reproduction and growth experiments were performed for a period of one year in laboratory under simulated summer conditions (light/dark 16:8 at 15, 19, and 23 degrees C). C. volutator was the first time reproduced successfully in laboratory for several generations and independent from its natural life cycle also in winter. The females produced two to three broods with a mean number of 96 offspring. A mean growth rate of 0.07 mm per day was determined at 15 degrees C. The reproduction and growth experiments provide consequently the essential base for the development of a chronic toxicity test with C. volutator. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effect of Temperature on the Population Growth of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) on Sugarcane
VL  - 39
IS  - 3
SP  - 999-1003
AB  - The effect of temperature on the developmental time, survival, and reproduction of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) reared on sugarcane was studied at seven constant temperatures (16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, and 40 degrees C). The developmental threshold temperatures and effective accumulated temperatures for the whole generation were 17.41 degrees C and 1,590.72 DD, respectively. One generation had the highest survival rate (26.67%) at 28 degrees C. The egg failed to survive at 16 and 40 degrees C. The population trend index (I = 38.22) and net reproductive rate (R-o = 38.3) were highest at 28 degrees C. The net reproductive rate (R-o = 3.36), intrinsic rate of increase (r(m) = 0.0028), and finite capacity of increase (lambda = 1.0028) were lowest at 20 degrees C. The mean generation time (T-o = 85.82) was shortest at 36 degrees C. The population double time (PDT = 27.08) was shortest at 32 degrees C. Based on these studies, we concluded that the temperatures from 28 to 32 degrees C were the most suitable temperatures for the development of R. ferrugineus.

TI  - THREE SELECTIONS ARE BETTER THAN ONE: CLINAL VARIATION OF THERMAL QTL FROM INDEPENDENT SELECTION EXPERIMENTS IN DROSOPHILA
VL  - 64
IS  - 10
SP  - 2921-2934
AB  - We report the results of two independent selection experiments that have exposed distinct populations of Drosophila melanogaster to different forms of thermal selection. A recombinant population derived from Arvin California and Zimbabwe isofemale lines was exposed to laboratory natural selection at two temperatures (T-AZ: 18 degrees C and 28 degrees C). Microsatellite mapping identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) on the X-chromosome between the replicate "Hot" and "Cold" populations. In a separate experiment, disruptive selection was imposed on an outbred California population for the "knockdown" temperature (T-KD) in a thermal column. Microsatellite mapping of the "High" and "Low" populations also uncovered primarily X-linked QTL. Notably, a marker in the shaggy locus at band 3A was significantly differentiated in both experiments. Finer scale mapping of the 3A region has narrowed the QTL to the shaggy gene region, which contains several candidate genes that function in circadian rhythms. The same allele that was increased in frequency in the High T-KD populations is significantly clinal in North America and is more common at the warm end of the cline (Florida vs. Maine; however, the cline was not apparent in Australia). Together, these studies show that independent selection experiments can uncover the same target of selection and that evolution in the laboratory can recapitulate putatively adaptive clinal variation in nature.

AB  - There is a global push for harnessing the solar energy for electricity generation and Photovoltaic cell is the leading technology in this endeavour. However, PVCs face an imminent drop in thermal performance at elevated collector plate temperature. To deal with this conundrum, a proposed microchannels based cooling system is integrated into the collector. To this end, a comprehensive 2-D numerical model has been developed using COMSOL Multiphysics. This model has been validated with existing literature. The variation of temperature across the channel is studied under varying conditions of Reynolds number and inlet temperature of microchannel. Cooling efficiency is selected as the parameter to judge the viability of this system.

VL  - 56

SP  - 247-260
AB  - The developmental rate and reproductive biology of Neoseiulus californicus, a generalist predator on spider mites and small insects, was investigated in the laboratory at five constant temperatures: 15, 20, 25, 30, and 34A degrees C. The European red mite, Panonychus ulmi, an important pest in Korean apple orchards, was used as prey. Mean developmental time and adult longevity were inversely related to temperature from 15 to 30A degrees C. Lifetime fecundity was greatest at 25A degrees C, whereas daily fecundity was highest at 30A degrees C. The sex ratio (female to male) was highest (0.77) at 25A degrees C and lowest (0.67) at 34A degrees C. Survivorship during immature development varied from 74.3 to 92.9%, with the lowest rate at 34A degrees C. Life table parameters were analyzed and pseudo-replicates for the generation time (t (G) ), the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r (m)), finite rate of increase (lambda), net reproductive rate (R (0)), and doubling time (t (D) ) were generated using the Jackknife method. Generation time (t (G) ) was lowest (10.7 days) at 34A degrees C, R (0) was highest (49.2) at 25A degrees C, and both r (m) (0.29) and lambda (1.34) were highest at 30A degrees C. In conclusion, the development and adult life-history traits obtained for N. californicus fed on P. ulmi indicated significant potential for biological control.

TI  - Transgenerational deleterious effects of ocean acidification on the reproductive success of a keystone crustacean (Gammarus locusta)
VL  - 138
SP  - 55-64
AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) poses a global threat to marine biodiversity. Notwithstanding, marine organisms may maintain their performance under future OA conditions, either through acclimation or evolutionary adaptation. Surprisingly, the transgenerational effects of high CO2 exposure in crustaceans are still poorly understood. For the first time, the present study investigated the transgenerational effect of OA, from hatching to maturity, of a key amphipod species (Gammarus locusta). Negative transgenerational effects were observed on survival of the acidified lineage, resulting in significant declines (10-15%) compared to the control groups in each generation. Mate-guarding duration was also significantly reduced under high CO2 and this effect was not alleviated by transgenerational acclimation, indicating that precopulatory behaviours can be disturbed under a future high CO2 scenario. Although OA may initially stimulate female investment, transgenerational exposure led to a general decline in egg number and fecundity. Overall, the present findings suggest a potential fitness reduction of natural populations of G. Jocasta in a future high CO2 ocean, emphasizing the need of management tools towards species' sustainability.

TI  - Temperature-induced plasticity in egg size and resistance of eggs to temperature stress in a soil arthropod
VL  - 24
IS  - 6
SP  - 1291-1298
AB  - P>1. Temperature is considered one of the most important mediators of phenotypic plasticity in ectotherms, resulting in predictable changes in egg size. However, the fitness consequences of temperature-induced plasticity in egg size are not well understood and are often assessed at mild temperatures, whereas in the field, extreme temperatures will occur. 2. In this study we investigated egg size plasticity and fitness-linked traits of eggs in response to temperature in the springtail Orchesella cincta. Eggs were oviposited at two temperatures (16 and 20 degrees C), and transplanted to 10, 15 and 20 degrees C for rearing, or exposed to temperature shock (-6 and 38 degrees C) to measure survival, development rate and growth. 3. Eggs oviposited at 16 degrees C had a greater volume and dry weight than eggs oviposited at 20 degrees C but had similar lipid content. Eggs oviposited at 16 degrees C had high survival at all rearing temperatures, whereas survival of eggs oviposited at 20 degrees C declined at lower rearing temperatures and was significantly lower than survival of large eggs when reared at 10 and 15 degrees C. No difference in egg development rate was found between oviposition temperatures, although development rate increased with rearing temperature. Juveniles were 5-10% larger when hatching from eggs oviposited at 16 degrees C, independent of the temperature at which the eggs were reared. 4. Eggs oviposited at 16 degrees C were more resistant to thermal stress, as their survival after exposure to cold or heat shock was higher than survival of eggs oviposited at 20 degrees C. However, egg development rate of the eggs that survived temperature shock was not different from the control, independent of egg oviposition temperature. 5. Our results show that temperature-induced plasticity in O. cincta affects fitness-linked traits of offspring through increased hatchling size and increased thermal tolerance of eggs produced at lower temperatures. 6. The increased resistance to thermal stress of O. cincta eggs oviposited at lower temperatures may provide a protective strategy in uncertain thermal environments.

TI  - Improved-Fitness Dependent Optimizer Based FOI-PD Controller for Automatic Generation Control of Multi-Source Interconnected Power System in Deregulated Environment
VL  - 8
SP  - 197757-197775
AB  - This paper presents a Fractional Order Integral-Proportional Derivative (FOI-PD) controller for Automatic Generation Control (AGC) of two-area Interconnected Power System (IPS) with six multiple generations units in a restructured environment. Further, the two-area IPS is composed of multiple non-linearities with Time Delay (TD), Boiler Dynamic (BD), Governor Dead Zone/Band (GDZ/GDB) and Generation Rate Constraint (GRC). The gains of the proposed controller are optimized by a most recent powerful meta-heuristic algorithm known as Improved-Fitness Dependent Optimizer (I-FDO). The efficiency of the proposed approach is compared with other techniques such as Firefly Algorithm (FA), Fitness Dependent Optimizer (FDO) and Teaching Learning Based Optimization (TLBO) algorithms. Further, to enhance the performance of the system, Redox Flow Batteries (RFB) is incorporated in each area and Thyristor Controlled Series Compensator (TCSC) in the tie-line of the power system. Results reveal that our proposed approach performs superior in terms of less Overshoot (Os), Settling time (Ts) and Undershoot (Us). Robustness of the proposed controller is verified by changing system parameters within a range of +/- (25) %.

AB  - In this paper, the productivity of the use of sugarcane bagasse and petroleum derivatives for the generation of electric energy was evaluated using the DEAP and Malmquist indexes. The results show that the total productivity of the factors of the use of bagasse to generate electrical energy registers an interannual decrease. In the case of the use of petroleum derivatives to generate energy, the total factor productivity in general average registered deterioration; however, some of the thermal plants studied registered a growth rate. This means that there is an opportunity for the review of production processes to increase the productivity of the use of bagasse and that oil derivatives are being managed with greater productivity to generate electricity.

TI  - Preset Generation for a Steel Tandem Cold Mill by Means of a Neural Network Tool
SP  - 125-+
AB  - This paper traces the development of a software tool, based on a combination of artificial neural networks (ANN) and a few process equations, aiming to serve as a backup operation instrument in the reference generation for the real-time controllers of a steel tandem cold mill. By emulating the mathematical model responsible for generating the presets under normal operational conditions, the system works as an option to maintain plant operation in the event of a failure in the processing unit that executes the mathematical model. The system, built from the production data collected over six years of plant operation, steered to the replacement of the former backup operation mode (based on a lookup table), which degraded both product quality and plant productivity. The study showed that ANN are appropriated tools for the intended purpose and that, by this instrument, it is possible to achieve virtually all the presets needed by this kind of process. The text characterizes the problem, relates the investigated options to solve it, justifies the choice of the ANN approach, describes the methodology and system implementation and, finally, shows and discusses the attained results.

TI  - Culturing Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes with a blood substitute diet for the females
VL  - 10
IS  - 3
SP  - 265-268
AB  - The tropical house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus was cultured by feeding the females on an artificial diet, not on live animals or whole blood. This anautogenous strain has been maintained for more than fifty generations. The blood replacement diet for female mosquitoes, designed to simulate the tonicity and density of host blood, was based on ovalbumin, soya infant formula, globulins and adenosine triphosphate. Female adults of Cx quinquefasciatus were fed the artificial blood formula from 'Parafilm' wax membrane-covered beakers. The diet was heated by radiant heat from a chamber containing an exothermic chemical reaction. This maintained the diet at a temperature of 33-37 degrees C for a period of up to 6 h, sufficient time to enable all the female mosquitoes to imbibe to satiation. After six generations on the artificial diet, female fecundity stabilized to a satisfactory level: the number of eggs per gonotrophic cycle averaged c. 85% of the 'control' strain fed on whole blood from live anaesthetized guineapigs, i.e. 156 eggs per female from nine feeds on the artificial diet compared with 183 from six feeds of whole blood. Adult weight of Cx quinquefasciatus females was not significantly different, from generation 6 onwards, for strains fed on artificial diet or whole blood. Sex ratio and the rate of egg viability were also equivalent for the two strains.

VL  - 461
SP  - 407-415
AB  - Little is known about the natural ecology of European eel during early life history. We extend our understandings on the ecology of this species by studying how early life stages perform under various light regimes. We assessed the effects of intensity, photoperiod (12:12 and 24:0 h light/dark) and spectral composition on embryonic survival, hatch success, larval morphology and survival at 5 days post-hatch. Treatments consisted of low intensity white (full spectrum, 2.2 mu mol m(2) s(-1)), blue (-470 nm, 0.7 mu mol m(2) s(-1)), green (-530 nm, 0.4 mu mol m(2) s(-1)), red (-690 nm, 02 mu mol m(2) s(-1)) and high intensity white (full spectrum, 10.5 mu mol m2 5-1), blue (-470 nm, 3.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), green (-530 nm, 1.5 mu mol m(2) s(-1)), and red light (-690 nm, 1.1 mu mol m(2) s(-1)). Additionally, offspring were reared in continuous darkness (0:24 h light/dark). Results showed that light critically influenced early life stages. In particular, for the 12:12 h photoperiod, embryonic survival, until 26 h post-fertilization was significantly higher when reared under low (62 +/- 13%) than those reared under high intensity light (42 13%). Furthermore, embryos reared in low light had a higher hatch success (16 +/- 7%) than those in high intensity light (12 7%). Larval yolk-sac area was significantly affected by photoperiod and body area was significantly affected by the interaction between intensity x photoperiod. The highest incidence of deformities (75%) occurred when embryos were reared in high intensity white light under a 24:0 h light/dark photoperiod. Larval survival was significantly affected by light regime, such that larvae reared in low light intensity had higher survival (20 +/- 8%) than those reared in high intensity (11 +/- 8%), larvae reared in the 12:12 h photoperiod had higher survival (19 +/- 8%) than those reared in the 24:0 h light/dark photoperiod (13 +/- 8%), and larvae reared in red light (22 +/- 8%) had higher survival than those reared in green (14 +/- 8%) or white light (11 +/- 8%). Under continuous darkness, development and survival of offspring was as high as the best intensity-photoperiod-spectral composition regime. For all early life history traits, a strong maternal effect was evident, such that offspring of 'poorer' quality showed lower adaptability to extrinsic factors than offspring of higher quality. Together, these findings suggest a preference for no or low light during embryogenesis and no or 12:12 h low red light during the pre-leptocephalus stage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Exploitation of rapeseed and sunflower residues for methane generation through anaerobic digestion: the effect of pretreatment
VL  - 20
SP  - 253-258
AB  - The present study aimed at assessing the anaerobic digestion process efficiency on rapeseed and sunflower residues. Batch mesophilic biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests were carried out and the methane potential as well as the biodegradability of all feedstocks, were determined. The experimental studies indicated that the biological methane potential of rapeseed and sunflower meal were 0.450 m(3)/kg and 0.481 m(3)/kg, respectively. Moreover, the biological methane potential of rapeseed straws was 0.264 m(3)/kg, while the respective value from sunflower straws was 0.260 m(3)/kg. For both rapeseed and sunflower residues, the methane potential of meal residues is much higher than the respective for straws residues. A possible reason for this could be the different composition of the feedstocks in terms of lignin. various pretreatment methods, such as thermal, chemical (through alkali or acid addition) or combination of the above methods were also tested in the effort to enhance the methane productivity and yield. The experiments showed that the pretreatment methods tested did not enhance the methane potential of the rapeseed and sunflower residues. This could be attributed to the inhibitory compounds which were possibly released during the pretreatment.

AB  - Microalgae have increased in demand as raw materials for functional biomolecules and biodiesel production. Various physiological and technological approaches have been investigated for maximizing productivity of microalgae. In the present study, we investigated the optimal condition of electrolysis-based water treatment system (EWTS) applicable to mass culture of marine microalgae. The first step was an electrolysis-based chlorination process of seawater for the on-site generation of biocide solution, and the initial total residual oxidants (TROs) of 20 mg/L was sufficient to completely eliminate contaminating aquatic organisms regardless incoming seawater quality such as high total organic carbon within 24 h. The second step was neutralization of residual TRO to prevent toxicity against microalgae culture, and sodium thiosulfate of 36 mg/L was optimum against the highest estimate of TRO 20 mg/L. Tetraselmis suecica cultured in seawater from neutralized EWTS showed similar growth curve with autoclaved seawater both in laboratory and outdoor culture conditions, which suggested that EWTS could be applied as an effective tool for the generation of basic media for biomass production of microalgae in outdoor culture system.

VL  - 90
SP  - 910-916
AB  - There is a general agreement that the climate change, which is the most important challenge facing humanity, is anthropogenic and attributed to fossil fuel consumption. Therefore, deploying more renewable energy resources is an urgent issue to be addressed. Geothermal refers to existing heat energy in deep rock and sedimentary basins. Traditionally, geothermal energy has been exploited in places with plentiful hot water at relatively shallow depth. Unfortunately, the high exploration and drilling costs of boreholes is the main barrier to the commerciality of geothermal worldwide. In oil producing countries, such problems can be overcome by utilizing oil or gas wells. The current study presents thermodynamic and economic analyses of a binary geothermal power generation system for commercial electricity generation. Two different source temperatures (100 and 120 degrees C) and constant sink temperature (29 degrees C) were considered. The optimal working fluid and optimal design that improve the performance of the plant are determined. For the current costs in Qatar, the economical analysis of 5 MW geothermal plant shows that the levelized cost of electricity for the plant varies from 5.6 to 5.2 cent/kW. Whereas, the payback period of such plants lies between 5.8 and 4.8 years. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Analysis of size of offspring reared through three laboratory generations from populations of the field grasshopper Chorthippus brunneus from 27 sites around the British Isles showed that offspring were larger towards the cooler-wetter conditions in the western and northern limits of the range. This variation had a significant genetic component. There was a trade-off between clutch size and offspring size between and within populations. Under favourable thermal and feeding conditions maternal fitness was optimal when individuals produced the largest clutches of the smallest eggs, but under poor conditions maternal fitness was optimal when individuals produced small clutches of very large offspring. Calculation of geometric mean fitness over time indicated that having larger offspring near to the edge of the range could be advantageous as a conservative risk-spreading strategy. As well as geographic variation in egg size, significant environment-genotype interactions in egg size in relation to temperature were observed.

AB  - Ultraviolet (UV) light is a major cause of stress, mutation, and mortality in microorganisms, causing numerous forms of cellular damage. Nevertheless, there is tremendous variation within and among bacterial species in their sensitivity to UV light. We investigated direct and correlated responses to selection during exposure to UV. Replicate lines of Escherichia coli K12 were propagated for 600 generations, half with UV and half as a control without UV. All lines responded to selection, and we found strong positive and negative correlated responses to selection associated with increased UV resistance. Compared to Control populations, UV-selected populations increased in desiccation and starvation resistance approximately twofold but were 10 times more sensitive to hypersalinity. There was little evidence for a persistent large competitive fitness cost to UV resistance. These results suggest that natural variation in UV resistance may be maintained by trade-offs for resistance to other abiotic sources of mortality. We observed an average twofold increase in cell size by the UV-selected populations, consistent with a structural mode of adaptation to UV exposure having preadaptive and maladaptive consequences to other abiotic stresses.

AB  - A power MOSFET-based push-pull configuration nanosecond-pulse generator has been designed, constructed, and characterized to permeabilize cells for biological and medical applications. The generator can deliver pulses with durations ranging from 80 ns up to 1 mu s and pulse amplitudes up to 1.4 kV. The unit has been tested for in vitro experiments on a medulloblastoma cell line. Following the exposure of cells to 100, 200, and 300 ns electric field pulses, permeabilization tests were carried out, and viability tests were conducted to verify the performance of the generator. The maximum temperature rise of the biological load was also calculated based on Joule heating energy conservation and experimental validation. Our results indicate that the developed device has good capabilities to achieve well-controlled electro-manipulation in vitro.

TI  - High temperatures eliminate Wolbachia, a cytoplasmic incompatibility inducing endosymbiont, from the two-spotted spider mite
VL  - 23
IS  - 11
SP  - 871-881
AB  - Wolbachia can induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) in the arrhenotokous two-spotted spider mite between uninfected females and infected males. Cytoplasmic incompatibility is expressed through a male-biased sex ratio and a low hatchability, and can be suppressed by removing Wolbachia from spider mites reared on a diet with antibiotics. Here we investigated whether heat-treatment can elimate Wolbachia from infected mites. Using a PCR assay with a Wolbachia-specific primer pair (ftsZ), and by standard crosses, we were able to show that 71 per cent of the mites had lost the Wolbachia infection after rearing the infected population at 32 +/- 0.5 degrees C for four generations. The infection could be completely removed when mites were reared at 32 +/- 0.5 degrees C for six generations. Curing through high temperatures could be one of the reasons why mixed infected/uninfected populations occur in the field. An additional consequence of rearing mites at 32 +/- 0.5 degrees C was the shortened development time. The effect of environmental temperature on the abundance of Wolbachia and possible behavioural consequences for the spider mite are discussed.

TI  - Exploring the Low-Pressure Growth Limit: Evolution of Bacillus subtilis in the Laboratory to Enhanced Growth at 5 Kilopascals
VL  - 76
IS  - 22
SP  - 7559-7565
AB  - Growth of Bacillus subtilis cells, normally adapted at Earth-normal atmospheric pressure (similar to 101.3 kPa), was progressively inhibited by lowering of pressure in liquid LB medium until growth essentially ceased at 2.5 kPa. Growth inhibition was immediately reversible upon return to 101.3 kPa, albeit at a slower rate. A population of B. subtilis cells was cultivated at the near-inhibitory pressure of 5 kPa for 1,000 generations, where a stepwise increase in growth was observed, as measured by the turbidity of 24-h cultures. An isolate from the 1,000-generation population was obtained that showed an increase in fitness at 5 kPa when compared to the ancestral strain or a strain obtained from a parallel population that evolved for 1,000 generations at 101.3 kPa. The results from this preliminary study have implications for understanding the ability of terrestrial microbes to grow in low-pressure environments such as Mars.

SP  - 2571-2584
AB  - This study documents the rearing of two pygmy angelfish species, Centropyge fisheri and Centropyge resplendens, and the early life history and reproduction of their hybrid offspring. A C. fisheri female, collected from Hawaii, and a C. resplendens male, captive-bred from parental stock collected from Ascension Island, were maintained at the hatchery facility for 7 months. Continuous spawning was achieved at a photoperiod cycle of 14L:10D and a water temperature of 26.5 degrees C, range +/- 1 degrees C. Over the 110 day period, the C. fisheri female spawned 102 times, 57% of which resulted in embryos (fertilized eggs). The mean +/- s.d. fecundity per spawn was 730 +/- 459 eggs (range 52-1967). Fertility (% eggs that developed into embryos) of all eggs that were preserved was 22.4 +/- 25.6%. A total of 235 hybrid juveniles were raised through metamorphosis with an average larval survival of 16.4%. Eight F-1 hybrid juveniles isolated for further study began to display signs of reproductive behaviour c. 300 days post-hatch (dph). Spawn resulting in non-fertile eggs were first obtained 319 dph, and fertilized eggs developing into embryos were obtained after 411 dph from at least two female individuals. While no attempt was made at rearing the F-2 larvae, embryo and larval development were normal up to 8 dph. Reproduction and development observed for all hybrid generations in this study were normal, similar to other Centropyge species and indicates a very close phylogenetic relationship between what are currently considered distinct species, e.g. C. fisheri and C. resplendens.

TI  - LIFE HISTORIES AND ABUNDANCE PATTERNS OF SNAG-DWELLING MAYFLIES IN A BLACKWATER COASTAL-PLAIN RIVER
VL  - 10
IS  - 4
SP  - 372-387
AB  - A diverse mayfly community (28 species) was found in the Ogeechee River, a blackwater river in the Georgia Coastal Plain. Quantitative samples of snag habitat, where most species (22) were found, were collected at 2-4 wk intervals in 1982 to investigate life history characteristics, and at monthly intervals in 1983 to determine consistency of seasonal and annual abundance patterns. Baetidae and Heptageniidae were abundant throughout each year with average densities of 1553-5981/m2 (1982-1983) and 1498-1828/m2 of snag surface, respectively. Field data for the most common species of Baetidae (Baetis ephippiatus, B. intercalaris) and Heptageniidae (Stenonema exiguum, S. integrum, S. modestum) showed no recognizable pattern of cohort development. This developmental asynchrony and long emergence periods for S. exiguum and S. modestum are consistent with previously published growth studies indicating multivoltinism. Ephemerellidae (551-719/m2), Oligoneuriidae (206-469/m2), Tricorythidae (721-1599/m2) and Caenidae (114-110/m2) were also commonly found on snags, but were seasonal in abundance. The major species of Ephemerellidae (Ephemerella argo, E. dorothea, Eurylophella sp.) showed distinct single cohorts developing primarily during winter/spring. Isonychia spp. (Oligoneuriidae) also showed a well-defined winter cohort, but had as many as two weakly defined cohorts during warm months. Caenis spp. (Caenidae) and Tricorythodes sp. (Tricorythidae) occurred primarily in summer months, during which time they were able to pass through multiple generations, as substantiated by either long emergence periods or independent growth studies. Major differences in life histories occurred between rather than within families. Relative abundance and seasonality at the family level were very consistent between years. The high degree of life history overlap in this diverse mayfly assemblage raises questions about the relationship between phenology and community structure, as well as latitudinal patterns of species richness.

TI  - Comparative study of working fluids for a Rankine cycle operating at low temperature
VL  - 103
SP  - 71-77
AB  - The main results of a thermodynamic study on the use of a low temperature heat source (150 degrees C as maximum) for power generation through a basic Rankine are reported in this paper. Different working fluids such as water and some hydrocarbons and coolants are studied. The procedure consisted in modifying the input pressure and temperature to the turbine. The efficiency for these fluids is a weak function of temperature, i.e., overheating the inlet fluid to the turbine does not cause a significant change in the efficiency. However, when the pressure ratio in the turbine increases, much larger values of efficiency are obtained, and also, as the input temperature to the turbine rises, the efficiency increases more sharply. As result, a maximum efficiency of 9% was obtained. It is shown the technical viability of implementing this type of process for recovering residual wastes for very low temperature, as well as an energy alternative and/or strengthener of non-conventional energy sources in non-provided zones.

VL  - 222

SP  - 614-627
AB  - Biological invasions provide opportunities to study evolutionary processes occurring over contemporary timescales. To explore the speed and repeatability of adaptation, we examined the divergence of life-history traits to climate, using latitude as a proxy, in the native North American and introduced European and Australian ranges of the annual plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia. We explored niche changes following introductions using climate niche dynamic models. In a common garden, we examined trait divergence by growing seeds collected across three ranges with highly distinct demographic histories. Heterozygosity-fitness associations were used to explore the effect of invasion history on potential success. We accounted for nonadaptive population differentiation using 11 598 single nucleotide polymorphisms. We revealed a centroid shift to warmer, wetter climates in the introduced ranges. We identified repeated latitudinal divergence in life-history traits, with European and Australian populations positioned at either end of the native clines. Our data indicate rapid and repeated adaptation to local climates despite the recent introductions and a bottleneck limiting genetic variation in Australia. Centroid shifts in the introduced ranges suggest adaptation to more productive environments, potentially contributing to trait divergence between the ranges.

TI  - MORTALITY OF OVERWINTERING EGGS AND LARVAE OF THE ALFALFA WEEVIL IN OKLAHOMA
VL  - 23
IS  - 1
SP  - 35-40
AB  - The alfalfa weevil, Hypera postica (Gyllenhal), is a univoltine species whose primary period of oviposition is during fall and winter in Oklahoma, with hatching typically occuring in late winter and spring. The objectives of this study were to estimate the total number of eggs laid per generation by the alfalfa weevil, the mortality of eggs through the winter, and reductions in numbers of newly hatched larvae resulting from lethal low temperatures. The study was conducted in alfalfa fields located at Stillwater (northern) and Chickasha (southern), OK, from 1980 to 1990. Population densities of eggs and larvae of the weevil were determined at regular intervals from October to May for each generation. Subsamples of eggs were reared for viability estimates. A summation procedure was used to calculate total eggs laid per generation. Mean total egg production per generation exceeded 900 per 0.1 m2 at each location. Mortality of eggs averaged about 30% resulting from low temperatures (< -15-degrees-C). In most years, hatching began before the last occurrence of temperatures below -6-degrees-C. These temperatures killed most alfalfa top growth and most larvae that were present. Combined mortality of eggs and larvae hatching during winter resulted in an average reduction of 38% in the reproductive potential for the weevil.

TI  - Limits to compensatory responses to altered phenology in amphibian larvae
VL  - 130
IS  - 2
SP  - 231-239
AB  - Changes in phenology are among the most pervasive effects of current climate change. Modifications in the timing of life-cycle events can affect the behavior, physiology and life-history of wildlife. However, organisms can develop compensatory strategies in order to reduce the costs of phenological alterations. Here, we examine the extent and limits of compensatory developmental responses in amphibian larvae exposed to variation in hatching timing. Using a common-garden experiment, we analyze how changes in temperature and food conditions alter compensatory responses to hatching delay, paying particular attention at how adverse environmental conditions can constrain these responses. We found that under benign conditions (warm temperature, unrestricted food) larvae fully compensate for the hatching delay, without cost in mass. However, under detrimental conditions (cold temperature and restricted food) these responses were prevented, and the combination of adverse conditions with long hatching delay completely disrupt compensatory responses. This study highlights the need of examining ecological responses to climate variation across a broad spectrum of environmental conditions in order to accurately predict the putative effect that climatic alterations can have on the life-histories and survival of wildlife.

TI  - A generic framework for overpressure generation in sedimentary sequences under thermal perturbations
VL  - 124
AB  - Abnormal pore pressures in excess of the hydrostatic equilibrium are observed in natural and artificial sediment systems worldwide. Such overpressure exerts a fundamental control over the diagenesis, stability, and productivity of both sedimentary reservoirs. The basin dynamics for overpressure generation involve complex THMC processes during sediment accumulation. In this paper, we develop a generic framework for thermochemical consolidation in natural and artificial sedimentary sequences by extending Biot's classical poroelasticity. The proposed theoretical model is then conveniently recast into an explicit form for one-dimensional sedimentation. The resulting formulation essentially extends the original Gibson's theory by incorporating coupled THMC effects in general sedimentary sequences, and a hierarchical scrutiny of different overpressuring mechanisms thus becomes straightforward. Moreover, a closed-form equation is derived from the new chemothermo-poroelasticity model for accreting sediments, and the critical temperature for pore pressure changes via hydration/dehydration is thus determined. The model demonstrates that overpressuring and depressuring are not mutually exclusive because of the competition between water volume changes and thermal strains induced by chemical reactions. By using evolutive properties of a reactive artificial sediment, our model calculations have highlighted the critical influences of the sediment and environment temperatures and deposition rate on the contribution of each overpressuring mechanism.

TI  - Productivity of the calanoid copepod Acartia tropica in response to different salinities and multigenerational acclimatization
VL  - 531
AB  - Copepods form the natural prey item for the vast majority of marine fish larvae in the wild. The tropical estuarine calanoid copepod Acartia tropica is a potential live feed for finfish larviculture because of their higher fecundity and wide salinity tolerance. The present study was aimed at identifying the optimal salinity for obtaining maximum production of A. tropica nauplii. Population growth, intrinsic rate of population increase, egg production (eggs female(-1) day(-1)), egg hatching success (EHS) and nauplii survival (%) of A. tropica were assessed at different salinity levels. Similarly, the effect of long term acclimatization on population growth of A. tropica was also studied. The experimental salinity range was set to be 5-30 ppt based on the abrupt salinity change experiment. Highest mean population count (1265 +/- 209) and intrinsic rate of population increase (0.493 +/- 0.01) were recorded at 15 ppt which was significantly higher (p<0.05) than other salinity treatments except for 20 ppt (1005 +/- 129, 0.481 +/- 0.01). The lowest mean population count and intrinsic rate of population increase were recorded at 30 ppt (80.75 +/- 17.86, 0.32 +/- 0.003). The highest mean daily egg production was recorded at 15 ppt (33.42 +/- 5.88) which was significantly different (p<0.05) from all other treatments. Nauplii survival at 15 ppt (79.73 +/- 4.86) was significantly higher (p<0.05) except for 20 ppt (73.81 +/- 5.62). However different salinity conditions did not affect EHS and sex ratio of adults in the present study. Multigenerational acclimatization significantly improved the population growth and mean daily egg production of A. tropica at 30 ppt (558.30 +/- 35, 25.80 +/- 4.00). Hence the present study suggests that the salinity range of 15-20 ppt supports the maximum productivity of A. tropica and it can be well adapted to higher salinity conditions through multigenerational acclimatization.

VL  - 126
SP  - 1337-1346
AB  - Analysis regarding entropy generation has turn out to be a useful approach to address refinements in thermal characteristics since it yields an intuition which cannot be acquired through energy analysis. The rate of entropy generation appropriately computes thermodynamic irreversibilities. Thus a decay of entropy productivity results in more effective energy transport mechanisms. Keeping aforementioned effectiveness in mind we aimed to elaborate entropy generation characteristics in unsteady nonlinear convective nanoliquid flow towards convectively heated permeable surface. Magneto nanomaterial model featuring thermophoretic and Brownian diffusion characteristics is considered. Thermodynamic second relation is utilized for entropy generation analysis. Modeling is arranged for viscous dissipation, heat generation, nonlinear radiation and Joule dissipation. Boundary-layer concept is opted for formulation. Influence of distinct variables velocity, temperature and concentration are discussed In addition rate of total entropy generation is highlighted. Besides, the gradients (velocity, thermal and solutal) are calculated and analyzed. We noted increasing trend for Brinkman number, magnetic and permeability parameters versus entropy generation rate. Further the Bejan number has opposite outcomes versus Brinkman number and radiation parameter. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparative transcriptome analysis of the rice leaf folder (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis) to heat acclimation
VL  - 21
IS  - 1
AB  - Background The rice leaf folderCnaphalocrocis medinalisGuenee is a serious insect pest of rice in Asia. This pest occurs in summer, and it is sensitive to high temperature. However, the larvae exhibit heat acclimation/adaptation. To understand the underlying mechanisms, we established a heat-acclimated strain via multigenerational selection at 39 degrees C. After heat shock at 41 degrees C for 1 h, the transcriptomes of the heat-acclimated (S-39) and unacclimated (S-27) larvae were sequenced, using the unacclimated larvae without exposure to 41 degrees C as the control. Results Five generations of selection at 39 degrees C led larvae to acclimate to this heat stress. Exposure to 41 degrees C induced 1160 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the heat-acclimated and unacclimated larvae. Both the heat-acclimated and unacclimated larvae responded to heat stress via upregulating genes related to sensory organ development and structural constituent of eye lens, whereas the unacclimated larvae also upregulated genes related to structural constituent of cuticle. Compared to unacclimated larvae, heat-acclimated larvae downregulated oxidoreductase activity-related genes when encountering heat shock. Both the acclimated and unacclimated larvae adjusted the longevity regulating, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, antigen processing and presentation, MAPK and estrogen signaling pathway to responsed to heat stress. Additionally, the unacclimated larvae also adjusted the spliceosome pathway, whereas the heat-acclimated larvae adjusted the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids pathway when encountering heat stress. Although the heat-acclimated and unacclimated larvae upregulated expression of heat shock protein genes under heat stress includingHSP70,HSP27andCRYAB, their biosynthesis, metabolism and detoxification-related genes expressed differentially. Conclusions The rice leaf folder larvae could acclimate to a high temperature via multigenerational heat selection. The heat-acclimated larvae induced more DEGs to response to heat shock than the unacclimated larvae. The changes in transcript level of genes were related to heat acclimation of larvae, especially these genes in sensory organ development, structural constituent of eye lens, and oxidoreductase activity. The DEGs between heat-acclimated and unacclimated larvae after heat shock were enriched in the biosynthesis and metabolism pathways. These results are helpful to understand the molecular mechanism underlying heat acclimation of insects.

AB  - Life histories for the trichopteran species Agapetus illini, Chimarra aterrima, C. obscura, Helicopsyche limnella, Polycentropus centralis, and Wormaldia moesta were estimated by determining the seasonal occurrence and relative abundance of larval instars and pupae, and from adult collections. Head capsule width measurements revealed that all of the species had five larval instars. Agapetus illini and W. moesta were univoltine, but bivoltine life histories with overlapping generations were observed for C aterrima, C obscura, H. limnella, and P. centralis. Adults of bivoltine species were prevalent from early spring through late autumn, and larval recruitment from reproduction occurred throughout adult flight periods. Adults of univoltine species (A. illini and W. moesta) were collected only during May. Bivoltinism appears to be a common life-history pattern in warmwater streams of southern latitudes in North America.

TI  - Environmentally-induced parental or developmental conditioning influences coral offspring ecological performance
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - The persistence of reef building corals is threatened by human-induced environmental change. Maintaining coral reefs into the future requires not only the survival of adults, but also the influx of recruits to promote genetic diversity and retain cover following adult mortality. Few studies examine the linkages among multiple life stages of corals, despite a growing knowledge of carryover effects in other systems. We provide a novel test of coral parental conditioning to ocean acidification (OA) and tracking of offspring for 6 months post-release to better understand parental or developmental priming impacts on the processes of offspring recruitment and growth. Coral planulation was tracked for 3 months following adult exposure to high pCO(2) and offspring from the second month were reciprocally exposed to ambient and high pCO(2) for an additional 6 months. Offspring of parents exposed to high pCO(2) had greater settlement and survivorship immediately following release, retained survivorship benefits during 1 and 6 months of continued exposure, and further displayed growth benefits to at least 1 month post release. Enhanced performance of offspring from parents exposed to high conditions was maintained despite the survivorship in both treatments declining in continued exposure to OA. Conditioning of the adults while they brood their larvae, or developmental acclimation of the larvae inside the adult polyps, may provide a form of hormetic conditioning, or environmental priming that elicits stimulatory effects. Defining mechanisms of positive acclimatization, with potential implications for carry over effects, cross-generational plasticity, and multi-generational plasticity, is critical to better understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics of corals under regimes of increasing environmental disturbance. Considering environmentally-induced parental or developmental legacies in ecological and evolutionary projections may better account for coral reef response to the chronic stress regimes characteristic of climate change.

TI  - Climate change and fish culture in Patagonia: present situation and perspectives
VL  - 42
IS  - 6
SP  - 787-796
AB  - Temperature increment is one of the most visible aspects of climate change. Reservoirs in northern Patagonia are the main location for rainbow trout cage aquaculture activities in Argentina and here, surface water temperature shows an increment that despite leading towards better growth rates, also provokes lack of ovulation, atresia and a partial or total absence of spawning during the breeding season. During the early life history, low survival rates at hatching and first feeding are also observed. The increase in market size (> 2 kg) has changed management practices, minimizing the difference between brood stock and individuals destined for consumption. Thus, the present situation differs deeply from carrying capacities forecasted few years ago and this analysis attempts to contribute to management policies including the idea of adaptation to climate change in the making of decisions.

TI  - Effects of elevated CO2 associated with maize on multiple generations of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera
VL  - 136
IS  - 1
SP  - 12-20
AB  - Under elevated environmental carbon dioxide (CO2), leaf chewers tend to compensate for decreased leaf nutritional quality with increased consumption; mortality and development times also increase and cause a reduction in the fitness of leaf chewers. However, the effect of elevated CO2 on multiple successive generations of these and other insects is not well understood. Furthermore, information about the direct effects of increased environmental CO2 on developmental time and consumption of herbivores is lacking. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that cascade effects of elevated CO2 through plants, rather than the direct effects of elevated CO2, are the main factors decreasing the fitness of cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera Hubner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). We used two series of experiments to quantify the growth, development, and consumption of H. armigera fed on an artificial diet or C-4 plants (maize) grown under two CO2 levels (ambient vs. double ambient). In the first series of experiments, elevated CO2 had no effect on the population abundance or individual consumption for three successive generations of cotton bollworms fed on an artificial diet. In the second series of experiments, elevated CO2 reduced population abundance of cotton bollworm larvae for two successive generations when they were fed maize milky grains. The specific effects were longer larval duration, lower fecundity, and decreased r(m) of cotton bollworms. Furthermore, elevated CO2 increased individual consumption when cotton bollworm was fed maize milky grains for two successive generations and decreased the population's total consumption in the first generation but increased it in the second generation. The results from this study indicate that: (1) The effects of elevated CO2 on three successive generations of cotton bollworm fed on artificial diet were weak, or even non-existent, and (2) elevated CO2 increased the consumption when cotton bollworm were fed maize. Our study also suggests that the damage inflicted by cotton bollworm on maize (a C-4 plant) will be seriously affected by the increases in atmospheric CO2, which is unlike our previous results for spring wheat (a C-3 plant).

TI  - Transgenerational effects of methyl farnesoate on Daphnia pulex clones: Male and ephippia production and expression of genes involved in sex determination
VL  - 66
IS  - 2
SP  - 374-390
AB  - Environmental sex determination implies that sex is defined by environmental factors influencing the maternal organism and/or oocytes. It provides population sex ratios that will maximise the sustainability of the population under incipient environmental conditions. Environmental factors responsible for sex determination include temperature, photoperiod, food availability, and population density. These cues stimulate the release of chemical signalling molecules (i.e. hormones) that determine the sex of newborns. We have analysed the responses of three Daphnia pulex clones (I, K, and S), isolated from different natural populations, to juvenile hormone methyl farnesoate (MF) in terms of survivorship, fecundity, production of males and ephippia, and expression of genes involved in sex determination (dsx1) and hormonal regulation (JHAMT, Met, RXR). Clonal individuals were exposed to: (1) high MF concentration (0.8 mu M) combined with stressful conditions; (2) low MF concentration (0.15 mu M) combined with optimal conditions of population density and food availability in two subsequent generations. The genetically different clones of D. pulex differed in the propensity for male and ephippia production and in the sensitivity to the stimuli that lead to the switch from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction. A significant induction of male production was observed in all three clones when exposed to MF. In conditions mimicking crowding, only clone S produced male offspring even in absence of MF and showed higher expression levels of JHAMT and dsx1 genes. This response suggests that clone S has a high propensity to produce males probably due to a high sensitivity of receptors to environmental stimuli activating the endogenous biosynthesis of MF. However, clone S exposed to high MF concentration produced fewer males than clones I and K, which generally have a low natural propensity to produce males. High MF concentration coupled with conditions mimicking crowding, probably activated a feedback mechanism in clone S via the differential modulation of genes involved in the synthesis as well in the degradation of MF. Exposure to low MF concentration for two subsequent generations resulted in a reduction of male progeny production from the first (G1) to the second (G2) generation. All analysed genes were up-regulated in both generations treated with MF, but with lower expression in G2. The reduced up-regulation of the dsx1 gene matched with the lower male production. Based on our results and literature data, we hypothesised that the maternal dsx1 mRNA probably plays some role early in oocyte development, and causes the eggs that receive the dsx1 signal to develop into males. Exposure to MF for two generations significantly increased ephippia production. These results suggest that the induction of male and ephippia might have a common root in the MF pathway. The effect of MF on life-history traits (delay in the age at maturity and fecundity reduction), sex ratio, and ephippia production suggests a direct impact of the juvenile hormone on the level of population growth. Thus, as a consequence of the switch from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction, MF influences Daphnia population metrics and in this way probably maximises the sustainability of the population under variable environmental conditions.

TI  - Life cycle of Musculium lacustre (Bivalvia : Sphaeriidae) in the Saone River at Lyon (France) : a curious life strategy
VL  - 40
IS  - 4
SP  - 279-284
AB  - The life cycle of Musculium lacustre populations in the Saone river at Lyon was studied over a three-years period. Following the growth period which occurs from March to June, adults released larvae, then disappeared during the summer. Only a few newborn of the new generation that appeared in May and June grow and give birth to a second generation at the end of summer or in autumn. Most of the juveniles of the first generation estivate, then hibernate with those of the second generation until the following spring. The individuals of each generation only reproduce once (semelparity). Longevity of M. lacustre is from 13 to 14 months. In 2001, the spring flood disturbed the progress of the life cycle and delayed the appearance of the new generation for one month. In 2003, a large accumulation of dead leaves at the beginning of winter and high spring temperatures led to considerable production of larvae. However, this was not followed by an increase in numbers: high mortality among the newborn occurred during May and June. These observations suggest that M. lacustre populations of the Saone are habitually food-limited. Nonetheless, the life cycle strategy adopted by this bivalve enabled it to withstand the high summer temperatures of 2003 as opposed to other Sphaeriidae (Pisidium) which disappeared in August.

TI  - Thermal modeling of ingot chain production
SP  - 1099-1105
AB  - Ingot chain casthouses are generally confronted with classical problems of productivity and reliability, sometimes difficult to analyze. Pechiney has developed a thermal model adapted to ingot chains in order to quantify the influence of the main process parameters. The PAMCAST/SIMULOR(R) software, dedicated to foundry casting, was used. The model uses industrial measurements and heat transfer coefficients determined in the laboratory. Among the many parameters explored with the model, the calculations show that the main parameters governing the productivity of the ingot chain are the water / mold heat transfer and the coating of the molds. The model is and will be used as a tool for optimizing present chains as well as for designing future generation ingot chains.

TI  - Upper thermal limits in terrestrial ectotherms: how constrained are they?
VL  - 27
IS  - 4
SP  - 934-949
AB  - 1. Terrestrial ectotherms are likely to face increased periods of heat stress as mean temperatures and temperature variability increase over the next few decades. Here, we consider the extent to which changes in upper thermal limits, through plasticity or evolution, might be constrained, and we survey insect and reptile data to identify groups likely to be particularly susceptible to thermal stress. 2. Plastic changes increase thermal limits in many terrestrial ectotherms, but tend to have less effect on upper limits than lower limits. 3. Although comparisons across insect species have normally not taken into account the potential for plastic responses, mid-latitude species seem most prone to experience heat stress now and into the future, consistent with data from lizards and other groups. 4. Evolutionary adaptive potential has only been measured for some species; there is likely to be genetic variation for heat responses in populations, but selection and heritability experiments suggest that upper thermal limits may not increase much. 5. Although related species can differ by several degrees in their upper thermal limits, there is strong phylogenetic signal for upper limits. If these reflect evolutionary constraints, substantial molecular changes may be required to increase upper thermal limits. 6. Findings point to many terrestrial ectotherms having a limited potential to change their thermal limits particularly within the context of an average predicted temperature increase of 2-4 degrees C for mid-latitude populations over the next few decades.
