AB  - P>The objective of this study was to assess the effects of an activating solution on the sperm motility duration (SMD) of 'curimbata', Prochilodus lineatus through of the definition of qualitative and quantitative parameters of the semen pool used in the experiment; evaluation of the effects of different ratios of semen dilution corresponding to 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 20, 1 : 200, 1 : 2000, 1 : 20 000 and 1 : 100 000 semen:dilute solution on the SMD and, assessment of the effects of different temperatures of the activating solution (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 degrees C) on the SMD. The results of SMD were directly proportional to the dilution (P < 0.05), starting from the dilution of 1 : 2 (semen:water), with 23.04 s. Were used three replicates of the semen pool for each test. Two-year-old brookstock were maintained in ponds culture conditions. In November-December 2006, twelve mature males broodfish were selected (mean weight and length of 405.8 +/- 134.2 g and 25.6 +/- 3.1 cm, respectively). The males released that semen under slight pressure of the urogenital papilla were selected for the experiment. The SMD increased proportionally to the increase in dilution, until it reached a maximum of 28.83 s for the ratio 1 : 100 000 semen: dilute solution. The results of SMD in relation to the temperature of the activating solution exhibited a quadratic behavior (P < 0.05) with a maximum theoretical performance in terms of sperm motility duration of 21.36 s at a temperature of 17.3 degrees C. Thus, for the species considered, the increase in the dilution ratio proved favorable for the rise in motility duration until the maximum value studied of 1 : 100 000 semen:dilute solution. As for the temperature of the activating solution, the best results of SMD were obtained at the temperature of 17.3 degrees C. At higher temperatures used in the experiment (25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 degrees C), a decrease in motility duration.

AB  - The Litopenaeus vannamei is one of the most important economical shell fish in throughout the world. Mineral deposition is a continuous problem in Litopenaeus vannamei culture pond in world wild. The current study to compares the water quality parameters, shrimp growth biomass, and mortality rates during harvest between three ponds. Experimental setup was selected three different ponds (brackish water pond, bore well pond, and bore well resevoir pond) were seeded with the same density of the Litopenaeus vannamei at Pennar River Andhra Pradesh, south India. The primary differences between the ponds were as the water source; one pond was filled from the estuary, estuarine-water was fed to the pond, the second one was taken from bore wells with high alkalinity, and there'd one filled from bore well resevoir pond. Temperature in three ponds was varied and it reached up to 29.6°C after 125 days of culture. Dissolved oxygen (DO) levels were varied within the acceptable range although levels in the alkaline pond were as near the lower limit in the last 90 days before harvest. Salinity levels were varied in three ponds, above optimal levels and increased over the 120 days. Alkalinity in the estuarine water was typically &lt;100 ppm and whereas (275-399 ppm) in the alkaline pond. In the alkaline pond, beginning on 75th day the mineral deposits was observed all parts of shrimp over the body and it's including the eye and the inner gill chambers after harvest, 42% of the shrimp showed this coating. The initial stages of the mineral deposits on shrimps showed pale yellow colour. Elemental analysis identified the major constituents was present in the sample as Manganese, Sodium, Chlorine, Magnesium, Aluminium, Silica, Iron and Calcium. Survival rates of shrimps in the estuarine-waterfed pond was 92% with a total pond biomass at harvest was 1.65 tons ha-1 compared to survival rates of 79% in the alkaline pond and a biomass at harvest was 1.020 tons ha-1. When quality water may be used, its alkalinity should be monitored and diluted with water from other sources. © 2014 Sakthivel A, et al.

VL  - 53

SP  - 2101-2116
AB  - Interest in the genomics of Eucalyptus has skyrocketed thanks to the recent sequencing of the genome of Eucalyptus grandis and to a growing number of large-scale transcriptomic studies. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) is the method of choice for gene expression analysis and can now also be used as a high-throughput method. The selection of appropriate internal controls is becoming of utmost importance to ensure accurate expression results in Eucalyptus. To this end, we selected 21 candidate reference genes and used high-throughput microfluidic dynamic arrays to assess their expression among a large panel of developmental and environmental conditions with a special focus on wood-forming tissues. We analyzed the expression stability of these genes by using three distinct statistical algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder andδCt), and used principal component analysis to compare methods and rankings. We showed that the most stable genes identified depended not only on the panel of biological samples considered but also on the statistical method used. We then developed a comprehensive integration of the rankings generated by the three methods and identified the optimal reference genes for 17 distinct experimental sets covering 13 organs and tissues, as well as various developmental and environmental conditions. The expression patterns of Eucalyptus master genes EgMYB1 and EgMYB2 experimentally validated our selection. Our findings provide an important resource for the selection of appropriate reference genes for accurate and reliable normalization of gene expression data in the organs and tissues of Eucalyptus trees grown in a range of conditions including abiotic stresses. © 2012 The Author.

TI  - The Temperature-Dependent Selectivity of Potential Interaction Partners for the Small Heat Shock Protein IbpA from Acholeplasma laidlawii
VL  - 6
IS  - 4
SP  - 437-442
AB  - Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) of α-crystalline type play a key role in the cell survival under stress conditions by preventing irreversible denaturation and aggregation of proteins. In contrast to most Mollicutes (mycoplasmas) where no sHsps were found, recently, some sHsp homologs were identified in the Acholeplasmataceae family, including Acholeplasma laidlawii, the only representative of Mollicutes that is known to survive in a host-free environment. Using pull-down followed by LC-MS, we identified the potential target proteins co-eluting with IbpA from the A. laidlawii cell extracts after exposition to low- and high temperatures. 308 and 464 proteins were co-eluted with IbpA from the cold- and heat-treated extracts, respectively, while only 240 of them were co-eluted with sHsp independently of the temperature. Most of potential IbpA targets were identified as enzymes involved in biosynthetic cycles and energy metabolism. We show IbpA specificity for target proteins on the incubation temperature. Significant differences between protein pools co-eluting specifically with IbpA at either 4 or 46 °C could be observed in terms of their aliphatic index, charge, molecular weight, and isoelectric point. Interestingly, only the isoelectric point distribution significantly differed between the protein pool co-eluting with IbpA under cooling (4 °C) and the entire proteome. In contrast, significant discrepancies in the distributions of aliphatic index, charge, hydropathy, molecular weight, and isoelectric point could be observed between the pool of proteins co-eluting with IbpA under heating (46 °C) and the entire proteome, indicating that there is likely a complex selective mechanism for proteins interaction with IbpA under heat shock conditions. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

TI  - Latitudinal differences in Mytilus californianus thermal physiology
VL  - 450
SP  - 93-105
AB  - The California ribbed mussel Mytilus californianus (Conrad 1837) is a dominant intertidal species that ranges from Alaska (USA) to Baja California (Mexico) along the west coast of North America. Despite its broad latitudinal range, which results in populations living at widely different temperatures, multiple studies have concluded that this species is genetically homogenous. This may be due to high gene flow, which would inhibit local adaptation, and lack of strong post-settlement selection pressure, which would not favor shifts in allelic frequencies among sites. We investigated several physiological traits that show temperature-adaptive variation in other Mytilus species. We sampled populations of M. californianus at 7 sites across 33° of latitude to test for the possibility of local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity. Individuals acclimated to common conditions were examined for possible differences in whole-organism thermal tolerance. The most northern population (Tatoosh Island) had a significantly lower survival rate following an acute heat stress event than the other populations. Additional physiological processes were examined that affect thermal optima and limits: critical thermal maximum (Hcrit) of cardiac function and metabolic capacity (as indexed by tissue activity of an indicator enzyme, malate dehydrogenase). Tatoosh mussels had a significantly lower Hcrit than other sites, indicating that this population may be adapted to cooler conditions compared to other populations. Metabolic activity did not correlate with latitude of collection. Phenotypic plasticity at the adult stage did not explain differences in thermal tolerance. Thus, genetic differences (local adaptation or balanced polymorphism), developmental plasticity, maternal effects, or within-site thermal heterogeneity may be responsible for the observed variation among populations. © Inter-Research 2012.

TI  - Which environmental factors control phytoplankton populations? A Bayesian variable selection approach
VL  - 269
SP  - 1-8
AB  - The structure of phytoplankton communities is thought to influence total productivity, trophic structure and the export of carbon below the mixed layer. Community structure is determined by a complex interaction between the physiological characteristics of each species, environmental conditions, resource availability, competition among species, and numerous loss terms. This complexity makes it very difficult to predict how changes in environmental conditions will alter the structure of phytoplankton communities. Here we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model with variable selection to identify how temperature, salinity, irradiance, and macronutrient concentrations determine the abundance of the 67 dominant identified species at Station CARIACO in the Caribbean Sea. This approach allows us to overcome the statistical challenge presented by the highly correlated environmental variables. Approximately three-quarters of the variables for each species have little effect on phytoplankton abundance. About half of the species decline in abundance with increasing temperature. Diatom species' abundances are much more likely to respond to changes in irradiance and nitrate concentration than dinoflagellates and dinoflagellate species' abundances are more likely to respond to changes in salinity.

SP  - 1-16
AB  - This paper reviews the progression of refrigerants from inception of mechanical refrigeration to the present. It divides historical and current refrigerants into separate generations and discusses the selection criteria distinguishing them. The four generations include slightly overlapping periods based on whatever worked (1830s-1930s), improved safety and durability (1931-1990s), stratospheric ozone protection (1990s-2010s), and attention to global warming (2012-?). The paper discusses the primary refrigerants employed in each period and goes on to examine the viability of the imminent fourth generation, responding to limits and anticipated limits to acceptable refrigerant global warming potential (GWP). The paper presents factors challenging or likely to challenge the fourth generation refrigerants. Among the potential driving factors are efficiency, momentum, prices, litigation and liability, unforeseen suitability issues, local impacts, and political naïveté. The paper summarizes impacts from these concerns, individually or in combination, and their potential to necessitate a subsequent fifth generation. Notwithstanding the controversial and uncertain nature of predictions, the paper suggests an approach to selecting future refrigerants in the absence of ideal choices and of new chemical families that might better approach them. Despite what many practitioners now consider the second transition during their careers, retiring still new but now familiar candidates (or a third transition including the earlier advent of fluorochemicals), the paper concludes that industry must choose between forward-looking selections, which go beyond minimum mandates, or face refrigerant transitions ... again. © 2012 ASHRAE.

AB  - Summary In many ecosystems, increases in vegetation density and the resulting closure of forest canopies are threatening the viability of species that depend upon open, sunlight-exposed habitats. Consequently, we need to develop management strategies that recreate open habitats while minimizing the impacts on non-target areas. Selective logging creates canopy gaps, but may result in undesirable effects in other respects. Thus, chainsaws have not been a popular tool for conservation. We conducted a landscape-scale experiment to test whether selective tree removal can restore patch-level habitat quality for Australia's most endangered snake (Hoplocephalus bungaroides) and its main prey (the lizard Oedura lesueurii). We selectively removed canopy trees surrounding 25 overgrown rock outcrops and compared the resultant habitat structure and abiotic conditions to 30 overgrown, shady outcrops and 20 open, sunny outcrops. Removing vegetation decreased canopy cover by 19% in experimental plots and increased incident radiation and thermal regimes. These changes increased the availability of suitable shelter sites for our target species by 131%. At the landscape scale, our manipulations had a trivial effect on forest habitat; by increasing the area of sun-exposed outcrops, we decreased forest cover by <0.1%. Our results show that targeted canopy removal can increase the availability of sun-exposed habitat patches for endangered species in biologically meaningful ways. Thus, selective tree felling may be an effective conservation tool for open-habitat specialists threatened by vegetation overgrowth. © 2011 Ecological Society of Australia.

AB  - The influence of drying temperature, sample slice thickness, and pretreatment on quality attributes like rehydration ratio, scavenging activity, color (in terms of nonenzymatic browning), and texture (in terms of hardness) of culinary banana (Musa ABB) has been evaluated in the present study. A comparative approach was made between artificial neural network (ANN) and response surface methodology (RSM) to predict various parameters for vacuum drying of culinary banana. The effect of process variables on responses during dehydration were investigated using general factorial experimental design. This design was used to train feed-forward back-propagation ANN. The predictive capabilities of these two methodologies for optimization of process parameters were compared in terms of relative deviation (Rd). Results revealed that a properly trained ANN model is found to be more accurate in prediction as compared to RSM. The optimum condition selected from ANN/GA responses on the basis of highest fitness value revealed that culinary banana slices of 6 mm thickness pretreated with 1% citric acid and dried at 76°C resulted in a maximum rehydration ratio of 6.20, scavenging activity of 48.63% with minimum nonenzymatic browning of 25%, and hardness of 43.63 N. Results further revealed that, in the case of rehydration ratio, temperature and pretreatment showed a positive effect while thickness had a negative effect. On the contrary, for scavenging activity, temperature showed the highest negative effect followed by slice thickness and positive effect with pretreatment. For nonenzymatic browning, thickness showed the highest negative effect but temperature and pretreatment showed a positive effect. Similarly, for hardness, all three parameters showed a negative effect. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We review life-history variation along elevation in animals and plants and illustrate its drivers, mechanisms and constraints. Elevation shapes life histories into suites of correlated traits that are often remarkably convergent among organisms facing the same environmental challenges. Much of the variation observed along elevation is the result of direct physiological sensitivity to temperature and nutrient supply. As a general rule, alpine populations adopt ‘slow’ life cycles, involving long lifespan, delayed maturity, slow reproductive rates and strong inversions in parental care to enhance the chance of recruitment. Exceptions in both animals and plants are often rooted in evolutionary legacies (e.g. constraints to prolonging cycles in obligatory univoltine taxa) or biogeographic history (e.g. location near trailing or leading edges). Predicting evolutionary trajectories into the future must take into account genetic variability, gene flow and selection strength, which define the potential for local adaptation, as well as the rate of anthropogenic environmental change and species’ idiosyncratic reaction norms. Shifts up and down elevation in the past helped maintain genetic differentiation in alpine populations, with slow life cycles contributing to the accumulation of genetic diversity during upward migrations. Gene flow is facilitated by the proximity of neighbouring populations, and global warming is likely to move fast genotypes upwards and reduce some of those constraints dominating alpine life. Demographic buffering or compensation may protect local alpine populations against trends in environmental conditions, but such mechanisms may not last indefinitely if evolutionary trajectories cannot keep pace with rapid changes. © 2017, The Author(s).

VL  - 42

AB  - Abstract: Context: Solubility limitation of BCS class II drugs pose challenges to in vitro release. Objective: To investigate the miscibility of Aprepitant (APR) and Soluplus® (SOL) for hot melt extrusion (HME) viability and improved in vitro release of APR. Methods: Solubility parameters of APR and SOL from group contribution methods were evaluated. Heat–cool–heat differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scans were assessed for determining the glass forming ability (GFA) and glass stability (GS) of APR. An optimum HME temperature was selected based on melting point depression in physical mixtures. Moisture sorption isotherms were collected using a dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) analyzer at 25 °C. A 1:4 APR:SOL physical mixture was extruded in a co-rotating 12 mm twin screw extruder and in vitro release was assessed in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF) with 0.25% SLS. Extrudates were analyzed using TGA, DSC, XRD and FTIR. Results: APR was classified as a class II glass former. APR and SOL had composition dependent miscibility based on Gibb’s free energy of mixing. Extrudate prepared using HME had an amorphous as well as a crystalline phase that showed good stability in accelerated stability conditions. Smaller particle size extrudates exhibited a higher % moisture uptake and in vitro release compared to larger particle size extrudates. Enhanced in vitro release of APR from extrudates was attributed to amorphization of APR, solubilization as well as crystal growth inhibition effect of SOL due to H-bond formation with APR. Conclusions: A solid dispersion of APR with improved in vitro release was successfully developed using HME technology. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

VL  - 98
IS  - 5
SP  - 1339-1353
AB  - Re-introduction of large wood for expanding hydraulic variability is an increasingly common practice, yet it is not yet known what elements of hydraulic variability are most beneficial to fish. In an experiment designed to emphasize the minimization of energy expenditure through controlled predation and drift, we investigated whether juvenile coho, under winter conditions, discriminated between microhabitats based primarily on flow strength, depth, distance to wood, or based on temporal or spatial variability of the flow field, with the hypothesis that turbulence would be a strong factor in habitat selection. We conducted physical experiments in a 1:1 scale model of a large wood jam at the Oregon Hatchery Research Center in Alsea, Oregon. We conducted high resolution (0.1 m) mapping of the flow field using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter array and underwater videogrammetry of fish locations. Results indicated that discrimination of microhabitats by juvenile coho salmon in cold, low flows emphasized depth and distance to wood over any hydraulic measures of the flow field. Correlations between hydraulic parameters and distance to wood limited our ability to distinguish the importance of turbulence measures relative to velocities, but highlighted the positive relationships between velocity and turbulence measures and the negative relationships between hydraulics and distance from the roughness elements. Findings suggest areas of further study including potential thresholds of temperature and flow intensity on the importance of turbulence in habitat selection. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.

TI  - Responses of the killifish (Aphanius dispar) to long-term exposure to elevated temperatures: growth, survival and microstructure of gill and heart tissues
VL  - 47
IS  - 6
SP  - 429-434
AB  - Some fish species, such as killifish, that normally inhabit temperate water environments are also found in extreme thermal environments such as thermal springs. The extent of the adaptations involved is not known. In the present laboratory study, we exposed killifish (Aphanius dispar) acclimated to a normal thermal environment to elevated temperatures (37–40 °C) in which related killifish species live permanently. Our objective was to determine whether there is evidence that killifish have heat-shock characteristics that make permanent adaptation likely. The fish was exposed to this temperature for a period of 44 days and then compared with control fish kept at their normal temperature (24 °C) with respect to growth, survival and histopathology of gill and heart tissues. At the end of the experimental time, the percentage of body weight gain and specific growth rate were significantly lower in fish kept in thermal stress compared with the control group. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was also significantly affected by water temperature, so that during thermal stress the values of FCR were negative. Fish condition (Condition factor: CF) did not differ significantly between both groups at the end of the experiment. On days 11 and 33, however, CF was significantly lower in the thermal stress group. The gill showed blood congestion in primary lamellae and shortened secondary lamellae in fish kept at 37–40 °C. No specific alterations were found in the cardiac tissue of fish kept in thermal stress conditions. Under thermal stress, 40% of fish survived until the end of the experiment. A preliminary conclusion drawn from this work is that A. dispar, which lives at normal temperatures, shows evidence of adaptability to elevated temperatures that could be a factor in the ability of killifish to adapt permanently over time to thermal environment. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - The evolution of redd site selection in brook charr in different environments: Same cue, same benefit for fitness*
VL  - 56
IS  - 6
SP  - 1017-1029
AB  - 1.Despite the great interest in characterising fish reproductive habitat, the relationship between the selection of a given spawning site and individual fitness has not been experimentally tested. 2.In this study, we used an in situ experimental approach to determine (i) the relative contribution of substrate characteristics as well as hydrological and physicochemical variables to small-scale redd site selection by brook charr, Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill) and (ii) if hatching and emergence success, used as a surrogate of fitness, are improved in selected compared to non-selected sites in both lake and stream habitats. 3.Our results show that upwelling groundwater flow was always significantly higher in selected than in non-selected sites in both lake and stream habitats. We found no significant difference in the mean geometric substrate diameter and no consistent differences in substrate composition between selected and non-selected sites. Oxygen concentration was higher (significantly so in three of four comparisons) and conductivity tended to be lower in selected than in non-selected sites, while temperature showed no significant or consistent variations. We found a significant positive relationship between the selection of a given spawning habitat and hatching and emergence success in these systems. 4.These results show that the main cue that brook charr use to select their spawning sites is upwelling groundwater in lake and stream habitats, and that active selection of these sites increases individual fitness. This suggests that natural selection acted on the same cues in lentic and lotic environments; this could have been highly adaptive in a species that used both habitats as colonisation routes after the last glaciation. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Proteomics to assess the role of phenotypic plasticity in aquatic organisms exposed to pollution and global warming
VL  - 52
IS  - 5
SP  - 681-694
AB  - Nowadays, the unprecedented rates of anthropogenic changes in ecosystems suggest that organisms have to migrate to new distributional ranges or to adapt commensurately quickly to new conditions to avoid becoming extinct. Pollution and global warming are two of the most important threats aquatic organisms will have to face in the near future. If genetic changes in a population in response to natural selection are extensively studied, the role of acclimation through phenotypic plasticity (the property of a given genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to particular environmental conditions) in a species to deal with new environmental conditions remains largely unknown. Proteomics is the extensive study of the protein complement of a genome. It is dynamic and depends on the specific tissue, developmental stage, and environmental conditions. As the final product of gene expression, it is subjected to several regulatory steps from gene transcription to the functional protein. Consequently, there is a discrepancy between the abundance of mRNA and the abundance of the corresponding protein. Moreover, proteomics is closer to physiology and gives a more functional knowledge of the regulation of gene expression than does transcriptomics. The study of protein-expression profiles, however, gives a better portrayal of the cellular phenotype and is considered as a key link between the genotype and the organismal phenotype. Under new environmental conditions, we can observe a shift of the protein-expression pattern defining a new cellular phenotype that can possibly improve the fitness of the organism. It is now necessary to define a proteomic norm of reaction for organisms acclimating to environmental stressors. Its link to fitness will give new insights into how organisms can evolve in a changing environment. The proteomic literature bearing on chronic exposure to pollutants and on acclimation to heat stress in aquatic organisms, as well as potential application of proteomics in evolutionary issues, are outlined. While the transcriptome responses are commonly investigated, proteomics approaches now need to be intensified, with the new perspective of integrating the cellular phenotype with the organismal phenotype and with the mechanisms of the regulation of gene expression, such as epigenetics. © 2012 The Author.

TI  - Climate of origin affects tick ( Ixodes ricinus) host- seeking behavior in response to temperature: implications for resilience to climate change?
VL  - 4
IS  - 7
SP  - 1186-1198
AB  - Climate warming is changing distributions and phenologies of many organisms and may also impact on vectors of disease-causing pathogens. In Europe, the tick Ixodes ricinus is the primary vector of medically important pathogens (e.g., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis). How might climate change affect I. ricinus host-seeking behavior (questing)? We hypothesize that, in order to maximize survival, I. ricinus have adapted their questing in response to temperature in accordance with local climates. We predicted that ticks from cooler climates quest at cooler temperatures than those from warmer climates. This would suggest that I. ricinus can adapt and therefore have the potential to be resilient to climate change. I. ricinus were collected from a cline of climates using a latitudinal gradient (northeast Scotland, North Wales, South England, and central France). Under laboratory conditions, ticks were subjected to temperature increases of 1°C per day, from 6 to 15°C. The proportion of ticks questing was recorded five times per temperature (i.e., per day). The theoretical potential to quest was then estimated for each population over the year for future climate change projections. As predicted, more ticks from cooler climates quested at lower temperatures than did ticks from warmer climates. The proportion of ticks questing was strongly associated with key climate parameters from each location. Our projections, based on temperature alone, suggested that populations could advance their activity season by a month under climate change, which has implications for exposure periods of hosts to tick-borne pathogens. Our findings suggest that I. ricinus have adapted their behavior in response to climate, implying some potential to adapt to climate change. Predictive models of I. ricinus dynamics and disease risk over continental scales would benefit from knowledge of these differences between populations. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Absence of countergradient and cogradient variation in an oceanic silverside, the California grunion Leuresthes tenuis
VL  - 461
SP  - 176-186
AB  - Spatial adaptations that maximize a species' fitness in its local environment, particularly in the form of countergradient variation (CnGV = genotypic influences counteract environmental effects on trait variation) and cogradient variation (CoGV = genotypic influences accentuate environmental plasticity), have been documented in many estuarine and anadromous fishes. However, their prevalence in more oceanic fishes, where extensive gene flow and reduced environmental selection may preclude local adaptation, remains unclear. If oceanic species lack genetic structure, they may be limited in their ability to adapt to global climate change. We examined the potential for adaptation in oceanic fishes by testing whether an oceanic silverside, the California grunion Leuresthes tenuis, displays CnGV in growth capacity and CoGV in vertebral number across a latitudinal gradient as found in estuarine silversides. Common garden experiments revealed that reaction norms for growth in response to temperature differed little among 3 L. tenuis populations from different latitudes. Growth rates of wild adult L. tenuis measured from scale analysis suggested that growth may be slightly faster at more southern latitudes, likely due to environmental variation. Mean vertebral number in wild L. tenuis, determined from radiographs, were nearly identical for all populations. Overall, our results did not provide evidence for spatial adaptations in these traits of L. tenuis, in contrast to the strong patterns of latitudinal trait adaptation in other, more estuarine silversides. This study provides support for the finding that higher gene flow levels and weaker environmental selection pressures of oceanic species limit local adaptation. © Inter-Research 2012 · www.int-res.com.

TI  - Out crosses between seasonally different segments of a Pacific salmon population reveal local adaptation
VL  - 100
IS  - 11
SP  - 1469-1481
AB  - In salmon populations, local adaptation to seasonally varying incubation temperature is characterized by temperature-adjusted development times [measured in degree days – accumulated temperature units (ATUs)] that differ between control and F1 hybrid crosses that were made between temporally separated population segments, a contrast not expected in a panmictic population. We examined adaptation of embryo development time to seasonally cooling temperature in a population of pink salmon by estimating genetic components of variation in control and hybrid F1 crosses made between members of early- and late-spawning subpopulations, and replicated our observations in independent odd- and even-year brood lines. In each brood line, both sire and dam components of variation of development time were significant and accounted for a substantially larger portion of variation than their interactions, which suggested that natural selection has acted primarily on additive genetic variation. The implications of these results are that (1) spatially or temporally proximate salmon populations may be structured by distinct adaptations; (2) artificial relaxation of local geneflow barriers may lead to depression of fitness; and (3) populations of salmon genetically structured by local adaptation may carry variation that enhances their persistence during rapid climate change. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

VL  - 111

SP  - 1167-1179
AB  - Background and Aims It is widely accepted that hydraulic failure due to xylem embolism is a key factor contributing to drought-induced mortality in trees. In the present study, an attempt is made to disentangle phenotypic plasticity from genetic variation in hydraulic traits across the entire distribution area of a tree species to detect adaptation to local environments. Methods A series of traits related to hydraulics (vulnerability to cavitation and hydraulic conductivity in branches), growth performance and leaf mass per area were assessed in eight Pinus canariensis populations growing in two common gardens under contrasting environments. In addition, the neutral genetic variability (FST) and the genetic differentiation of phenotypic variation (QST) were compared in order to identify the evolutionary forces acting on these traits. Key Results The variability for hydraulic traits was largely due to phenotypic plasticity. Nevertheless, the vulnerability to cavitation displayed a significant genetic variability (approx. 5% of the explained variation), and a significant genetic × environment interaction (between 5 and 19% of the explained variation). The strong correlation between vulnerability to cavitation and survival in the xeric common garden (r =-0.81; P &lt; 0.05) suggests a role for the former in the adaptation to xeric environments. Populations from drier sites and higher temperature seasonality were less vulnerable to cavitation than those growing at mesic sites. No trade-off between xylem safety and efficiency was detected. QST of parameters of the vulnerability curve (0.365 for P50 and the slope of the vulnerability curve and 0.452 for P88) differed substantially from FST (0.091), indicating divergent selection. In contrast, genetic drift alone was found to be sufficient to explain patterns of differentiation for xylem efficiency and growth. Conclusions The ability of P. canariensis to inhabit a wide range of ecosystems seemed to be associated with high phenotypic plasticity and some degree of local adaptations of xylem and leaf traits. Resistance to cavitation conferred adaptive potential for this species to adapt successfully to xeric conditions. © 2013 The Author.

TI  - Integrated co-limitation kinetic model for microalgae growth in anaerobically digested municipal sludge centrate
VL  - 18
SP  - 15-24
AB  - Microalgae have a substantial potential as a renewable energy resource, but sustainable microalgae-based bioenergy production has to find an inexpensive water and nutrient resource. Wastewater has been considered as such a resource to reduce environmental impacts and economic burdens of microalgae cultivation. Understanding of microalgae growth kinetics in wastewater is necessary to improve microalgae productivity for successful implementation of the integrated microalgae-wastewater system. This study presents an integrated colimitation kinetic model of microalgae growth in anaerobically digested municipal sludge centrate. Nitrogen (N), dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, light intensity (I), and temperature (T) were selected as major growth factors in themodel. The model framework was constructed by combining threshold and multiplicative structures to explain the relationship among these factors. Depending on culture conditions, the integrated model consists of alternative rate expressions for factors selected. These expressions include the Andrews and Monod models for both CO2 and N, and the Chalker and Muller-Fuega models combined with the Arrhenius equation for light intensity and temperature. The model was calibrated and validated using batch studies with anaerobically digested municipal sludge centrate as wastewater source. Criteria to select the rate expressions considering limitation conditions include NH4-N <= 150 mg L-1, aqueous CO2 <= 50 mg L-1, and light intensity <= 90 mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1). Above these ranges, the rate expressions considering both limitation and inhibition were applied to the model. The model was shown to have a reasonable growth rate prediction of Chlorella sp. under different nutrient levels of the centrate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Urban warming trumps natural enemy regulation of herbivorous pests
VL  - 24
IS  - 7
SP  - 1596-1607
AB  - Trees provide ecosystem services that counter negative effects of urban habitats on human and environmental health. Unfortunately, herbivorous arthropod pests are often more abundant on urban than rural trees, reducing tree growth, survival, and ecosystem services. Previous research where vegetation complexity was reduced has attributed elevated urban pest abundance to decreased regulation by natural enemies. However, reducing vegetation complexity, particularly the density of overstory trees, also makes cities hotter than natural habitats. We ask how urban habitat characteristics influence an abiotic factor, temperature, and a biotic factor, natural enemy abundance, in regulating the abundance of an urban forest pest, the gloomy scale, (Melanaspis tenebricosa). We used a map of surface temperature to select red maple trees (Acer rubrum) at warmer and cooler sites in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. We quantified habitat complexity by measuring impervious surface cover, local vegetation structural complexity, and landscape scale vegetation cover around each tree. Using path analysis, we determined that impervious surface (the most important habitat variable) increased scale insect abundance by increasing tree canopy temperature, rather than by reducing natural enemy abundance or percent parasitism. As a mechanism for this response, we found that increasing temperature significantly increases scale insect fecundity and contributes to greater population increase. Specifically, adult female M. tenebricosa egg sets increased by approximately 14 eggs for every 18C increase in temperature. Climate change models predict that the global climate will increase by 2-38C in the next 50- 100 years, which we found would increase scale insect abundance by three orders of magnitude. This result supports predictions that urban and natural forests will face greater herbivory in the future, and suggests that a primary cause could be direct, positive effects of warming on herbivore fitness rather than altered trophic interactions. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.

AB  - Bioactive components of fruit and vegetables play an important role in scavenging free radicals and protect the body from degenerative diseases. A kinetic study was conducted to quantify the losses occurring in bioactive components, antioxidant activity and changes in colour and firmness of four commonly used vegetables (beetroot, green pea, eggplant and green pepper) during heat treatment (70–90 °C). The study revealed that logistic model can predict the variation in bioactive components and antioxidant activity with higher R2 and lower root mean square error (RMSE) as compared to first order model due to logarithmic reduction in these properties in the beginning of the process itself. However zero and first order kinetic models were found suitable to predict the changes occurring in colour and firmness respectively during blanching. D, z value, activation energy (Ea), activation enthalpy and entropy were calculated for all measured parameters for selected vegetables in the temperature range of 70–90 °C. These finding would be useful in designing thermal processes and related calculations for these vegetables. © 2016, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).

TI  - Drought–induced modifications in the vascular systems of tertiary relicts vaccinium arctostaphylos, rhododendron ponticum and ilex colchica (Strandja, Bulgaria)
VL  - 2
SP  - 263-270
AB  - As is clear from weather data, the climate of the inner Strandja, Bulgaria, has grown dryer since 1970. As a result, some relic species having low environmental adaptation potential either have been subjected to the risk of mortality from drought, or have migrated upward, to more humid conditions. The aim of our work was to reveal the effect of recent climatic changes on the vascular systems of relic Vaccinium arctostaphylos L., Rhododendron ponticum L. and Ilex colchica Poj. growing in Strandja. These species are recognized to need conservation. The xylem features were studied by Image Analysis set-up using the dated cross-sections of the woody samples. Vessel characters were measured ring by ring. Correlations were calculated between the chronologies of the vessel parameters (mean vessel area and vessel density per a growth ring) and daily average temperature and precipitation recorded at Burgas weather station. These correlations were analyzed using a 20-day moving window technique whereby the climatic variables were shifted at 10-day steps from April 1-st to October 30. It was revealed that from 1996 to 2008, V. arctostaphylos mean vessel area, S, (μm2) was rising while the mean vessel density, N/mm2, was dropping. The same trends but at considerably lower rates were revealed for R. ponticum in 2001-2008. In I. colchica, the former feature, on the contrary, dropped slightly and the latter rose in 2004-2008. In all three species, relative water conductive area within a growth ring, sw (sum of the vessel areas located in the growth ring /growth ring area), remained constant in R. ponticum, on the contrary, dropped slightly in V. arctostaphylos and rose in I. colchica. Climate signals recorded in vessels showed that April-May air temperatures influenced in xylem of all three species, while June-July temperatures influenced only archaic R. ponticum and V. arctostaphylos. Spring (April) and summer (June 20 – July 10) precipitation had significant positive effect only on these two species but not on I. colchica. The results clearly showed V. arctostaphylos, the most ancient species, were extremely vulnerable to unfavorable climate. When available water diminishes and transpiration rises, increasing vessel area is unfavorable for plant health, because it makes embolism in vascular system highly probable. © SGEM2016.

TI  - Adenine methylation may contribute to endosymbiont selection in a clonal aphid population
VL  - 15
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: The pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum has two modes of reproduction: parthenogenetic during the spring and summer and sexual in autumn. This ability to alternate between reproductive modes and the emergence of clonal populations under favorable conditions make this organism an interesting model for genetic and epigenetic studies. The pea aphid hosts different types of endosymbiotic bacteria within bacteriocytes which help the aphids survive and adapt to new environmental conditions and habitats. The obligate endosymbiont Buchnera aphidicola has a drastically reduced and stable genome, whereas facultative endosymbionts such as Regiella insecticola have large and dynamic genomes due to phages, mobile elements and high levels of genetic recombination. In previous work, selection toward cold adaptation resulted in the appearance of parthenogenetic A. pisum individuals characterized by heavier weights and remarkable green pigmentation. Results: Six adenine-methylated DNA fragments were isolated from genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from the cold-induced green variant of A. pisum using deoxyadenosine methylase (Dam) by digesting the gDNA with the restriction enzymes DpnI and DpnII, which recognize the methylated and unmethylated GATC sites, respectively. The six resultant fragments did not match any sequence in the A. pisum or Buchnera genomes, implying that they came from facultative endosymbionts. The A1 fragment encoding a putative transposase and the A6 fragment encoding a putative helicase were selected for further comparison between the two A. pisum variants (green and orange) based on Dam analysis followed by PCR amplification. An association between adenine methylation and the two A. pisum variants was demonstrated by higher adenine methylation levels on both genes in the green variant as compared to the orange one. Conclusion: Temperature selection may affect the secondary endosymbiont and the sensitive Dam involved in the survival and adaptation of aphids to cold temperatures. There is a high degree of adenine methylation at the GATC sites of the endosymbiont genes at 8°C, an effect that disappears at 22°C. We suggest that endosymbionts can be modified or selected to increase host fitness under unfavorable climatic conditions, and that the phenotype of the newly adapted aphids can be inherited. © 2014 Reingold et al.. licensee BioMed Central Ltd. 2014This article is published under license to BioMed Central Ltd.

VL  - 28
IS  - 1
SP  - 40-45
AB  - Summary: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of probiotics prepared from Bacillus subtilis (strain C-3102-Calsporin ®; Calpis, Tokyo, Japan) as a dietary supplement on several reproductive aspects of female 'matrinxã'(Brycon amazonicus), including hematological parameters, immunological characteristics and total lipid concentrations in muscle and liver tissue. The broodstock were kept in two ponds of 600m 2, at a density of 50 fish per pond, from March to November 2008. The fish were divided into two treatment groups: untreated control fish (T1), and fish fed with 10g of probiotics per kg of ration (T2). Fish were fed a diet containing 32% crude protein (CP), 7% crude fat (CF), and 6.5% ether extract (EE) twice daily at a rate of 1% of the total biomass per day during the coldest months (May through August) and 3% during the warm season (March, April and September through November). During the reproductive period, 20 individuals from each treatment group were selected for the experiments; two doses of crude carp pituitary extract were given to females in 10-h intervals, and one dose was given to the males at the same time the females were given the second dose. A total of 20 fish were used for the hematological analyses. After anesthetization, blood samples were withdrawn by caudal puncture to determine the total number of cells, differential and total leukocyte counts, thrombocyte count, hematocrit, hemoglobin rate and plasma cortisol and glucose levels. The hematimetric index mean corpuscular volume (VCM) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MHCM) were calculated. Ten other 'matrinxãs' from the same groups were used to assess macrophage phagocytic activity and lipid levels. The results showed that females fed a probiotics-supplemented diet exhibited an increase in numbers of oocytes and, consequently, had higher rates of fertilization and hatching of larvae. Probiotic-treated fish also exhibited a significant increase in the phagocytic activity of macrophages, indicating an improvement in the immune system of breeders. Hematologic parameters were different in comparison to the time-zero group, and plasma cortisol and glucose levels were higher in the females. The total lipids levels in muscle and liver tissue were lower in B. amazonicus that received feed supplemented with probiotics. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.

AB  - We determined the thermal biology of the oviparous Liolaemus boulengeri and the viviparous Liolaemus lineomaculatus populations localised at high and low latitude sites in Patagonia, Argentina. We present data of body temperatures in the field (T-b) and preferred temperature in the laboratory (T-pref), micro-environmental and operative temperatures and the effectiveness of thermoregulation. Liolaemus boulengeri and L. lineomaculatus choose different heat sources for active selection of suitable thermal micro-environments for thermoregulation, and the oviparous L. boulengeri is a more effective thermoregulator (E=0.55) than the viviparous L. lineomaculatus (E=0.43). Even when L. boulengeri is a better thermoregulator and both species show identical timing in the reproductive cycles, there are constraint factors that impose limitations on the southernmost distribution of the oviparous L. boulengeri.

TI  - Cold tolerance and metabolic rate increased by cold acclimation in Drosophila Albomicans from natural populations
VL  - 88
IS  - 5
SP  - 289-300
AB  - Cold acclimation is one of the important factors in temperature adaptation for insects needing to make rapid adjustment to the seasonal temperature changes in their living environment. In a fruit fly species, Drosophila albomicans, which has a tropical origin and currently has a wide geographic distribution extended into Asian temperate regions, cold tolerance in terms of survival time at 1 degrees C of adult flies reared at 25 degrees C was substantially improved by a cold acclimation at 20 degrees C for several days. Examining 29 isofemale lines from widely distributed natural populations, we observed a substantial variation in their acclimation response. However, the acclimation response was not necessarily stronger in the strains from the recently colonized temperate regions. A significantly stronger acclimation response was detected in male flies of the temperate strains when compared to those of the tropical strains. D. albomicans also showed stronger cold tolerance compared to its closely related species belonging to the D. nasuta subgroup. Among these strains, we detected a strong positive correlation between the cold tolerance change and the metabolic rate change upon the cold acclimation, suggesting their strong physiological association regulated by common genetic factors, which may have been the target of natural selection for the temperature adaptation. The response to deacclimation and reacclimation suggested that a systematic change in gene expressions is the main molecular mechanism for the cold acclimation to have effects on the cold tolerance and metabolic rate changes.

TI  - Resistance of functional Lactobacillus plantarum strains against food stress conditions
VL  - 48
SP  - 63-71
AB  - The survival of three Lactobacillus plantarum strains (Lp 790, Lp 813 and Lp 998) with functional properties was studied taking into account their resistance to thermal, osmotic and oxidative stress factors. Stress treatments applied were: 52 degrees C-15 min (Phosphate Buffer pH 7, thermal shock), H2O2 0.1% (p/v) - 30 min (oxidative shock) and NaCl aqueous solution at 17, 25 and 30% (p/v) (room temperature - 1 h, osmotic shock). The osmotic stress was also evaluated on cell growth in MRS broth added of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10% (p/v) of NaCl, during 20 h at 30 degrees C. The cell thermal adaptation was performed in MRS broth, selecting 45 degrees C for 30 min as final conditions for all strains. Two strains (Lp 813 and Lp 998) showed, in general, similar behaviour against the three stress factors, being clearly more resistant than Lp 790. An evident difference in growth kinetics in presence of NaCl was observed between Lp 998 and Lp 813, Lp998 showing a higher optical density (OD570nm) than Lp 813 at the end of the assay. Selected thermal adaptation improved by 2 log orders the thermal resistance of both strains, but cell growth in presence of NaCl was enhanced only in Lp 813. Oxidative resistance was not affected with this thermal pretreatment. These results demonstrate the relevance of cell technological resistance when selecting presumptive "probiotic" cultures, since different stress factors might considerably affect viability or/and performance of the strains. The incidence of stress conditions on functional properties of the strains used in this work are currently under research in our group. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 92
IS  - 4
SP  - 1991-2002
AB  - Nest building is a taxonomically widespread and diverse trait that allows animals to alter local environments to create optimal conditions for offspring development. However, there is growing evidence that climate change is adversely affecting nest-building in animals directly, for example via sea-level rises that flood nests, reduced availability of building materials, and suboptimal sex allocation in species exhibiting temperature-dependent sex determination. Climate change is also affecting nesting species indirectly, via range shifts into suboptimal nesting areas, reduced quality of nest-building environments, and changes in interactions with nest predators and parasites. The ability of animals to adapt to sustained and rapid environmental change is crucial for the long-term persistence of many species. Many animals are known to be capable of adjusting nesting behaviour adaptively across environmental gradients and in line with seasonal changes, and this existing plasticity potentially facilitates adaptation to anthropogenic climate change. However, whilst alterations in nesting phenology, site selection and design may facilitate short-term adaptations, the ability of nest-building animals to adapt over longer timescales is likely to be influenced by the heritable basis of such behaviour. We urgently need to understand how the behaviour and ecology of nest-building in animals is affected by climate change, and particularly how altered patterns of nesting behaviour affect individual fitness and population persistence. We begin our review by summarising how predictable variation in environmental conditions influences nest-building animals, before highlighting the ecological threats facing nest-building animals experiencing anthropogenic climate change and examining the potential for changes in nest location and/or design to provide adaptive short- and long-term responses to changing environmental conditions. We end by identifying areas that we believe warrant the most urgent attention for further research. © 2016 Cambridge Philosophical Society

TI  - A portable wireless particulate sensor system for continuous real-time environmental monitoring
AB  - Airborne particulate matter has been shown to be associated with morbidity and mortality, and may interfere with certain sensitive experiments. Understanding the levels and movements of particulate matter in an enclosed space can lead to a reduction in the impact of this material on health and experimental results. A system of environmental sensors including particulate matter, selected gases, humidity, temperature, and pressure can be used to assist in tracking air movement, providing real-time mapping of potential contaminants as they move through a space. In this paper we present a system that is capable of sensing these environmental factors, collecting data from multiple dispersed nodes and presenting the aggregated information in real-time. The highly modular system is based on a flexible and scalable framework developed for use in aircraft cabin environments. Use of this framework enables the deployment of a custom suite of sensors with minimal development effort. Individual nodes communicate using a self-organizing mesh network and can be powered from a variety of sources, bringing a high level of flexibility in the arrangement and distribution of the sensor array. Sensor data is transmitted to a coordinator node, which then passes the time-correlated information to a server-hosted database through a choice of wired or wireless networks. Presentation software is used to either monitor the real-time data stream, or to extract records of interest from the database. A reference implementation has been created for the National Institutes of Health consisting of a custom optical particle counter and off-the-shelf sensors for CO2, CO, temperature, humidity, pressure, and acoustic noise. The total environmental sensing system provides continuous, real-time data in a readable format that can be used to analyze ambient air for events of interest. © 2012 by Boise State University.

TI  - Behind the scenes of population viability modeling: Predicting butterfly metapopulation dynamics under climate change
VL  - 259
SP  - 62-73
AB  - Studies explaining the choice of model structure for population viability analysis (PVA) are rare and no such study exists for butterfly species, a focal group for conservation. Here, we describe in detail the development of a model to predict population viability of a glacial relict butterfly species, Boloria eunomia, under climate change. We compared four alternative formulations of an individual-based model, differing in the environmental factors acting on the survival of immature life stages: temperature (only temperature impact), weather (temperature, precipitation, and sunshine), temperature and parasitism, and weather and parasitism. Following pattern-oriented modeling, four observed patterns were used to contrast these models: one qualitative (response of population size to habitat parameters) and three quantitative ones describing population dynamics during eight years (mean and variability of population size, and magnitude of the temporal autocorrelation in yearly population growth rates). The four model formulations were not equally able to depict population dynamics under current environmental conditions; the model including only temperature was selected as the most parsimonious model sufficiently well reproducing the empirical patterns. We used all four model formulations to test a range of climate change scenarios that were characterized by changes in both mean and variability of the weather variables. All models predicted adverse effects of climate change and resulted in the same ranking of mean climate change scenarios. However, models differed in their absolute values of population viability measures, underlining the need to explicitly choose the most appropriate model formulation and avoid arbitrary usage of environmental drivers in a model. We conclude that further applications of pattern-oriented modeling to butterfly and other species are likely to help in identifying the key factors impacting the viability of certain taxa, which, ultimately, will aid and speed up informed management decisions for endangered species under climate change.

TI  - The effects of light and temperature on microalgal growth and nutrient removal: An experimental and mathematical approach
VL  - 6
IS  - 27
SP  - 22896-22907
AB  - Cultivation of microalgae and cyanobacteria has been intensified in the last decades, due to the numerous applications described for these microorganisms. However, the high process costs associated with biomass production systems reduce the economic feasibility of microalgal/cyanobacterial cultivation. A better understanding of the effects of light and temperature on growth kinetics will contribute to the improvement of biomass productivities and reduce the costs associated with the optimization of culture parameters. In this study, the effects of average daily light irradiance and temperature on growth and nutrient removal were assessed using Chlorella vulgaris, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Synechocystis salina and Microcystis aeruginosa. Additionally, a mathematical model relating specific growth rates with these variables was developed. Both kinetic growth parameters and nutrient removal had similar responses to light and temperature: increasing light supply, higher specific growth rates, biomass productivities and nutrient removal efficiencies were achieved. Among the studied temperatures, all microorganisms presented higher biomass productivities and nutrient removal efficiencies at 25°C. Regarding the results from the mathematical model, the optimal temperature for the selected microorganisms was 25.3 ± 1.1°C. On the other hand, the optimal average daily light irradiances varied with the species, being 208, 258, 178 and 140 μE m-2 s-1 for C. vulgaris, P. subcapitata, S. salina and M. aeruginosa, respectively. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

TI  - Variation in growth and developmental responses to supraoptimal temperatures near latitudinal range limits of gypsy moth Lymantria dispar (L.), an expanding invasive species
VL  - 42
IS  - 2
SP  - 181-190
AB  - Variation in thermal performance within and between populations provides the potential for adaptive responses to increasing temperatures associated with climate change. Organisms experiencing temperatures above their optimum on a thermal performance curve exhibit rapid declines in function and these supraoptimal temperatures can be a critical physiological component of range limits. The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), is one of the best-documented biological invasions and factors driving its spatial spread are of significant ecological and economic interest. The present study examines gypsy moth sourced from different latitudes across its North American range for sensitivity to high temperature in constant temperature growth chamber experiments. Supraoptimal temperatures result in higher mortality in northern populations compared with populations from the southern range extent (West Virginia and coastal plain of Virginia, U.S.A.). Sublethal effects of high temperature on traits associated with fitness, such as smaller pupal mass, are apparent in northern and West Virginia populations. Overall, the results indicate that populations near the southern limits of the range are less sensitive to high temperatures than northern populations from the established range. However, southern populations are lower performing overall, based on pupal mass and development time, relative to northern populations. This suggests that there may be a trade-off associated with decreased heat sensitivity in gypsy moth. Understanding how species adapt to thermal limits and possible fitness trade-offs of heat tolerance represents an important step toward predicting climatically driven changes in species ranges, which is a particularly critical consideration in conservation and invasion ecology. © 2017 The Royal Entomological Society

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrients after the establishment of Caragana intermedia plantation on sand dunes in alpine sandy land of the Tibet Plateau
VL  - 10
IS  - 5
AB  - The Gonghe Basin region of the Tibet Plateau is severely affected by desertification. Compared with other desertified land, the main features of this region is windy, cold and short growing season, resulting in relatively difficult for vegetation restoration. In this harsh environment, identification the spatial distribution of soil nutrients and analysis its impact factors after vegetation establishment will be helpful for understanding the ecological relationship between soil and environment. Therefore, in this study, the 12-yearold C. intermediaplantation on sand dunes was selected as the experimental site. Soil samples were collected under and between shrubs on the windward slopes, dune tops and leeward slopes with different soil depth. Then analyzed soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK). The results showed that the spatial heterogeneity of soil nutrients was existed in C. intermedia plantation on sand dunes. (1) Depth was the most important impact factor, soil nutrients were decreased with greater soil depth. One of the possible reasons is that windblown fine materials and litters were accumulated on surface soil, when they were decomposed, more nutrients were aggregated on surface soil. (2) Topography also affected the distribution of soil nutrients, more soil nutrients distributed on windward slopes. The herbaceous coverage were higher and C. intermedia ground diameter were larger on windward slopes, both of them probably related to the high soil nutrients level for windward slopes. (3) Soil " fertile islands"were formed, and the "fertile islands" were more marked on lower soil nutrients level topography positions, while it decreased towards higher soil nutrients level topography positions. The enrichment ratio (E) for TN and AN were higher than other nutrients, most likely because C. intermedia is a leguminous shrub. © 2015 Li et al.

TI  - Climate warming mediates range shift of two differentially adapted stenothermal Drosophila species in the Western Himalayas
VL  - 16
IS  - 2
SP  - 147-153
AB  - The average temperature of the earth has increased from 0.3 to 0.6°C, and warming is facilitating faunal reshuffling. Variable thermal environments warrant mechanisms to adjust the expression of phenotypic values to environmental needs. Ectothermic Drosophilids are profoundly affected by thermal selection (i.e., genetic effects) or through induced effects on phenotypes (i.e., plastic effects). Climatic data for the last fifty years involves a significant change in average temperature (Tave) of Western Himalayas, which has affected the distribution and boundaries of various Drosophilids in this region. There is a significant decline in the number of D. nepalensis from lower ranges; whereas D. ananassae is reported to be introduced to lower to mid mountainous ranges. Further, a comparison of fecundity, hatchability, and viability at different growth temperatures has shown significant decrease in trait values at 17°C in D. ananassae and at 25°C in D. nepalensis. Thus, the recent range changes of these two species involve genetic effects on ecophysiological and plastic effects on life history traits. Our results indicate that thermal plasticity of life history traits can be species-specific; thus climate change may lead to a mismatch of such traits to the changing environment. We suggest that D. nepalensis and D. ananassae could serve as indicator species for analyzing range changes under changing climatic conditions. Evolutionary biologists can provide unique perspective to the examination of how climate change will affect the earth's biota. © 2013 Korean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society..

AB  - A novel, solvent-deficient precipitation (SDP) method for catalyst preparation in general and for preparation of iron FT catalysts in particular is reported. Eight catalysts using a 23 factorial design of experiments to identify the key preparation variables were prepared. The catalysts were characterized by electron microprobe, N2 adsorption, TEM, XRD, and ICP. Results show that the morphology of the catalysts, i.e., surface area, pore volume, pore size distribution, crystallite sizes, and promoter distribution are significantly influenced by (1) whether or not the precursor catalyst is washed, (2) the promoter addition step, and (3) the drying condition (temperature). Consequently, the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts determined from fixed-bed testing are also affected by these three variables. Unwashed catalysts prepared by a one-step method and dried at 100 °C produced the most active catalysts for FT synthesis. The catalysts of this study prepared by SDP compared favorably in activity, productivity, and stability with Fe FT catalysts reported in the literature. It is believed that this facile SDP approach has promise for development of future FT catalysts, and also offers a potential alternate route for the preparation of other catalysts for various other applications. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Soft robots driven by stimuli-responsive materials have unique advantages over conventional rigid robots, especially in their high adaptability for field exploration and seamless interaction with humans. The grand challenge lies in achieving self-powered soft robots with high mobility, environmental tolerance, and long endurance. We are able to advance a soft electronic fish with a fully integrated onboard system for power and remote control. Without any motor, the fish is driven solely by a soft electroactive structure made of dielectric elastomer and ionically conductive hydrogel. The electronic fish can swim at a speed of 6.4 cm/s (0.69 body length per second), which is much faster than previously reported untethered soft robotic fish driven by soft responsive materials. The fish shows consistent performance in a wide temperature range and permits stealth sailing due to its nearly transparent nature. Furthermore, the fish is robust, as it uses the surrounding water as the electric ground and can operate for 3 hours with one single charge. The design principle can be potentially extended to a variety of flexible devices and soft robots. © 2017 The Authors.

VL  - 30
IS  - 31
SP  - 10465-10471
AB  - Animals select their optimal environmental temperature, even when faced with alternatives that differ only slightly. This behavior is critical as small differences in temperature of only several degrees can have a profound effect on the survival and rate of development of poikilothermic animals, such as the fruit fly. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila larvae choose their preferred temperature of 17.5 degrees C over slightly cooler temperatures (14-16 degrees C) through activation of chordotonal neurons. Mutations affecting a transient receptor potential (TRP) vanilloid channel, Inactive (Iav), which is expressed specifically in chordotonal neurons, eliminated the ability to choose 17.5 degrees C over 14-16 degrees C. The impairment in selecting 17.5 degrees C resulted from absence of an avoidance response, which is normally mediated by an increase in turns at the lower temperatures. We conclude that the decision to select the preferred over slightly cooler temperatures requires iav and is achieved by activating chordotonal neurons, which in turn induces repulsive behaviors, due to an increase in high angle turns.

AB  - The frequency and magnitude of heat waves have increased in recent decades, imposing additional stresses on organisms in extreme environments. Most reptilian embryos are regularly exposed to thermal stress because they develop in shallow, warm soils for weeks to months. We studied cardiac performance during warming to infer lethal temperatures for embryonic lizards in the Sceloporus undulatus complex. Embryos from four populations throughout the geographical range (New Jersey, South Carolina, Colorado, and Arizona) were warmed at a rate observed in natural nests. Embryos from all populations exhibited a similar pattern of thermal sensitivity, as follows: heart rate rose between 34 and 41 degrees C, remained stable between 41 and 44 degrees C, and dropped sharply between 44 and 47 degrees C. No embryos recovered from cardiac arrest, indicating that the upper lethal temperature was <= 47 degrees C. Despite the putative selective pressures, the thermal limit to cardiac performance seems to have been conserved during the evolution of this species.

AB  - Agricultural nitrogen loss becomes an increasingly important source of water quality deterioration and eutrophication, even threatens water safety for humanity. Nitrogen dynamic mechanism is still too complicated to be well captured at watershed scale due to its multiple existence forms and instability, disturbance of agricultural management practices. Stereoscopic agriculture is a novel agricultural planting pattern to efficiently use local natural resources (e.g., water, land, sunshine, heat and fertilizer). It is widely promoted as a high yield system and can obtain considerable economic benefits, particularly in China. However, its environmental quality implication is not clear. In our study, Qianyanzhou station is famous for its stereoscopic agriculture pattern of Southern China, and an experimental watershed was selected as our study area. Regional characteristics of runoff and nitrogen losses were simulated by an integrated water system model (HEQM) with multi-objective calibration, and multiple agriculture practices were assessed to find the effective approach for the reduction of diffuse nitrogen losses. Results showed that daily variations of runoff and nitrogen forms were well reproduced throughout watershed, i.e., satisfactory performances for ammonium and nitrate nitrogen (NH4-N and NO3-N) loads, good performances for runoff and organic nitrogen (ON) load, and very good performance for total nitrogen (TN) load. The average loss coefficient was 62.74 kg/ha for NH4-N, 0.98 kg/ha for NO3-N, 0.0004 kg/ha for ON and 63.80 kg/ha for TN. The dominating form of nitrogen losses was NH4-N due to the applied fertilizers, and the most dramatic zones aggregated in the middle and downstream regions covered by paddy and orange orchard. In order to control diffuse nitrogen losses, the most effective practices for Qianyanzhou stereoscopic agriculture pattern were to reduce farmland planting scale in the valley by afforestation, particularly for orchard in the downstream regions, followed by fertilizer application optimization.

TI  - Improvement of antler production and some reproduction traits in hybridization between Tian Shan Wapiti and Northeast Sika deer
VL  - 154
SP  - 92-97
AB  - It is difficult to mate Sika does with Wapiti bucks due to differences in body size, estrus period and other environmental factors, although their hybrids have high economic value. In this study, we determined the optimal period of artificial insemination and analyzed specific assisted reproductive technologies to improve hybrid survival. Newborn and fawn hybrids showed strong vitality, particularly with respect to adaptability, stress resistance, growth rate, cold tolerance and gastrointestinal disease resistance. Hybrid deer displayed characteristics of both parents, provided more venison and exhibited more antler production than their female parents. The buck teasing method led to a higher conception rate than the estrus synchronization method. We determined that the optimal time to perform artificial insemination is from 14 to 18 h after the doe has entered estrus. Does that were overweight both before and during pregnancy often experienced dystocia. By contrast, does that were underweight often birthed fawns with congenital dysplasia. Additional days of lactation significantly increased the growth rate, immunity, and weaning survival rate of fawns without delaying return to estrus for the doe. This research should help improve the production capacity and adaptation of international hybrid deer for market diversification. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Assessing chilling and drought tolerance of different plant genera on extensive green roofs in an arid climate region in Iran
VL  - 192
SP  - 215-223
AB  - The harsh and stressful growing environment of extensive green roofs especially in arid environments allows a limited range of plant species to survive. Therefore, achieving plantings to survive in such conditions is a significant challenge. This paper describes an experiment investigating plant selections for extensive green roofs based on chilling (cold season) and drought (warm season) conditions of Iran. Nine species were selected from the three major taxonomic and functional plant groups that are commonly used on extensive green roofs including grasses, groundcovers and sedums. The species namely Agropyron cristatum, Festuca aurundinacea, Festuca ovina, Potentila sp., Frankinia thymifolia, Vinca minor, Sedum acre, Sedum spurinum, Carpobrotus edulis were imposed to natural chilling in autumn and winter using a randomized complete block design. For spring and summer, irrigation regimes at levels (48, 72 and 96 h intervals) in a factorial experiment based on a randomized complete block design with four replications were applied. The results showed that Agropyron cristatum, Frankinia thymifolia and Carpobrotus edulis were the best plants from each class. Carpobrotus edulis was the best choice for cold and warm seasons and this was followed by Frankinia thymifolia and Potentila sp. Vinca minor performed well in the cold seasons and Sedum spurinum appeared to be excellent in the warm seasons. The plants of the experiment showed significantly different appearances in different watering regimes. Little differences in drought tolerances were observed among the forbs and grasses, which must be watered during warm seasons. However, the succulents responded very well to the drought and low watering regimes. Overall, succulents and groundcovers were considered more appropriate for application in warm and cold seasons, respectively. According to the findings, drought and cold weather conditions cannot be a major obstacle for developing extensive green roofs in Iran if considerations are made on selecting its plant species. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - The role of selected agroforestry trees in temperature adaptation on coffea arabica: A case study of the Moshi District, Tanzania
SP  - 553-566
AB  - This study was conducted to assess the soil and air temperature levels of dominant tree species in agroforestry systems that influence Coffea arabica productivity. A purposive sampling technique was employed to select villages and farms from different agroecological zones. The data collection methods included questionnaires and focus groups with key informants. Soil and air temperatures were measured using temperature sensors. General linear models in SAS were employed to analyze the temperature data and Statistical Package for Social Science for socio economic data. Dominant tree species included Grevillea robusta, Albizia schimperiana and Rauvolfia caffra. There was a significant difference in soil and air temperature regulation among tree species in the midland (p < 0.05), with mean temperature differences of 0.5-1.6 and 0.2-0.4 °C for soil and air temperature, respectively. G. robusta significantly regulates soil and air temperature in both highland and midland zones (p < 0.05) compared to the other studied tree species that had mean temperature differences of 0.2-1.6 and 0.3-0.4 °C for soil and air temperature, respectively. Since moderate temperature favours Coffee productivity, G. robusta is recommended in both the midland and highlands; however, it is imperative to investigate how the soil impacted by G. robusta affects coffee productivity. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

TI  - Temperature, paternity and asynchronous hatching influence early developmental characteristics of larval Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua
VL  - 459
SP  - 70-79
AB  - Offspring, especially during early development, are influenced by both intrinsic properties endowed to them by their parents, extrinsic environmental factors as well as the interplay between genes and the environment. We investigated the effects of paternity (P), temperature (T), and asynchronous hatching on larval traits of cod, Gadus morhua from the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea. Daily cohorts of 4 half-sib families of Atlantic larvae and 5 half-sib families of Baltic larvae were incubated and hatched at 5 temperatures (Atlantic 2.0-10.0 degrees C, Baltic 6.5-12.5 degrees C) and imaged for notochord length (L-N), yolk-sac area (A(Y)), and deformities. Larvae hatching on a given day were incubated at the same temperature and sampled at 4 days post-hatch (DPH) for growth, yolk utilization rate (YUR) and efficiency (YUE). The mean SE duration of the hatching window decreased with increasing temperature in both Atlantic (5.4 +/- 0.1 to 2.6 +/- 0.3 days from 2.0 to 10.0 degrees C) and Baltic larvae (6.2 +/- 0.4 to 5.0 +/- 0.6 days from 6.5 to 12.5 degrees C) and L-N increased and A(Y) decreased for every subsequent day of hatch. Deformities increased with increasing T and P x T explained 523 and 26.8% of the variance for Atlantic and Baltic larvae, respectively. In Baltic larvae, size at peak hatch tended to decrease with increasing T and P x T explained 34.6% of the variance. In Atlantic larvae, growth, YUR and YUE were influenced by T while P alone explained 26.0% of the variance in YUE and up to 66.4% of variance in morphological traits at 4 DPH. Asynchronous hatching significantly affected larval growth, YUR, and YUE with P explaining 37.1% of the variance in growth for Atlantic larvae. Temperature and asynchronous hatching interacted to produce larvae that were generally longer and had smaller A(Y) if they were incubated at colder temperatures or if they hatched at the end of the hatching period at a specific temperature. Differences in larval morphometrics among temperatures for early hatching larvae decreased or even reversed for later hatching larvae. In light of anticipated global climate change, the present study on cod provides further insight in understanding the genotype-based variability and the adaptive potential to an ecologically changing environment.

TI  - Optimisation of warpage on plastic injection moulding part with MGSS conformal cooling channels moulds using response surface methodology (RSM)
VL  - 1835
AB  - Nowadays, there are various methods of optimisation works that have been explored by many researchers to find the appropriate processing parameters setting of injection moulding process. From the previous researches, it was reported that the optimisation work improved the moulded part quality. Apart from quality, the productivity in the injection moulding process also plays an important role. Therefore, some of the researchers have introduced the conformal cooling channels which have been proven to improve the quality and productivity of the moulded part. However, the application of optimisation work to determine an appropriate processing parameters setting in previous researches are only focusing on the conventional straight-drilled cooling channels and the application in conformal cooling channels are still lacking. In this study, the application of optimisation work to improve warpage of the front panel housing part with Milled Groove Square Shape (MGSS) conformal cooling channels has been explored. By selecting cooling time, cooling temperature, packing pressure and melt temperature as the variables, design of experiment (DOE) has been constructed by using the central composite design (CCD) approach. By performing Response Surface Methodology (RSM) optimisation approach, warpage of the moulded part has been optimised. Based on the results warpage has optimised by 46.5%. The finding shows that the application of optimisation work on the conformal cooling channels offers the best outcome. © 2017 Author(s).

TI  - The impact of soil carbon management and environmental conditions on N mineralization
VL  - 47
IS  - 6
SP  - 709-714
AB  - Soil carbon (C) management is identified as a key element of sustainable agriculture, and an increase in nitrogen (N) mineralization rates is expected with an increase in soil C. However, any practical recommendation for using soil C management to substitute the application of synthetic N fertilizer needs to account simultaneously for other important agronomic variables and environmental conditions. For this purpose we investigated the simultaneous impact of soil C management, environmental conditions, and soil structure on N mineralization in two apple orchard systems in Havelock North, New Zealand. One system is an organic orchard using regular compost applications and the other is a neighboring integrated orchard with no external inputs of organic matter. The soil type, texture, and climate are identical in both orchards. We selected different temperatures (10°C, 15°C, and 20°C) and soil moistures (-30, -100, and -300 kPa) as the environmental conditions for N mineralization. Simultaneously, the hot-water extractable C (HWC) contents were measured and served as the indicator for the soil C management of the orchards. To analyze the impact of soil structure, the N mineralization of undisturbed cores was compared with that of disturbed samples. The net N mineralization of the soil in the organic orchard was on average six times higher than that in the integrated orchard. At the same time, in the organic orchard the HWC contents at the beginning of the N mineralization experiment were about two times higher than in the integrated orchard. In a multiple regression as a practical recommendation for the orchards of our case study, we could explain 84% of the variability of N mineralization rates using HWC and environmental conditions as the independent variables. The HWC content was the most significant variable in the multiple regression model and showed that soil C management has a more prominent role than the environmental conditions. Soil C management such as regular compost applications which increase the soil's HWC contents can also be used to manage N mineralization. The significant difference between the undisturbed and disturbed samples showed the soil structure can have an effect on N mineralization. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Temperature effect on survival, growth, and triacylglycerol content during the early ontogeny of Mytilus edulis and M. Trossulus
VL  - 417
SP  - 183-191
AB  - Temperature is a major factor contributing to the biogeography of intertidal poikilo- therms. The population dynamics of intertidal invertebrates like mussels are strongly dependent on larval supply and larval mortality. Unlike adults, which are resistant to fluctuating environmental conditions, larvae are highly sensitive to the physicochemical conditions of the pelagic zone. The effects of rearing temperature on larval and post-larval performance of 2 coexisting mussels species, Mytilus edulis and M. trossulus, were examined in this study. In the first experiment, larvae of both species were reared separately at constant temperatures of 10, 17, and 24°C from D-larvae to the dissoconch stage. In the second experiment, pediveligers were reared under the same experimental conditions as the larvae for 2 wk. Survival, growth, and lipid composition (triacylglycerol [TAG] and sterol [ST] contents) were used to compare the performance of both species. The first experiment showed a species-specific thermal tolerance range, reflecting the biogeography of the species. M. trossulus larvae showed a preference for water at 10 and 17°C, corresponding to the more northerly distribution of this species, whereas M. edulis preferred temperatures of 17 and 24°C. Moreover, the TAG content in larvae of both species varied with temperature, supporting the hypothesis of a positive correlation between energy reserve content and the survival of mussel larvae. In contrast, the species-specific characteristics of thermal tolerance were not observed during post-larval development, suggesting that the selective effect of temperature on mussel species occurs during early ontogeny. © Inter-Research 2010.

TI  - Juvenile sea stars exposed to acidification decrease feeding and growth with no acclimation potential
VL  - 509
SP  - 227-239
AB  - Ocean acidification has the potential to affect growth and calcification of benthic marine invertebrates, particularly during their early life history. We exposed field-collected juveniles of Asterias rubens from Kiel Fjord (western Baltic Sea) to 3 seawater CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) levels (ranging from around 650 to 3500 μatm) in a long-term (39 wk) and a short-term (6 wk) experiment. In both experiments, survival and calcification were not affected by elevated pCO2. However, feeding rates decreased strongly with increasing pCO2, while aerobic metabolism and NH 4+ excretion were not significantly affected by CO 2 exposure. Consequently, high pCO2 reduced the scope for growth in A. rubens. Growth rates decreased substantially with increasing pCO2 and were reduced even at pCO2 levels occurring in the habitat today (e.g. during upwelling events). Sea stars were not able to acclimate to higher pCO2, and growth performance did not recover during the long-term experiment. Therefore, the top-down control exerted by this keystone species may be diminished during periods of high environmental pCO2 that already occur occasionally and will be even higher in the future. However, some individuals were able to grow at high rates even at high pCO2, indicating potential for rapid adaption. The selection of adapted specimens of A. rubens in this seasonally acidified habitat may lead to higher CO2 tolerance in adult sea stars of this population compared to the juvenile stage. Future studies need to address the synergistic effects of multiple stressors such as acidification, warming and reduced salinity, which will simultaneously impact the performance of sea stars in this habitat. © 2014 Inter-Research.

VL  - 11
IS  - 4
SP  - 437-451
AB  - Solar fuel is one of the ideal energy sources in the future. The synergy of photo and thermal effects leads to a new approach to higher solar fuel production under relatively mild conditions. This paper reviews different approaches for solar fuel production from spectrumselective photo-thermal synergetic catalysis. The review begins with the meaning of synergetic effects, and the mechanisms of spectrum-selectivity and photo-thermal catalysis. Then, from a technical perspective, a number of experimental or theoretical works are sorted by the chemical reactions and the sacrificial reagents applied. In addition, these works are summarized and tabulated based on the operating conditions, spectrum-selectivity, materials, and productivity. A discussion is finally presented concerning future development of photo-thermal catalytic reactions with spectrum-selectivity. © 2017, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - The threat of global climate change has caused concern among scientists because crop production could be severely affected by changes in key climatic variables that could compromise food security both globally and locally. Although it is true that extreme climatic events can severely impact small farmers, available data is just a gross approximation at understanding the heterogeneity of small scale agriculture ignoring the myriad of strategies that thousands of traditional farmers have used and still use to deal with climatic variability. Scientists have now realized that many small farmers cope with and even prepare for climate change, minimizing crop failure through a series of agroecological practices. Observations of agricultural performance after extreme climatic events in the last two decades have revealed that resiliency to climate disasters is closely linked to the high level of on-farm biodiversity, a typical feature of traditional farming systems. Based on this evidence, various experts have suggested that rescuing traditional management systems combined with the use of agroecologically based management strategies may represent the only viable and robust path to increase the productivity, sustainability and resilience of peasant-based agricultural production under predicted climate scenarios. In this paper we explore a number of ways in which three key traditional agroecological strategies (biodiversification, soil management and water harvesting) can be implemented in the design and management of agroecosystems allowing farmers to adopt a strategy that both increases resilience and provides economic benefits, including mitigation of global warming. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Temperature-based spawning habitat selection by Capelin (mallotus villosus) in Newfoundland
VL  - 74
IS  - 6
SP  - 1622-1629
AB  - The location of reproduction is a key life history trait, as it influences the bio-physical conditions that offspring experience and, thus, fitness. Capelin Mallotus villosus is a small (<200 mm), short-lived forage fish that spawns in two habitats in coastal Newfoundland: warm beaches and cool, deep water (15-40 m). From 2009 to 2014, we investigated temperature-dependent spawning habitat use by quantifying hourly temperature at spawning sites during July within each habitat along with population-level spawning site use. Capelin did not spawn at sites with temperatures <2 °C or consistently >12 °C, supporting the estimated suitable spawning temperature range (2-12 °C). Spawning typically occurred exclusively at beaches early in July when deep-water habitat was too cold (i.e.<2 °C), and then switched to deep-water habitat later in July when beaches became too warm (i.e.<12 °C). Spawning overlapped for 1-3 d in both habitats when temperatures were within suitable ranges (2011, 2013), but capelin also spawned exclusively in one habitat when temperatures remained suitable in the other. The latter suggests that other factors influence spawning habitat selection, such as conspecific egg densities and other environmental conditions. Overall, the flexible use of spawning habitats, along with wide tolerance ranges of capelin eggs to environmental conditions, are likely key adaptations to maximize fitness and stabilize population dynamics of this important forage fish species in an unpredictable environment. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2017.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Kidneys from marginal or donation after cardiac death (DCD) donors are particularly susceptible to injury during hypothermic preservation and may benefit from alternative methods of preservation. Normothermic preservation can be adapted to improve the quality of kidneys for transplantation by a variety of techniques. RECENT FINDINGS: Extracorporeal membrane support to maintain circulation before cooling and organ retrieval has been used to improve the condition of DCD donor kidneys, with lower rates of delayed graft function (DGF) compared with standard retrieval conditions. Experimentally, normothermic perfusion has been used in conjunction with hypothermic techniques as a resuscitation technique to improve graft outcome. An ex-vivo porcine kidney model showed that energy levels could be replenished to improve tissue perfusion during reperfusion. This technique was translated into a porcine transplant model demonstrating that it was a feasible and safe method of preservation. SUMMARY: Normothermic preservation techniques have the potential to be adapted into an improved method of retaining tissue viability compared with hypothermic techniques. Furthermore, they may be used as a device to enhance and assess the condition of the kidney which would be particularly beneficial for kidneys from DCD donors. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

VL  - 6

AB  - Pine wilt disease is caused by a complex of the pine wood nematode (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and its associated bacteria. To isolate the aseptic nematode, the sterilizing effect of seven chemicals on PWN and its accompanying bacteria Burkholderia cepacia (strain B619) in a series of concentration and treating time were investigated. B619 could be completely killed by peroxide, sodium hypochlorite, mercuric chloride, malachite green, and gentamycin and couldn’t by lysozyme and streptomycin. PWNs could not be disinfected effectively by any of these chemicals. However, The survival rate of PWN decreased as the treatment time and concentration of these disinfectants were increased. Treatments at room temperature (22 °C to 26 °C) or at low temperature (4 °C) improved the eliminating effect of 0.1% mercuric chloride, 3% peroxide, and 4% sodium hypochlorite. Higher PWN survival was observed at low temperatures compared with that at room temperature. The chemicals that most effectively eliminated the bacteria and decreased the PWN survival rate were 3% peroxide, 0.1% mercuric chloride, and 4% sodium hypochlorite. The results suggested that PWN might have a protective effect on its associated bacteria. © 2014, Journal of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Research. All rights reserved.

VL  - 22
IS  - 3
SP  - 205-213
AB  - Introduction - Sinigrin, a major glucosinolate present in Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.) seeds as the precursor of the anticancer compound allyl isothiocyanate, shows a wide range of biological activities. It's necessary to optimize the extraction methods and conditions, in order to improve the extraction productivity and save raw material. Objective - To systemically investigate and optimize the most important factors affected the productivity of sinigrin in the process of extraction using response surface methodology. Methodology - The ranges of three main factors including the ethanol concentration, extraction time and extraction temperature were selected by the one-factor-at-a-time method. The conditions of ultrasonic-stimulated extraction of sinigrin from defatted Indian mustard seed powder were optimized by Box-Behnken design to obtain the maximum productivity. Result - The predicted productivity (3.81%) was obtained using 57% ethanol concentration at 81 degrees C for 60 min, with the coefficient of the model R-2 > 0.96 (n = 17). The actual productivity (3.84 +/- 0.02%) of sinigrin under the optimized condition was increased by 70.67% compared with the result of conventional extraction. Meanwhile, HPLC, UV and IR were applied to examine if there is a difference between the ultrasonic-stimulated solvent extraction and conventional extraction, and the improvement of productivity of sinigrin depended on the destruction of cell wall caused by the elimination of outer pectinous material was explained by SEM and composition content analysis. Conclusion - The ultrasonic-stimulated solvent extraction was suggested to be a promising method to improve the productivity of sinigrin. And the results demonstrated that sinigrin productivity may be related to pectinous materials existed in the seeds. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - The temperature-size rule emerges from ontogenetic differences between growth and development rates
VL  - 26
IS  - 2
SP  - 483-492
AB  - The temperature-size rule (TSR) is a widespread phenomenon, which describes the phenotypic plastic response of species' size to temperature: individuals reared at colder temperatures mature as larger adults than at warmer temperatures. The TSR is driven by an unequal thermal response of growth and development rates. However, we currently lack an understanding of how these rates change through ontogeny and their decoupling. Further, we do not know how this decoupling varies across generations. Using the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana as a model, we examine growth and development rates through ontogeny at different temperatures across two generations. The slopes of natural-logged weight-specific growth rates against temperature are steeper in earlier than later larval stages, indicating their greater temperature dependence, whereas development rates maintain the same temperature dependence across life stages. An inverse TSR is generated in early larval stages; the typical TSR (smaller size at warmer temperatures) is only established later in ontogeny. Phase-specific temperature dependence of growth and development rates is not significantly different across the 1st and 2nd generation, suggesting the TSR is primarily a within-generation outcome. 6.Ontogenetic size responses in Artemia are compared to other crustacean species to identify patterns within this subphylum. Data for a range of crustaceans follow the same ontogenetic pattern: early larval stages show an inverse or no TSR, with TSR being only established in later stages. Adults often, but not always, show the greatest response. © 2012 The Authors. Functional Ecology © 2012 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Periplasmic peptidyl-prolyl isomerases SurA and FkpA play an important role in the starvation-stress response (SSR) of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
VL  - 98
IS  - 1
SP  - 51-63
AB  - Carbon-energy source (C)-starved cells of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) are remarkably more resistant to stress than actively growing ones. Carbon-starved S. Typhimurium is capable of withstanding extended periods of starvation and assault from a number of different stresses that rapidly kill growing cells. These unique properties of the C-starved cell are the direct result of a series of genetic and physiological adaptations referred to as the starvation-stress response (SSR). Previous work established that the SSR of S. Typhimurium is partially regulated by the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor σE. As part of an effort to identify σE-regulated SSR genes, we investigated surA and fkpA, encoding two different classes of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that function in folding cell envelope proteins. Both surA and fkpA are members of the heat-shock-inducible σE regulon of Escherichia coli. Although both genes are expressed in C-starved Salmonella cells, evidence indicates that surA and fkpA are not C-starvation-inducible. Furthermore, their expression during C-starvation does not appear to be σE-dependent. Nonetheless, surA and fkpA proved to be important, to differing degrees, for long-term C-starvation survival and for the cross-resistance of C-starved cells to high temperature, acidic pH, and the antimicrobial peptide polymyxin B, but neither were required for cross-resistance to oxidative stress. These results point to fundamental differences between heat-shock-inducible and C-starvation-inducible genes regulated by σE and suggest that genes other than surA and fkpA are involved in the σE-regulated branch of the SSR in Salmonella. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Modeling potential river management conflicts between frogs and salmonids
VL  - 73

SP  - 773-784
AB  - Management of regulated rivers for yellow-legged frogs (Rana boylii) and salmonids exemplifies potential conflicts among species adapted to different parts of the natural flow and temperature regimes. Yellow-legged frogs oviposit in rivers in spring and depend on declining flows and warming temperatures for egg and tadpole survival and growth, whereas salmonid management can include high spring flows and low-temperature reservoir releases. We built a model of how flow and temperature affect frog breeding success. Its mechanisms include adults selecting oviposition sites to balance risks of egg dewatering by decreasing flow versus scouring by high flow, temperature effects on development, habitat selection by tadpoles, and mortality via dewatering and scouring. In simulations of a regulated river managed primarily for salmonids, below-natural temperatures delayed tadpole metamorphosis into froglets, which can reduce overwinter survival. However, mitigating this impact via higher temperatures was predicted to cause adults to oviposit before spring flow releases for salmonids, which then scoured the egg masses. The relative timing of frog oviposition and high flow releases appears critical in determining conflicts between salmonid and frog management. © 2016, National Research Council of Canada.

TI  - Genetic variation in bacterial kidney disease (BKD) susceptibility in lake Michigan chinook salmon and its progenitor population from the puget sound
VL  - 26
IS  - 1
SP  - 9-18
AB  - Mass mortality events in wild fish due to infectious diseases are troubling, especially given the potential for long-term, population-level consequences. Evolutionary theory predicts that populations with sufficient genetic variation will adapt in response to pathogen pressure. Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha were introduced into Lake Michigan in the late 1960s from a Washington State hatchery population. In the late 1980s, collapse of the forage base and nutritional stress in Lake Michigan were thought to contribute to die-offs of Chinook Salmon due to bacterial kidney disease (BKD). Previously, we demonstrated that Lake Michigan Chinook Salmon from a Wisconsin hatchery have greater survival following BKD challenge relative to their progenitor population. Here, we evaluated whether the phenotypic divergence of these populations in BKD susceptibility was due to selection rather than genetic drift. Comparison of the overall magnitude of quantitative trait to neutral marker divergence between the populations suggested selection had occurred but a direct test of quantitative trait divergence was not significant, preventing the rejection of the null hypothesis of differentiation through genetic drift. Estimates of phenotypic variation (V-P ), additive genetic variation (V-A ) and narrow-sense heritability (h (2)) were consistently higher in the Wisconsin relative to the Washington population. If selection had acted on the Wisconsin population there was no evidence of a concomitant loss of genetic variation in BKD susceptibility. The Renibacterium salmoninarum exposures were conducted at both 14 degrees C and 9 degrees C; the warmer temperature accelerated time to death in both populations and there was no evidence of phenotypic plasticity or a genotype-by-environment (G x E) interaction. High h (2) estimates for BKD susceptibility in the Wisconsin population, combined with a lack of phenotypic plasticity, predicts that future adaptive gains in BKD resistance are still possible and that these adaptive gains would be stable under the temperature range evaluated here.

TI  - Advanced Control of Frictional Properties on Paper Clutch Materials by a Combination of Friction Modifiers
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
SP  - 103-109
AB  - This study proposes a novel approach for controlling frictional performances at paper clutch systems by a combination of organic friction modifiers (OFMs). The OFMs are commonly used for modifying the frictional properties at the paper clutch. Although the effect of the OFMs tends to be dependent on temperature due to their working mechanism based on the surface adsorption, the frictional properties are preferable to be stable in all the operating temperature for the consistent and precise clutch control. Aiming to modify the temperature dependence of the OFM effect, an OFM with an Advanced Concept (FMAC) was newly developed, and the impact on the clutch frictional performance was investigated using Low Velocity Friction Apparatus (LVFA). Only with the conventional OFM, the friction values experienced excessive reduction at 80 or 120°C, while an optimal property was achieved at 40°C. In the presence of the FMAC, it was possible to inhibit the conventional OFM selectively at the high temperature conditions preventing the friction reduction, leading to the ideal frictional property in all the temperature conditions. The surface analysis revealed that the FMACs were capable of adsorbing on the substrate more intensively at high temperature, which should be the reason of the temperature dependent competitive effect of the FMACs.

TI  - Temperature, stress and spontaneous mutation in Caenorhabditis briggsae and Caenorhabditis elegans
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - Mutation rate often increases with environmental temperature, but establishing causality is complicated. Asymmetry between physiological stress and deviation from the optimal temperature means that temperature and stress are often confounded. We allowed mutations to accumulate in two species of Caenorhabditis for approximately 100 generations at 18° and for approximately 165 generations at 26°; 26° is stressful for Caenorhabditis elegans but not for Caenorhabditis briggsae. We report mutation rates at a set of microsatellite loci and estimates of the per-generation decay of fitness (DMw), the genomic mutation rate for fitness (U) and the average effect of a new mutation (E[a]), assayed at both temperatures. In C. elegans, the microsatellite mutation rate is significantly greater at 26° than at 18° whereas in C. briggsae there is only a slight, non-significant increase in mutation rate at 26°, consistent with stress-dependent mutation in C. elegans. The fitness data from both species qualitatively reinforce the microsatellite results. The fitness results of C. elegans are potentially complicated by selection, but also suggest temperature-dependent mutation; the difference between the two species suggests that physiological stress plays a significant role in the mutational process. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - One-stage syngas-to-fuel in a micro-structured reactor: Investigation of integration pattern and operating conditions on the selectivity and productivity of liquid fuels
VL  - 326
SP  - 37-46
AB  - A one-stage syngas-to-fuel process was carried out by integrating Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) with hydrocracking (HC) in a micro-reactor to verify the feasibility of a related process simplification with a view to small-scale X-to-liquid (XtL) plants. Different approaches to the integration of the two process steps and the influence of the operating conditions were investigated targeting liquid fuel synthesis (C-5-C-20). It was proven that FTS plays the determining role in the integrated process and HC only exhibits a promoting function. Good performance was obtained in both sequential and mixed-bed systems. With an increase of temperature the liquid fuel selectivity reaches a plateau value of around 70% at 230-250 degrees C, depending on the integration pattern and syngas space velocity. H-2/CO ratio and pressure only have limited influence on the fuel selectivity. FTS was enhanced in the mixed-bed configuration. Meanwhile, consistent hydrocarbon distribution was obtained for both integration patterns when reaching the plateau fuel selectivity. The catalyst stability in both configurations was analyzed, and a reasonable and comparable long-term stability was obtained. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - NPP vulnerability of the potential vegetation of China to climate change in the past and future
VL  - 27
IS  - 2
SP  - 131-142
AB  - Using the Integrated Biosphere Simulator, a dynamic vegetation model, this study initially simulated the net primary productivity (NPP) dynamics of China’s potential vegetation in the past 55 years (1961–2015) and in the future 35 years (2016–2050). Then, taking the NPP of the potential vegetation in average climate conditions during 1986–2005 as the basis for evaluation, this study examined whether the potential vegetation adapts to climate change or not. Meanwhile, the degree of inadaptability was evaluated. Finally, the NPP vulnerability of the potential vegetation was evaluated by synthesizing the frequency and degrees of inadaptability to climate change. In the past 55 years, the NPP of desert ecosystems in the south of the Tianshan Mountains and grassland ecosystems in the north of China and in western Tibetan Plateau was prone to the effect of climate change. The NPP of most forest ecosystems was not prone to the influence of climate change. The low NPP vulnerability to climate change of the evergreen broad-leaved and coniferous forests was observed. Furthermore, the NPP of the desert ecosystems in the north of the Tianshan Mountains and grassland ecosystems in the central and eastern Tibetan Plateau also had low vulnerability to climate change. In the next 35 years, the NPP vulnerability to climate change would reduce the forest–steppe in the Songliao Plain, the deciduous broad-leaved forests in the warm temperate zone, and the alpine steppe in the central and western Tibetan Plateau. The NPP vulnerability would significantly increase of the temperate desert in the Junggar Basin and the alpine desert in the Kunlun Mountains. The NPP vulnerability of the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests would also increase. The area of the regions with increased vulnerability would account for 27.5% of China. © 2017, Institute of Geographic Science and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR), Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Mutation and immobilization techniques were applied to uridine phosphorylase (UP) from Escherichia coli in order to enhance its thermal stability and hence productivity in a biocatalytic reaction. UP was evolved by iterative saturation mutagenesis. Compared to the wild type enzyme, which had a temperature optimum of 40 degrees C and a half-life of 9.89 h at 60 degrees C. the selected mutant had a temperature optimum of 60 degrees C and a half-life of 17.3 h at 60 degrees C. Self-immobilization of the native UP as a Spherezyme showed a 3.3 fold increase in thermostability while immobilized mutant enzyme showed a 4.4 fold increase in thermostability when compared to native UP. Combining UP with the purine nucleoside phosphorylase from Bacillus halodurans allows for synthesis of 5-methyluridine (a pharmaceutical intermediate) from guanosine and thymine in a one-pot transglycosylation reaction. Replacing the wild type UP with the mutant allowed for an increase in reaction temperature to 65 degrees C and increased the reaction productivity from 10 to 31 gl(-1) h(-1). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Simple Technologies for Converting Rest Raw Materials of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) into High-Quality, Valuable, and Tasty Feed Ingredients
VL  - 26
IS  - 5
SP  - 604-619
AB  - Rest raw materials as viscera, heads, and frames from farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were hydrolyzed with the use of endogenous enzymes and the commercial enzymes Protamex and a mixture of Papain and Bromelain. Composition of the prehydrolysis mixture clearly influenced the quality of final hydrolysate and process kinetics. An increased proportion of viscera increased the amount of endogenous enzymes, which influenced hydrolysis kinetics, the extent of hydrolysis, and increased bitterness. Commercial enzymes, in addition to endogenous enzymes, are not always more yield efficient or economically beneficial but can be used to improve the taste and to ease the separation of oil from the hydrolysate fraction. Hydrolysis of denatured proteins in rest raw materials was hardly detectable. Optimum temperature should therefore be selected to avoid protein denaturation and simultaneously maintain high enzymatic activity. Hydrolysates preferably contain a low concentration of oil, and this work shows that high-quality oil can be separated before hydrolysis by mild thermal treatment. The previous separation of oil did not influence hydrolysate yield and decreased the concentration of lipids in the final hydrolysate. The initial separation of oil also increased productivity of the hydrolysis reactor, due to the reduction of hydrolysis volume. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

VL  - 55

SP  - 789-797
AB  - The striped flea beetle, Phyllotreta striolata (F.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is an economically important pest on crucifer vegetables worldwide. Twenty isolates of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) (Rhabditida: Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae) were evaluated against soil-dwelling stages of the flea beetle in the laboratory. The corrected mortalities and reproduction rates at a concentration of 36 infective juveniles (IJs) cm-2 surface area of sand against third instars of the pest greatly differed among the tested isolates, ranging from 6.7% to 100%. When tested over a range of temperatures from 15°C to 35°C, 25°C was found to be the optimal temperature for four selected nematode isolates (Steinernemacarpocapsae All, Steinernemapakistanense 94-1, Heterorhabditis indica LN2 and H. indica 212-2) to infect the third instar and reproduce in the cadavers. S. pakistanense 94-1 and H. indica 212-2 showed markedly greater heat-tolerance compared to S. carpocapsae All and H. indica LN2. Corrected mortalities and reproduction rates increased as the concentration of IJs increased from 4 to 36 IJs cm-2. The LC50 values of S. carpocapsae All, S. pakistanense 94-1, H. indica LN2 and 212-2 were 17.1, 15.5, 6.5 and 5. 9 IJs cm-2, respectively. The third instars larvae and pupae of P. striolata were more susceptible to the four nematode isolates than the first and second instars. Higher pathogenicity and greater heat tolerance and reproduction potential makes H. indica 212-2 the most promising candidate for the biological control of P. striolata under the field conditions of South China. © 2010 International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC).

TI  - Genotype and local environment dynamically influence growth, disturbance response and survivorship in the threatened coral, Acropora cervicornis
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
AB  - The relationship between the coral genotype and the environment is an important area of research in degraded coral reef ecosystems. We used a reciprocal outplanting experiment with 930 corals representing ten genotypes on each of eight reefs to investigate the influence of genotype and the environment on growth and survivorship in the threatened Caribbean staghorn coral, Acropora cervicornis. Coral genotype and site were strong drivers of coral growth and individual genotypes exhibited flexible, non-conserved reaction norms, complemented by ten-fold differences in growth between specific G-E combinations. Growth plasticity may diminish the influence of local adaptation, where foreign corals grew faster than native corals at their home sites. Novel combinations of environment and genotype also significantly affected disturbance response during and after the 2015 bleaching event, where these factors acted synergistically to drive variation in bleaching and recovery. Importantly, small differences in temperature stress elicit variable patterns of survivorship based on genotype and illustrate the importance of novel combinations of coral genetics and small differences between sites representing habitat refugia. In this context, acclimatization and flexibility is especially important given the long lifespan of corals coping with complex environmental change. The combined influence of site and genotype creates shortterm differences in growth and survivorship, contributing to the standing genetic variation needed for adaptation to occur over longer timescales and the recovery of degraded reefs through natural mechanisms. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

AB  - A biocompatible photothermal nanomedicine based on a PEGylated nanogel containing gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in a cross-linked network core of stimuli-responsive poly[2-(N,N-diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (PEAMA) gel for cancer photothermal therapy (PTT) was prepared through the reduction of Au(iii) ions without any reducing agents. The influence of the reduction conditions, such as pH, temperature, and N/Au ratio (molar ratio of the amino groups in the PEGylated nanogel to the Au(iii) ions), on the formation of the GNPs in the stimuli-responsive PEAMA gel core (reducing environment) was also studied. Note that the PEGylated nanogel containing GNPs prepared at pH 6, 60 °C and N/Au = 1 (PEGylated GNG (1)) was found to have the highest GNP-loading capacity with a diameter of about 8 nm, as observed by TEM; viz., about 27 GNPs formed in a single PEAMA gel core. PEGylated GNG (1) showed a remarkable photothermal efficacy (ΔT = 7.7 °C) under irradiation with Ar ion (Ar+) laser (514.5 nm) at a fluence of 39 W cm-2 for 6 min (14 kJ cm -2). Note that PEGylated GNG (1) showed non-cytotoxicity in the absence of irradiation with Ar+ laser (480 μg mL-1: &gt; 90% cell viability), whereas pronounced cytotoxicity (IC50 = 110 μg mL-1) was observed for PEGylated GNG (1) under irradiation with Ar+ laser at a fluence of 26 W cm-2 for 5 min (7.8 kJ cm-2), because of the heat-generation from the GNPs in the cells, which resulted in selective and noninvasive cancer PTT. Thus, PEGylated GNG (1), which has a high GNP-loading capacity, would be a promising nanomedicine for cancer PTT. © 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

VL  - 30

SP  - 1373-1383
AB  - In viviparous ectotherms, the interval between reproductive bouts is often extended by long gestation times, preventing multiple reproductive events per annum. We assessed the potential roles of physiological adaptation and environmental constraints in driving an unusual case of geographic variation in life history, in the viviparous lizard (Eulamprus quoyii), which has either one or two reproductive bouts per annum, depending on the geographic location of the population. Using dynamic energy budget theory, we developed an integrated model of the energetics of growth and reproduction in this lizard, and applied it in conjunction with biophysical calculations of body temperature and activity time across its geographic range to predict reproductive frequency. Our model indicated that geographic variation in body temperature alone (i.e. environmental constraints) explained the observed pattern of litter frequency, suggesting that differences in energy allocation among populations were unlikely to be a major cause of differences in litter frequency in E. quoyii. It also suggested that natural selection should favour fixation of litter size in the transition zone. © 2015 The Authors. Functional Ecology © 2015 British Ecological Society

VL  - 49

SP  - 373-388
AB  - Water temperature is a key driver of aquatic processes. Monitoring stream water temperature is key to understanding current species distributions and future climate change impacts on freshwater ecosystems. However, a very small fraction of streams are continuously monitored for water temperature throughout North America, due to prohibitive logistical costs. We develop a framework that aids in developing cost-effective stream temperature monitoring by using stream habitat features to inform strategic site selection of temperature monitoring sites. We test this framework using sockeye salmon spawning streams as a model, which included 19 streams in the northern-most watershed of the Fraser River Basin, British Columbia, Canada. The objective of this framework is to evaluate the trade-off between cost (i.e., the number of streams monitored) and the effectiveness of monitoring scenarios at meeting different monitoring objectives. We compared monitoring scenarios that were informed by well-established relationships between variables and that are commonly collected or available as part of other monitoring activities (stream length, magnitude, order, gradient, wetted width, and spot temperatures) and water temperature metrics (maximum, mean, and variance during August) derived from continuously monitored streams to monitoring scenarios where streams were randomly selected. Informed scenarios included streams that were selected in order of watershed level and stream habitat characteristics (e.g., longest to shortest); ordering was based on the relationship between each habitat variable and temperature metrics. Informed monitoring scenarios were then compared to random selection of monitoring sites with regard to how well monitoring scenarios met two management objectives during the critical salmon spawning period: (1) identifying streams that exceed a temperature threshold and (2) identifying streams that represent the temperature regime of a complex of streams (e.g., mean and variance of streams within an aggregate of streams). Management objectives were met by monitoring fewer streams using the informed monitoring scenarios rather than the average of the random scenarios. This highlights how common inexpensive watershed level variables that relate to stream temperature can inform the strategic selection of sites and lead to more cost-effective stream temperature monitoring. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - A half century of high-altitude studies in anthropology: Introduction to the plenary session
VL  - 25

SP  - 148-150
AB  - Until 50 years ago, high-altitude terrestrial research was conducted largely within the realm of environmental physiology, where interests were focused on physiological mechanisms and mountain exploration. Scientists from the United States, Europe, and Peru had developed sophisticated physiological models of adaptation and acclimatization to the hypoxia of high altitude, but very little research had been conducted on permanent residents, particularly natives of high altitude in the two major regions of the world-the Andes and the Himalayas. In 1962, Raul T. Baker initiated a project at the Pennsylvania State University to explore the responses of indigenous Peruvians to the major stresses at altitude: hypoxia and cold. Approaches to this early research were anthropological in perspective and centered on population-level studies with an evolutionary approach. Studies were conducted by applying a combination of physiological experimental methods, simulated field experiments, and extended anthropological field observations. Early hypotheses at this time were that heredity played a major role in the adaptive complexes in native high-altitude residents. These early hypotheses were later modified to incorporate or replace the genetic hypotheses with developmental adaptation models. A half century of research within anthropology and research in other fields has presented a vastly more complex and integrated picture of high-altitude adaptation in native residents. Recent studies incorporate physiology and oxygen transport, population and molecular genetics, reproduction, growth, and development. The history and current status of high-altitude research and its anthropological applications are treated in papers from this plenary symposium. Am. J. Hum.

TI  - Methods for determining nitrogen release from controlled-release fertilizers used for vegetable production
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
SP  - 20-24
AB  - The purpose of this article is to review nitrogen (N) controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) research methods used to measure nutrient release from CRFs. If CRF-N release patterns match vegetable crop needs, crop N uptake may become more efficient, thus resulting in similar or greater yields, reduced fertilizer N needs, and reduced environmental N losses. Three methods categories to estimate N release are: laboratory; growth chamber, greenhouse, or both; and field methods. Laboratory methods include a standard and accelerated temperature-controlled incubation methods (TCIMs); methods incubate CRF using selected time periods, temperatures, and/or sampling methods. Accelerated TCIMs, in contrast to the standard method, allow for shorter incubation periods. Growth chamber and greenhouse methods, including column and plastic bag studies, may be used to test new CRF products in conditions similar to particular vegetable production systems. However, the column method predicts N release from CRFs more effectively than the plastic bag method because of ammonia volatilization and lower N recovery rates associated with the bag method. Both field methods, pot-in-pot and pouch methods, are viable vegetable research options. The pouch method measures N remaining in the CRF prill and the pot-in-pot method measures N released from the CRY, thus each method can be applied to different research objectives. Nitrogen released during incubation may be measured using methods such as total Kjeldahl N (TKN), prill weight loss, combustion, colorirnetric, or ion-specific electrodes. The prill weight loss method is the least expensive but can only be used with urea CRF. Thus, the CRF-N source(s) and research objectives will determine the appropriate N analysis method. More research needs to be completed on correlations of field and laboratory CRY extractions. Field release methods should be considered the most reliable indicator of CRF-N performance until a laboratory method reliably predicts CRF-N expected field response.

TI  - Modelling the future hydroclimatology of the lower Fraser River and its impacts on the spawning migration survival of sockeye salmon
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
SP  - 87-98
AB  - Short episodic high temperature events can be lethal for migrating adult Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.). We downscaled temperatures for the Fraser River, British Columbia to evaluate the impact of climate warming on the frequency of exceeding thermal thresholds associated with salmon migratory success. Alarmingly, a modest 1.0 °C increase in average summer water temperature over 100 years (1981-2000 to 2081-2100) tripled the number of days per year exceeding critical salmonid thermal thresholds (i.e. 19.0 °C). Refined thresholds for two populations (Gates Creek and Weaver Creek) of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) were defined using physiological constraint models based on aerobic scope. While extreme temperatures leading to complete aerobic collapse remained unlikely under our warming scenario, both populations were increasingly forced to migrate upriver at reduced levels of aerobic performance (e.g. in 80% of future simulations, ≥90% of salmon encountered temperatures exceeding population-specific thermal optima for maximum aerobic scope; Topt=16.3 °C for Gates Creek and Topt=14.5 °C for Weaver Creek). Assuming recent changes to river entry timing persist, we also predicted dramatic increases in the probability of freshwater mortality for Weaver Creek salmon due to reductions in aerobic, and general physiological, performance (e.g. in 42% of future simulations≥50% of Weaver Creek fish exceeded temperature thresholds associated with 0-60% of maximum aerobic scope). Potential for adaptation via directional selection on run-timing was more evident for the Weaver Creek population. Early entry Weaver Creek fish experienced 25% (range: 15-31%) more suboptimal temperatures than late entrants, compared with an 8% difference (range: 0-17%) between early and late Gates Creek fish. Our results emphasize the need to consider daily temperature variability in association with population-specific differences in behaviour and physiological constraints when forecasting impacts of climate change on migratory survival of aquatic species. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Extreme Weather Events and the German Economy: The Potential for Climate Change Adaptation
SP  - 125
AB  - Although climate change is a global challenge, its effects occur locally and differ by region. A feasible adaptation strategy needs to assess regional damages and their socio-economic effects. For Germany, the largest threat comes from extreme weather events, which will impact residential and commercial buildings, infrastructure and in the case of heat waves will limit labor productivity. This paper presents findings from a study of economic effects of climate change adaptation until the year 2050 in Germany on different scales. In particular, the authors have applied an input–output-based macroeconometric model, adjusting it to cope with the challenges of damages from heat waves, and river flood events, by integrating suitable adaptation measures to such events into the model. Infrastructure damages, shifts from domestic production to imports, and low levels of productivity due to heat waves, are some of the topics the paper deals with. Comparing scenarios with (a) integrated extreme weather events and (b) adaptation measures with a reference scenario without extreme weather or adaptation, the simulation results reveal slightly negative effects on economic sectors and Germany’s economy as a whole. These effects intensify over time and hurt the economy. Adaptation measures reduce the damages and pay off, but the economy is still worse off with climate change. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

SP  - 65-70
AB  - Proteins' thermal stabilization is a significant problem in various biomedical, biotechnological, and technological applications. We investigated thermal stability of hen egg white lysozyme in aqueous solutions of the following stabilizing osmolytes: Glycine (GLY), N-methylglycine (NMG), N,N-dimethylglycine (DMG), N,N,N-trimethylglycine (TMG), and trimethyl-N-oxide (TMAO). Results of CD-UV spectroscopic investigation were compared with FTIR hydration studies' results. Selected osmolytes increased lysozyme's thermal stability in the following order: Gly>NMG>TMAO≈DMG>TMG. Theoretical calculations (DFT) showed clearly that osmolytes' amino group protons and water molecules interacting with them played a distinctive role in protein thermal stabilization. The results brought us a step closer to the exact mechanism of protein stabilization by osmolytes.

TI  - Heritable variation in heat shock gene expression: A potential mechanism for adaptation to thermal stress in embryos of sea turtles
VL  - 283
IS  - 1822
AB  - The capacity of species to respond adaptively to warming temperatures will be key to their survival in the Anthropocene. The embryos of egg-laying species such as sea turtles have limited behavioural means for avoiding high nest temperatures, and responses at the physiological level may be critical to coping with predicted global temperature increases. Using the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) as a model, we used quantitative PCR to characterise variation in the expression response of heat-shock genes (hsp60, hsp70 and hsp90; molecular chaperones involved in cellular stress response) to an acute non-lethal heat shock. We show significant variation in gene expression at the clutch and population levels for some, but not all hsp genes. Using pedigree information, we estimated heritabilities of the expression response of hsp genes to heat shock and demonstrated both maternal and additive genetic effects. This is the first evidence that the heat-shock response is heritable in sea turtles and operates at the embryonic stage in any reptile. The presence of heritable variation in the expression of key thermotolerance genes is necessary for sea turtles to adapt at a molecular level to warming incubation environments. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

VL  - 195

SP  - 809-830
AB  - While the cellular heat-shock response has been a paradigm for studying the impact of thermal stress on RNA metabolism and gene expression, the genome-wide response to thermal stress and its connection to physiological stress resistance remain largely unexplored. Here, we address this issue using an array-based exon expression analysis to interrogate the transcriptome in recently established Drosophila melanogaster stocks during severe thermal stress and recovery. We first demonstrated the efficacy of exon-level analyses to reveal a level of thermally induced transcriptome complexity extending well beyond gene-level analyses. Next, we showed that the upper range of both the cellular and physiological thermal stress response profoundly affected message expression and processing in D. melanogaster, limiting expression to a small subset of transcripts, many that share features of known rapidly responding stress genes. As predicted from cellular heat-shock research, constitutive splicing was blocked in a set of novel genes; we did not detect changes to alternative splicing during heat stress, but rather induction of intronless isoforms of known heatresponsive genes. We observed transcriptome plasticity in the form of differential isoform expression during recovery from heat shock, mediated by multiple mechanisms including alternative transcription and alternative splicing. This affected genes involved in DNA regulation, immune response, and thermotolerance. These patterns highlight the complex nature of innate transcriptome responses under stress and potential for adaptive shifts through plasticity and evolved genetic responses at different hierarchical levels. © 2013 by the Genetics Society of America.

VL  - 7
AB  - A large body of literature has recently recognized the role of microclimates in controlling the physiology and ecology of species, yet the relevance of fine-scale climatic data for modeling species performance and distribution remains a matter of debate. Using a 6-year monitoring of three potato moth species, major crop pests in the tropical Andes, we asked whether the spatiotemporal resolution of temperature data affect the predictions of models of moth performance and distribution. For this, we used three different climatic data sets: (i) the WorldClim dataset (global dataset), (ii) air temperature recorded using data loggers (weather station dataset), and (iii) air crop canopy temperature (microclimate dataset). We developed a statistical procedure to calibrate all datasets to monthly and yearly variation in temperatures, while keeping both spatial and temporal variances (air monthly temperature at 1 km2 for the WorldClim dataset, air hourly temperature for the weather station, and air minute temperature over 250 m radius disks for the microclimate dataset). Then, we computed pest performances based on these three datasets. Results for temperature ranging from 9 to 11°C revealed discrepancies in the simulation outputs in both survival and development rates depending on the spatiotemporal resolution of the temperature dataset. Temperature and simulated pest performances were then combined into multiple linear regression models to compare predicted vs. field data. We used an additional set of study sites to test the ability of the results of our model to be extrapolated over larger scales. Results showed that the model implemented with microclimatic data best predicted observed pest abundances for our study sites, but was less accurate than the global dataset model when performed at larger scales. Our simulations therefore stress the importance to consider different temperature datasets depending on the issue to be solved in order to accurately predict species abundances. In conclusion, keeping in mind that the mismatch between the size of organisms and the scale at which climate data are collected and modeled remains a key issue, temperature dataset selection should be balanced by the desired output spatiotemporal scale for better predicting pest dynamics and developing efficient pest management strategies. © 2016 Rebaudo, Faye and Dangles.

VL  - 79
SP  - 230-238
AB  - The effects of heating rate (HR) on the performance of two-phase (batch followed by fed-batch) high cell-density cultivations (HCDC) of E. coli DH5 alpha for the production of plasmid DNA (pDNA) were investigated. Optimal temperatures for the HCDC, as selected from shake flask experiments at constant temperatures between 30 and 45 degrees C, were 35 degrees C for biomass accumulation in the batch phase and 42 degrees C for inducing pDNA replication during the fed-batch. In HCDC the temperature was increased at HR of 0.025, 0.05, 0.10 and 0.25 degrees C/min and the performance of the cultivations were compared to a HCDC run at constant temperature (35 degrees C). Compared to constant 35 degrees C, heat-induced HCDC accumulated up to 50% less biomass within the same cultivation time and acetate and glucose accumulated to high concentrations. The overall specific productivity (Q(P)) and average pDNA yield (Y-p/x) in HCDC at 35 degrees C were 0.22 +/- 0.02 mg/g h and 5.3 +/- 0.00 mg/g, respectively. Such parameters were maximum at a HR of 0.05 degrees C/min, reaching 0.56 +/- 0.06 mg/g h and 9.3 +/- 0.6 mg/g, respectively. At HR above 0.5 degrees C/min, Y-p/x remained relatively constant, whereas Q(P) tended to decrease. The supercolied pDNA fraction remained around 80% at all HR. Bioreactors were equipped with a capacitance/conductivity probe. In all cases biomass concentration correlated closely with the capacitance signal and acetate and glucose accumulation was accompanied by an increase in the conductivity signal. Thus, it was possible to calculate acetate and biomass concentrations, as well as mu, from online capacitance and conductivity signals using estimators. Altogether, in this study it was shown that it is possible to maximize pDNA productivity by choosing an appropriate HR and that relevant parameters can be estimated by capacitance/conductivity signals, which are useful for better process control and development.

VL  - 9

SP  - 492-500
AB  - Interpretation of bacteriohopanepolyol (BHP) biomarkers tracing microbiological processes in modern and ancient sediments relies on understanding environmental controls of production and preservation. BHPs from methanotrophs (35-aminoBHPs) were studied in methane-amended aerobic river-sediment incubations at different temperatures. It was found that: (i) With increasing temperature (4°C–40°C) a 10-fold increase in aminopentol (associated with Crenothrix and Methylobacter spp. growth) occurred with only marginal increases in aminotriol and aminotetrol; (ii) A further increase in temperature (50°C) saw selection for the thermophile Methylocaldum and mixtures of aminopentol and C-3 methylated aminopentol, again, with no increase in aminotriol and aminotetrol. (iii) At 30°C, more aminopentol and an aminopentol isomer and unsaturated aminopentol were produced after methanotroph growth and the onset of substrate starvation/oxygen depletion. (iv) At 50°C, aminopentol and C-3 methylated aminopentol, only accumulated during growth but were clearly resistant to remineralization despite cell death. These results have profound implications for the interpretation of aminoBHP distributions and abundances in modern and past environments. For instance, a temperature regulation of aminopentol production but not aminotetrol or aminotriol is consistent with and, corroborative of, observed aminopentol sensitivity to climate warming recorded in a stratigraphic sequence deposited during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM). © 2017 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - The coevolution of virulence: Tolerance in perspective
VL  - 6
IS  - 9
AB  - Coevolutionary interactions, such as those between host and parasite, predator and prey, or plant and pollinator, evolve subject to the genes of both interactors. It is clear, for example, that the evolution of pollination strategies can only be understood with knowledge of both the pollinator and the pollinated. Studies of the evolution of virulence, the reduction in host fitness due to infection, have nonetheless tended to focus on parasite evolution. Host-centric approaches have also been proposed-for example, under the rubric of "tolerance", the ability of hosts to minimize virulence without necessarily minimizing parasite density. Within the tolerance framework, however, there is room for more comprehensive measures of host fitness traits, and for fuller consideration of the consequences of coevolution. For example, the evolution of tolerance can result in changed selection on parasite populations, which should provoke parasite evolution despite the fact that tolerance is not directly antagonistic to parasite fitness. As a result, consideration of the potential for parasite counter-adaptation to host tolerance-whether evolved or medially manipulated-is essential to the emergence of a cohesive theory of biotic partnerships and robust disease control strategies. © 2010 Little et al.

TI  - Thermal carrying capacity for a thermally-sensitive species at the warmest edge of its range
VL  - 8
IS  - 11
AB  - Anthropogenic environmental change is causing unprecedented rates of population extirpation and altering the setting of range limits for many species. Significant population declines may occur however before any reduction in range is observed. Determining and modelling the factors driving population size and trends is consequently critical to predict trajectories of change and future extinction risk. We tracked during 12 years 51 populations of a cold-water fish species (brown trout Salmo trutta) living along a temperature gradient at the warmest thermal edge of its range. We developed a carrying capacity model in which maximum population size is limited by physical habitat conditions and regulated through territoriality. We first tested whether population numbers were driven by carrying capacity dynamics and then targeted on establishing (1) the temperature thresholds beyond which population numbers switch from being physical habitat- to temperature-limited; and (2) the rate at which carrying capacity declines with temperature within limiting thermal ranges. Carrying capacity along with emergent density-dependent responses explained up to 76% of spatio-temporal density variability of juveniles and adults but only 50% of young-of-the-year's. By contrast, young-of-the-year trout were highly sensitive to thermal conditions, their performance declining with temperature at a higher rate than older life stages, and disruptions being triggered at lower temperature thresholds. Results suggest that limiting temperature effects were progressively stronger with increasing anthropogenic disturbance. There was however a critical threshold, matching the incipient thermal limit for survival, beyond which realized density was always below potential numbers irrespective of disturbance intensity. We additionally found a lower threshold, matching the thermal limit for feeding, beyond which even unaltered populations declined. We predict that most of our study populations may become extinct by 2100, depicting the gloomy fate of thermally-sensitive species occurring at thermal range margins under limited potential for adaptation and dispersal. © 2013 Ayllón et al.

TI  - Optimization of technique parameters of annular mould briquetting machine for straw briquette compressing
VL  - 29
IS  - 22
SP  - 32-41
AB  - China is a large agricultural nation with abundant straw resources, and the crop straw is regarded as a kind of precious biology resource. Recently, the straw briquetting technology was found to be an effective way to solve the low comprehensive utilization of straw. The annular mould briquetting machine has become the mainstream equipment among lot of straw curing equipment, because of its lower energy consumption, wear resistance and high productivity, etc. However, the present biomass compression molding process research mainly concentrates on the experiments and theories of corn stalks, cotton stalks, wheat straw, and wood chips molding instead of rice straw molding, especially by using annular mould briquetting. A significant feature of molding briquette is the physical properties that directly determine the transportation, usage requirements, and the storage condition of compression moldings. Both the relaxed density and the durability are the indexes to measure the physical properties of molding briquette. This paper introduced the process of the straw's compressing by using a 9JYK-2000A type of annular mould. The rice straw was taken as material in the experiments and the influence of the key work parameters on straw's compressing was analyzed. Besides, the optimal parameter combination was obtained in the experiments. A central composite rotatable orthogonal experimental design of response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to find the optimum technical parameters. Relaxed density and crush resistance were selected as responses, and the material moisture content, operation temperatures, clearances between rolls and die, and screw rotary speed were selected as input variables with five levels respectively. A design-expert 8.0.6 regression analysis method and a response surface method were applied to analyze the regression equation of relaxed density and crush resistance. In addition, the mathematical model has been established to analyze the effect of four factors on test indexes. The experiments showed that the proposed model was agreeable with the practical condition, which could adequately reflect the relations among factors. Through the experimental analysis, the rules of influence and the contribution brought by the interaction among factors on relaxed density and crush resistance were discussed, and finally the optimized process parameters was obtained. The value of relaxed density and crush resistance was predicted by applying a regression equation. Moreover, the optimal parameters were chosen to verify the reliability of the experimental results. Results indicated that the calculating results were in agreement with the measured results, and the relative errors of relaxed density and crush resistance were respectively 0.263% and 1.678%. The regression model equations can be used to predict the annular mould briquetting machine compressing the rice straw molding process-molding briquette of relaxed density and crush resistance. The relaxed density and crush resistance had a peak value under the optimal combination of the factors. When the raw material had the moisture content of 17.5%-27.1%, operation temperature of 81.9°C-88.1°C, the gap of roll-die of 2.4-3.78 mm and the spindle speed of 157.6-186.5 r/min, the relax density was over 1.0 g/cm3 and the crush resistance was over 65%. The contributing rate of every factor on relax density was as follows: screw rotary speed &gt; clearances between rolls and die &gt; straw moisture content &gt; operation temperature. And the contributing rate of every factor on crush resistance was as follows: moisture content &gt; screw rotary speed &gt; gap between rolls and die &gt; operation temperature. The research findings provide a theoretical basis and technical support for straw briquette compressing with an annular mould briquetting machine.

TI  - Evaluating potential dryland cropping systems adapted to climate change in the central great plains
VL  - 108
IS  - 6
SP  - 2391-2405
AB  - Climate in the semiarid central Great Plains is expected to become warmer and drier in coming decades, with potentially greater variability in precipitation and temperature. Cropping systems that include forages and allow flexibility for determining if a crop should be planted and which crop to plant (based on available soil water at planting) may provide the opportunity to maintain economic viability in a changing climate environment. The objective of this study was to compare cropping system productivity and profitability of flexible rotations that incorporate forages against grain-based cropping systems that are set rotational sequences. Yield and net returns for five set rotations and three flexible rotations were compared at Akron, CO, over 5 yr. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields were reduced by 57% when the fallow period prior to wheat production was replaced with crop production. Average net income was greatest for the continuously cropped all-forage set 3-yr rotation followed by the flexible 3-yr rotations that included wheat and forage phases. The lowest net returns were seen for the set grainbased rotations and the flexible wheat–grain crop rotation. Incorporating forage production as a phase in dryland wheat rotational systems can add profitability and sustainability to the production system in the face of climate variability. © 2016 by the American Society of Agronomy.

TI  - Salt marsh macrophyte Phragmites australis strategies assessment for its dominance in mercury-contaminated coastal lagoon (Ria de Aveiro, Portugal)
VL  - 19
IS  - 7
SP  - 2879-2888
AB  - Introduction and aims: The dominance of a plant species in highly metal-contaminated areas reflects its tolerance or adaptability potential to these scenarios. Hence, plants with high adaptability and/or tolerance to exceptionally high metal-contaminated scenarios may help protect environmental degradation. The present study aimed to assess the strategies adopted by common reed, Phragmites australis for its dominance in highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro coastal lagoon (Portugal). Materials and methods: Both plant samples and the sediments vegetated by monospecific stand of Phragmites australis were collected in five replicates from mercury-free (reference) and contaminated sites during low tide between March 2006 and January 2007. The sediments' physico-chemical traits, plant dry mass, uptake, partitioning, and transfer of mercury were evaluated during growing season (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) of P. australis. Redox potential and pH of the sediment around roots were measured in situ using a WTW-pH 330i meter. Dried sediments were incinerated for 4 h at 500°C for the estimation of organic matter whereas plant samples were oven-dried at 60°C till constant weight for plant dry mass determination. Mercury concentrations in sediments and plant parts were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with thermal decomposition, using an advanced mercury analyzer (LECO 254) and maintaining the accuracy and precision of the analytical methodologies. In addition, mercury bioaccumulation and translocation factors were also determined to differentiate the accumulation of mercury and its subsequent translocation to plant parts in P. australis. Results and conclusions: P. australis root exhibited the highest mercury accumulation followed by rhizome and leaves during the reproductive phase (autumn). During the same phase, P. australis exhibited ≈5 times less mercury-translocation factor (0. 03 in leaf) when compared with the highest mercury bioaccumulation factor for root (0. 14). Moreover, seasonal variations differentially impacted the studied parameters. P. australis' extraordinary ability to (a) pool the maximum mercury in its roots and rhizomes, (b) protect its leaf against mercury toxicity by adopting the mercury exclusion, and (c) adjust the rhizosphere-sediment environment during the seasonal changes significantly helps to withstand the highly mercury-contaminated Ria de Aveiro lagoon. The current study implies that P. australis has enough potential to be used for mercury stabilization and restoration of sediments/soils rich in mercury as well. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Mass-rearing of insects for pest management: Challenges, synergies and advances from evolutionary physiology
VL  - 38
SP  - 87-94
AB  - Mass- and laboratory-rearing of insects is a key component of several integrated pest management strategies. However, mass- or laboratory-rearing can have dramatic effects on insect performance via laboratory adaptation, inbreeding depression, inadvertent selection or through direct rearing effects (e.g. crowding and artificial diets). Thus, when rearing insects intended for field release, or when research is intended to reflect wild population performance, there is a need to establish quality under these conditions. In reality, however, much of the focus on quality control of mass- or laboratory-reared insects concerns maintenance of facility output (i.e. numbers) and, to a much lesser extent, individual trait effects (e.g. mating competitiveness or field flight performance). This is due to both practical issues (time or budget constraints), but also to limited understanding of the relationship between laboratory and field assays and the basic biology of the species. Regardless, trait performance is widely acknowledged as an essential factor in integrated pest management success. Recent studies on basic insect biology have made significant progress in understanding several aspects of field performance, such as the ability for thermal treatments to mitigate poor performance via phenotypic plasticity or the effects of artificial selection, and have lessons which may transfer to applied quality control for pest management. Here, we review the key challenges faced in insect rearing when focussing on quality control for field performance, some major recent advances in understanding field performance of insects in relation to environmental factors (e.g. thermal adaptation), and the potential synergies between basic biology and quality control research foci.

TI  - Evaluation and validation of reference genes for qPCR analysis to study climate change-induced stresses in Sinularia cf. cruciata (Octocorallia: Alcyonidae)
VL  - 483
SP  - 42-52
AB  - Coral reef organisms, including octocorals, are facing the consequences of anthropogenic activities, such as increasing oceanic pH and sea surface temperature, threatening their long-term survival and well-being. Gene expression studies based on quantitative PCR (qPCR) are important tools to provide insight into the molecular basis of octocoral stress responses and their potential resilience mechanisms. Nevertheless, a lack of experimentally validated, stably expressed reference genes for the normalization of gene expression using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qPCR) method limit such investigations among octocorals. Here, assessment of the expression stability of seven candidate reference genes was performed using a palette of statistical tools for valid qPCR-based gene expression studies on the octocoral Sinularia cf. cruciata during thermal (34 degrees C) and low-pH (pH 7.5) stress and the most suitable set of reference genes was determined for such experiments. The reliability of the selected reference genes was confirmed in a qPCR assay that targeted the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene. The HSP70 gene was found to be significantly upregulated during thermal stress, whereas during low-pH stress the expression level of this gene decreased. This study provides experimentally validated stress-specific sets of stably expressed reference genes during climate change-induced stresses, which will benefit future gene expression studies on Sinularia cf. cruciata as well as other octocorals. These results also highlight potentially different acclimation strategies of octocorals to different sources of abiotic stresses, contributing to our understanding of the potential for the adaptation of coral reef organisms to a changing world.

TI  - Effects of daily temperature fluctuation on the survival of carp infected with Cyprinid herpesvirus 3
VL  - 433
SP  - 208-213
AB  - Fluctuating water temperatures can affect fitness in fish when the opportunity to select habitats with appropriate temperature is limited. Despite the importance of the relationships between water temperature and host-pathogen interactions, reports on the susceptibility of fish to infectious viruses under conditions of changing water temperature are limited. Here, we compared the survival rates of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) infected with Cyprinid hopesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) in water in which the temperature varied from 22 degrees C +/- 3 degrees C and in water with a constant temperature of 22 degrees C or 25 degrees C. We also examined changes in concentrations of CyHV-3 DNA and cortisol released from infected fish into ambient water as indicators of CyHV-3 transmission and stress response, respectively. The survival rates of fish infected with CyHV-3 were lower, and concentrations of CyHV-3 DNA and cortisol were higher, in the fluctuating-temperature treatments than in the constant-temperature treatments. Our findings provide direct evidence that carp are highly susceptible to CyHV-3 infection when water temperatures change diurnally. Moreover, such temperature fluctuations can promote transmission of CyHV-3 in the wild. Preserving a variety of aquatic environments including water temperature may help to prevent disease outbreaks and to conserve fish populations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Design and experiment on small-scale axial multi-point gas intake conditioner for pellet mill
VL  - 47

SP  - 121-127
AB  - Pellet mill is one of main machines in the feed processing machinery, which occupies an important position in the feed granulation processing. In order to achieve the small quantities production need of pellet feed, the working principle and structural characteristics of the conditioner were investigated, and the main parameters of key components were determined with theoretical analysis. Accordingly, the small-scale axial multi-point gas intake conditioner was designed to be compatible with the small-scale pellet mill. The blade installation angle X1, speed of conditioner X2, and speed of feeder X3 were selected as the influence factors, and the productivity of conditioner Y1, conditioned material temperature Y2 were selected as evaluating indicators, thus the performance optimization experiments were carried out under the quadratic orthogonal rotation design. Based on the software regression analysis Design-Expert 8.0.6 and response surface analysis method, the relationship between the two influence factors and conditioning evaluating indicator was established. The results showed that X1, X2 and X3 were significantly correlated with Y1 and Y2 (P&lt;0.01 and P&lt;0.001, respectively). By using response surface method, the optimal aggregative index could be obtained under the condition that the blade installation angle was 38.1°, speed of conditioner spindle was 220.6 r/min, and speed of feeder was 17.4 r/min. Under this scheme, the productivity of conditioner was 12.7 g/s and the material temperature after conditioning was 65.0℃. In this case, the conditioner had the proper productivity and the conditioned material temperature was within the scope of the technical requirements. Therefore, this conditioner has good practicability in the process of conditioning small quantities of feed raw materials; the research provides references for the design of small-scale conditioner and the parameters optimization of processing technology. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

TI  - Variation in spawning time promotes genetic variability in population responses to environmental change in a marine fish
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
AB  - The level of phenotypic plasticity displayed within a population (i.e. the slope of the reaction norm) reflects the short-term response of a population to environmental change, while variation in reaction norm slopes among populations reflects spatial variation in these responses. Thus far, studies of thermal reaction norm variation have focused on geographically driven adaptation among different latitudes, altitudes or habitats. Yet, thermal variability is a function of both space and time. For organisms that reproduce at different times of year, such variation has the potential to promote adaptive variability in thermal responses for critical early life stages. Using common-garden experiments, we examined the spatial scale of genetic variation in thermal plasticity for early life-history traits among five populations of endangered Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) that spawn at different times of year. Patterns of plasticity for larval growth and survival suggest that population responses to climate change will differ substantially, with increasing water temperatures posing a considerably greater threat to autumn-spawning cod than to those that spawn in winter or spring. Adaptation to seasonal cooling or warming experienced during the larval stage is suggested as a possible cause. Furthermore, populations that experience relatively cold temperatures during early life might be more sensitive to changes in temperature. Substantial divergence in adaptive traits was evident at a smaller spatial scale than has previously been shown for a marine fish with no apparent physical barriers to gene flow (~200 km). Our findings highlight the need to consider the impact of intraspecific variation in reproductive timing on thermal adaptation when forecasting the effects of climate change on animal populations. © The Author 2015.

Recombinant BmMetRS was expressed, purified from wild type Brucella melitensis biovar Abortus 2308 strain ATCC/CRP #DD-156 and screened by a thermal melt assay against a focused library of one hundred previously classified methionyl-tRNA-synthetase inhibitors of the blood stage form of Trypanosoma brucei. Three compounds showed appreciable shift of denaturation temperature and were selected for further studies on inhibition of the recombinant enzyme activity and cell viability against wild type B. melitensis strain 16M. BmMetRS protein complexed with these three inhibitors resolved into three-dimensional crystal structures and was analyzed. All three selected methionyltRNA-synthetase compounds inhibit recombinant BmMetRS enzymatic functions in an aminoacylation assay at varying concentrations. Furthermore, growth inhibition of B. melitensis strain 16M by the compounds was shown. Inhibitor-BmMetRS crystal structure models were used to illustrate the molecular basis of the enzyme inhibition. Our current data suggests that BmMetRS is a promising target for brucellosis drug development. However, further studies are needed to optimize lead compound potency, efficacy and safety as well as determine the pharmacokinetics, optimal dosage, and duration for effective treatment. © 2016 Ojo et al.

AB  - Biotlc and abiotic stresses play a major role during silkworm rearing in realizing the cocoon productivity and quality, which could easily be managed by utilizing silkworm breed(s) tolerant to high temperature and viruses. Tropical sericulture beset with fluctuating environmental conditions and persistent pathogen load necessitates development of silkworm breeds with genetic plasticity to mitigate adverse climatic conditions and Bombyx mori Nuclcar Polyhedral Virus (BmNPV). Eight polyvoltine breeds (ND7, NDV6, L14. NP1,96E, 2000H, BL67 and BI.69) were identified as breeding resource material based on cumulative score index (>90 %) on survival, cocoon weight and shell weight upon exposure to high temperature and BmNPV. Five new polyvoltine lines viz., LI (NP1 x L14), L3 (NP1 x L14 x ND7), HB1 (NDV6 x BL69), HB4 (BL69 ∗ NDV6) and HB6 (BL67 x L14) were developed and stabilized through selection (adapted to high temperature and BmNPV] factors through conventional breeding. Hybrid evaluation was conducted utilizing the robust/productive bivoltine (S8) breed and two promising crossbreeds (L3 x S8 and H B4 x SB) were identified. These newly developed crossbreeds excelled in the rearing and reeling performances over the existing crossbreed (PM x CSR2). Newly evolved crossbreeds (L3 x S8 and HB4 x S8) are recommended for further field evaluation and commercial exploitation to improve the quality crossbreed raw silk production in India. © 2017 Indian Journal of Sericulture.

TI  - Nickel abundance in stony cosmic spherules: Constraining precursor material and formation mechanisms
VL  - 46

SP  - 1110-1132
AB  - We report bulk and olivine compositions in 66 stony cosmic spherules (Na2O&lt;0.76wt%), 200-800μm in size, from the Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica. In porphyritic cosmic spherules, relict olivines that survived atmospheric entry heating are always Ni-poor and similar in composition to the olivines in carbonaceous or unequilibrated ordinary chondrites (18 spherules), and equilibrated ordinary chondrites (one spherule). This is consistent with selective survival of high temperature, Mg-rich olivines during atmospheric entry. Olivines that crystallized from the melts produced during atmospheric entry have NiO contents that increase with increasing NiO in the bulk spherule, and that range from values similar to those observed in chondritic olivines (NiO generally &lt;0.5wt%) to values characteristic of olivines in meteoritic ablation spheres (NiO&gt;2wt%). Thus, NiO content in olivine cannot be used alone to distinguish meteoritic ablation spheres from cosmic spherules, and the volatile element contents have to be considered. We propose that the variation in NiO contents in cosmic spherules and their olivines is the result of variable content of Fe, Ni metal in the precursor. NiO contents in olivines and in cosmic spherules can thus be used to discuss their parent body. Ni-poor spherules can be derived from C-rich and/or metal-poor precursors, either related to CM, CI, CR chondrites or to chondritic fragments dominated by silicates, regardless of the parent body. Ni-rich spherules (NiO&gt;0.7wt%) that represent 55% of the 47 barred-olivine spherules we studied, were derived from the melting of C-poor, metal-rich precursors, compatible with ordinary chondrite or CO, CV, CK carbonaceous chondrite parentages. © The Meteoritical Society, 2011.

TI  - Temperature-Mediated Effects of Host Alternation on the Adaptation of Myzus persicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae)
VL  - 44
IS  - 2
SP  - 379-391
AB  - Local adaptation, an important phenomenon in ecological speciation, occurs in Myzus persicae (Sulzer), with the tobacco-adapted line proposed as a subspecies. Recent studies showed that temperature could alter the selection strength and direction in host-herbivore interactions. To understand the formation of host-adapted speciation and the effects of temperature on host adaptation, the parthenogenetic progeny of an M. persicae egg were conditioned on two hosts for >10 generations. Then, their life table parameters were studied after reciprocal transfer under a temperature gradient. The results showed that aphids habituated on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and rape (Brassica napus L.) had different optimal temperatures, including different upper thresholds of development and reproduction on original and alternative hosts. After habituation for >10 generations, local adaptation of aphids on the host of origin was formed, which was observed as the better performance of the native aphids compared with the foreign ones. The M. persicae that habituated on rape appeared more generalized to the host plants than the aphids that habituated on tobacco. The adaptation patterns of green peach aphids on two hosts varied differentially according to temperature, which verified the temperature-mediated effects of host selection on herbivores, implying the presence of a demographic basis of aphid seasonal migration. © The Authors 2015.

TI  - Striped bass habitat selection rules in reservoirs without suitable summer habitat offer insight into consequences for growth
VL  - 139
IS  - 5
SP  - 1450-1464
AB  - The traditional view of habitat requirements for inland striped bass Morone saxatilis suggests that these fish need dissolved oxygen (DO) levels above 2-3 mg/L and temperatures below 25°C to thrive. However, striped bass are found in reservoirs where hypolimnetic hypoxia forces them into warm temperatures (27-30°C) for much of the summer, and contrary to expectations, these populations do not consistently experience poor growth or mortality. We used telemetry of adult striped bass in Badin Lake, North Carolina, to characterize habitat selection by striped bass in systems with unsuitable summer habitat. As summer stratification developed, striped bass selected preferred temperatures of 20-23°C as long as the DO was at least 2 mg/L. Once hypoxia forced striped bass into warmer water, the fish concentrated at the top of the oxycline (defined as the depth just above the largest decline in DO occurring over a 1-m change in depth), which was 1-2°C warmer but had greater DO levels (4-8 mg/L) than the coolest water, with DO of 2 mg/L. Striped bass remained at the top of the oxycline into the fall, even after deeper water with preferred temperatures and a DO level of 2 mg/L became available. We suggest that these patterns, supported by observations in the literature, represent summer habitat selection rules for striped bass in reservoirs where all oxygenated habitat exceeds temperatures traditionally considered suitable for striped bass. We also show that the depth distribution of Badin Lake striped bass in response to physical habitat constraints causes them to overlap spatially with warmwater prey inhabiting shallow, warmwater depths both in the summer and early fall. Badin Lake striped bass continue to feed and grow over the summer, providing evidence that the availability of adequate prey resources can offset the costs of poor summer habitat. Warm, productive reservoirs without permanent thermal refuges may therefore provide better habitat for maintaining quality growth and condition than those systems where occupation of cooler temperatures segregates striped bass from their prey. © by the American Fisheries Society 2010.

TI  - Lipid remodelling in the reef-building honeycomb worm, Sabellaria alveolata, reflects acclimation and local adaptation to temperature
VL  - 6
AB  - Acclimation and adaptation, which are key to species survival in a changing climate, can be observed in terms of membrane lipid composition. Remodelling membrane lipids, via homeoviscous adaptation (HVA), counteracts membrane dysfunction due to temperature in poikilotherms. In order to assess the potential for acclimation and adaptation in the honeycomb worm, Sabellaria alveolata, a reef-building polychaete that supports high biodiversity, we carried out common-garden experiments using individuals from along its latitudinal range. Individuals were exposed to a stepwise temperature increase from 15°C to 25°C and membrane lipid composition assessed. Our results suggest that S. alveolata was able to acclimate to higher temperatures, as observed by a decrease in unsaturation index and 20:5n-3. However, over the long-term at 25°C, lipid composition patterns are not consistent with HVA expectations and suggest a stress response. Furthermore, unsaturation index of individuals from the two coldest sites were higher than those from the two warmest sites, with individuals from the thermally intermediate site being in-between, likely reflecting local adaptation to temperature. Therefore, lipid remodelling appears limited at the highest temperatures in S. alveolata, suggesting that individuals inhabiting warm environments may be close to their upper thermal tolerance limits and at risk in a changing climate. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Mangroves migrate northward in Florida and colonize marshes historically dominated by salt marsh species. In theory, this migration should be facilitated by greater numbers of propagules stemming from increased reproductive activity and greater genetic variability caused by outcrossing. We aimed to determine if stand reproduction and % outcrossing were affected by cold stress (stress increases with latitude), anthropogenic stress (human population density as a proxy), and years since a major hurricane. Further, we wished to determine if mutation rate varied with the stressors and if that affected stand reproduction. Both coasts of Florida from the southern Florida Keys to Tampa Bay on the Gulf of Mexico coast, and Merritt Island on the Atlantic coast. We conducted field surveys of frequency of reproducing trees (104,211 trees surveyed in 102 forested stands), incidence of trees showing albinism in propagules, and% outcrossing estimated from the ratio of albino:normal propagules. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test a conceptual model that served as a multivariate hypothesis. Reproductive frequencies varied by site and increased with latitude although more strongly on the Gulf coast. Our SEM results indicate that outcrossing increases in this predominately selfing species under conditions of cold and anthropogenic stress, and that this increases reproductive output in the population. Further, we find that increased mutation rates suppress stand reproductive output but there is no significant relationship between outcrossing and mutation rate. Tree size responded to stressors but did not affect stand reproduction. Reproduction increased with years since major hurricane. Potential for colonization of northern Florida salt marshes by mangroves is enhanced by increased reproductive rates that provides more propagules and outcrossing that should enhance genetic variation thereby promoting adaptation to novel environmental conditions. Natural (cold) stress reduced mutation rate and increased stand reproductive output but anthropogenic stress did the opposite. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Adaptive personality calibration in a human society: Effects of embodied capital on prosocial traits
VL  - 26
IS  - 4
SP  - 1071-1082
AB  - We examine the causes of variation in personality traits among human hunter-horticulturalists. Specifically, we demonstrate that prosocial aspects of personality (related to leadership and gregarious cooperation) associate positively with physical strength and the possession of formal education. Moreover, we report evidence that the heritability associated with strength and education explains much of the heritability in prosocial personality traits. Our results suggest personality is calibrated to condition-dependent aspects of one's phenotype, such as size and skill.Evolutionary theories of personality origins have stimulated much empirical research in recent years, but pertinent data from small-scale human societies have been in short supply. We investigate adaptively patterned personality variation among Tsimane' forager-horticulturalists. Based on a consideration of cost-benefit tradeoffs that likely maintain variation in human prosociality, we hypothesize that individual differences in prosocial personality traits are facultatively calibrated to variation in "embodied capital"aEuro"that is, knowledge, skills, or somatic traits that increase expected future fitness. In support of this hypothesis, 2 components of embodied capital-physical strength and formal education-associated positively with Tsimane' prosocial leadership orientation (PLO), a broad personality dimension representing gregarious cooperation, interpersonal warmth, and pursuit of leadership. Moreover, using pedigrees to compute heritability estimates, strength and education had additive effects on the heritable variance in PLO, which suggests that prosocial traits may be "reactively heritable" by virtue of their calibration to condition-dependent components of embodied capital. Although alternative explanations must be falsified in future research, our findings 1) provide one of the first demonstrations of adaptively patterned personality variation in a small-scale society and 2) illustrate the potential power of an adaptationist approach to elucidate the causal underpinnings of heritable personality variation.

TI  - Behavior characteristics and habitat adaptabilities of the endangered butterfly Teinopalpus aureus in Mount Dayao
VL  - 32
IS  - 20
SP  - 6527-6534
AB  - Teinopalpus aureus was listed as a protected species in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species since 1985, and a Chinese first-class protected species since 1989. It is concerned increasingly by people throughout the world. However, we now still unknown its field status, habitat adaptabilities etc. In this study, we selected four sites in Dayaoshan, Guangxi Province, China, to count adult and early stages (egg, larva and pupa) by the method of route survey, and to record its mating, ovipositing and feeding behaviors by the method of on-site tracking observation. Results showed that T. aureus grew in wet season (from April to October, with > 50mm/month in precipitation). This butterfly showed active selectivity to temperature, which larvae fed actively during 17°C to 24°C, and males hilltoped actively during 19°C to 26°C, while females preferred to oviposit at noon when temperature was relatively high, during 27°C to 30°C. Males showed topographically choice behavior, and (87. 34±7. 58) % of males (n = 339) preferred to fly up hilltops (not hillsides) in surveys. They aggregated there during 6:00am to 11:00am, flying or perching, and spent (77. 87±19. 32) % of time in the latter. Moreover, males always perched on those leaves located high branches or the edges of hilltop, where they "waiting" for females to obtain mating opportunity and showed the type of "perching" in mating strategy. Males showed territoriality while perching on hilltops, and often, who firstly perched in a domain would be the last winner in male-male competition over territorial ownership. This study also showed that T. aureus had a high mortality in field, and the rate of pupa emergence was only 38. 9% (n=20). As for the survivals, a complicated defense system was observed, including the primary defense system (protective or cryptic color, color or shape mimicry etc.) and the second defense system (ocular-spot demonstrating, body swaying, yellow Y-gland stretching etc.). Moreover, the fully matured larva preferred to pupate under a cluster of leave in bushes or bamboo graves in the under-story of forest, and the height of pupation site was (1. 82 ± 1.58)m (n=20). Our results suggest that T. aureus evolve some specific behaviors to adapt the specific habitat of broad-leaves forest under the pressure of nature selectivity. However, habitat destructions (e. g. felling) or interference (e. g. the under-story's reclamation) might make more individuals of T. aureus fail to live, and then threat the endangered butterfly's population, or even lead to the extinction of local population.

TI  - Spatially distinct response of rice yield to autonomous adaptation under the CMIP5 multi-model projections
VL  - 53
IS  - 1
SP  - 21-30
AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a very important staple crop, as it feeds more than half of the world’s population. Numerous studies have focused on the negative impacts of climate change on rice production. However, there is little debate on which region of the world is more vulnerable to climate change and how adaptation to this change can mitigate the negative impacts on rice production. We investigated the impacts of climate change on rice yield, based on simulations combining a global crop model, M-GAZE, and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model projections. Our focus was the impact of mitigating emission forcings (representative concentration pathway RCP 4.5 vs. RCP 8.5) and autonomous adaptation (i.e., changing crop variety and planting date) on rice yield. In general, our results showed that climate change due to anthropogenic warming leads to a significant reduction in rice yield. However, autonomous adaptation provides the potential to reduce the negative impact of global warming on rice yields in a spatially distinct manner. The adaptation was less beneficial for countries located at a low latitude (e.g., Cambodia, Thailand, Brazil) compared to mid-latitude countries (e.g., USA, China, Pakistan), as regional climates at the lower latitudes are already near the upper temperature thresholds for acceptable rice growth. These findings suggest that the socioeconomic effects from rice production in lowlatitude countries can be highly vulnerable to anthropogenic global warming. Therefore, these countries need to be accountable to develop transformative adaptation strategies, such as adopting (or developing) heat-tolerant varieties, and/or improve irrigation systems and fertilizer use efficiency. © 2017, Korean Meteorological Society and Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Many insects use the change in day length as a reliable cue for upcoming winter and respond to shortened photoperiod through diapause. In this study, we report the clinal variation in photoperiodic diapause induction in populations of the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis collected along a latitudinal gradient in Europe. In this species, diapause occurs in the larval stage and is maternally induced. Adult Nasonia females were exposed to different photoperiodic cycles and lifetime production of diapausing offspring was scored. Females switched to the production of diapausing offspring after exposure to a threshold number of photoperiodic cycles. A latitudinal cline was found in the proportion of diapausing offspring, the switch point for diapause induction measured as the maternal age at which the female starts to produce diapausing larvae, and the critical photoperiod for diapause induction. Populations at northern latitudes show an earlier switch point, higher proportions of diapausing individuals and longer critical photoperiods. Since the photoperiodic response was measured under the same laboratory conditions, the observed differences between populations most likely reflect genetic differences in sensitivity to photoperiodic cues, resulting from local adaptation to environmental cycles. The observed variability in diapause response combined with the availability of genomic tools for N. vitripennis represent a good opportunity to further investigate the genetic basis of this adaptive trait. © 2013 The Authors.

VL  - 61
IS  - 4
SP  - 931-937
AB  - This is the first study to evaluate the survival potential of cold-adapted Listeria monocytogenes in icecream. Cold adaptation enhances survival of this pathogen in ice-cream during the first period of storage compared to non-adapted cells. The viable population of cold-adapted and non-adapted cells was 3 log (36 days) and 4.3 log (27 days), respectively, lower than the initial population (6.3 log) in inoculated ice-cream. This behavior raises concerns for food safety. The viable population of both cold-and non-adapted cells displayed a slight statistical difference in the next period of frozen storage (0.29 and 0.75 log decline at 137 and 182 days, respectively). Significant numbers of L. monocytogenes cells survived for extended periods of time, irrespective of whether they were previously cold-or non-adapted (332 and 182 days respectively). The natural additives utilized (fructose syrup, corn syrup, sesame oil and sesame paste) did not have any significant effect on the response of non-adapted L. monocytogenes in ice-cream during 182 days of storage. On the other hand, the survival of cold-adapted L. monocytogenes is influenced by the ingredients utilized in the ice cream. Sesame paste and corn syrup had an inhibitory action on cold-adapted L. monocytogenes throughout the frozen storage (332 days) possibly as a consequence of lower water activity in samples with these additives. © 2011 Springer-Verlag and the University of Milan.

TI  - Interactions between growth, demography and biotic interactions in determining species range limits in a warming world: The case of Pinus sylvestris
VL  - 282
SP  - 10-22
AB  - Changes in climate are affecting the distribution and status of species on a global scale, through alteration of factors including their phenology, growth and ecological interactions. These alterations are often most apparent at species range edges, where changes to conditions previously limiting the species distribution can result in range shifts. In this paper, we review the rapid recent increase in our understanding of the factors limiting the distribution of a species to explore how the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors is likely to significantly alter its range edge behaviour beyond our current predictive capacity. We focus on Scots pine (Pious sylvestris L), one of the most abundant tree species on the globe. Glacial refugia and colonisation routes after last glacial maximum have strongly influenced the genetic diversity and local adaptation of this species. Over recent decades, increased reproduction and growth has been detected at the northern limit of P. sylvestris as a response to increased temperature, whereas at its southern limit, increased drought stress has resulted in decreased growth, low recruitment, and in some cases a massive mortality of this species. In addition, direct climatic effects on the species are acting together with indirect effects due to altered biotic interactions including outbreaks of insects, pathogens, and parasites, and increased herbivory linked to declining ecosystem productivity. However, whilst predictive studies forecast a gradual decline of the species at the southern range limit and expansion at higher latitudes, models do not commonly include biotic factors, which can significantly modify the response of the species to climatic changes. We conclude by discussing the early detection of imperilled areas and how their natural resistance and resilience to ongoing climatic changes might be increased. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Optimal Mutagen Dosage to Induce Point-Mutations in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 and Its Application to Promote Temperature Tolerance
VL  - 7
IS  - 11
AB  - Random mutagenesis is a useful tool to genetically modify organisms for various purposes, such as adaptation to cultivation conditions, the induction of tolerances, or increased yield of valuable substances. This is especially attractive for systems where it is not obvious which genes require modifications. Random mutagenesis has been extensively used to modify crop plants, but even with the renewed interest in microalgae and cyanobacteria for biofuel applications, there is relatively limited current research available on the application of random mutagenesis for these organisms, especially for cyanobacteria. In the presented work we characterized the lethality and rate of non-lethal point mutations for ultraviolet radiation and methyl methanesulphonate on the model cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Based on these results an optimal dosage of 10-50 J/m2 for UV and either 0.1 or 1 v% for MMS was determined. A Synechocystis wildtype culture was then mutagenized and selected for increased temperature tolerance in vivo. During the second round of mutagenesis the viability of the culture was monitored on a cell by cell level from the treatment of the cells up to the growth at an increased temperature. After four distinct rounds of treatment (two with each mutagen) the temperature tolerance of the strain was effectively raised by about 2°C. Coupled with an appropriate in vivo screening, the described methods should be applicable to induce a variety of desirable characteristics in various strains. Coupling random mutagenesis with high-throughput screening methods would additionally allow to select for important characteristics for biofuel production, which do not yield a higher fitness and can not be selected for in vivo, such as fatty acid concentration. In a combined approach with full genome sequencing random mutagenesis could be used to determine suitable target-genes for more focused methods. © 2012 Tillich et al.

VL  - 13
IS  - 4
SP  - 302-308
AB  - Improvement of the one-step production of L-ribose from ribitol using a recombinant Escherichia coli is described. The gene encoding the enzyme mannitol-1-dehydrogenase (MDH) from Apium graveolens has previously been codon-optimized, cloned into the constitutive pZuc10 vector, and expressed in E. coli. This MDH catalyzes the NADdependent conversion of mannitol to D-mannose and has the ability to convert several polyols to their L-sugar counterparts, including ribitol to L-ribose. Here, three rounds of directed evolution using libraries generated through errorprone PCR and screened using a dinitrosalicylate reagent. Mutants were selected for improved conversion of L-ribose, and the best mutant was isolated by combining two round 2 mutations. Libraries were also selected for thermal stability and screened at increasingly higher temperatures with each round of mutagenesis. An overall 19.2-fold improvement was observed with a final conversion of 46.6 ± 1.7% and a productivity of 3.88 ± 0.14 gL-1d-1 in 50 mL shaken flasks at 34 °C. Further characterization of the mutants suggests that increased enzyme thermal stability and expression are responsible for the increase in L-ribose production. The mutant E. coli production strain isolated represents an improved system for largescale production of L-ribose. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

VL  - 178

AB  - Recent studies suggest an important role of thermophilic bacterial communities of the Phylum Firmicutes on soil C, N and S cycling, and a positive effect on crop productivity through the production of sulfate (SO42-) and ammonium (NH 4+), essential plant nutrients. Copper (Cu) is commonly supplemented to soils as a fungicide in phytosanitary treatments although its consequences to the bacterial communities is frequently overlooked. Herein, we report on the influence of temperature and Cu on the microbial communities, namely those of the Phylum Firmicutes, from a soil collected at an olive orchard in S Portugal. Community fingerprints and band identification through sequencing was combined with measurement of SO42- and NH 44+ production at different supplemented amounts of Cu and at moderate and high temperatures (30°C and 50°C, respectively). Both temperature and Cu induced changes in these communities, selecting for specific bacteria. Temperature induced the dominance of Brevibacillus, and Cu addition to soil caused a reduction of SO42- release by soil bacteria. Ammonium production during bacterial growth at moderate and high temperatures was not affected by Cu addition. A Cu-tolerant thermophilic isolate, belonging to the Bacillus genus, showed significant inhibition by high Cu concentrations and a reduction of NH 44+ release during growth; genera Brevibacillus and Bacillus have been previously reported as high NH 44+ and SO42- producers of the Firmicutes phylum. Results indicate that Cu treatments select specific tolerant bacterial strains which could influence natural soil fertilization in Cu-treated orchards. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

TI  - Impact of Climate Change on Voltinism and Prospective Diapause Induction of a Global Pest Insect - Cydia pomonella ( L.)
VL  - 7
IS  - 4
AB  - Global warming will lead to earlier beginnings and prolongation of growing seasons in temperate regions and will have pronounced effects on phenology and life-history adaptation in many species. These changes were not easy to simulate for actual phenologies because of the rudimentary temporal (season) and spatial (regional) resolution of climate model projections. We investigate the effect of climate change on the regional incidence of a pest insect with nearly worldwide distribution and very high potential for adaptation to season length and temperature - the Codling Moth, Cydia pomonella. Seasonal and regional climate change signals were downscaled to the hourly temporal scale of a pest phenology model and the spatial scale of pest habitats using a stochastic weather generator operating at daily scale in combination with a re-sampling approach for simulation of hourly weather data. Under future conditions of increased temperatures (2045-2074), the present risk of below 20% for a pronounced second generation (peak larval emergence) in Switzerland will increase to 70-100%. The risk of an additional third generation will increase from presently 0-2% to 100%. We identified a significant two-week shift to earlier dates in phenological stages, such as overwintering adult flight. The relative extent (magnitude) of first generation pupae and all later stages will significantly increase. The presence of first generation pupae and later stages will be prolonged. A significant decrease in the length of overlap of first and second generation larval emergence was identified. Such shifts in phenology may induce changes in life-history traits regulating the life cycle. An accordingly life-history adaptation in photoperiodic diapause induction to shorter day-length is expected and would thereby even more increase the risk of an additional generation. With respect to Codling Moth management, the shifts in phenology and voltinism projected here will require adaptations of plant protection strategies to maintain their sustainability. © 2012 Stoeckli et al.

TI  - Toward a CO2-free ethylene oxide process: Homogeneous ethylene oxide in gas-expanded liquids
VL  - 65
IS  - 1
SP  - 128-134
AB  - Among industrial chemical processes, ethylene oxide manufacture emits the largest amount of CO2 (similar to 2-3 million tons/yr), as byproduct from the burning of both the ethylene (feed) and ethylene oxide. Further, the conventional silver-based catalytic process presents safety challenges due to the formation of explosive ethylene oxide/O-2 mixtures in the gas phase. By judicious choice of the catalyst (methyltrioxorhenium), oxidant (H2O2) and reaction medium (methanol/water), a homogeneous liquid phase catalytic system has been demonstrated that eliminates CO2 formation while producing ethylene oxide at > 90% selectivity at near-ambient temperatures. Given its high volatility, the ethylene oxide is easily recovered from the reaction phase by distillation. The vicinity of the gaseous ethylene feed to its critical temperature (9 degrees C) is exploited to significantly increase its solubility in the liquid reaction phase by facile compression beyond the critical pressure of ethylene (similar to 50 bar). Since H2O2 is stable at typical reaction temperatures (40 degrees C or less), potentially explosive ethylene oxide/O-2 mixtures are avoided in the gas phase. In addition to the potential of arresting the carbon footprint of a large-scale industrial process, the demonstrated process concept shows how gas-expanded liquids can be generally exploited in homogeneous catalysis to enhance productivity.

VL  - 35

SP  - 65-72
AB  - This study investigated the use of alkaline hydrolysis at ambient temperature for inactivation of selected fish pathogens in fish tissues under conditions approximating those that are likely to be found in the aquaculture industry. Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) and Lactococcus garvieae have been determined in a previous study to be the most resistant virus and bacteria to pH 12 from a wide range of viruses and bacteria tested. They were spiked at high titres into fish extracts that were then treated with 1m sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Viable L. garvieae was not detected in the treated fish extract after 1h, and ISAV was not detected after 24-h exposure. Field mortalities of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., caused by infectious pancreatic necrosis virus were treated by alkaline hydrolysis at ambient temperature. The macerated fish mortalities contained a high titre of virus (3.38×10 8 TCID 50g -1) that was reduced to approximately 2.2×10 3 TCID 50g -1 after 24-h exposure to NaOH, and virus was not detected after exposure for 48h. The results suggest that alkaline hydrolysis at ambient temperature has potential as a biosecure treatment method for fish by-products containing fish pathogens. © 2011.

TI  - Intra-specific variation reveals potential for adaptation to ocean acidification in a cold-water coral from the Gulf of Mexico
VL  - 4
AB  - Ocean acidification, the decrease in seawater pH due to the absorption of atmospheric CO2, profoundly threatens the survival of a large number of marine species. Cold-water corals are considered to be among the most vulnerable organisms to ocean acidification because they are already exposed to relatively low pH and corresponding low calcium carbonate saturation states (ω). Lophelia pertusa is a globally distributed cold-water scleractinian coral that provides critical three-dimensional habitat for many ecologically and economically significant species. In this study, four different genotypes of L. pertusa were exposed to three pH treatments (pH = 7.60, 7.75, and 7.90) over a short (2-week) experimental period, and six genotypes were exposed to two pH treatments (pH = 7.60 and 7.90) over a long (6-month) experimental period. Their physiological response was measured as net calcification rate and the activity of carbonic anhydrase, a key enzyme in the calcification pathway. In the short-term experiment, net calcification rates did not significantly change with pH, although they were highly variable in the low pH treatment, including some genotypes that maintained positive net calcification in undersaturated conditions. In the 6-month experiment, average net calcification was significantly reduced at low pH, with corals exhibiting net dissolution of skeleton. However, one of the same genotypes that maintained positive net calcification (+0.04% day-1) under the low pH treatment in the short-term experiment also maintained positive net calcification longer than the other genotypes in the long-term experiment, although none of the corals maintained positive calcification for the entire 6 months. Average carbonic anhydrase activity was not affected by pH, although some genotypes exhibited small, insignificant, increases in activity after the sixth month. Our results suggest that while net calcification in L. pertusa is adversely affected by ocean acidification in the long term, it is possible that some genotypes may prove to be more resilient than others, particularly to short perturbations of the carbonate system. These results provide evidence that populations of L. pertusa in the Gulf of Mexico may contain the genetic variability necessary to support an adaptive response to future ocean acidification. © 2017 Kurman, Gómez, Georgian, Lunden and Cordes.

TI  - Comparative physiological plasticity to desiccation in distinct populations of the malarial mosquito Anopheles coluzzii
VL  - 9
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-13
AB  - Background: In West Africa, populations of the malaria vector mosquito, Anopheles coluzzii, are seasonally exposed to strong desiccating conditions during the dry season. Their dynamics strictly follows the pace of the availability of suitable larval development sites (water collections). Accordingly, mosquitoes can reproduce all year long where permanent breeding is possible, or stop reproduction and virtually disappear at the onset of the dry season when surface water dries up, like observed in temporary habitats of dry savannah areas. This highlights the strong adaptive abilities of this mosquito species, which relies at least in part, upon physiological and molecular mechanisms of specific signatures. Methods: Here, we analysed a range of physiological and molecular responses expressed by geographically different populations of An. coluzzii inhabiting permanent and temporary breeding sites from the north and the south-west of Burkina Faso. Four mosquito colonies, namely (i) Oursi, built from females breeding in permanent habitats of the north; (ii) Déou, from temporary northern habitats; (iii) Soumousso from south-western temporary breeding sites; and (iv) Bama, from permanent habitats of the same south-western zone, were reared in climatic chambers under contrasted environmental conditions, mimicking temperature, relative humidity and light regimen occurring in northern Burkina Faso. Female mosquitoes were analysed for the seasonal variation in their amounts of proteins, triglycerides and free-circulating metabolites. The expression level of genes coding for the adipokinetic (AKH-I) and the AKH/corazonin-related peptides (ACP) were also assessed and compared among populations and environmental conditions. Results: Our analysis did not reveal an apparent pattern of physiological and molecular variations strictly correlated with either the larval ecotype or the geographical origin of the mosquitoes. However, specific distinct responses were observed among populations, suggesting that dry season survival may rely on more complex ecological parameters at a micro-habitat scale. Interestingly, the physiological and molecular data support the hypothesis that different aestivation abilities exist among populations of An. coluzzii inhabiting contrasted ecological settings. In particular, the striking metabotypes differentiation and the AKH mRNA expression level observed in females from temporary northern populations may suggest the existence of a “strong” aestivation strategy in these specimens. Conclusion: Our work provides insights into the physiological and molecular basis of dry and rainy season responses in An. coluzzii, and highlights the important diversity of the mechanisms involved. Such results represent key data for understanding the ecophysiological mechanisms underpinning the strong adaptive potential of this malaria vector species, which undoubtedly contributes to the spreading of mosquito distribution areas in space and time. © 2016 The Author(s).

VL  - 34

AB  - Warming rivers and an improved knowledge of thermal impacts on fish are fueling a need for simple tools to generate water temperature forecasts that aid in decision making for the management of aquatic resources. Although there is strong evidence for temperature-dependent mortality in freshwater fish populations, the application of water temperature models for in-season fisheries management is still limited due to a lack of appropriate temperature thresholds and due to uncertainty in forecasts. We evaluated the ability of statistical models based on seasonal trends, air temperature, and discharge to produce daily forecasts of water temperature in the Fraser River, British Columbia, including explicit quantification of uncertainty in predictor variables. For all models evaluated (with and without air temperature and/or discharge predictor variables), the top model choice varied as a function of environmental conditions, uncertainty in the air temperature forecasts used to predict water temperature, and the selection of quantitative performance criteria (i.e., defining the "best" model based on the smallest mean raw error or based on the ability to accurately forecast extreme water temperatures). Water temperature forecasts averaged across 10 d produced by simple models that were fitted only to historical seasonal water temperature trends were as accurate as forecasts generated from uncertain air temperature predictions. Models fitted to air temperature were critical for forecasting high temperature thresholds; even the use of uncertain air temperature forecasts predicted high water temperatures with greater accuracy than models that lacked an air temperature covariate. In contrast, models that were fitted to discharge variables lowered the rate of false-negative and false-positive errors associated with estimating below-average temperatures. On the basis of our findings, we suggest that fisheries managers should quantify the effect of uncertainties in model predictor variables when assessing water temperature models and should evaluate model performance in the context of system-specific conditions and management objectives.

VL  - 103
IS  - 7
AB  - For ectothermic animals, selection of a suitable microhabitat is affected by a combination of abiotic and biotic factors. Also important is the trade-off between those microhabitats with optimal microclimatic conditions and food availability vs. those with the lowest level of competition and lowest risk of predation. Central European species of groundhoppers (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae) live in locations with small-scale mosaics of patches formed by bare ground, moss cushions and vascular plants (grasses and forbs). Our research focused on the effects of selected weather components (current temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and sunlight) on specific microhabitat selection by adults (during the reproductive season) and by the last-instar nymphs (during the non-reproductive season) of the groundhopper Tetrix tenuicornis. Using experimental conditions, we determined that microhabitat use by T. tenuicornis is sex-specific and that microhabitat preference differs between adults and nymphs. We suppose that microhabitats are used according to groundhopper current needs in relation to each habitat’s suitability for maintaining body temperature, food intake and reproductive behaviour. Microhabitat preferences were significantly associated with temperature and atmospheric pressure. Changes in atmospheric pressure signal changes in weather, and insects respond to increases or decreases in pressure by adjusting their behaviour in order to enhance survival. We propose that, under low atmospheric pressure, T. tenuicornis actively seeks microhabitats that provide increased protection from adverse weather. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.

TI  - A map of the topsoil organic carbon content of Europe generated by a generalized additive model
VL  - 66
IS  - 1
SP  - 121-134
AB  - Summary: There is an increasing demand for up-to-date soil organic carbon (OC) data for global environmental and climatic modelling. The aim of this study was to create a map of topsoil OC content at the European scale by applying digital soil mapping techniques to the first European harmonized geo-referenced topsoil (0-20 cm) database, which arises from the Land use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS). A map of the associated uncertainty was also produced to support careful use of the predicted OC contents. A generalized additive model (GAM) was fitted on 85% of the dataset (R2 = 0.29), using OC content as dependent variable a backward stepwise approach selected slope, land cover, temperature, net primary productivity, latitude and longitude as suitable covariates. The validation of the model (performed on 15% of the data-set) gave an overall R2 of 0.27 and an R2 of 0.21 for mineral soils and 0.06 for organic soils. Organic C content in most organic soils was under-predicted, probably because of the imposed unimodal distribution of our model, whose mean is tilted towards the prevalent mineral soils. This was also confirmed by the poor prediction in Scandinavia (where organic soils are more frequent), which gave an R2 of 0.09, whilst the prediction performance (R2) in non-Scandinavian countries was 0.28. The map of predicted OC content had the smallest values in Mediterranean countries and in croplands across Europe, whereas largest OC contents were predicted in wetlands, woodlands and mountainous areas. The map of the predictions' standard error had large uncertainty in northern latitudes, wetlands, moors and heathlands, whereas small uncertainty was mostly found in croplands. The map produced gives the most updated general picture of topsoil OC content at the European Union scale. © 2014 The Authors.

TI  - Sex and proximity to reproductive maturity influence the survival, final maturation, and blood physiology of pacific salmon when exposed to high temperature during a simulated migration
VL  - 85
IS  - 1
SP  - 62-73
AB  - Some Pacific salmon populations have been experiencing increasingly warmer river temperatures during their once-in-a-lifetime spawning migration, which has been associated with en route and prespawn mortality. The mechanisms underlying such temperature-mediated mortality are poorly understood. Wild adult pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon were used in this study. The objectives were to investigate the effects of elevated water temperature on mortality, final maturation, and blood properties under controlled conditions that simulated a "cool" (13 degrees C) and "warm" (19 degrees C) freshwater spawning migration. After 10 d at 13 degrees C, observed mortality was 50%-80% in all groups, which suggested that there was likely some mortality associated with handling and confinement. Observed mortality after 10 d at 19 degrees C was higher, reaching >= 98% in male pink salmon and female pink and sockeye salmon. Thus, male sockeye salmon were the most thermally tolerant (54% observed mortality). Model selection supported the temperature-and sex-specific mortality patterns. The pink salmon were closer to reproductive maturation and farther along the senescence trajectory than sockeye salmon, which likely influenced their survival and physiological responses throughout the experiment. Females of both species held at 19 degrees C had reduced plasma sex steroids compared with those held at 13 degrees C, and female pink salmon were less likely to become fully mature at 19 degrees than at 13 degrees C. Male and female sockeye salmon held at 19 degrees C had higher plasma chloride and osmolality than those held at 13 degrees C, indicative of a thermally related stress response. These findings suggest that sex differences and proximity to reproductive maturity must be considered when predicting thermal tolerance and the magnitude of en route and prespawn mortality for Pacific salmon.

TI  - Wildfire effects on the soil seed bank of a maritime pine stand - The importance of fire severity
VL  - 191
SP  - 80-88
AB  - This study addressed the impacts of wildfire and, in particular, its severity on the seed bank of the litter/ash layer and the topsoil of a Mediterranean pine plantation (Pinus pinaster Ait.) in north-central Portugal. The study location was selected for presenting a homogeneous pine cover before the fire, on the one hand, and, on the other, heterogeneous patches with distinct degrees of damage to the pine crowns immediately after the fire. The experimental design involved the selection, from the opposite valley side, of three zones with adjacent strips of Low and High Canopy Consumption (L/HCC). Within each of these strips, a transect was laid out along which three plots were established at 10. m intervals. The same was done in the unburnt area immediately outside the fire perimeter. At each plot, samples were collected within the first two weeks after the fire to: (i) asses viable seed densities for three sampling layers, using the indirect method for a 10-month period; (ii) estimate maximum temperature reached (MTRs) at 0-3. cm depth, on the basis of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR). Fire severity at the plots was further determined by verifying, in situ, pine canopy consumption (FCC) as well as by measuring the minimum diameter of remaining shrub twigs (TDI). In comparison with the unburnt area, the recently burnt area as a whole revealed a substantial increase in overall densities of viable seeds. Seed bank composition, however, varied markedly within the burnt area but this could be explained reasonably well by differential effects of the wildfire associated with its severity, in terms of the two crown consumption classes as well as the TDI index but not the MTRs. The inclusion of the litter/ash layer and the separation of two soil depths were amply justified by providing clear support for the important role of fire severity, in particular for the two principal taxa (Calluna vulgaris and Erica spp., presumably mainly E. australis). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Transgenerational acclimation of fishes to climate change and ocean acidification
VL  - 6
AB  - There is growing concern about the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on marine organisms and ecosystems, yet the potential for acclimation and adaptation to these threats is poorly understood. Whereas many short-term experiments report negative biological effects of ocean warming and acidification, new studies show that some marine species have the capacity to acclimate to warmer and more acidic environments across generations. Consequently, transgenerational plasticity may be a powerful mechanism by which populations of some species will be able to adjust to projected climate change. Here, I review recent advances in understanding transgenerational acclimation in fishes. Research over the past 2 to 3 years shows that transgenerational acclimation can partially or fully ameliorate negative effects of warming, acidification, and hypoxia in a range of different species. The molecular and cellular pathways underpinning transgenerational acclimation are currently unknown, but modern genetic methods provide the tools to explore these mechanisms. Despite the potential benefits of transgenerational acclimation, there could be limitations to the phenotypic traits that respond transgenerationally, and trade-offs between life stages, that need to be investigated. Future studies should also test the potential interactions between transgenerational plasticity and genetic evolution to determine howthese two processes will shape adaptive responses to environmental change over coming decades. © 2014 Faculty of 1000 Ltd.

TI  - Antimony recovery from the halophosphate fraction in lamp phosphor waste: A zero-waste approach
VL  - 18
IS  - 1
SP  - 176-185
AB  - Antimony is becoming an increasingly critical element as the supply-demand gap is expected to exceed 10% over the period 2015-2020. Antimony production is primarily concentrated in China (90%) and as the industrial demand for this metal surges, attention has to turn towards the recovery of antimony from (industrial) waste residues and end-of-life products in order to guarantee a sustainable supply of antimony. Although lamp phosphor waste is usually considered as a source of rare earths, it also contains significant amounts of antimony in the form of the white halophosphate phosphor (Ca,Sr)5(PO4)3(Cl,F):Sb3+,Mn2+ (HALO). HALO phosphor readily dissolves in dilute acidic conditions, making antimony far more accessible than in the main production route which is the energy intensive processing of stibnite ore (Sb2S3). HALO makes up 50 wt% of the lamp phosphor waste, but it has been systematically overlooked and treated as an undesired residue in the efforts to recover rare earths from lamp phosphor waste. In this paper, the feasibility of antimony recovery is discussed and an efficient process is proposed. The HALO phosphor is first dissolved in dilute HCl at room temperature, followed by a selective extraction of antimony with the ionic liquid Aliquat® 336. The remaining leachate is valorized as apatite which is a feed for the phosphate and fertilizer industry. A zero-waste valorization approach was followed, meaning that no residue or waste was accepted and that all the elements were converted into useful products. This paper thus emphasizes the potential of lamp phosphor waste as a secondary source of antimony and describes a sustainable process to recover it. The process can be integrated in lamp phosphor recycling schemes aimed at recovering rare earths. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.

TI  - Local adaptation drives thermal tolerance among parasite populations: A common garden experiment
VL  - 283
IS  - 1830
AB  - Understanding the evolutionary responses of organisms to thermal regimes is of prime importance to better predict their ability to cope with ongoing climate change. Although this question has attracted interest in free-living organisms, whether or not infectious diseases have evolved heterogeneous responses to climate is still an open question. Here, we ran a common garden experiment using the fish ectoparasite Tracheliastes polycolpus, (i) to test whether parasites living in thermally heterogeneous rivers respond differently to an experimental thermal gradient and (ii) to determine the evolutionary processes (natural selection or genetic drift) underlying these responses. We demonstrated that the reaction norms involving the survival rate of the parasite larvae (i.e. the infective stage) across a temperature gradient significantly varied among six parasite populations. Using a Qst/Fst approach and phenotype–environment associations, we further showed that the evolution of survival rate partly depended upon temperature regimes experienced in situ, and was mostly underlined by diversifying selection, but also—to some extent—by stabilizing selection and genetic drift. This evolutionary response led to population divergences in thermal tolerance across the landscape, which has implications for predicting the effects of future climate change. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Cold adaptation increases rates of nutrient flow and metabolic plasticity during cold exposure in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 283
IS  - 1838
AB  - Metabolic flexibility is an important component of adaptation to stressful environments, including thermal stress and latitudinal adaptation. A long history of population genetic studies suggest that selection on core metabolic enzymes may shape life histories by altering metabolic flux. However, the direct relationship between selection on thermal stress hardiness and metabolic flux has not previously been tested. We investigated flexibility of nutrient catabolism during cold stress in Drosophila melanogaster artificially selected for fast or slow recovery from chill coma (i.e. cold-hardy or -susceptible), specifically testing the hypothesis that stress adaptation increases metabolic turnover. Using 13C-labelled glucose, we first showed that cold-hardy flies more rapidly incorporate ingested carbon into amino acids and newly synthesized glucose, permitting rapid synthesis of proline, a compound shown elsewhere to improve survival of cold stress. Second, using glucose and leucine tracers we showed that cold-hardy flies had higher oxidation rates than coldsusceptible flies before cold exposure, similar oxidation rates during cold exposure, and returned to higher oxidation rates during recovery. Additionally, cold-hardy flies transferred compounds among body pools more rapidly during cold exposure and recovery. Increased metabolic turnover may allow cold-adapted flies to better prepare for, resist and repair/tolerate cold damage. This work illustrates for the first time differences in nutrient fluxes associated with cold adaptation, suggesting that metabolic costs associated with cold hardiness could invoke resource-based trade-offs that shape life histories. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Collective behaviors of spiral waves in the networks of hodgkin-huxley neurons in presence of channel noise
VL  - 18

SP  - 243-259
AB  - Collective behaviors of spiral waves in the networks of Hodgkin-Huxley neuron are investigated. A stable rotating spiral wave can be developed to occupy the quiescent areas in networks of neurons by selecting appropriate initial values for the variables in the networks of neurons. In our numerical studies, most neurons are quiescent and finite (few) numbers of neurons are selected with different values to form a spiral seed. In this way, neurons communicating are carried by propagating spiral wave to break through the quiescent domains (areas) in networks of neurons. The effect of membrane temperature on the formation of spiral wave is investigated by selecting different fixed membrane temperatures in the networks, and it is found that a spiral wave cannot be developed if the membrane temperature is close to a certain threshold. A quantitative factor of synchronization is defined to measure the statistical properties and collective behaviors of the spiral wave. And a distinct phase transition, which indicates the critical condition for spiral survival, is observed in the sudden changing point of the factors of synchronization curve vs. certain bifurcation parameter. Internal noise is introduced into ion channels (channel noise) with the Langevin method. It is found that a stable rotating spiral wave is developed and the spiral wave is robust to weak channel noise (the membrane patch is not small). The spiral wave can not grow up and the stable rotating spiral wave encounters instability in presence of strong channel noise. Coherence resonance-like behavior is observed in calculating the factors of synchronization in presence of channel noise. © 2010 World Scientific Publishing Company.

TI  - Transient thermal behavior of automotive dry clutch discs by using Ansys software
VL  - 22
IS  - 6
SP  - 562-570
AB  - The clutch is an important element for comfort during frequent maneuvers so-called start-up and speed gear change for a vehicle equipped with a manual transmission. During the phase of sliding or closing the clutch, the clutch torque is generated by the friction of the pad on the flywheel disc and the plate and then transmitted to the input shaft of the box by the friction disc. This friction generates a quantity of heat which leads to a temperature rise of the clutch. During this sliding phase of the clutch, the speed difference between the friction surfaces may be equated with Coulomb friction model. Currently, the clutches are subjected to high thermal stresses due to the engine. It is therefore useful to estimate the parameters influencing the thermal behavior of the clutch disc when starting or amount gearshift. In this study, we chose three geometric clutch models designed in 3D using Solid Works software, which are then converted into FEM model. Before beginning the analysis of the transient thermal behavior of each model, we proceed to the evaluation of the heat transfer coefficients using ANSYS CFX code. We also analyzed the effect of parameters such as the time of the slip, the angular speed, the lining material and the pressure exerted by the plate on the thermal behavior of the clutch to arrive at end correlations between the selected parameters and the temperature of the clutch disc.

TI  - Assay conditions in laboratory experiments: Is the use of constant rather than fluctuating temperatures justified when investigating temperature-induced plasticity?
VL  - 166
IS  - 1
SP  - 23-33
AB  - Temperature is an important selective agent in nature. Consequently, temperature-induced plasticity which may help buffering detrimental effects of temperature variation has received considerable attention over recent decades. Laboratory studies have almost exclusively used constant temperatures, while in nature, temperature typically shows pronounced daily fluctuations. Using a factorial design with constant versus fluctuating temperatures and a higher versus a lower mean temperature, we here investigate in the butterfly Lycaena tityrus whether the use of constant temperatures is justified. Fluctuating compared to constant temperatures caused shorter development times, increased heat but decreased cold stress resistance, decreased heat-shock protein expression, and increased immunocompetence. Thus, overall, fluctuating temperatures were more beneficial to the butterflies compared to constant ones. However, despite substantial variation across temperature regimes, the ranking of trait values among treatments remained largely unaffected (e.g. lower constant as well as fluctuating temperatures caused increased pupal mass). Thus, we tentatively conclude that there is no general reason for concern about using constant temperatures in studies investigating phenotypic plasticity, which seem to comprise a fair proxy. However, substantial differences in mean values as well as interactive effects suggest that one needs to be cautious. We further demonstrate negative effects of high temperatures on butterfly immune function, which seem to result from a trade-off between the latter and the heat shock response. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

TI  - Economic impacts of climate change on agriculture: A comparison of process-based and statistical yield models
VL  - 12
IS  - 6
AB  - A large number of studies have been published examining the implications of climate change for agricultural productivity that, broadly speaking, can be divided into process-based modeling and statistical approaches. Despite a general perception that results from these methods differ substantially, there have been few direct comparisons. Here we use a data-base of yield impact studies compiled for the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (Porter et al 2014) to systematically compare results from process-based and empirical studies. Controlling for differences in representation of CO2 fertilization between the two methods, we find little evidence for differences in the yield response to warming. The magnitude of CO2 fertilization is instead a much larger source of uncertainty. Based on this set of impact results, we find a very limited potential for on-farm adaptation to reduce yield impacts. We use the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) global economic model to estimate welfare consequences of yield changes and find negligible welfare changes for warming of 1 °C-2 °C if CO2 fertilization is included and large negative effects on welfare without CO2. Uncertainty bounds on welfare changes are highly asymmetric, showing substantial probability of large declines in welfare for warming of 2 °C-3 °C even including the CO2 fertilization effect. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Grizzly bears have long roamed across Yellowstone National Park and beyond-a seminal fact that triggered a controversial early federal ecosystem management effort. Less than a quarter century ago, though protected under the Endangered Species Act, the Yellowstone grizzly population teetered on the edge of extinction, jeopardized by escalating development pressures around the park and an unresponsive federal bureaucracy seemingly indifferent to the mounting bear losses. Once a congressional investigation revealed the grizzly's worsening plight, the responsible agencies responded by proposing to coordinate their conservation efforts at an ecosystem scale and to revise their land management practices to reduce threats to the region's iconic bear population. Although the most grandiose of their plans, captured in a draft Greater Yellowstone Area Vision Document, fell prey to local political intermeddling, the concept of ecosystem management as a plausible-even essential- approach to wildlife management was validated. And the region's grizzly population began rebounding to the point where it is now a candidate for removal from the federal endangered species list. But the Yellowstone grizzly bear population is not yet secure, not in the face of climate changes that are inexorably altering the regional ecosystem and once again calling into question the adequacy of our conservation efforts. According to scientists, warming temperatures and mountain pine beetles are devastating the region's high elevation whitebark pine trees, which produce nuts that represent an important seasonal food source for the grizzly bear.2 Two federal courts have agreed and ordered the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reconsider whether the loss of this food source will affect the bear's long-term survival.3 In fact, whitebark pine is dying at such an alarming rate over its range that it is now a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act.4 The culprit, by most accounts, is global warming, which has unleashed a massive bark beetle infestation and intensified wildfires, both of which are taking a toll on the whitebark pine. As the grizzly loses this critical food source, it will be forced to roam further afield for nutrition, a journey that will likely result in more deadly encounters with humans. Future conservation efforts will plainly have to take account of these climate change impacts, providing yet another justification for an ecosystem-based management strategy. This chapter will address the relationship between wildlife conservation, climate change, and ecosystem management, suggesting that a coordinated and adaptive landscape-scale approach is the only viable strategy for ensuring that the grizzly bear and other species survive in a warming world. It begins by describing the relationship between wildlife conservation and ecosystem management, highlighting key ecosystem management principles designed to promote biodiversity conservation in a world where ecological change is often unpredictable. This includes a critical overview of the nature reserve system that we have created to promote wildlife conservation, explaining the system's ecological and managerial shortcomings. The chapter then introduces climate change, reviewing the impacts that rising temperatures will likely have on wildlife populations and potential adaptive responses that could ameliorate these impacts. The chapter concludes with an assessment of how the law underpinning ecosystem management might be employed to address the climate change challenge through landscape-scale, adaptive management conservation strategies. Given the dire consequences of failing to act in the face of climate change, adaptive ecosystem management merits careful consideration as a viable wildlife conservation strategy for addressing the uncertain and potentially drastic environmental changes that are afoot.

TI  - The Genetic Envelope of Winegrape Vines: Potential for Adaptation to Future Climate Challenges
SP  - 464-481
AB  - Adaptation of the winegrape industry to a warmer and water restrained future is perhaps more urgent and critical than for most of the alternative agricultural land use practices. Winegrape vines (Vitis vinifera L.) are traditionally grown in unique 'terroirs' of which climate is a critical component, the characteristics of wine being directly linked to the climate of the region. A changing climate, therefore, will likely affect the both the style and quality of wine produced at a given site. Furthermore, winegrapes have an expected productive life of more than thirty years so selection of planting material today already requires consideration of the future climate. Exploiting the genetic diversity of the Vitis species through substitution of better suited V. vinifera varieties and clones can be the first step to reducing the impacts of a warmer climate. Planting longer season varieties so that ripening is achieved at a desirable part of the season is fundamental practice to all grape-growing enterprises. Similarly rootstock selection to suit current and future environmental conditions can enhance resilience to a potential water restrained future. Breeding among the V. vinifera varieties, or outcrossing with other Vitis species can be undertaken to produce better adapted progeny, as in some regions and/or further into the future, selection from the existing varietal stock may not be adequate to fully avoid the negative impacts of climate change. This may be the case, for example, in attempting to source well suited vines for regions already considered to be warmer or hot. As well as using conventional breeding, genetic modification and marker assisted breeding can be employed to produce better adapted grapevines, these techniques being no doubt facilitated by the recently completed sequencing of the grapevine genome. No matter which strategy is used, adaptation of the vine to increased heat stress and drought stress will be the main focus for researchers and winegrape growers interested in avoiding the impacts of the projected warmer and drier climate. It remains to be seen how increasing CO2 will interact with these other climatic factors on grapevine physiology. More research is required on this topic for this crop. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Inc..

TI  - Demographic effects of temperature-dependent sex determination: Will tuatara survive global warming?
VL  - 16
IS  - 1
SP  - 60-72
AB  - Global climate change is of particular concern for small and isolated populations of reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination because low genetic variation can limit adaptive response in pivotal temperatures, leading to skewed sex ratios. We explore the demographic consequences of skewed sex ratios on the viability of a tuatara population characterized by low genetic diversity. We studied the rare species of tuatara (Sphenodon guntheri) on the 4 ha North Brother Island in New Zealand over two nesting seasons and captured 477 individuals, with a 60% male bias in the adult population. Females first breed at 15 years and have extremely low rates of gravidity, producing clutches of three to eight eggs every 9 years. Simulations of the population using population viability analysis showed that the current population is expected to persist for at least 2000 years at hatchling sex ratios of up to 75% male, but populations with 85% male hatchlings are expected to become extinct within approximately 300 years (some eight generations). Incorporation of inbreeding depression increased the probability of extinction under male biased sex ratios, with no simulated populations surviving at hatchling sex ratios 475% male. Because recent models have predicted that climate change could lead to the production of all male S. guntheri hatchlings by 2085, we examined whether periodic intervention to produce mixed or female biased sex ratios would allow the population to survive if only males were produced in natural nests. We show that intervention every 2-3 years could buffer the effects of climate change on population sex ratios, but translocation to cooler environs might be more cost-effective. Climate change threatens tuatara populations because neither modified nesting behaviour nor adaptive response of the pivotal temperature can modify hatchling sex ratios fast enough in species with long generation intervals. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

VL  - 62
IS  - 2
SP  - 246-250
AB  - The corals of the Persian/Arabian Gulf are better adapted to temperature fluctuations than elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific. The Gulf is an extreme marine environment displaying the highest known summer water temperatures for any reef area. The small and shallow sea can be considered a good analogue to future conditions for the rest of the world's oceans under global warming. The fact that corals can persist in such a demanding environment indicates that they have been able to acclimatize and selectively adapt to elevated temperature. The implication being that colonies elsewhere may be able to follow suit. This in turn provides hope that corals may, given sufficient time, similarly adapt to survive even in an impoverished form, under conditions of acidification-driven lowering of CaCO3 saturation state, a further consequence of raised atmospheric CO2. This paper demonstrates, however, that the uniquely adapted corals of the Gulf may, within the next three centuries, be threatened by a chronic habitat shortage brought about by the dissolution of the lithified seabed on which they rely for colonisation. This will occur due to modifications in the chemical composition of the Gulf waters due to climate change. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Tuning of catalytic CO2 hydrogenation by changing composition of CuO-ZnO-ZrO2 catalysts
VL  - 118
SP  - 21-31
AB  - CO2 hydrogenation was carried out over a series of CuO-ZnO-ZrO2 catalysts prepared via a reverse co-precipitation method. The influence of catalyst compositions on the physicochemical properties of the catalysts as well as their catalytic performance was investigated. The catalysts were characterized by means of N2-sorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), H2 and CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (H2- and CO2-TPD). The binary CuO-ZrO2 (67:33) catalyst exhibits the highest methanol selectivity at all reaction temperature and its maximum yield of methanol (144.5 gmethanol kgcat-1 h-1) is achieved at 280°C, owing to the strong basic sites and the largest CuO crystallite size. The addition of Zn to the binary CuO-ZrO2 catalyst causes a higher Cu dispersion and an increased number of active sites for CO2 and H2 adsorption. However, the basic strength of the ternary CuO-ZnO-ZrO2 catalysts is lower than the binary CuO-ZrO2 catalyst which provides the maximum yield of methanol at lower reaction tempertures (240 and 250°C), depending on the catalyst compositions. The optimum catalyst composition of Cu-Zn-Zr (38.2:28.6:33.2) gives a superior methanol productivity of 219.7 gmethanol kgcat-1 h-1 at 240°C. The results demonstrate the possibility of controlling catalytic CO2 hydrogenation via tuning the catalyst composition. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - European beech in its northeasternmost stands in Europe: Varying climate-growth relationships among generations and diameter classes
VL  - 45
SP  - 123-131
AB  - Age, genetics and social status of trees affect their sensitivity to environmental factors, and information about such effects is needed for comprehensive assessment of growth potential. Climatic sensitivity of radial increment (i.e., tree-ring width) of introduced European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) of different generations and social status, growing in its northeasternmost stands in Europe, was studied by dendroclimatological methods. At present, the studied stands occur outside of the natural distribution area of the species, providing opportunity to study adaptability and potential growth of beech in novel environments under changing climate. The sensitivity of radial growth to climatic factors was modulated by the generation and social status (size) of trees. The first generation trees, which were propagated from the material transferred from the northern Germany, were highly sensitive to climatic factors and showed wide spectrum of responses. The dominant trees were particularly sensitive to June precipitation, indicating sensitivity to water deficit in summer. The suppressed trees were mainly sensitive to temperature in the dormant period. Tree-ring width of the second generation trees, which were propagated from the first generation stands, was mainly affected by water deficit in summer, yet the local factors, modulated the mechanisms of response. In one stand, tree-ring width was affected by conditions during the formation of tree-ring, indicating direct influence of weather conditions on xylogenesis. In the other stand, tree-ring width was correlated to weather conditions in the preceding year, suggesting influence via carbohydrate reserves. The effect of social status on climatic sensitivity in the second generation stands was considerably weaker, likely due to the natural and anthropogenic selection of the material best adapted for local conditions. The effect of climatic factors on radial growth of beech has shifted during the 20th century. The effect of autumn temperature has weakened, likely due to warming; the effect of factors related to water deficit in summer has intensified that could be related to both, changes in climate and ageing. The observed climate-growth relationships suggested that conditions in winter have become suitable for beech, yet careful selection of sites/regions with appropriate hydrological conditions appear necessary to counteract the increasing effect of water deficit, hence to ensure productivity of future beech sites in Latvia. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

TI  - Behavioural and physiological adaptations to low-temperature environments in the common frog, Rana temporaria
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Extreme environments can impose strong ecological and evolutionary pressures at a local level. Ectotherms are particularly sensitive to low-temperature environments, which can result in a reduced activity period, slowed physiological processes and increased exposure to sub-zero temperatures. The aim of this study was to assess the behavioural and physiological responses that facilitate survival in low-temperature environments. In particular, we asked: 1) do high-altitude common frog (Rana temporaria) adults extend the time available for larval growth by breeding at lower temperatures than low-altitude individuals?; and 2) do tadpoles sampled from high-altitude sites differ physiologically from those from low-altitude sites, in terms of routine metabolic rate (RMR) and freeze tolerance? Breeding date was assessed as the first day of spawn observation and local temperature recorded for five, paired high- and low-altitude R. temporaria breeding sites in Scotland. Spawn was collected and tadpoles raised in a common laboratory environment, where RMR was measured as oxygen consumed using a closed respiratory tube system. Freeze tolerance was measured as survival following slow cooling to the point when all container water had frozen. Results: We found that breeding did not occur below 5°C at any site and there was no significant relationship between breeding temperature and altitude, leading to a delay in spawning of five days for every 100 m increase in altitude. The relationship between altitude and RMR varied by mountain but was lower for individuals sampled from high- than low-altitude sites within the three mountains with the highest high-altitude sites (≥900 m). In contrast, individuals sampled from low-altitudes survived freezing significantly better than those from high-altitudes, across all mountains. Conclusions: Our results suggest that adults at high-altitude do not show behavioural adaptations in terms of breeding at lower temperatures. However, tadpoles appear to have the potential to adapt physiologically to surviving at high-altitude via reduced RMR but without an increase in freeze tolerance. Therefore, survival at high-altitude may be facilitated by physiological mechanisms that permit faster growth rates, allowing completion of larval development within a shorter time period, alleviating the need for adaptations that extend the time available for larval growth. © 2014Muir et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

VL  - 259
IS  - 4
SP  - 698-709
AB  - This study compiles and summarizes the existing knowledge about observed and projected impacts of climate change on forests in Europe. Forests will have to adapt not only to changes in mean climate variables but also to increased variability with greater risk of extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought, storms and floods. Sensitivity, potential impacts, adaptive capacity, and vulnerability to climate change are reviewed for European forests. The most important potential impacts of climate change on forest goods and services are summarized for the Boreal, Temperate Oceanic, Temperate Continental, Mediterranean, and mountainous regions. Especially in northern and western Europe the increasing atmospheric CO2 content and warmer temperatures are expected to result in positive effects on forest growth and wood production, at least in the short-medium term. On the other hand, increasing drought and disturbance risks will cause adverse effects. These negative impacts are very likely to outweigh positive trends in southern and eastern Europe. From west to east, the drought risk increases. In the Mediterranean regions productivity is expected to decline due to strongly increased droughts and fire risks. Adaptive capacity consists of the inherent adaptive capacity of trees and forest ecosystems and of socio-economic factors determining the capability to implement planned adaptation. The adaptive capacity in the forest sector is relatively large in the Boreal and the Temperate Oceanic regions, more constrained by socio-economic factors in the Temperate Continental, and most limited in the Mediterranean region where large forest areas are only extensively managed or unmanaged. Potential impacts and risks are best studied and understood with respect to wood production. It is clear that all other goods and services provided by European forests will also be impacted by climate change, but much less knowledge is available to quantify these impacts. Understanding of adaptive capacity and regional vulnerability to climate change in European forests is not well developed and requires more focussed research efforts. An interdisciplinary research agenda integrated with monitoring networks and projection models is needed to provide information at all levels of decision making, from policy development to the management unit.

VL  - 37
IS  - 6
SP  - 1345-1359
AB  - While ocean acidification is a global issue, the severity of ecosystem effects is likely to vary considerably at regional scales. The lack of understanding of how biogeographically separated populations will respond to acidification hampers our ability to predict the future of vital ecosystems. Cold-water corals are important drivers of biodiversity in ocean basins across the world and are considered one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to ocean acidification. We tested the short-term physiological response of the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa to three pH treatments (pH = 7.9, 7.75 and 7.6) for Gulf of Mexico (USA) and Tisler Reef (Norway) populations, and found that reductions in seawater pH elicited contrasting responses. Gulf of Mexico corals exhibited reductions in net calcification, respiration and prey capture rates with decreasing pH. In contrast, Tisler Reef corals showed only slight reductions in net calcification rates under decreased pH conditions while significantly elevating respiration and capture rates. These differences are likely the result of environmental differences (depth, pH, food supply) between the two regions, invoking the potential for local adaptation or acclimatization to alter their response to global change. However, it is also possible that variations in the methodology used in the experiments contributed to the observed differences. Regardless, these results provide insights into the resilience of L. pertusa to ocean acidification as well as the potential influence of regional differences on the viability of species in future oceans. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

TI  - Effects of temperature and prey size on predator-prey interactions between bluefish and bay anchovy
VL  - 461
SP  - 449-457
AB  - Little is known about the behavioral responses of fishes at low temperatures. Of particular interest are predator-prey interactions because feeding at low temperature is necessary for the overwinter survival of many species. This experiment examined how low temperatures affect behavioral interactions between bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix L) and two sizes of bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli V.) prey. Temperature had an effect on multiple responses of predator-prey encounters including the approach distance of bluefish towards prey, attack and escape speeds, and prey handling time. The reaction distance of prey was important in determining the outcome of an attack; anchovy reacting at a greater distance from an attacking bluefish escaped more often. However, temperature did not have an effect on either reaction distance or bluefish capture success. The influence of prey size depended on how capture success was defined. Bluefish ability at catching prey was not affected by anchovy size, but larger prey were ingested less frequently due to a greater incidence of prey being dropped in trials with large anchovy. Further, bluefish had greater difficulty handling and ingesting prey at lower temperatures, especially for larger prey. At the lowest temperature treatment small anchovy were readily consumed, but no attacks were made on larger prey. This shows that bluefish modify prey size-selectivity behavior based on temperature, which probably results from a perceived inability to handle and ingest large prey at low temperatures. These results suggest that at low winter temperatures bluefish are restricted to smaller prey. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Stability Comparison of Perovskite Solar Cells Based on Zinc Oxide and Titania on Polymer Substrates
VL  - 9

SP  - 687-695
AB  - Device scale-up and long-term stability constitute two major hurdles that the emerging perovskite solar technology will have to overcome before commercialization. Here, a comparative study was performed between ZnO and TiO2 electron-selective layers, two materials that allow the low-temperature processing of perovskite solar cells on polymer substrates. Although the use of TiO2 is well established on glass substrates, ZnO was chosen because it can be readily printed at low temperature and offers the potential for the large-scale roll-to-roll manufacturing of flexible photovoltaics at a low cost. However, a rapid degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 was observed if it was deposited on ZnO, therefore, the influence of the perovskite film preparation conditions on its morphology and degradation kinetics was investigated. This study showed that CH3NH3PbI3 could withstand a higher temperature on TiO2 than ZnO and that TiO2-based perovskite devices were more stable than their ZnO analogues. So solar: A comparison between CH3NH3PbI3/ZnO- and CH3NH3PbI3/TiO2-based perovskite solar cells on polymer substrates demonstrates a higher thermal device stability if constructed on TiO2. Exacerbated degradation of CH3NH3PbI3 leads us to question the viability of ZnO as an effective electron-selective layer in low-temperature processed perovskite solar cells. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

TI  - Salmon Welfare Index Model (SWIM 1.0): A semantic model for overall welfare assessment of caged Atlantic salmon: Review of the selected welfare indicators and model presentation
VL  - 5
IS  - 1
SP  - 33-57
AB  - A semantic model for overall welfare assessment of Atlantic salmon reared in sea cages is presented. The model, called SWIM 1.0, is designed to enable fish farmers to make a formal and standardized assessment of fish welfare using a set of selected welfare indicators. In order to cover all welfare relevant aspects from the animals' point of view and to create a science-based tool we first identified the known welfare needs of Atlantic salmon in sea cages and searched the literature for feasible welfare indicators. The framework of semantic modelling was used to perform a structured literature review and an evaluation of each indicator. The selected indicators were water temperature, salinity, oxygen saturation, water current, stocking density, lighting, disturbance, daily mortality rate, appetite, sea lice infestation ratio, condition factor, emaciation state, vertebral deformation, maturation stage, smoltification state, fin condition and skin condition. Selection criteria for the indicators were that they should be practical and measureable on the farm, that each indicator could be divided into levels from good to poor welfare backed up by relevant scientific literature. To estimate each indicator's relative impact on welfare, all the indicators were weighted based on their respective literature reviews and according to weighting factors defined as part of the semantic modelling framework. This was ultimately amalgamated into an overall model that calculates welfare indexes for salmon in sea cages. More importantly, the model identifies how each indicator contributes (negatively and positively) to the overall index and hence which welfare needs are compromised or fulfilled. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - In this work, the supercritical carbon dioxide impregnation of low density polyethylene (LDPE) films with a mixture of two terpenic ketones (thymoquinone and R-(+)-pulegone) with biopesticide activity is investigated, as a strategy for developing a packaging material or delivery device for protecting seeds, kernels and derivatives during storage and transport. Impregnation runs were performed according to a fractional factorial experimental design in order to evaluate the effect of four process variables at two levels (pressure: 10-15 MPa; depressurization rate: 0.5-2.0 MPa/min; time: 2-4 h; initial ketone mole fraction: 0.0017-0.0025) on impregnation yield and selectivity between ketones. Operational temperature was constant for all experiments and equal to 45 degrees C. The impregnated films were analyzed by infrared spectroscpy (FTIR) in order to confirm the presence of both ketones and determine their relative ratio in the final product. ANOVA test of the results indicate that contact time and ketone concentration are the only factors with significant effects on impregnation yield (ranging between 2.25 and 5.59%), while no factor seems to affect significantly the loading selectivity, with thymoquinone/pulegone ratios in the final product between 0.39 and 0.99. The insecticidal activity of impregnated film samples was evaluated in fumigant assays against corn weevil (Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky), a major pest of stored kernels. The films showed a high activity level during the first 2 days (similar to 100% mortality), which gradually decreased until showing no toxicity after 7 days. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

VL  - 51

SP  - 112-121
AB  - In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the survival at temperatures considerably exceeding the optimum is supported by intense synthesis of the so-called heat shock proteins (HSPs), which act to overcome the adverse effects of heat stress. Among mycoplasmas (class Mollicutes), which have significantly reduced genomes, only some members of the Acholeplasmataceae family possess small HSPs of the α-crystallin type. Overproduction of a recombinant HSP IbpA (Hsp20) from the free-living mycoplasma Acholeplasma laidlawii was shown to increase the resistance of Escherichia coli to short-term heat shock. It has been long assumed that IbpA prevents protein aggregation and precipitation thereby increasing viability of E. coli cells. Several potential target proteins interacting with IbpA under heat stress were identified, including biosynthetic enzymes, enzymes of energy metabolism, and components of the protein synthesis machinery. Statistical analysis of physicochemical properties indicated that IbpA interaction partners significantly differ in molecular weight, charge, and isoelectric point from other members of the E. coli proteome. Upon shortterm exposure to increased temperature, IbpA was found to preferentially interact with high-molecularweight proteins having a pI of about 5.1, significantly lower than the typical values of E. coli proteins. © 2017, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

AB  - In a patchy environment, animals must make habitat choices, presumably based on environmental cues that provide reliable fitness-related information. Capelin Mallotus villosus is a small (<200mm), short-lived (3-6 years) forage fish that spawns adhesive eggs in 2 habitats with divergent temperature regimes: beach (warm, variable) and deep water (demersal; cool, stable). In 2009 and 2010, I investigated the influence of temperature on spawning habitat selection in coastal Newfoundland by quantifying habitat-specific temperature, population-level habitat use, and individual-level movements of male capelin via acoustic telemetry. Drastically, different temperature in both years was associated with divergent habitat use. Capelin spawned only at beaches in 2009, when temperatures were significantly colder and frequently fell below suitable ranges at demersal sites (2-12°C), whereas demersal sites were predominantly used under opposing conditions in 2010. Most male capelin (76%, n = 22) were detected in one habitat only per year (beach: 10%, n = 3; demersal: 66%, n = 19). Males detected in both habitats (17%, n = 5) primarily dispersed from the initial habitat when temperatures routinely fell outside of suitable ranges. This movement often involved traveling long distances (11.0-32.7 km) against currents, suggesting energetic costs. Other males (7%, n = 2) were only detected at unused sites in 2009, implying these fish did not spawn despite having developed secondary sexual characteristics. Overall, temperature appeared to be an important environmental cue for habitat selection by capelin. The flexible use of spawning habitats under divergent temperature conditions suggests that capelin have a high capacity to respond to and possibly tolerate predicted ocean-climate change. © 2012 The Author.

TI  - Yield response to deficit irrigation strategies based on plant available water for growing field corn
AB  - The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates only 20% of the land used to grow food is irrigated but it accounts for 40% of the world food supply. Climate change, population growth, and loss of prime agricultural land to development will necessitate judicious use of irrigation water to grow adequate food crops notwithstanding uncertain precipitation levels. The study reported here was conducted at University of Maryland Eastern Shore to determine the influence of deficit irrigation on water use efficiency of corn crop in the 2015 growing season under field conditions using a drip irrigation scheme. Deficit irrigation is being widely investigated as a valuable and sustainable production strategy. It is generally hypothesized that yield loss is less pronounced if irrigation water is available during the reproductive stage of the crop. For this study, the growing season was divided in three equal portions corresponding to early, middle, and late stages of crop growth. Three irrigation treatments were chosen along with a non-irrigated control area. These treatments were based on plant available water in the soil which takes into account the permanent wilting point and field capacity. These treatments were as follows; Treatment 1 (70-70-70), treatment 2 (0-50-50), treatment 3 (0-30-15), and the non-irrigated control (rain-fed). 70 corresponds to maintaining 70% plant available water. It is to be noted two of the treatments have '0' for the early stage indicating that no irrigation was scheduled. During the growing season weekly measurements were taken using a handheld IRT sensor, soil moisture sensor, as well as a SPAD meter. Thermal imagery was also captured using an unmanned aerial system (UAS). A selected portion of the experimental area was hand harvested and the rest with a combine harvester equipped with a yield monitor. The results of this preliminary field study indicate deficit irrigation does make judicious use of irrigation water. While UAS based thermal image analyses and correlation studies with soil moisture and IRT data holds promise, further investigations will be necessary for conclusive results.

TI  - Continuous synthesis of a high energetic substance using small scale reactors
VL  - 32
SP  - 685-690
AB  - For the industrial production of chemicals a safe process design is required to avoid harm to people and environment. It becomes tremendous important if one or more of the following points are characteristic for the synthesis: high heat release, explosive atmosphere, presence of toxic and/or of thermal unstable substances. One substance group, known for being unstable, is the group of organic peroxides. They are potential high energetic substances. Many syntheses of organic peroxides are carried out in semi-batch mode to control the heat release in a good manner. With the aim to increase process control, the advantages of continuous reaction mode, combined with micro reaction technology, are used for the synthesis of one specific organic peroxide in this work. This approach is not only characterised by shorter residence time, good heat transfer, but also by smaller quantities of managed chemicals, and, therefore, by a lower hazard potential. Often yield and selectivity can be improved additionally. For the study a peroxyester, namely tert-Butyl peroxy-2-ethylhexanoate (TBPEH), with known thermal hazard potential was chosen. The two phase liquid/liquid reaction was carried out in three types of reactors. A small scale tubular reactor, stressed by ultrasound, and two different micro structured reactors were used. One of them had a meandering and the other a split-and-recombine channel structure. Synthesis temperature was also varied. From preliminary studies it was known that the side reaction of the involved carboxylic acid chloride to the corresponding acid can become more important in continuous mode compared to semi-batch mode. The effect of reactor type and temperature on selectivity and therefore yield of TBPEH was analysed and compared. In result the reaction could be carried out in a safe manner. The high heat-exchanging efficiency of the used reactors and the short residence time allowed synthesis temperature near the onset temperature of decomposition of TBPEH. In relation to the results of the capillary tube and of the reactor with meandering channel structure (MR), the results for the split-and-recombine reactor (SAR) showed the best trend line. Further studies have to underline the result. Compared to the traditional reaction path (the semi-batch mode), a higher space time yield could be achieved. This promising information is accompanied by the fact of low reaction volumes. In consequence the productivity is low without a numbering up of reaction channels or a scaling up of it. The nowadays existing philosophy of producing a specific quantity of product by a company, followed by the transport to the costumer may change. Just organic peroxides, used in small quantities, e.g. as initiators for polymerisation processes or as resin hardeners, provide the opportunity for an on-demand-production.

AB  - Hydrostatic pressure is a well-known physical parameter which is now considered an important variable of life, since organisms have the ability to adapt to pressure changes, by the development of resistance against this variable. In the past decades a huge interest in high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) technology is increasingly emerging among food and biosciences researchers. Microbial specific stress responses to HHP are currently being investigated, through the evaluation of pressure effects on biomolecules, cell structure, metabolic behavior, growth and viability. The knowledge development in this field allows a better comprehension of pressure resistance mechanisms acquired at sub-lethal pressures. In addition, new applications of HHP could arise from these studies, particularly in what concerns to biotechnology. For instance, the modulation of microbial metabolic pathways, as a response to different pressure conditions, may lead to the production of novel compounds with potential biotechnological and industrial applications. Considering pressure as an extreme life condition, this review intends to present the main findings so far reported in the scientific literature, focusing on microorganisms with the ability to withstand and to grow in high pressure conditions, whether they have innated or acquired resistance, and show the potential of the application of HHP technology for microbial biotechnology. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Ohmic heating and pulsed vacuum effect on dehydration processes and polyphenol component retention of osmodehydrated blueberries (cv. Tifblue)
VL  - 36
SP  - 112-119
AB  - Blueberries are highly perishable fruits; therefore, emerging technologies focus on improving the bioactive compound retention and extending the shelf life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of ohmic heating and vacuum pulses on the dehydration processes and polyphenol compound retention of osmodehydrated blueberries (cv. Tifblue). The treatments were performed using a 65% (w/w) sucrose solution, an electric field of 13 V/cm (100 V) at 30 °C, 40 °C or 50 °C for 300 min, and air drying at 50, 60 or 70 °C to obtain dried blueberries. The moisture content, soluble solids and phenolic compounds were analyzed. The combination of ohmic heating/pulsed vacuum treatments intensifies mass transfer in osmodehydrated blueberries, especially at higher temperatures. Nevertheless, the polyphenol retention was greater at lower temperatures; hence, the application of an intermediate process temperature (40 °C) was selected as a pre-treatment prior to further drying. The treated samples improve the retention of polyphenols after drying compared with untreated samples. Therefore, the results of this research study suggest that the use of a pulsed vacuum and ohmic heating in the osmotic dehydration (PVOD/OH) treatment at 40 °C for 240 min and subsequent drying at 60°C could be the best process for dehydrating blueberries, considering that it improved mass transfer, achieved lower losses of phenolic components and reduced the drying time. Industrial relevance Blueberries are an important fruit due their high bioactive compound content, especially polyphenols. Studies that involve emerging technologies application could add value to blueberries. Ohmic heating and pulsed vacuum as pre-treatments improve the efficiency of dehydration processes, focused toward bioactive compounds retention and achieving commercial viability. In this work have been applied PVOD/OH treatments at moderated temperatures and subsequently dried at 60 °C, obtaining promissory results. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

TI  - Multi-objective optimization for the economic production of d-psicose using simulated moving bed chromatography
VL  - 1398
SP  - 47-56
AB  - The biocatalytic production of rare carbohydrates from available sugar sources rapidly gains interest as a route to acquire industrial amounts of rare sugars for food and fine chemical applications. Here we present a multi-objective optimization procedure for a simulated moving bed (SMB) process for the production of the rare sugar D-psicose from enzymatically produced mixtures with its epimer D-fructose. First, model parameters were determined using the inverse method and experimentally validated on a 2-2-2-2 lab-scale SMB plant. The obtained experimental purities (PUs) were in excellent agreement with the simulated data derived from a transport-dispersive true-moving bed model demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed design. In the second part the performance of the separation was investigated in a multi-objective optimization study addressing the cost-contributing performance parameters productivity (PR) and desorbent requirement (DR) as a function of temperature. While rare sugar SMB operation under conditions of low desorbent consumption was found to be widely unaffected by temperature, SMB operation focusing on increased PR significantly benefited from high temperatures, with possible productivities increasing from 3.4 kg (L day)(-1) at 20 degrees C to 5 kg(Lday)(-1) at 70 degrees C, indicating that decreased selectivity at higher temperatures could be fully compensated for by the higher mass transfer rates, as they translate into reduced switch times and hence higher PR. A DR/PR Pareto optimization suggested a similar but even more pronounced trend also under relaxed PU requirements, with the PR increasing from 4.3 kg (L day)(-1) to a maximum of 7.8 kg (L day)(-1) for SMB operation at 50 degrees C when the PU of the non-product stream was reduced from 99.5% to 90%. Based on the in silico optimization results experimental SMB runs were performed yielding considerable PRs of 1.9 (30 degrees C), 2.4 (50 degrees C) and 2.6 kg (L day)(-1) (70 degrees C) with rather low DR (27 L per kg of rare sugar produced) on a lab-scale SMB installation.

TI  - A genetic algorithm to refine input data selection for air temperature prediction using artificial neural networks
VL  - 13
IS  - 5
SP  - 2253-2260
AB  - The accurate prediction of air temperature is important in many areas of decision-making including agricultural management, transportation and energy management. Previous research has focused on the development of artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict air temperature from one to twelve hours in advance. The inputs to these models included a constant duration of prior data with a fixed resolution for all environmental variables for all prediction horizons. The overall goal of this research was to develop more accurate ANN models that could predict air temperature for each prediction horizon. The specific objective was to determine if the ANN model accuracy could be improved by applying a genetic algorithm (GA) for each prediction horizon to determine the preferred duration and resolution of input prior data for each environmental variable. The ANN models created based on this GA based approach provided smaller errors than the models created based on the existing constant duration and fixed data resolution approach for all twelve prediction horizons. Except for a few cases, the GA generally included a longer duration for prior air temperature data and shorter durations for other environmental variables. The mean absolute errors (MAEs) for the evaluation input patterns of the one-, four-, eight-, and twelve-hour prediction models that were based on this GA approach were 0.564 degrees C, 1.264 degrees C, 1.766 degrees C and 2.018 degrees C, respectively. These MAEs were improvements of 3.98%, 4.59%, 2.55% and 1.70% compared to the models that were created based on the existing approach for the same corresponding prediction horizons. Thus, the GA based approach to determine the duration and resolution of prior input data resulted in more accurate ANN models than the existing ones for air temperature prediction. Future work could examine the effects of various GA and fitness evaluation parameters that were part of the approach used in this study. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Divergent enhancer haplotype of ebony on inversion In(3R)Payne associated with pigmentation variation in a tropical population of Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 20
IS  - 20
SP  - 4277-4287
AB  - The pattern and intensity of pigmentation have direct impact on individual fitness through various ecological factors. In a Drosophila melanogaster population from southern Japan, thoracic trident pigmentation intensity of most of the strains could be classified into Dark or Light-type. The expression level variation of the ebony gene correlated well with this phenotype and the allelic differences in expression indicated that the variation is partly due to cis-regulatory changes. In the ∼13 kb gene region, we identified 17 nucleotide sites and 2 indels that were in complete association with the thoracic trident pigmentation intensity. Interestingly, 11 out of 19 sites located within ∼0.5 kb of the core epidermis enhancer. These sites had no obvious association with the abdominal pigmentation intensity in the previously analysed African populations from Uganda and Kenya, which suggested that multiple potential mutational pathways in the cis-regulatory control region of a single gene could lead to similar phenotypic variation within this species. We also found that the Light-type enhancer haplotype is strongly linked to a cosmopolitan inversion, In(3R)Payne, which is predominant in warmer climatic regions in both hemispheres. The sequence pattern suggested that the strong linkage may be due to selective forces related to thermal adaptation. The inferred selection for lighter pigmentation in the Japanese population is in the opposite direction of the previously reported case of selection for darker individuals in African populations. Nevertheless, both adaptive changes involved cis-regulatory changes of ebony, which shows that this gene is likely to be a common target of natural selection. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Rapid growth reduces cold resistance: Evidence from latitudinal variation in growth rate, cold resistance and stress proteins
VL  - 6
IS  - 2
AB  - Background: Physiological costs of rapid growth may contribute to the observation that organisms typically grow at submaximal rates. Although, it has been hypothesized that faster growing individuals would do worse in dealing with suboptimal temperatures, this type of cost has never been explored empirically. Furthermore, the mechanistic basis of the physiological costs of rapid growth is largely unexplored. Methodology/Principal Finding: Larvae of the damselfly Ischnura elegans from two univoltine northern and two multivoltine southern populations were reared at three temperatures and after emergence given a cold shock. Cold resistance, measured by chill coma recovery times in the adult stage, was lower in the southern populations. The faster larval growth rates in the southern populations contributed to this latitudinal pattern in cold resistance. In accordance with their assumed role in cold resistance, Hsp70 levels were lower in the southern populations, and faster growing larvae had lower Hsp70 levels. Yet, individual variation in Hsp70 levels did not explain variation in cold resistance. Conclusions/Significance: We provide evidence for a novel cost of rapid growth: reduced cold resistance. Our results indicate that the reduced cold resistance in southern populations of animals that change voltinism along the latitudinal gradient may not entirely be explained by thermal selection per se but also by the costs of time constraint-induced higher growth rates. This also illustrates that stressors imposed in the larval stage may carry over and shape fitness in the adult stage and highlights the importance of physiological costs in the evolution of life-histories at macro-scales. © 2011 Stoks, De Block.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change is altering temperature regimes for coastal marine fishes. However, given that temperature changes will not occur in isolation of other stressors, it is necessary to explore the potential consequences of stress on the thermal tolerances and preferences of tropical marine fish in order to understand the thresholds for survival, and predict the associated coastal ecological consequences. In this study, we used exogenous cortisol injections to investigate the effects of a thermal challenge on checkered puffers (Sphoeroides testudineus) as a secondary stressor. There were no significant differences between control and cortisol-treated fish 48 h following cortisol treatment for swimming ability (using a chase to exhaustion protocol), blood glucose concentrations or standard metabolic rate. In the lab, control and cortisol-treated puffers were exposed to ambient (29.1 +/- 1.5 degrees C), ambient +5 degrees C (heat shock) and ambient -5 degrees C (cold shock) for 4 h and to evaluate the consequences of abrupt temperature change on puff performance and blood physiology. Following cold shock, control fish exhibited increases in cortisol levels and weak 'puff' performance. Conversely, fish dosed with cortisol exhibited consistently high cortisol levels independent of thermal treatment, although there was a trend for an attenuated cortisol response in the cortisol-treated fish to the cold shock treatment. A 20-day complementary field study conducted in the puffer's natural habitat, a tidal creek in Eleuthera, The Bahamas, revealed that cortisol-injected fish selected significantly cooler temperatures, measured using accumulated thermal units, when compared to controls. These results, and particularly the discrepancies between consequences documented in the laboratory and the ecological trends observed in the field, highlight the need to establish the link between laboratory and field data to successfully develop management policies and conservation initiatives with regards to anthropogenic climate change.

AB  - Background. Several European and North American studies have reported associations between cold temperatures and mortality from diseases of the circulatory system. However, the effects of cold vary between the settings warranting further research in other parts of the world. Objectives. To study associations between temperature and mortality from selected diseases of circulatory system in Astana, Kazakhstan - the second coldest capital in the world. Methods. Daily counts of deaths from hypertensive diseases (ICD-10 codes: I10-I15), ischemic heart disease (I20-I25) and cerebrovascular diseases (I60-I69) among adults 18 years and older in Astana, Kazakhstan, during cold periods (October-March) in 2000-2001 and 2006-2010 were collected from the City Registry Office. Associations between mortality and mean apparent temperature and minimum apparent temperature (average for lags 0-15) were studied using Poisson regression controlling for barometric pressure (average for lags 0-3), wind speed and effects of month, year, weekends and holidays. Analyses were repeated using mean and minimum temperatures. Results. Overall, there were 320, 4468 and 2364 deaths from hypertensive disorders, ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular diseases, respectively. No significant associations between either mean, mean apparent, minimum or minimum apparent temperatures were found for any of the studied outcomes. Conclusions. Contrary to the European findings, we did not find inverse associations between apparent temperatures and mortality from cardiovascular or cerebrovascular causes. Factors behind the lack of association may be similar to those in urban settings in Siberia, that is, centrally heated houses and a culture of wearing large volumes of winter clothes outdoors. Further research on the sensitivity of the population in Kazakhstan to climatic factors and its adaptive capacity is warranted. © 2012 Andrej M. Grjibovski et al.

AB  - Plastics have become the widely used materials because of their advantages, such as cheapness, endurance, lightness, and hygiene. However, they cause waste and soil pollution and they do not easily decompose. Many promising technologies are being investigated for separating mixed thermoplastics, but they are still uneconomical and unreliable. Depending on their surface characteristics, these plastics can be separated from each other by flotation method which is useful mineral processing technique with its low cost and simplicity.The main objective of this study is to investigate the flotation characteristics of PET and PVC and determine the effect of plasticizer reagents on efficient plastic separation. For that purpose, various parameters such as pH, plasticizer concentration, plasticizer type, conditioning temperature and thermal conditioning were investigated. As a result, PET particles were floated with 95.1% purity and 65.3% efficiency while PVC particles were obtained with 98.1% purity and 65.3% efficiency. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Modelling as a tool for analysing the temperature-dependent future of the Colorado potato beetle in Europe
VL  - 19
IS  - 4
SP  - 1043-1055
AB  - A warmer climate may increase the risk of attacks by insect pests on agricultural crops, and questions on how to adapt management practice have created a need for impact models. Phenological models driven by climate data can be used for assessing the potential distribution and voltinism of different insect species, but the quality of the simulations is influenced by a range of uncertainties. In this study, we model the temperature-dependent activity and development of the Colorado potato beetle, and analyse the influence of uncertainty associated with parameterization of temperature and day length response. We found that the developmental threshold has a major impact on the simulated number of generations per year. Little is known about local adaptations and individual variations, but the use of an upper and a lower developmental threshold gave an indication on the potential variation. The day length conditions triggering diapause are known only for a few populations. We used gridded observed temperature data to estimate local adaptations, hypothesizing that cold autumns can leave a footprint in the population genetics by low survival of individuals not reaching the adult stage before winter. Our study indicated that the potential selection pressure caused by climate conditions varies between European regions. Provided that there is enough genetic variation, a local adaption at the northern distribution limit would reduce the number of unsuccessful initiations and thereby increase the potential for spreading to areas currently not infested. The simulations of the impact model were highly sensitive to biases in climate model data, i.e. systematic deviations in comparison with observed weather, highlightening the need of improved performance of regional climate models. Even a moderate temperature increase could change the voltinism of Leptinotarsa decemlineata in Europe, but knowledge on agricultural practice and strategies for countermeasures is needed to evaluate changes in risk of attacks. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - The shape of impacts to come: lessons and opportunities for adaptation from uneven increases in global and regional temperatures
VL  - 139
IS  - 3
SP  - 341-349
AB  - Uneven patterns in the rate of climate change have profound implications for adaptation. Assuming a linear or monotonic increase in global or regional temperatures can lead to inefficient planning processes that underestimate the magnitude, pattern, and timing of the risks faced by human and natural systems, which could exaggerate future impacts and the costs of managing them. Adaptation planning needs to move beyond imposing linear thinking and analysis onto nonlinear systems. Doing so would improve research into adaptive management processes that learn from and adapt to new knowledge at a pace that reflects non-linearity. Specifically, the pace of adaptation must consider the potential consequences of uneven increases in weather and climate variables as a means to reduce system vulnerability. Projections simulating periods of relative stability with those of rapid change would lead to more complex and more accurate expectations of future risks and associated consequences for human and natural systems. Adaptation planning based on such projections could then consider the implications of non-linear climate change on the extent of any adaptation effort, including quantified (or qualitative) risks and associated costs and benefits. Adaptation planning could be improved by projections that incorporate more nuanced understandings of how development processes could interact with climate change to alter future risks and vulnerabilities. Two examples are highlighted to illustrate the complexity and dynamic nature of non-monotonic climate-development-response scenarios: vector borne diseases and agricultural productivity. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Three-dimensional finite element thermal analysis in selective laser melting of Al-Al2O3 powder
SP  - 131-150
AB  - The selective laser melting (SLM) of aluminium-based composites continues to be a challenge due to the high reflectivity, high thermal conductivity and oxidation of aluminium, all of which directly influence the thermal performance of each layer during SLM. Due to the extremely rapid melting and cooling rate of aluminium, however, it is difficult to measure thermal performance within practical SLM applications. A three-dimensional finite element simulation model is thus developed in this study to simulate the transient temperature distribution and molten pool dimensions of the premier layer during the SLM of Al-Al2O3 composite powder. In order to produce high-quality parts with minimum defects in a highly efficient manner, the predicted optimum volumetric energy density is found to be 40 J/mm3, with laser power 300 W, scanning speed 1000 mm/s, hatch spacing 150 μm and layer thickness 50 μm; the molten pool size that is produced is 165 μm in length, 160 μm in width and 77 μm in depth, with a predicted maximum temperature of around 3400°C. All of these factors may contribute to the creation of good metallurgic bonding. © 2016 The Department of Energy’s Kansas City National Security Campus is operated and managed by Honeywell Federal Manufacturing Technologies, LLC under contract number DE-NA0002839.

TI  - LAMPhimerus: A novel LAMP assay for detecting Amphimerus sp. DNA in human stool samples
VL  - 11
IS  - 6
AB  - Background: Amphimeriasis is a fish-borne disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimerus spp. that has recently been reported as endemic in the tropical Pacific side of Ecuador with a high prevalence in humans and domestic animals. The diagnosis is based on the stool examination to identify parasite eggs, but it lacks sensitivity. Additionally, the morphology of the eggs may be confounded with other liver and intestinal flukes. No immunological or molecular methods have been developed to date. New diagnostic techniques for specific and sensitive detection of Amphimerus spp. DNA in clinical samples are needed. Methodology/Principal findings: A LAMP targeting a sequence of the Amphimerus sp. internal transcribed spacer 2 region was designed. Amphimerus sp. DNA was obtained from adult worms recovered from animals and used to optimize the molecular assays. Conventional PCR was performed using outer primers F3-B3 to verify the proper amplification of the Amphimerus sp. DNA target sequence. LAMP was optimized using different reaction mixtures and temperatures, and it was finally set up as LAMPhimerus. The specificity and sensitivity of both PCR and LAMP were evaluated. The detection limit was 1 pg of genomic DNA. Field testing was done using 44 human stool samples collected from localities where fluke is endemic. Twenty-five samples were microscopy positive for Amphimerus sp. eggs detection. In molecular testing, PCR F3-B3 was ineffective when DNA from fecal samples was used. When testing all human stool samples included in our study, the diagnostic parameters for the sensitivity and specificity were calculated for our LAMPhimerus assay, which were 76.67% and 80.77%, respectively. Conclusions/Significance: We have developed and evaluated, for the first time, a specific and sensitive LAMP assay for detecting Amphimerus sp. in human stool samples. The procedure has been named LAMPhimerus method and has the potential to be adapted for field diagnosis and disease surveillance in amphimeriasis-endemic areas. Future large-scale studies will assess the applicability of this novel LAMP assay. © 2017 Cevallos et al.

VL  - 31

SP  - 195-212
AB  - Mediterranean vipers are ecologically very similar. When in contact, they constitute an exceptional model to study the effects of competitive interactions and niche segregation mechanisms. In High Ebro, distinct methodologies (random visual encounter, road sampling and radio-tracking surveys, captive maintenance, standardized transects and ad hoc field observations) were used to compare ecological traits (diet, micro-habitat, activity, reproductive and demographic) of V. aspis, V. latastei and hybrids among both species and determine competitive advantages of each form. Diet preferences were similar but few differences were found in feeding frequency and annual variation in diet consumption. Males of the three forms compete for areas with similar characteristics but differences were found mainly during summer. Significant differences in average movement rates and home range size were found among males. Fecundity and new-borns fitness were lower in V. aspis than in V. latastei, whereas hybrids had intermediate values. Male and female adult hybrids were more abundant than parental forms, whereas female and juvenile V. latastei and juvenile hybrids had high road-mortality. The three forms seem to be competing intensely for resources but the segregation on the spatial and temporal axes of their niches could be reducing interspecific competition and allowing coexistence. The use of different resources probably confers reproductive and demographic advantages for V. latastei and hybrids, respectively. Moreover, reproductive fitness of hybrids suggests the occurrence of endogenous selection. Comparative thermal and genetic studies are needed to clarify the limiting factors of vipers and to establish a model of the hybrid zone. © 2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

TI  - Geographic origin and culture method influence the overwinter mortality of juvenile hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria (L.)
VL  - 440
SP  - 48-59
AB  - Overwinter mortality of juvenile northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria, is a major impediment to the aquaculture industry from the mid-Atlantic US through Atlantic Canada. Mortality occurs during prolonged exposures to low temperatures and/or during the winter-spring transition when water temperatures are rising. Recent efforts to overwinter juveniles of Mercenaria mercenaria produced from native Maine (ME, USA) broodstock in eastern ME have found high survival while using a newly adopted methodology (i.e. cages in the water column rather than the standard practice of bottom planting) for overwintering. The current study aimed to determine if the high survivorship was a result of the culture methodology or if the ME genetic stock is better adapted for overwinter survival. Field studies were performed across two consecutive winters in ME, NewYork (NY) and NewJersey (NJ, USA) to compare survivorship of two size classes of juvenile Mercenaria mercenaria using the new methodology to the standard practice of bottom planting, and to compare the survival and physiological condition of the ME stock vs. the NY and NJ stocks across a latitudinal gradient. The ME stock had greater survival than the NY and NJ stock at all sites and in both study years. Both of the ME size classes exhibited lower mortality (<12%) through the onset of winter and when temperatures were <5 degrees C suggesting greater tolerance to low temperatures, while the NY and NJ stocks experienced very high mortality (up to 87%). However, the ME stock did experience significant mortality in the spring when water temperatures were rising in NY and NJ in both years and in ME during the second study year which was abnormally warm. Mortality of all stocks coincided with a decline in carbohydrate reserves. Survival was greater in field plots as compared to the overwintering cages in NY and NJ but no significant difference was observed in ME. The results demonstrate that alternate methodologies used to successfully overwinter juvenile Mercenaria mercenaria in eastern Maine cannot be applied effectively to more southern locations. However, the results suggest that selective breeding programs may be able to develop aquaculture stocks that are better adapted to overwintering conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Future reef decalcification under a business-as-usual CO2 emission scenario
VL  - 110
IS  - 38
SP  - 15342-15347
AB  - Increasing atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) is a major threat to coral reefs, but some argue that the threat is mitigated by factors such as the variability in the response of coral calcification to acidification, differences in bleaching susceptibility, and the potential for rapid adaptation to anthropogenic warming. However the evidence for these mitigating factors tends to involve experimental studies on corals, as opposed to coral reefs, and rarely includes the influence of multiple variables (e.g., temperature and acidification) within regimes that include diurnal and seasonal variability. Here, we demonstrate that the inclusion of all these factors results in the decalcification of patch-reefs under business-as-usual scenarios and reduced, although positive, calcification under reduced-emission scenarios. Primary productivity was found to remain constant across all scenarios, despite significant bleaching and coral mortality under both future scenarios. Daylight calcification decreased and nocturnal decalcification increased sharply from the preindustrial and control conditions to the future scenarios of low (reduced emissions) and high (business-as-usual) increases in pCO2. These changes coincided with deeply negative carbonate budgets, a shift toward smaller carbonate sediments, and an increase in the abundance of sediment microbes under the business-as-usual emission scenario. Experimental coral reefs demonstrated highest net calcification rates and lowest rates of coral mortality under preindustrial conditions, suggesting that reef processes may not have been able to keep pace with the relatively minor environmental changes that have occurred during the last century. Taken together, our results have serious implications for the future of coral reefs under business-as-usual environmental changes projected for the coming decades and century.

TI  - The ability of a GCM-forced hydrological model to reproduce global discharge variability
VL  - 14
IS  - 8
SP  - 1595-1621
AB  - Data from General Circulation Models (GCMs) are often used to investigate hydrological impacts of climate change. However GCM data are known to have large biases, especially for precipitation. In this study the usefulness of GCM data for hydrological studies, with focus on discharge variability and extremes, was tested by using bias-corrected daily climate data of the 20CM3 control experiment from a selection of twelve GCMs as input to the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB. Results of these runs were compared with discharge observations of the GRDC and discharges calculated from model runs based on two meteorological datasets constructed from the observation-based CRU TS2.1 and ERA-40 reanalysis. In the first dataset the CRU TS 2.1 monthly timeseries were downscaled to daily timeseries using the ERA-40 dataset (ERA6190). This dataset served as a best guess of the past climate and was used to analyze the performance of PCR-GLOBWB. The second dataset was created from the ERA-40 timeseries bias-corrected with the CRU TS 2.1 dataset using the same bias-correction method as applied to the GCM datasets (ERACLM). Through this dataset the influence of the bias-correction method was quantified. The bias-correction was limited to monthly mean values of precipitation, potential evaporation and temperature, as our focus was on the reproduction of inter- and intra-annual variability. After bias-correction the spread in discharge results of the GCM based runs decreased and results were similar to results of the ERA-40 based runs, especially for rivers with a strong seasonal pattern. Overall the bias-correction method resulted in a slight reduction of global runoff and the method performed less well in arid and mountainous regions. However, deviations between GCM results and GRDC statistics did decrease for < span style='border-top: 1px solid #000; color: #000;'> Q </span >, Q90 and IAV. After bias-correction consistency amongst models was high for mean discharge and timing (Qpeak), but relatively low for inter-annual variability (IAV). This suggests that GCMs can be of use in global hydrological impact studies in which persistence is of less relevance (e.g. in case of flood rather than drought studies). Furthermore, the bias-correction influences mean discharges more than extremes, which has the positive consequence that changes in daily rainfall distribution and subsequent changes in discharge extremes will also be preserved when the bias-correction method is applied to future GCM datasets. However, it also shows that agreement between GCMs remains relatively small for discharge extremes. Because of the large deviations between observed and simulated discharge, in which both errors in climate forcing, model structure and to a lesser extent observations are accumulated, it is advisable not to work with absolute discharge values for the derivation of future discharge projections, but rather calculate relative changes by dividing the absolute change by the absolute discharge calculated for the control experiment.

VL  - 111

SP  - 239-248
AB  - Host genetic resistance against disease-causing pathogens can be enhanced through family-based selective breeding. At present, there is an incomplete understanding of how artificial selection of fish alters host physiology and response following pathogen exposure. We previously reported the generation of selectively-bred rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss lines with either increased resistance (ARS-Fp-R) or susceptibility (ARS-Fp-S) to bacterial cold water disease (BCWD). This study (1) determined baseline reference-range intervals for packed cell volume (PCV) and 18 plasma biochemistry analytes, and (2) examined pathophysiological changes following infection between the genetic lines. PCV and biochemistry reference-range intervals did not significantly differ between genetic lines; thus data were pooled into a single reference-range population (n = 85). ARS-Fp-R and ARS-Fp-S line fish were intraperitoneally challenged with Flavobacterium psychrophilum, and plasma was collected on Days 1, 3, 6, and 9 post-challenge. Splenic bacterial load was measured using an F. psychrophilum-specific qPCR assay. In both genetic lines, changes were observed in mean PCV, total protein, albumin, glucose, cholesterol, chloride, and calcium, falling outside the established reference intervals and significantly differing from phosphate-buffered saline challenged fish, on at least 1 d post-challenge. Mean PCV, total protein, and calcium significantly differed between ARS-Fp-R and ARS-Fp-S line fish on Day 9 post-infection, with values in the ARS-Fp-S line deviating most from the reference interval. PCV, total protein, cholesterol, and calcium negatively correlated with bacterial load. These findings identify divergent pathophysiological responses between ARS-Fp-R and ARS-Fp-S line fish following laboratory challenge that are likely associated with differential survival. © Inter-Research 2014.

TI  - Leaf phenology characteristics of narrow-leaved ASH (Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl) in clonal seed orchard
VL  - 140
IS  - 3
SP  - 117-126
AB  - Narrow-leaved ash (Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl) is a hygrophilic and predominantly thermophilic tree species that favours deep, clayed and moist soils exposed to occasional seasonal flooding. The largest complexes of narrow-leaved ash (80 %) are located along the Sava river. In the context of global climate change, it is important to know the composition and structure of genetic variability, particularly in terms of adaptive potential such as growth, survival and leaf phenology. The goal of research was to analyze the beginning of the leaf unfolding phase (L2 phase), the duration of leaf development (L2 -L6) and the impact of atmospheric parameters on the beginning of leaf unfolding, as well as to determine intrapopulation and interpopulation variability and the existence of ecotypic forms in relation to the beginning of leaf unfolding. Phenological characteristics of leaf phenology of narrow-leaved ash were monitored in the clonal seed orchard of Nova Gradiška in the course of three years of research (2012, 2014 and 2015). Monitoring included 42 clones originating from three populations (Jasenovac, Novska and Stara Gradiška). Every clone was represented with four ramets each (in total 168 plants). Leaf development was divided into six phenophases (figure 2, table 1); the analysis focused exclusively on Phase L2 (beginning of leaf unfolding). The average number of days from January 1st to the beginning of leaf unfolding was 98 days in 2012, 93 days in 2014, and 103 days in 2015 (figure 3, table 2). The average number of days required for leaf development amounted to 27 days in 2012, 26 days in 2014 and 20 days during 2015. Based on phenological results throughout the three years of study, the clones were divided into two ecotypic forms (early and late) with regard to the beginning of flushing (figure 5, table 4). The justification of division into two forms was statistically confirmed (table 3). The average values of the number of days for early ecotypic forms ranged from 90 to 101 days, and for late forms from 99 to 107 days. Along with temperature requirements as the most crucial activating factor in the manifestation of leaf phenology, researche also confirmed high correlation between cumulative values of precipitation quantity (from December 1st to the beginning of Phase L2) and the beginning of leaf unfolding in narrow-leaved ash (r=0,93). Statistically significant differences were found between all the studied clones, and so were for intrapopulation variability for the beginning of leaf unfolding; however, no statistically significant differences were found between the studied populations (table 3). Intraclonal values of the coefficient of variability (CV %) for the property of leaf unfolding decreased with the age of the experiment and on average amounted to 15.22 % at age 2 + 8 years, 13.46 % at age 2 + 10 years, and 7.8 % at age of 2 + 11 years, indicating higher stability and uniformity of phenological characteristics among the ramets as their age increased (figure 4). The affiliation of the clones to ecotypic forms did not coincide with their geographic origin, which additionally confirmed important intrapopulation variability of narrow-leaved ash.

TI  - The effect of meter-scale lateral oxygen gradients at the sediment-water interface on selected organic matter based alteration, productivity and temperature proxies
VL  - 9
IS  - 4
SP  - 1553-1570
AB  - A valid assessment of selective aerobic degradation on organic matter (OM) and its impact on OM-based proxies is vital to produce accurate environmental reconstructions. However, most studies investigating these effects suffer from inherent environmental heterogeneities. In this study, we used surface samples collected along two meter-scale transects and one longer transect in the northeastern Arabian Sea to constrain initial OM heterogeneity, in order to evaluate selective aerobic degradation on temperature, productivity and alteration indices at the sediment-water interface. All of the studied alteration indices, the higher plant alkane index, alcohol preservation index, and diol oxidation index, demonstrated that they are sensitive indicators for changes in the oxygen regime. Several export production indices, a cholesterol-based stanol/stenol index and dinoflagellate lipid- and cyst-based ratios, showed significant (more than 20%) change only over the lateral oxygen gradients. Therefore, these compounds do not exclusively reflect surface water productivity, but are significantly altered after deposition. Two of the proxies, glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether-based TEX86 sea surface temperature indices and indices based on phytol, phytane and pristane, did not show any trends related to oxygen. Nevertheless, unrealistic sea surface temperatures were obtained after application of the TEX86, TEX 86L, and TEX86H proxies. The phytol-based ratios were likely affected by the sedimentary production of pristane. Our results demonstrate the selective impact of aerobic organic matter degradation on the lipid and palynomorph composition of surface sediments along a short lateral oxygen gradient and suggest that some of the investigated proxies may be useful tracers of changing redox conditions at the sediment-water interface. © 2012 Author(s).

TI  - Population-dependent acclimatization capacity of thermal tolerance in larvae of the rocky-shore barnacle Pollicipes elegans
VL  - 134
IS  - 4
SP  - 291-302
AB  - As environmental temperatures increase and become more seasonally variable, the ability of individuals to plastically alter their physiological responses to temperature (=acclimatize) may affect the potential for species persistence. Among marine organisms, the larval stage is often the most physiologically sensitive; larvae are also often the main dispersal stage in the life history. However, studies that address the acclimatization of marine larvae are rare. We investigated whether larvae of the gooseneck barnacle Pollicipes elegans from two temperate populations, one from the Northern Hemisphere (Mexico) and one from the Southern Hemisphere (Peru), show patterns of seasonal acclimatization to temperature. We compared the effects of temperature on swimming activity, oxygen consumption, and mortality of larvae from the two populations in both warm and cold seasons. Larvae from Mexico had higher thermal tolerances when collected in the boreal summer compared to the boreal winter, while no similar indication of seasonal acclimatization was seen in larvae from Peru. The lack of acclimatization in larvae of P. elegans from Peru may be related to recent thermal history, low selection for acclimatization due to irregular patterns of seasonal temperature change during ENSO events, or to different phylogeographic histories of Northern- and Southern-hemisphere populations. © 2015 The American Microscopical Society.

TI  - Factorial optimisation of the effects of extrusion temperature profile and polymer grade on as-spun aliphatic-aromatic co-polyester fibres III: Mechanical properties
VL  - 103
IS  - 2
SP  - 139-153
AB  - The effect of extrusion temperature profile in the melt-spinning process of as-spun linear aliphatic-aromatic co-polyester (AAC) fibres upon their mechanical properties and process productivity was modelled by using factorial experimental designs. After the viscoelastic and morphology characteristics of the polymer were considered using Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Melt Flow Index (MFI), the rheological data were used to determine the enhanced melt-spinning temperature of the six heating zones in the process. Tensile strength, elongation at break, modulus and fibre productivity (g/min) of the melt-spinning process have been quantitatively assessed as responses to polymer grades and extrusion zone temperature. The optimisation of mechanical properties and productivity helps in understanding and controlling the most desired properties in the produced fibre. It has been noted that the die head temperature (spinning temperature), the polymer grade and their interaction are the most significant factors affecting the mechanical properties. Analysis of the fibre productivity shows that the polymer grade and its interaction with the die head temperature is significant in terms of influencing the output of the melt-spinning process, which could be related to the polymer molecular weight and polymer structure. There is an interaction between polymer grade and feeding zone temperature which is related to the material supply action in the feeding zone. The friction between the screw and the material is affected by heating action, which affects the moisture content and the molten material rheology. By adjusting the extrusion temperature profile and selecting the more applicable spin-able polymer grade through a statistical forecasting model, the combination of the cost related to material grade and processing cost controls the fibre production cost. The fibre made of low MFI grade has better structure and mechanical properties than that made of the higher MFI grade, and the former will be preferred for future work. With previous work related to the effects of extrusion temperature profile on the fibre structure, the present paper will help in developing the production process of biodegradable linear AAC fibres. © 2012 Copyright The Textile Institute.

TI  - A dynamic eco-evolutionary model predicts slow response of alpine plants to climate warming
VL  - 8
AB  - Withstanding extinction while facing rapid climate change depends on a species' ability to track its ecological niche or to evolve a new one. Current methods that predict climate-driven species' range shifts use ecological modelling without eco-evolutionary dynamics. Here we present an eco-evolutionary forecasting framework that combines niche modelling with individual-based demographic and genetic simulations. Applying our approach to four endemic perennial plant species of the Austrian Alps, we show that accounting for eco-evolutionary dynamics when predicting species' responses to climate change is crucial. Perennial species persist in unsuitable habitats longer than predicted by niche modelling, causing delayed range losses; however, their evolutionary responses are constrained because long-lived adults produce increasingly maladapted offspring. Decreasing population size due to maladaptation occurs faster than the contraction of the species range, especially for the most abundant species. Monitoring of species' local abundance rather than their range may likely better inform on species' extinction risks under climate change. © 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Clonal variation in reproductive response to temperature by a potential bulking control agent, Lecane inermis (Rotifera)
VL  - 64
IS  - 2
SP  - 403-408
AB  - The novel idea of using rotifers Lecane inermis (Rotifera, Monogononta) as a tool to overcome activated sludge bulking generates an on-going need to study rotifer biology. The results of biological research on rotifers can serve to improve the method so that it can be most effective when applied in treatment plants. The aim of this study was to test the effect of temperature on four selected rotifer clones originating from different treatment plants. The rate of population development from a single individual (parthenogenetic female) during a 10-day experiment was measured at three temperatures: 8, 15 and 20 degrees C. The temperatures used reflect the annual temperature distribution in the majority of municipal wastewater treatment plants in the temperate zone. The growth rate coefficient (r) and doubling time (tD) were calculated for each clone. Under the most favourable conditions (20 degrees C), r values varied between 0.41 and 0.47 d and doubling time between 1.5 and 1.7 d. At a temperature of 15 degrees C, the doubling time was approximately two times longer (2.5-3.4 d). The strongest intraspecific variations were observed at the lowest temperature of 8 degrees C. At this temperature, one of the clones almost failed to proliferate, and another exhibited a doubling time of 7.9 d. The doubling times were a few times greater for the remaining two clones (60 d for Lk1, 33.3 d for Lk4). These results could be very useful in predicting the chances that the rotifers would survive in a biological reactor in a wastewater treatment plant at the temperatures used in these reactors.

AB  - The objective of this study was to manipulate ventilation rate to characterize interactions between stocks of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) and ventilation setting on varroa mite (Varroa destructor Anderson and Trueman) mortality in honey bee colonies kept indoors over winter. The first experiment used colonies established from stock selected locally for wintering performance under exposure to varroa (n=6) and unselected bees (n=6) to assess mite and bee mortality and levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2) in the bee cluster when kept under a simulated winter condition at 5°C. The second experiment, used colonies from selected bees (n=10) and unselected bees (n=12) that were exposed to either standard ventilation (14.4 liter/min per hive) or restricted ventilation (0.24 liter/min per hive, in a Plexiglas ventilation chamber) during a 16-d treatment period to assess the influence of restricted air flow on winter mortality rates of varroa mites and honey bees. Experiment 2 was repeated in early, mid-, and late winter. The first experiment showed that under unrestricted ventilation with CO2 concentrations averaging <2% there was no correlation between CO2 and varroa mite mortality when colonies were placed under low temperature. CO2 was negatively correlated with O2 in the bee cluster in both experiments. When ventilation was restricted, mean CO2 level (3.82±0.31%, range 0.43-8.44%) increased by 200% relative to standard ventilation (1.29±0.31%; range 0.09-5.26%) within the 16-d treatment period. The overall mite mortality rates and the reduction in mean abundance of varroa mite over time was greater under restricted ventilation (37±4.2%) than under standard ventilation (23±4.2%) but not affected by stock of bees during the treatment period. Selected bees showed overall greater mite mortality relative to unselected bees in both experiments. Restricting ventilation increased mite mortality, but did not affect worker bee mortality relative to that for colonies under standard ventilation. Restricted ventilation did not affect the overall level of Nosema compared with the control. However, there was an interaction between stock, season, and time of the trial. Unselected stock showed an increase in Nosema over time in the late winter trial that did not occur in the selected stock. In conclusion, these findings suggested that restricted ventilation has potential to suppress varroa mite in overwintering honey bee colonies via a low-cost and environmentally friendly measure. © The Authors 2015.

AB  - Climate change in Australia is expected to influence crop growing conditions through direct increases in elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) and average temperature, and through increases in the variability of climate, with potential to increase the occurrence of abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, waterlogging, and salinity. Associated effects of climate change and higher CO2 concentrations include impacts on the water-use efficiency of dryland and irrigated crop production, and potential effects on biosecurity, production, and quality of product via impacts on endemic and introduced pests and diseases, and tolerance to these challenges. Direct adaptation to these changes can occur through changes in crop, farm, and value-chain management and via economically driven, geographic shifts where different production systems operate. Within specific crops, a longer term adaptation is the breeding of new varieties that have an improved performance in 'future' growing conditions compared with existing varieties. In crops, breeding is an appropriate adaptation response where it complements management changes, or when the required management changes are too expensive or impractical. Breeding requires the assessment of genetic diversity for adaptation, and the selection and recombining of genetic resources into new varieties for production systems for projected future climate and atmospheric conditions. As in the past, an essential priority entering into a 'climate-changed' era will be breeding for resistance or tolerance to the effects of existing and new pests and diseases. Hence, research on the potential incidence and intensity of biotic stresses, and the opportunities for breeding solutions, is essential to prioritise investment, as the consequences could be catastrophic. The values of breeding activities to adapt to the five major abiotic effects of climate change (heat, drought, waterlogging, salinity, and elevated CO2) are more difficult to rank, and vary with species and production area, with impacts on both yield and quality of product. Although there is a high likelihood of future increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and temperatures across Australia, there is uncertainty about the direction and magnitude of rainfall change, particularly in the northern farming regions. Consequently, the clearest opportunities for 'in-situ' genetic gains for abiotic stresses are in developing better adaptation to higher temperatures (e.g. control of phenological stage durations, and tolerance to stress) and, for C3 species, in exploiting the (relatively small) fertilisation effects of elevated CO2. For most cultivated plant species, it remains to be demonstrated how much genetic variation exists for these traits and what value can be delivered via commercial varieties. Biotechnology-based breeding technologies (marker-assisted breeding and genetic modification) will be essential to accelerate genetic gain, but their application requires additional investment in the understanding, genetic characterisation, and phenotyping of complex adaptive traits for climate-change conditions. © 2012 CSIRO.

VL  - 4

SP  - 2360-2374
AB  - Intraspecific assisted migration (ISAM) through seed transfer during artificial forest regeneration has been suggested as an adaptation strategy to enhance forest resilience and productivity under future climate. In this study, we assessed the risks and benefits of ISAM in white spruce based on long-term and multilocation, rangewide provenance test data. Our results indicate that the adaptive capacity and growth potential of white spruce varied considerably among 245 range-wide provenances sampled across North America; however, the results revealed that local populations could be outperformed by nonlocal ones. Provenances originating from south-central Ontario and southwestern Québec, Canada, close to the southern edge of the species' natural distribution, demonstrated superior growth in more northerly environments compared with local populations and performed much better than populations from western Canada and Alaska, United States. During the 19-28 years between planting and measurement, the southern provenances have not been more susceptible to freezing damage compared with local populations, indicating they have the potential to be used now for the reforestation of more northerly planting sites; based on changing temperature, these seed sources potentially could maintain or increase white spruce productivity at or above historical levels at northern sites. A universal response function (URF), which uses climatic variables to predict provenance performance across field trials, indicated a relatively weak relationship between provenance performance and the climate at provenance origin. Consequently, the URF from this study did not provide information useful to ISAM. The ecological and economic importance of conserving white spruce genetic resources in south-central Ontario and southwestern Québec for use in ISAM is discussed. © 2014 The Authors.

VL  - 32

AB  - An investigation was conducted of the combined effect of salinity and temperature on growth, survival, and biomass productivity of postlarval and early juvenile pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus duorarum (Burkenroad 1939) produced from a single spawning event. The study used a factorial block design consisting of three salinity treatments (15, 35, and 55), each replicated, within three temperature treatment (22°C, 27°C, and 32°C) water baths. The study was divided into two phases: postlarval (first 28 days) and early juvenile (second 28 days). Growth was assessed every 7 days throughout the experiment by measuring carapace length (CL) and wet weight (WWT) of 15 randomly selected shrimp from each temperature/salinity replicate tank. After the first study phase, survival was assessed and experimental aquaria were reset with 30 randomly selected shrimp from the same temperature-salinity replicates. Survival was assessed again at the end of the early juvenile phase. The effect of treatments was evaluated by average growth (average finalWWT), survival, and average final biomass production. Exponential growth rates (CL andWWT) and temperature physiological coefficients (Q10) were also computed. Effects of temperature and salinity on growth and survival were variable, and no significant interaction among the treatment factors was observed. Biomass production increased consistently with temperature (postlarval, P > 0.0001; early juvenile, P < 0.0001) and decreased at the highest salinity (55; postlarval, P = 0.0140; early juvenile, P < 0.0001). Significant reductions in all performance outcomes except postlarval growth (P > 0.05) were observed at the high salinity of 55. The response of growth to salinity was not significant until the early juvenile treatment phase, whereas the effect of temperature on growth was significant during both phases. Hypersalinity (salinity, 55) had a detrimental effect on performance outcomes; however, performance outcomes at salinities of 15 and 35 were comparable. These results have implications for the natural productivity of pink shrimp in Florida Bay, where conditions are often hypersaline.

SP  - 2058-2071
AB  - A comparative study was conducted to evaluate precision and accuracy in controlling the temperature dependence of encapsulated microbial time–temperature integrators (TTIs) developed using two different emulsification techniques. Weissela cibaria CIFP 009 cells, immobilized within 2% Na-alginate gel microbeads using homogenization (5,000, 7,000, and 10,000 rpm) and Shirasu porous glass (SPG) membrane technologies (10 μm), were applied to microbial TTIs. The prepared micobeads were characterized with respect to their size, size distribution, shape and morphology, entrapment efficiency, and bead production yield. Additionally, fermentation process parameters including growth rate were investigated. The TTI responses (changes in pH and titratable acidity (TA)) were evaluated as a function of temperature (20°C, 25°C, and 30°C). In comparison with conventional methods, SPG membrane technology was able not only to produce highly uniform, small-sized beads with the narrowest size distribution, but also the bead production yield was found to be nearly 3.0 to 4.5 times higher. However, among the TTIs produced using the homogenization technique, poor linearity (R2) in terms of TA was observed for the 5,000 and 7,000 rpm treatments. Consequently, microbeads produced by the SPG membrane and by homogenization at 10,000 rpm were selected for adjusting the temperature dependence. The Eavalues of TTIs containing 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g microbeads, prepared by SPG membrane and conventional methods, were estimated to be 86.0, 83.5, and 76.6 kJ/mol, and 85.5, 73.5, and 62.2 kJ/mol, respectively. Therefore, microbial TTIs developed using SPG membrane technology are much more efficient in controlling temperature dependence. © 2015 by The Korean Society for Microbiology and Biotechnology.

TI  - Polymerization of 1,3-butadiene catalyzed by a thermal robust, high selective and active iron catalyst: An applicable recipe for producing syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene
VL  - 98
SP  - 136-142
AB  - A novel class of organic phosphates were synthesized and applied in iron catalyst as additive for 1,2-syndiotactic polymerization of 1,3-butadiene in combination with aluminum alkyls (Ali-Bu3 or AlEt3) in hexane at industrial favorable 50-100 degrees C. Remarkable enhanced polymer productivity (up to 486 kg (polymer)/mol(Fe)h) and excellent 1,2-syndiotactic regularity have been achieved at 50-100 degrees C in all examing cases. All the polymers obtained under various polymerization conditions possess prevailingly 1,2 inserted homo-sequences up to 94.7% 1,2-selectivity in syndiotactic arrangements (up to 94.4%, denoted by rrrr) with melting point ranging from 170 to 182 degrees C. The current in-situ generated catalyst systems feature high productivity, selectivity, robustness (e.g. high thermal stability, good tolerance to poisons and environmentally friendly hexane as solution polymerization medium) and single-site behaviour. These all extend the practical usefulness of these versatile phosphates assisted catalyst, and they are promising candidates to act as ancillary additive for industrial applicable 1,2-syndiotactic polymerization of 1,3-butadiene.

TI  - Evidence of local adaptation in westslope cutthroat trout
VL  - 141

SP  - 872-880
AB  - An understanding of the process of local adaptation would allow managers to better protect and conserve species. Many salmonids are in need of such efforts, and because they often persist in differing, isolated environments, they are useful organisms for studying local adaptation. In addition, the temperature sensitivity of salmonids provides a likely target for natural selection. We studied thermal adaptation in four wild populations and one hatchery stock of westslope cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi. The mean summer temperatures of source streams ranged from 6.7°C to 11.2°C. Embryos were collected from the wild, and embryonic development, embryonic survival, and juvenile growth were determined. A significant relationship between median embryonic survival and source stream temperature was detected. Based on a rank test, populations from colder streams had a greater decline in median embryonic survival at warm temperatures than populations from warmer streams. Embryonic development and juvenile growth did not appear to be influenced by source. These findings suggest that populations are thermally adapted to their source streams and this should be considered by managers. However, further study is necessary to sort out the potential confounding factors, whether genetic or epigenetic. © American Fisheries Society 2012.

AB  - Concerns about climate change and other issues mostly related to the reduction of fossil fuel usage have increased the demand for renewable energy sources. The possibility of using lignocellulosic biomass for energy generation is gaining interest in many countries worldwide. The current paper presents the analysis of physicochemical characteristics of nine lignocellulosic biomasses: five types of eucalyptus wood chips, sugar cane bagasse, elephant grass, bamboo, and coconut husk. Selection of a thermal conversion technology depends on the knowledge of important biomass characteristics in relation to thermal conversion: density and productivity, proximate and ultimate analysis, heating value, ash and polysaccharides composition, and thermogravimetric analysis. With regard to the annual energy potential and density, it was suggested that Eucalyptus urophylla (Flores IP) × E. urophylla (Timor) and bamboo have the greatest potential for energy application, which reduces transport and storage costs. Moreover, the eucalyptus has desirable characteristics in thermal conversion processes: low ash content that results in lesser damage to the equipment and low content of sulfur and nitrogen that leads to better environmental performance and product quality. The obtained information could be used as a basis for a more comprehensive database of biomass properties that will help to evaluate various biomasses with respect to the renewable energy potential. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The designs of six sigma ideas can impel the product design to reach the design processes of six sigma goals during researching and developing. It will design program the construction, in the procedure of DMADV, the products will be defined (Define), the requirements are weighed (Measure), specification analysis (Analyze), the detail design (Design) and design proving (Verify). Because design and must correlate with customer's demand in products six standard deviations. The specification will certainly include the reliability goal. So six sigma design, combine reliability design complete so as to attain. However, reliability design until deterministic analyze, take, prolong to test, can prove, reach goal (make minimum failure rate) in the past Like this, may enable and research and develop time long, cost increase. In this Research probe into electronic product analyze with deterministic temperature specified specification (Nominal Specification) that customer required. And, stipulate the preliminary design temperature specification. Then applied the inverse simulation method, imitate temperature specification that stipulate already in order to climate temperature that use actually. To confirm the temperature of high survival rate, can confirm the specification of detail design. Then while the detail design, dispose the goal in accordance with the reliability, select the part which accords with the temperature specification for use. During this period, set up inverse Fault Tree Analysis. Regard it as the virtue sensor device to use climate temperature actually, to the temperature simulation survival rate selecting the part for using. If lower than 1 in survival rating, reveal the part is selected for use incorrectly, i.e. the system is unsafe. Then the revision part temperature specification, until survival rate is 1. It will guarantee the systematic function of the products is safe, it is difficult to failure happened (Failure Free). This research is applied to the case study with the design of electronics instrument of the motorcycle, ones that proved and utilized inverse method are feasible and advantages of designing change reducibly, shorten the designing time.

TI  - Enchytraeids in a changing climate: A mini-review
VL  - 53
IS  - 3
SP  - 161-167
AB  - The climate is undergoing rapid changes with rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, increasing temperatures and changes in the hydrological regimes resulting in more frequent and intense drought periods. These three climate change factors will, separately and in combination, affect the biotic and abiotic components of soil communities. This paper reviews the impact of climate change on field communities of enchytraeids with special emphasis on Cognettia sphagnetorum because most relevant studies have involved this species. C. sphagnetorum prefers cold and wet environments and several studies suggest that reductions of soil moisture may have dramatic consequences for C. sphagnetorum and other enchytraeid species. Effects of changing temperatures are less clear partly because thermal conditions influence soil moisture, which complicate the predictions of the outcome from such changes. The predicted increasing annual mean temperature may be stimulating and expand the season for growth and reproduction of enchytraeids; on the other hand, an increased frequency of extreme weather events, with heat waves during summer and bare soil freezes during autumn and spring, may occasionally cause severe mortality. Stimulating effects of increased atmospheric CO2 have been observed, perhaps due to increased food availability via root and litter production. However, effects of CO2 are also influenced by moisture and temperature. Generally, there is a lack of research looking into the complicated interactions between various climate change factors, and little is known about the potential of enchytraeids to adapt to a changing climate. Existing data suggest that C. sphagnetorum is not capable of adapting to a drier climate, thus, a decline in abundance and distribution of this species is possible. Since enchytraeids are of ecological significance in some types of habitats, a reduction may result in serious disruption in the functioning of these decomposer communities. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

TI  - The effect of different land use patterns on soil properties in alpine areas of eastern Qilian Mountains
VL  - 32
IS  - 2
SP  - 0548-0556
AB  - The patterns of using land are comprehensive reflection of human being activities on soil, and it is the main reason that provoking the change of global environment and an essential part of the constantly changing global environment as well. Land use patterns have the most profound and direct influence on natural and ecological processes, which including the influence on soil nutrient, soil moisture, soil erosion and land productivity. The present work was performed in the eastern Qilian Mountains, which is characterized by high altitude, important daily temperature variations with sparse air, strong radiation and low temperature. And it belongs to the typical alpine areas characterized by weak and sensitive environment. Therefore, the mainly objectives of this study reported herein was focused on the effect of different land use patterns on soil properties in alpine areas of eastern Qilian Mountains, and so to improve the region's rational land utilization and ecological restoration. In this research, four land use patterns were selected in the experimental area, which are nature grassland, naturally restored abandoned cropland, slope cropland and sown grassland. The results showed that different patterns of using land in the alpine region leaded to significant difference on soil property. 1 The following part is the soil moisture content under different land use patterns, the orders are from more to less: nature grassland, sown grassland, naturally restored abandoned cropland, and slope cropland; 2 As to the soil bulk density, naturally restored abandoned cropland was the highest, followed by sown grassland, the third was slope cropland, and the lowest was nature grassland; 3 The soil compaction was in the order of slope cropland > sown grassland >naturally restored abandoned cropland > nature grassland; 4 the total porosity of the four pattern used land that can be organized in the order from high to low can be described as follows, nature grassland > sown grassland > naturally restored abandoned cropland > slope cropland. The organic matter content of natural grassland was 116. 438 g/ kg, significantly higher than the other land use patterns(P<0. 05)and that of naturally grass-restored cropland was 28. 541 g/ kg, which was significantly lower than the other patterns(P<0. 05). The natural grassland had the highest total N content and available nutrients of N, P and K, while slope cropland had the maximum contents of total P, K. under different land use patterns. The soil property changes in the study area which indicates that natural grassland had a better function in helping maintain the good soil physical and chemical properties, and also its soil characteristics were distinctly different from those of slope cropland and sown grassland which present the worse soil physical properties and lower nutrients. Restored cropland that had been abandoned 4 years only had soil compaction. Meanwhile, the N content had improved during those days. However, the other properties were still poor. These phenomena show that the soil ecosystem which has been serious damaged is quite difficult to get recovery in alpine areas, and it needs a much longer time to recover.

TI  - An evaluation of thinning to improve habitat for capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus)
VL  - 314
SP  - 94-103
AB  - In Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forests the composition of the ground flora can be affected by the amount of light reaching the forest floor, influencing the balance between the three common ericaceous shrubs bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and heather (Calluna vulgaris). A pinewood ground flora with more than 20% bilberry cover is considered good habitat for capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus), a large forest grouse of considerable conservation interest throughout Europe. Old, semi-natural Scots pine woodland is considered its prime habitat in Scotland, although this is limited in area compared to twentieth century planted forests. Action to manipulate environmental conditions within Scots pine plantations by altering light levels to favour bilberry through thinning and felling could potentially increase greatly the area of available capercaillie habitat in Scotland. We implemented a five year study to look at bilberry response to variable intensity thinning in two Scots pine plantations, where thinning followed management guidance for capercaillie available at the time. Bilberry was present in both forests but a positive response to thinning was not universal; although at both sites bilberry cover increased significantly over five years with levels >20% cover reached, this could only be attributed to the thinning treatment at one of the sites. A treatment of small patch clearfelling did not lead to losses in bilberry. Management guidance published after the trial had begun, identified the appropriate intensity of thinning for enhancing bilberry cover at our study sites, indicated by the relative increase of bilberry in the plots where the prescription had been followed. Although there was no significant treatment effect by year five, 42% average bilberry cover was reached at one site tested. However the format of this guidance, a range of stem density-tree height combinations, was difficult to apply using typical forest management data and we explore redefining the guidance as a post thinning stand basal area range. We suggest >22 to <31 m(2) ha(-1) basal area would be appropriate in Scots pine plantations established at normal spacing and subject to the commonest form of selective thinning regime. This range in basal area can be achieved without conflicting with management for timber production. Our results also support small patch clearfelling as a method of diversifying plantation age structure which is compatible with maintaining capercaillie brood habitat.

TI  - Mortality risk attributable to high and low ambient temperature: A multicountry observational study
VL  - 386
IS  - 9991
SP  - 369-375
AB  - Background Although studies have provided estimates of premature deaths attributable to either heat or cold in selected countries, none has so far offered a systematic assessment across the whole temperature range in populations exposed to different climates. We aimed to quantify the total mortality burden attributable to non-optimum ambient temperature, and the relative contributions from heat and cold and from moderate and extreme temperatures. Methods We collected data for 384 locations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, UK, and USA. We fitted a standard time-series Poisson model for each location, controlling for trends and day of the week. We estimated temperature-mortality associations with a distributed lag non-linear model with 21 days of lag, and then pooled them in a multivariate metaregression that included country indicators and temperature average and range. We calculated attributable deaths for heat and cold, defined as temperatures above and below the optimum temperature, which corresponded to the point of minimum mortality, and for moderate and extreme temperatures, defined using cutoffs at the 2·5th and 97·5th temperature percentiles. Findings We analysed 74 225 200 deaths in various periods between 1985 and 2012. In total, 7·71% (95% empirical CI 7·43-7·91) of mortality was attributable to non-optimum temperature in the selected countries within the study period, with substantial differences between countries, ranging from 3·37% (3·06 to 3·63) in Thailand to 11·00% (9·29 to 12·47) in China. The temperature percentile of minimum mortality varied from roughly the 60th percentile in tropical areas to about the 80-90th percentile in temperate regions. More temperature-attributable deaths were caused by cold (7·29%, 7·02-7·49) than by heat (0·42%, 0·39-0·44). Extreme cold and hot temperatures were responsible for 0·86% (0·84-0·87) of total mortality. Interpretation Most of the temperature-related mortality burden was attributable to the contribution of cold. The effect of days of extreme temperature was substantially less than that attributable to milder but non-optimum weather. This evidence has important implications for the planning of public-health interventions to minimise the health consequences of adverse temperatures, and for predictions of future effect in climate-change scenarios.

TI  - No evidence for thermal transgenerational plasticity in metabolism when minimizing the potential for confounding effects
VL  - 284
IS  - 1846
AB  - Environmental change may cause phenotypic changes that are inherited across generations through transgenerational plasticity (TGP). If TGP is adaptive, offspring fitness increases with an increasing match between parent and offspring environment. Here we test for adaptive TGP in somatic growth and metabolic rate in response to temperature in the clonal zooplankton Daphnia pulex. Animals of the first focal generation experienced thermal transgenerational ‘mismatch’ (parental and offspring temperatures differed), whereas conditions of the next two generations matched the (grand)maternal thermal conditions. Adjustments of metabolic rate occurred during the lifetime of the first generation (i.e. within-generation plasticity). However, no further change was observed during the subsequent two generations, as would be expected under TGP. Furthermore, we observed no tendency for increased juvenile somatic growth (a trait highly correlated with fitness in Daphnia) over the three generations when reared at new temperatures. These results are inconsistent with existing studies of thermal TGP, and we describe how previous experimental designs may have confounded TGP with within-generation plasticity and selective mortality. We suggest that the current evidence for thermal TGP is weak. To increase our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary role of TGP, future studies should more carefully identify possible confounding factors. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

TI  - Two spatial scales in a bleaching event: Corals from the mildest and the most extreme thermal environments escape mortality
VL  - 58
IS  - 5
SP  - 1531-1545
AB  - In summer 2010, a bleaching event decimated the abundant reef flat coral Stylophora pistillata in some areas of the central Red Sea, where a series of coral reefs 100-300 m wide by several kilometers long extends from the coastline to about 20 km offshore. Mortality of corals along the exposed and protected sides of inner (inshore) and mid and outer (offshore) reefs and in situ and satellite sea surface temperatures (SSTs) revealed that the variability in the mortality event corresponded to two spatial scales of temperature variability: 300 m across the reef flat and 20 km across a series of reefs. However, the relationship between coral mortality and habitat thermal severity was opposite at the two scales. SSTs in summer 2010 were similar or increased modestly (0.5uC) in the outer and mid reefs relative to 2009. In the inner reef, 2010 temperatures were 1.4uC above the 2009 seasonal maximum for several weeks. We detected little or no coral mortality in mid and outer reefs. In the inner reef, mortality depended on exposure. Within the inner reef, mortality was modest on the protected (shoreward) side, the most severe thermal environment, with highest overall mean and maximum temperatures. In contrast, acute mortality was observed in the exposed (seaward) side, where temperature fluctuations and upper water temperature values were relatively less extreme. Refuges to thermally induced coral bleaching may include sites where extreme, high-frequency thermal variability may select for coral holobionts preadapted to, and physiologically condition corals to withstand, regional increases in water temperature. © 2013, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.

TI  - Salmonella in table eggs from farm to retail - When is cooling required?
VL  - 47
SP  - 254-263
AB  - Storage time and temperature are known to be important factors in determining Salmonella growth in table eggs. It is assumed that growth of Salmonella within eggs starts when the egg yolk membrane breaks down, allowing Salmonella to enter and grow. The length of time for which the yolk membrane remains intact is time and temperature dependent. The present study addresses the question whether the current legal requirement in Germany to cool table eggs marketed 18 days after laying needs to be updated. Detailed data on the current storage and transport conditions in Germany were collected. On the basis of these data, typical combinations of temperature and time were selected. For these different time-temperature scenarios, the consequences regarding the probability of growth of Salmonella Enteritidis inside the eggs were calculated. A probabilistic model consisting of nine modules reflecting storage/transport stages from farm to retail in Germany was used to calculate whether the yolk membrane remains intact during the individual steps. Growth of Salmonella was simulated without cooling (room temperature) as well as with two different cooling scenarios (4-6 degrees C and 8-12 degrees C), which are temperature ranges used in Germany by various retailers. Simulations of these scenarios resulted in relative low numbers of eggs with Salmonella growth until purchase (89 out of 50,000 eggs in the uncooled scenario, 10 out of 50,000 eggs stored at 8-12 degrees C and 5 out of 50,000 eggs stored at 4-6 degrees C). These results show that for an average egg trading time of 7.5 days, as was observed for Germany, the probability for the consumer to purchase eggs where no Salmonella growth has started and yolk membrane integrity still exists is high. However, the model supports the necessity for egg cooling after the yolk membrane integrity time is exhausted. Furthermore, the model shows clearly that cooling will extend the time period before the egg yolk membrane breaks down. According to our results, the requirement to cool eggs from the 18th day onwards after laying, as required by legislation in Germany, is reasonable, as it matches the time point of the yolk membrane breakdown for the average egg kept at 18-20 degrees C. Therefore, continuation of this regulation is strongly supported. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Characterization of bottom hydrodynamic conditions on the central western Portuguese continental shelf based on benthic foraminifera and sedimentary parameters
VL  - 109
SP  - 52-68
AB  - Dead benthic foraminiferal assemblages from the central western Portuguese continental shelf have been studied to identify the prevalent oceanographic processes in the study area. Sediment samples collected at 46 stations along transepts perpendicular to the coastal line, between the latitudes of 38-40 degrees N and 17-190 m water depth, in April/May 2008, were analysed for selected physicochemical parameters (temperature, redox potential), grain size, organic matter content, and benthic foraminifera. Statistical analysis identified two main groups of stations, the Inshore/Offshore groups, which are not only defined by their geographical positions, but easily distinguishable by different hydrodynamic conditions. The Offshore Group is mainly represented by deeper stations characterized by a higher percentage of fines and TOM, negative values of redox potential and by the higher foraminiferal density and species diversity than the Inshore one. Foraminiferal assemblages of the Offshore Group are dominated/represented by species (such as Cassidulina laevigata/Cassidulina carinata, Bolivina spathulata, Bolivina ordinaria, Globo-cassidulina minuta, Bulimina elongata/Bulimina gibba and Bulimina marginata) common in areas with significant concentrations of organic matter. The benthic foraminiferal assemblages of the Inshore Group are instead characterized by epifaunal species such as Lobatula lobatula, Cibicides ungerianus, Planorbulina mediterranensis, Gavelinopsis praegeri and Quinqueloculina seminula. Both the sedimentary and foraminiferal results suggest that this group of stations is subjected to stronger bottom hydrodynamic conditions, caused by waves and swell activity and coastal currents, than the Offshore Group. Bray-Curtis similarity comparison between the stations of both groups reveals that the Offshore Group has a higher internal similarity than the Inshore Group. These differences seem to stem from topographic forcing, from the presence of rocky outcrops, from canyons and capes, from the distribution of rivers and from the magnitude of their discharges, which determine specific hydrodynamic features and differences in the sedimentary deposits and biological productivity. The influence of the Tagus river (supply of fresh water, detritus and organic matter from continental sources), the presence of canyons and capes, which leave the most important imprint on the study area, are marked by changes in the foraminiferal assemblages both in the Inshore and Offshore groups.

To assess the abilities of some current models to capture these differences, we report here the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations examining the association of acetate-methylammonium and methane-methane pairs at 11 different temperatures from -12.5 to 112.5 °C. Simulations were performed using two popular water models (TIP3P and TIP5P), with a total simulation time of 22 μs. With both water models, we find that the acetate-methylammonium salt-bridge interaction is significantly more stabilized by high temperatures (e.g., over the range 25 to 100 °C) than is the methane-methane hydrophobic interaction. At low temperatures however, the two models exhibit quite different behavior, with the TIP5P model predicting little change in the relative stabilities of the two types of interaction in the range -12.5 to 50 °C; this surprising result has potential implications for understanding adaptation to life in psychrophilic organisms. Fitting the ΔG data to the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation allows the ΔH, ΔS, and ΔCp of interaction to be obtained, thereby yielding a complete thermodynamic characterization of the different types of interaction in the temperature range 0 to 100 °C: despite significant quantitative differences, both water models correctly capture the opposite signs of the ΔCp of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Finally, we show that at high temperatures a Poisson-based continuum solvation model provides good agreement with the explicit-solvent MD results, but only when the atomic radii used in the continuum calculations are scaled with temperature. © 2010 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The thermal environment of ectotherms affects every aspect of their life history and many ectotherms must keep their body near an optimal temperature range through some form of thermoregulation. Because of the small size of geckos in the genus Sphaerodactylus, they are highly susceptible to overheating and desiccation. Also, because of their small size, they are assumed to conform quickly to environmental temperatures, leaving them no option but to exploit microhabitats with temperatures as close as possible to their optimal range. We used a thermal gradient to find the preferred temperature of S. macrolepis in the lab and thermal imaging and data loggers in the field to explore their thermal ecology and microhabitat selection. Our data suggest that all of the microhabitats available within our study sites are outside of the preferred temperature range of S. macrolepis during the hottest parts of the day. The layer of leaf litter closest to the ground had the highest humidity and lowest, most stable temperatures. However, geckos ranged into a nearby grassy field where temperatures and humidity were sub-optimal. Although these geckos quickly conform to the temperature of their microhabitat, they appear to adjust activity periods to exploit suitable environmental temperatures when they are available. © 2014.

VL  - 132
SP  - 366-371
AB  - This study evaluated the effect of temperature (20 and 25 degrees C) on reproduction, oxidative stress, and copper (Cu) toxicity in Daphnia magna across three generations (F0, F1, and F2). Exposing D. magna to elevated temperature significantly decreased the number of offspring per female per day, the time to first brood, and body length compared to exposure to the optimal temperature (p < 0.05). In addition, elevated temperature induced a significantly higher production of reactive oxygen species and lipid per oxidation (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that D. magna likely responded to thermal stress by investing more energy into defense mechanisms, rather than growth and reproduction. In addition, oxidative stress at the elevated temperature gradually increased with each generation, possibly owing to the reduced fitness of the offspring. Exposing D. magna to 25 degrees C (EC50=34 +/- 3 mu g L-1) substantially increased the median effective concentration of Cu in all generations compared to exposure to 20 degrees C (EC50=25 +/- 3 mu g L-1), indicating a decrease in acute toxicity at elevated temperature. However, elevated temperature significantly increased the oxidative stress induced by a sublethal concentration of Cu (10 mu g L-1). The interaction between elevated temperature and Cu exposure appears to be synergistic; however, this needs to be confirmed using multiple generations in a long-term experiment (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

VL  - 44
IS  - 3
SP  - 549-560
AB  - A major industrial problem in high-temperature liquid reaction systems is the attack of furnace components by chemically aggressive molten reactants. Freeze-lining technologies involving the deliberate formation of controlled frozen deposits are increasingly being applied to extend the range of liquid bath compositions and process temperatures that can be used; this has resulted in significant increases in process performance and productivity. It has been widely assumed that the interface between the stationary frozen layer and the agitated molten bath at steady state consists of the primary phase, which stays in contact with the bulk liquid at the liquidus temperature, T liquidus. It has been shown in the current laboratory-based studies through the use of a cold finger technique that, at steady state and in selected ranges of process conditions and bath compositions, the phase assemblage present at the deposit/liquid interface is not that of the primary phase alone. The microstructural observations clearly demonstrate that the temperature of the deposit/liquid bath interface, T f, can be lower than the liquidus temperature of the bulk liquid, T liquidus. These observations point to a significant change in the mechanism and behavior of the systems. To explain this phenomenon, it is proposed that the steady-state thickness of freeze linings is not the result of equilibrium freezing but rather represents a state of dynamic equilibrium that is critically dependent on the relative rates of crystallization, mass, and heat transfer processes, occurring close to and at the deposit interface. The mechanisms taking place in the boundary liquid layer involve both partial crystallization/remelting and continuous removal of solids. This finding has important implications for the design of the high-temperature industrial reactors and selection of ranges of melt chemistries and conditions that can be used. This finding means that temperatures below the liquidus can be selected for some processes, resulting potentially in significant savings of energy and increases in throughput of pyrometallurgical reactors. The findings are generic and are not limited to the specific chemical systems reported in the article. © 2013 The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society and ASM International.

TI  - Inducing stable α + β microstructures during selective laser melting of Ti-6Al-4V using intensified intrinsic heat treatments
VL  - 10
IS  - 3
AB  - Selective laser melting is a promising powder-bed-based additive manufacturing technique for titanium alloys: near net-shaped metallic components can be produced with high resource-efficiency and cost savings. For the most commercialized titanium alloy, namely Ti-6Al-4V, the complicated thermal profile of selective laser melting manufacturing (sharp cycles of steep heating and cooling rates) usually hinders manufacturing of components in a one-step process owing to the formation of brittle martensitic microstructures unsuitable for structural applications. In this work, an intensified intrinsic heat treatment is applied during selective laser melting of Ti-6Al-4V powder using a scanning strategy that combines porosity-optimized processing with a very tight hatch distance. Extensive martensite decomposition providing a uniform, fine lamellar α + β microstructure is obtained along the building direction. Moreover, structural evidence of the formation of the intermetallic α2-Ti3Al phase is provided. Variations in the lattice parameter of β serve as an indicator of the microstructural degree of stabilization. Interconnected 3D networks of β are generated in regions highly affected by the intensified intrinsic heat treatment applied. The results obtained reflect a contribution towards simultaneous selective laser melting-manufacturing and heat treatment for fabrication of Ti-6Al-4V parts. © 2017 by the authors.

TI  - Identification and profiling of miRNAs in the freeze-avoiding gall moth Epiblema scudderiana via next-generation sequencing
VL  - 410
IS  - 1
SP  - 155-163
AB  - The rapid development of high-throughput next-generation sequencing approaches in recent years has facilitated large-scale discovery and expression analysis of non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs, in traditional and non-traditional animal models. Such an approach has been leveraged to amplify, identify, and quantify miRNAs in several models of cold adaptation. The present study is the first to investigate the status of these small RNAs in an insect species that uses the freeze avoidance strategy of cold hardiness, the gall moth Epiblema scudderiana. To characterize the overall miRNA expression profile and to identify cold-modulated miRNAs in control (5 °C) and cold-exposed (−15 °C) E. scudderiana larvae, a next-generation sequencing-based approach was undertaken. A total of 44 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between the two conditions; 21 up-regulated miRNAs and 23 down-regulated miRNAs in −15 °C-exposed larvae as compared with controls. Among the most significant changes observed in miRNAs with potential relevance to cold adaptation were elevated miR-1-3p, miR-92b-3p, and miR-133-3p levels as well as reduced miR-13a-3p and miR-13b-3p levels in E. scudderiana larvae exposed to cold temperatures. Expression values obtained from next-generation sequencing were also validated by a quantitative PCR approach for five miRNAs; miR-34-5p, miR-274-5p, miR-275-3p, miR-307a-3p, and miR-316-5p. Overall, this work provides the first description of a miRNA signature for subzero survival by a freeze-avoiding insect using a high-throughput approach and positions a new group of miRNAs at the forefront of the molecular changes underlying cold adaptation. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

VL  - 244

SP  - 178-184
AB  - Watersheds in frozen ground have been influenced by climate change for centuries, particularly in the last two decades when permafrost degradation has accelerated and intensified. This degradation speeds up water transfer, increases soil moisture, improves agricultural productivity, and affects the ecological environment. It is important to evaluate the effects of these impacts on hydrology to develop sustainable water resources management in cold regions. This study evaluated changes in both winter air temperature and streamflow regime for a selected drainage basin at low latitude but high altitude following large scale permafrost degradation in the Tibetan Plateau. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was used to identify trends in both winter air temperature and streamflow. The results showed significant upward trends in winter flow but not summer runoff. The trend tests indicated that change points of winter streamflow and temperature occurred in 1985 and 1983, respectively. Comparison of winter flow duration for two 16-year periods (1976-1991 and 1992-2008) showed a significantly upward trend in winter streamflow. Increases in most winter flows varied from 16% to 24%, while the increase in low flows was much greater. There were reliable positive correlations between the October and November temperatures and the following monthly discharges. Both the temperature rise and discharge increase at start of the frost period can greatly increase drainage of subsurface water in February, when the maximum variability occurred. The total increases in winter flow are increasing as a function of time, with significant changes occurring since the early 1980s. However, it is yet unclear if the watershed has seen the full effects of the permafrost degradation over the Tibetan Plateau. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

VL  - 27

SP  - 454-461
AB  - Radio and acoustic telemetry were used to monitor the seasonal movement of hatchery-reared and wild shortnose sturgeon (622-927mm total length) in the Savannah River. Diploid, and sterile hatchery-reared shortnose sturgeon, and wild shortnose sturgeon showed apparent similar seasonal patterns of movement within the river. We were unable to detect any significant differences in the seasonal mean river location, minimum daily distance moved, absolute distance moved, displacement or mean territory size among treatments. Fish moved throughout the brackish and freshwater interface area of the Savannah River during the summer months. Coinciding with decreasing fall temperatures, fish of all treatment groups moved downriver into brackish areas of the upper estuary, residing in the Front, Middle, and Back Rivers, where they remained through winter. Upriver movements of some hatchery-reared and wild groups began in early February as river temperatures began to increase. Shortnose sturgeon from each group selected apparent similar thermal, salinity and water depth conditions throughout the year. Hatchery-reared fish may be useful as surrogates for wild fish in behavioural studies. Triploid or surgically-sterilized fish may be used in situ behavioural studies where genetic contamination is a concern. It may be possible to monitor habitats used by released hatchery-reared fish to locate or verify remnant populations of rare or endangered species in systems where they are thought to be extirpated. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin.

VL  - 32
IS  - 1
SP  - 83-92
AB  - In ectotherms, variation in body temperature (Tb) affects physiological performance and, ultimately, fitness. Therefore, reptiles regulate Tb behaviourally by choosing habitats of optimal temperature. The main goal of this study was to determine the link between patterns of thermoregulation and habitat selection in Common Musk Turtles inhabiting a thermally challenging region. We expected habitat selection to be based on the fulfillment of thermoregulatory requirements, which can be accomplished by selecting thermally superior habitats. From early May to late August 2007, we tracked 22 Common Musk Turtles with temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters and collected daily Tb profiles with automated radio-telemetry data loggers. In addition, temperature data loggers were placed in the study area to measure the range of environmental operative temperatures (Te) available to musk turtles. The habitats with the highest thermal quality were aquatic habitats with surface cover (i.e., lily pads, macrophytes, etc.) followed by shallow water. As expected, musk turtles used habitats non-randomly and had a strong preference for thermally superior habitats. This is consistent with the typical aquatic basking behaviour observed in musk turtles, suggesting that there is a strong link between thermal quality of habitats and habitat selection, even in this almost entirely aquatic turtle. © 2011 BRILL.

TI  - Analysis of the water balance under regional scenarios of climate change for arid zones of Colombia
VL  - 30
IS  - 1
SP  - 63-76
AB  - This work discusses in detail the parameters involved in water balance. The analysis is performed by considering the current conditions and climate change in a climatic zone that represents the arid regions of Colombia: The municipality of Uribia (desert) in the state of La Guajira. For this purpose, some climatological stations, which by their reported values of temperature and precipitation can be considered representative of the arid or desert climatic zones according to the Lang's index (PCP/Tavg), were selected. Then, with historical temperature and precipitation values registered at the station of the area, the baseline was built and its behavior analyzed. The station data were obtained from the database of the Instituto de Hidrología, Meteorología y Estudios Ambientales (Institute of Hidrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies) of Colombia. After estimating the baseline scenarios, the current water balance on the site was calculated by taking into account the original variables and including new parameters, if necessary, for the calculation of the simplified continuity equation. The analysis included parameters such as potential and actual evapotranspiration, moisture of soil, storage or recharge and their changes, water deficit and excess, runoff, periods of recharge, and water use. Anomalies in temperatures (°C) and precipitation were calculated by taking into account the new climate scenarios “representative concentration pathways” for different periods (short-and long-term). With the anomalies identified, the baseline for the above-mentioned variables was adjusted. Again, the associated parameters were analyzed and discussed in the context of water balance. In climate change scenarios, the water balance projects a prospective exacerbation of desert conditions in the Uribia-Guajira region, since a decrease in the Lang's index from its current value of 18.7 (desert) to 17.0 in 2050 and 14.5 in 2070 is expected, as a consequence of a decrease in precipitation (2.4 and 11.0%) and an increase in annual temperature of about 1.7 °C with the HadGEM2-Es model for the period 2041-2060 and 3.7 °C with the GFDL-CM3 model for the period 2061-2080. This can be verified by means of the Thornthwaite climate classification, which categorizes the area of study as an arid zone with limited and no excess of water. This deficit could lead to serious environmental consequences, social problems and a decline in the industrial and agricultural productivity of the zone. © 2017 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México

AB  - Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths, both within the US and worldwide. There have been major treatment advances in NSCLC over the past decade with the discovery of molecular drivers of NSCLC, which has ushered in an era of personalized medicine. There are several actionable genetic aberrations in NSCLC, such as epidermal growth factor receptor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). In 3%–7% of NSCLC, a chromosomal inversion event in chromosome 2 leads to fusion of a portion of the ALK gene with the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene. The constitutive activation of the ALK fusion oncogene renders it vulnerable to therapeutic intervention. This review focuses on the first-line treatment of advanced ALK-positive NSCLC using ALK inhibitors. Crizotinib was the first agent proven to be efficacious as first-line treatment for ALK- positive NSCLC. However, acquired resistance inevitably develops. The central nervous system is a sanctuary site that represents a common site for disease progression as well. Hence, more potent, selective next-generation ALK inhibitors that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier have been developed for treatment against crizotinib-resistant ALK-positive NSCLC and are also currently being evaluated for first-line therapy as well. In this review, we provide summary of the clinical experience with these drugs in the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC. © 2015 Gandhi et al.

AB  - Multiple layers of GaN/AlN quantum dot (QD) ensembles were grown by the Stranski-Krastanov method on Si(111) using molecular beam epitaxy. During the subsequent cooling from growth temperature, the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the Si substrate and GaN/AlN film containing the vertically stacked QDs leads to an additional biaxial tensile stress of 20-30 kbar in the III-nitride film. We have selectively modified the thermal stress in the QD layers by etching a cross-hatched pattern into the as-grown sample using inductively coupled Cl 2/Ar plasma reactive ion etching. The results show that a suitable choice of stripe width from ∼2 to 10 μm and orientation along [11-20] and [1-100] can create regions of in-plane uniaxial stress that enable a selective and local control of the polarized luminescence from ensembles of QDs which were probed with cathodoluminescence. A theoretical modelling of the effects of carrier filling on the polarization anisotropy and the excitonic transition energy was performed, as based on three dimensional self-consistent solutions of the Schrödinger and Poisson equations using the 6 × 6 k·p method. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

TI  - Climate variability, farmland value, and farmers’ perceptions of climate change: implications for adaptation in rural Pakistan
VL  - 24

SP  - 532-544
AB  - Many studies have examined the impact of climatic variability on agricultural productivity, although an understanding of these effects on farmland values and their relationship to farmers’ decisions to adapt and modify their land-use practices remains nascent in developing nations. We estimated the impacts of the deviation in our study year's (2012) temperature and precipitation patterns from medium-term (1980–2011) climatic patterns on farmland values in Pakistan. This was accomplished by employing a modified form of a Ricardian regression model. We also examined farmers’ perceptions of climate change during this period, as well as their perceptions of climate change impacts on farm productivity, in addition to past and anticipated farm adaptation strategies. Our results indicate that positive temperature deviation from the medium-term mean–indicative of climatic change–affects farmland values in Pakistan. Deviation in annual cumulative precipitation conversely appears to have no significant impact. Estimates of the marginal impact of temperature deviation suggested a slight but negative linear relationship with farmland values. The location of farms in areas where farmers can avail financial or extension services conversely had a positive impact on farmland values, as did the availability of irrigation facilities. Our analysis of farmers’ perceptions of climate change and their consequent adaptation behavior indicated a relatively high degree of awareness of climatic variability that influenced a number of proactive and future anticipated farm adaptation strategies. Examples included increased use of irrigation and farm enterprise diversification, as well as land-use change, including shifting from agriculture into alternative land uses. National policy in Pakistan underscores the importance of maintaining a productive rural agricultural sector. Our findings consequently highlight the importance of appropriate adaptation strategies to maintain both farm productivity and farmland values in much of Pakistan. The implications of increased extension and financial services to enhance farmers’ potential for climate change adaptation are discussed. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

TI  - Research to compare the growth rate between the Acara Geophagus brasiliensis and Tilapia Oreochromis nioticus in conditions of intensive monoculture utilizing ration and live food
VL  - 12
IS  - 9
AB  - The state of Santa Catarina, because of its climate conditions and lack of alternative native species with commercial interest, does its pisciculture mainly of exotics species. It is one of the main localities for the culture of Tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, (Linnaeus, 1758) and also where it will find many regions with favorable conditions for its growth. To those conditions, we have to add an excellent acceptance of this species by the market of companies that process fish, and also by the consumer in general. Acara or Cara is the generic name assigned to various fishes of the family of Ciclideos, same family that the Tilapia belongs. The most common species of fresh water fish in Brazil is Geophagus brasiliensis (QUOY & GAIMARD, 1824), which can grow up to 25cm long and adapts very well to hot and cold regions. The objective of this research is to evaluate the reproductive potential, growth rate and adaptability of the Geophagus brasiliensis to offer the pisciculturist an alternative of native species of commercial cultivation. It was observed the capability of captive reproduction, capability of sexual reversion, survival skills of larvae and growth rate of Acara until the termination stage, when comparing the same parameter with the Tilapia. Another objective of this research was to evaluate the acceptability of the species zooplankton Daphnia magna as a form of food for the larvae of Acara and Tilapia, as well as analyze the capability of this species of mass culture in covered tanks of psiculture by a system of green house where the culture can be done all year around. The combination of these researches will envisage optimizing the final fish production (survival and weight gain) utilizing a low cost methodology.

TI  - A pipeline for developing and testing staining protocols for flow cytometry, demonstrated with SYBR Green I and propidium iodide viability staining
VL  - 131
SP  - 172-180
AB  - The increasing use of flow cytometry (FCM) for analyses of environmental samples has resulted in a large variety of staining protocols with varying results and limited comparability. Viability assessment with FCM is in this context of particular interest because incorrect staining could severely affect the outcome/interpretation of the results. Here we propose a pipeline for the development and optimization of staining protocols for environmental samples, demonstrated with the common viability dye combination of SYBR Green I (SG) and propidium iodide (PI). Optimization steps included the assessment of dye solvents, determination of suitable PI concentration, and determining the optimal staining temperature and staining time. We demonstrated that di methyl sulfoxide (DMSO) could impair membrane integrity, when used for SGPI stock solution preparation, and TRIS buffer was chosen as an alternative. Moreover we selected 6 mu M as optimal PI final concentration: less than 3 mu M resulted in incomplete staining of damaged cells, while concentrations higher that 12 mu M resulted in false Pl-positive staining of intact cells. Low temperatures (25 degrees C) resulted in a slow reaction and did not enable the staining of all bacteria, while high temperatures (44 degrees C) caused damage to cells'and false PI-positive results. Hence, 35 degrees C was selected as optimal staining temperature. We further showed that a minimum of 15 min were necessary to obtain stable staining results. Moreover, we showed that addition of EDTA resulted in 1-39% more Pl-positive results compared to an EDTA-free sample, and argue that insufficient evidence currently exist in favor of adding EDTA to all samples in general. Altogether, the data clearly shows the need to be careful, precise and reproducible when staining cells for flow cytometric analyses, and the need to assess and optimize staining protocols with both viable and non-viable bacteria.

TI  - Induction of viable but nonculturable Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the phyllosphere of lettuce: A food safety risk factors
VL  - 77
IS  - 23
SP  - 8295-8302
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 continues to be an important human pathogen and has been increasingly linked to food-borne illness associated with fresh produce, particularly leafy greens. The aim of this work was to investigate the fate of E. coli O157:H7 on the phyllosphere of lettuce under low temperature and to evaluate the potential hazard of viable but nonculturable (VBNC) cells induced under such stressful conditions. First, we studied the survival of six bacterial strains following prolonged storage in water at low temperature (4°C) and selected two strains with different nonculturable responses for the construction of E. coli O157:H7 Tn7gfp transformants in order to quantitatively assess the occurrence of human pathogens on the plant surface. Under a suboptimal growth temperature (16°C), both E. coli O157:H7 strains maintained culturability on lettuce leaves, but under more stressful conditions (8°C), the bacterial populations evolved toward the VBNC state. The strain-dependent nonculturable response was more evident in the experiments with different inoculum doses (10 9 and 10 6 E. coli O157:H7 bacteria per g of leaf) when strain BRMSID 188 lost culturability after 15 days and strain ATCC 43895 lost culturability within 7 days, regardless of the inoculum dose. However, the number of cells entering the VBNC state in high-cell-density inoculum (approximately 55%) was lower than in low-cell-density inoculum (approximately 70%). We recorded the presence of verotoxin for 3 days in samples that contained a VBNC population of 4 to 5 log 10 cells but did not detect culturable cells. These findings indicate that E. coli O157:H7 VBNC cells are induced on lettuce plants, and this may have implications regarding food safety. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

TI  - Migration delays caused by anthropogenic barriers: Modeling dams, temperature, and success of migrating salmon smolts
VL  - 21
IS  - 8
SP  - 3014-3031
AB  - Disruption to migration is a growing problem for conservation and restoration of animal populations. Anthropogenic barriers along migration paths can delay or prolong migrations, which may result in a mismatch with migration-timing adaptations. To understand the interaction of dams (as barriers along a migration path), seasonally changing environmental conditions, timing of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) downstream migration, and ultimate migration success, we used 10 years of river temperature and discharge data as a template upon which we simulated downstream movement of salmon. Atlantic salmon is a cool-water species whose downstream migrating smolts must complete migration before river temperatures become too warm. We found that dams had a local effect on survival as well as a survival effect that was spatially and temporally removed from the encounter with the dam. While smolts are delayed by dams, temperatures downstream can reach lethal or near-lethal temperatures;as a result, the match between completion of migration and the window of appropriate migration conditions can be disrupted. The strength of this spatially and temporally removed effect is at least comparable to the local effects of dams in determining smolt migration success in the presence of dams. We also considered smolts from different tributaries, varying in distance from the river mouth, to assess the potential importance of locally adapted migration timing on the effect of barriers. Migration-initiation temperature affected modeled smolt survival differentially across tributaries, with the success of smolts from upstream tributaries being much more variable across years than that of smolts with a shorter distance to travel. As a whole, these results point to the importance of broadening our spatial and temporal view when managing migrating populations. We must consider not only how many individuals never make it across migration barriers, but also the spatially and temporally removed consequences of delays at the barriers for those individuals that successfully navigate them. ©2011 by the Ecological Society of America.

TI  - Climate change impacts on human health over Europe through its effect on air quality
VL  - 16
SP  - 33-44
AB  - This review examines the current literature on the effects of future emissions and climate change on particulate matter (PM) and O3 air quality and on the consequent health impacts, with a focus on Europe. There is considerable literature on the effects of climate change on O3 but fewer studies on the effects of climate change on PM concentrations. Under the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th assessment report (AR5) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), background O3 entering Europe is expected to decrease under most scenarios due to higher water vapour concentrations in a warmer climate. However, under the extreme pathway RCP8.5 higher (more than double) methane (CH4) abundances lead to increases in background O3 that offset the O3 decrease due to climate change especially for the 2100 period. Regionally, in polluted areas with high levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx), elevated surface temperatures and humidities yield increases in surface O3 - termed the O3 climate penalty - especially in southern Europe. The O3 response is larger for metrics that represent the higher end of the O3 distribution, such as daily maximum O3. Future changes in PM concentrations due to climate change are much less certain, although several recent studies also suggest a PM climate penalty due to high temperatures and humidity and reduced precipitation in northern mid-latitude land regions in 2100. A larger number of studies have examined both future climate and emissions changes under the RCP scenarios. Under these pathways the impact of emission changes on air quality out to the 2050s will be larger than that due to climate change, because of large reductions in emissions of O3 and PM pollutant precursor emissions and the more limited climate change response itself. Climate change will also affect climate extreme events such as heatwaves. Air pollution episodes are associated with stagnation events and sometimes heat waves. Air quality during the 2003 heatwave over Europe has been examined in numerous studies and mechanisms for enhancing O3 have been identified. There are few studies on health effects associated with climate change impacts alone on air quality, but these report higher O3-related health burdens in polluted populated regions and greater PM2.5 health burdens in these emission regions. Studies that examine the combined impacts of climate change and anthropogenic emissions change under the RCP scenarios report reductions in global and European premature O3-respiratory related and PM mortalities arising from the large decreases in precursor emissions. Under RCP 8.5 the large increase in CH4 leads to global and European excess O3-respiratory related mortalities in 2100. For future health effects, besides uncertainty in future O3 and particularly PM concentrations, there is also uncertainty in risk estimates such as effect modification by temperature on pollutant-response relationships and potential future adaptation that would alter exposure risk. © 2017 The Author(s).

VL  - 88
IS  - 19
SP  - 11459-11468
AB  - Changes in protein function and other biological properties, such as RNA structure, are crucial for adaptation of organisms to novel or inhibitory environments. To investigate how mutations that do not alter amino acid sequence may be positively selected, we performed a thermal adaptation experiment using the single-stranded RNA bacteriophage Qβ in which the culture temperature was increased from 37.2°C to 41.2°C and finally to an inhibitory temperature of 43.6°C in a stepwise manner in three independent lines. Whole-genome analysis revealed 31 mutations, including 14 mutations that did not result in amino acid sequence alterations, in this thermal adaptation. Eight of the 31 mutations were observed in all three lines. Reconstruction and fitness analyses of Qβ strains containing only mutations observed in all three lines indicated that five mutations that did not result in amino acid sequence changes but increased the amplification ratio appeared in the course of adaptation to growth at 41.2°C. Moreover, these mutations provided a suitable genetic background for subsequent mutations, altering the fitness contribution from deleterious to beneficial. These results clearly showed that mutations that do not alter the amino acid sequence play important roles in adaptation of this single-stranded RNA virus to elevated temperature. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

TI  - Structural and kinetic changes to small-pore Cu-zeolites after hydrothermal aging treatments and selective catalytic reduction of NO: X with ammonia
VL  - 2
IS  - 2
SP  - 168-179
AB  - Three small-pore, eight-membered ring (8-MR) zeolites of different cage-based topology (CHA, AEI, RTH), in their proton- and copper-exchanged forms, were first exposed to high temperature hydrothermal aging treatments (1073 K, 16 h, 10% (v/v) H2O) and then to reaction conditions for low temperature (473 K) standard selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with ammonia, in order to study the effect of zeolite topology on the structural and kinetic changes that occur to Cu-zeolites used in NOx abatement. UV-visible spectra were collected to monitor changes to Cu structure and showed that band intensities for isolated, hydrated Cu2+ cations (∼12, 500 cm-1) remain constant after hydrothermal aging, but decrease in intensity upon subsequent exposure to low temperature SCR reaction conditions. Standard SCR rates (per Cu, 473 K), activation energies, and reaction orders are similar between Cu-AEI and Cu-CHA zeolites before and after hydrothermal aging, although rates are lower after hydrothermal aging as expected from the decreases in intensity of UV-visible bands for Cu2+ active sites. For Cu-RTH, rates are lower (by 2-3×) and apparent activation energies are lower (by ∼2×) than for Cu-AEI or Cu-CHA. These findings suggest that the RTH framework imposes internal transport restrictions, effectively functioning as a one-dimensional framework during SCR catalysis. Hydrothermal aging of Cu-RTH results in complete deactivation and undetectable SCR rates, despite X-ray diffraction patterns and Ar micropore volumes (87 K) that remain unchanged after hydrothermal aging treatments and subsequent SCR exposure. These findings highlight some of the differences in low temperature SCR behavior among small-pore Cu-zeolites of different topology, and the beneficial properties conferred by double six-membered ring (D6R) composite building units. They demonstrate that deleterious structural changes to Cu sites occur after exposure to hydrothermal aging conditions and SCR reactants at low temperatures, likely reflecting the formation of inactive copper-aluminate domains. Therefore, the viability of Cu-zeolites for practical low temperature NOx SCR catalysis cannot be inferred solely from assessments of framework structural integrity after hydrothermal aging treatments, but also require Cu active site and kinetic characterization after hydrothermally aged zeolites are exposed to low temperature SCR reaction conditions. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Alternative tactics in spawning site selection by brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) related to incubation microhabitats in a harsh winter environment
VL  - 58
IS  - 1
SP  - 142-158
AB  - Species with distributions that span a broad range of latitudes may have populations that exhibit distinct life history traits associated with environmental gradients. The majority of previous studies have indicated a strong association between spawning site selection by brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and the presence of upwelling groundwater, but does this generalisation extend to the thermal regimes experienced at northern sites? We investigated the role of hyporheic flow in redd site selection by brook trout in a relatively high-latitude boreal system. Hyporheic flows through streambed substratums can be dominated by groundwater or surface water and may be influenced by the presence of morphological features. For autumn spawners such as brook trout, embryos situated in microhabitats where hyporheic flow in the shallow substratum is groundwater dominant (i.e. warmer in winter) are likely to experience accelerated development rates relative to embryos in redds where there is downwelling surface water (i.e. colder in winter). We measured vertical hydraulic gradients (VHG) at the microhabitat scale and spatial and temporal variation in upwelling/downwelling flow and thermal regimes in brook trout spawning/incubation habitats. Additionally, we noted the proximity of redd sites to stream morphological features (e.g. riffle crests). Our results indicate that upwelling flow was not a decisive cue in redd site selection at the microhabitat scale (100m) as an approximately equal number of redds were situated in microhabitats with upward flow as compared to microhabitats with downward flow through the redd. Redds situated on bedforms with convex longitudinal profiles (e.g. riffle crests, log steps) were associated with downward flow, whereas redds not immediately adjacent to these bedform features were associated with upward flow. Winter streambed temperatures confirmed that both sites with steady upwelling (i.e. warm incubation regime) and downwelling (i.e. cold incubation regime) were indeed selected by spawners. Our observations that spawners utilised both cold-regime and warm-regime sites suggests the existence of distinct reproductive tactics related to hyporheic flow patterns in this boreal system. As temperature is the dominant factor controlling rates of embryonic development, the use of spawning microhabitats with distinct thermal regimes implies substantial differences in the timing of hatching and the phenology of emergence. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Influenza A virus-specific aptamers screened by using an integrated microfluidic system
VL  - 14
IS  - 12
SP  - 2002-2013
AB  - The influenza A virus is a notorious pathogen that causes high morbidity, high mortality, and even severe global pandemics. Early and rapid diagnosis of the virus is therefore crucial in preventing and controlling any influenza outbreaks. Recently, novel nucleic acid-based affinity reagents called aptamers have emerged as promising candidates for diagnostic assays as they offer several advantages over antibodies, including in vitro selection, chemical synthesis, thermal stability and relatively low costs. Aptamers with high sensitivity and specificity are generated via Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX), a process that is currently time-consuming, as well as labor- and resource-intensive. In this study, an integrated microfluidic system was developed and was successfully applied to screen a specific aptamer for the influenza A/H1N1 (InfA/H1N1) virus in an automated and highly efficient manner. The selected aptamer was implemented in a magnetic-bead assay, which demonstrated specific and sensitive detection of the InfA/H1N1 virus, even in biological samples such as throat swabs. Consequently, this specific aptamer presents a promising affinity reagent for clinical diagnosis of InfA/H1N1. This is the first demonstration of screening influenza virus-specific aptamers using the microfluidic SELEX technology, which may be expanded for the rapid screening of aptamers against other pathogens for future biomedical applications. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.

TI  - A sustainability assessment of advanced materials for novel housing solutions
VL  - 92
SP  - 182-191
AB  - Material selection is a key step in product design and typically aims at identifying the most suitable material that meets product performance goals at minimum cost. In recent years research has been driven for developing sustainable solutions at competitive costs. This work evaluates the sustainability of advanced sandwich-structured composites for novel housing solutions. Five polymer matrix composite sandwich materials have been selected and compared concerning mechanical, thermal, acoustic and fire performance as well as cost and environmental impact, in order to study both the technical viability and the sustainability of lightweight solutions for prefabricated structural wall panels as well as for new housing; this included mechanical and fire testing of the selected materials. Subsequently, the thermal and acoustic properties of the alternatives were obtained. After performing a cost analysis and environmental assessment, the results of the tests and analyses led to a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA); PROMETHEE II (preference ranking organizational method for enrichment evaluation) was used to identify the best alternative. Finally the proposed solution was compared with a typical brick house performance. Higher specific strength, better thermal insulation and lower environmental impacts arose as the main advantages of the proposed structures while acoustic properties and fire safety still need to be improved.

TI  - Conceptual core design of a generation IV LFR demonstration plant
VL  - 3
SP  - 1791-1803
AB  - The Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) is one of the six concepts selected by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) as candidates for the next generation of nuclear power plants to be industrially deployed by 2040. Due to its significant technological innovations, the European Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNETP) has recognized that GEN-IV LFR development requires -as a fundamental intermediate step- the realization of a demonstration plant (DEMO) of some hundreds MWth. Accordingly, in the frame of an I-NERI between ENEA (Italy) and Argonne National Laboratory (USA) under the auspices of the EURATOM-DOE Agreement, the conceptual design of a pool-type LFR DEMO is being developed, assuming as reference industrial-size LFR the European Lead-cooled SYstem (ELSY) under development within the 6th and 7 th EURATOM Framework Programmes. A demonstration reactor is expected to prove the viability of technology to be implemented in the First-of-a-Kind industrial power plant. Therefore, the first step towards DEMO conceptual design has been the definition of its specifications as a nuclear power facility able to validate ELSY main features and performances, and to qualify numerical codes and tools. Suitable design parameters have been set to meet the foremost objective of reaching a high fast neutron flux while respecting all technological constraints. A fuel cycle hypothesis has been adopted and burn-up calculations have been performed. Two different independent sets of absorbers have been introduced to guarantee the required reliability for safe reactor shut-down. Preliminary thermal-hydraulic analyses have been carried out to verify safety limits are not exceeded.

TI  - Gyrodactylus salinae n. sp. (Platyhelminthes: Monogenea) infecting the south European toothcarp Aphanius fasciatus (Valenciennes) (Teleostei, Cyprinodontidae) from a hypersaline environment in Italy
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Historically, non-native species of Gambusia (Poeciliidae) have been used to control larval stages of the Asian tiger mosquito, Stegomyia albopicta Reinert, Harbach et Kitching, 2004 throughout Italy. The potential utility of indigenous populations of Aphanius fasciatus (Valenciennes) (Teleostei: Cyprinodontidae) as an appropriate alternative biological control is currently being explored. A sub-sample of ten fish collected from Cervia Saline, Italy (salinity 65 ppt; 30°C) to assess their reproductive capability in captivity, harboured a moderate infection of Gyrodactylus von Nordmann, 1832 (Platyhelminthes, Monogenea). A subsequent morphological and molecular study identified this as being a new species. Results: Gyrodactylus salinae n. sp. is described from the skin, fins and gills of A. fasciatus. Light and scanning electron microscopical (SEM) examination of the opisthaptoral armature and their comparison with all other recorded species suggested morphological similarities to Gyrodactylus rugiensoides Huyse et Volckaert, 2002 from Pomatoschistus minutus (Pallas). Features of the ventral bar, however, permit its discrimination from G. rugiensoides. Sequencing of the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 and the 5.8S rRNA gene and a comparison with all species listed in GenBank confirmed they are unique and represent a new species (most similar to Gyrodactylus anguillae Ergens, 1960, 8.3% pair-wise distance based on 5.8S+ITS2). This represents the first species of Gyrodactylus to be described from Aphanius and, to date, has the longest ITS1 (774 bp) sequenced from any Gyrodactylus. Additional sampling of Cervia Saline throughout the year, found G. salinae n. sp. to persist in conditions ranging from 35 ppt and 5°C in December to 65 ppt and 30°C in July, while in captivity a low level of infection was present, even in freshwater conditions (0 ppt). Conclusions: The ability of G. salinae n. sp. to tolerate a wide range of salinities and temperatures shows its potential to readily adapt to several environmental conditions. These findings, together with the fact that A. fasciatus is a protected species and is considered as a biological control organism, necessitate further studies on the ecology and virulence of G. salinae n. sp. © 2011 Paladini et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Transient Receptor Potential Is Essential for High Temperature Tolerance in Invasive Bemisia tabaci Middle East Asia Minor 1 Cryptic Species
VL  - 9
IS  - 9
AB  - Temperature is an important factor in affecting population dynamics and diffusion distribution of organisms. Alien species can successfully invade and colonize to various temperature environments, and one of important reasons is that alien species have a strong resistance to stress temperature. Recently, researchers have focused on the mechanisms of temperature sensing to determine the sensing and regulation mechanisms of temperature adaptation. The transient receptor potential (TRP) is one of the key components of an organism's temperature perception system. TRP plays important roles in perceiving temperature, such as avoiding high temperature, low temperature and choosing the optimum temperature. To assess high temperature sensation and the heat resistance role of the TRP gene, we used 3′ and 5′ rapid-amplification of cDNA ends to isolate the full-length cDNA sequence of the TRP gene from Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) MEAM1 (Middle East Asia Minor 1), examined the mRNA expression profile under various temperature conditions, and identified the heat tolerance function. This is the first study to characterize the TRP gene of invasive B. tabaci MEAM1 (MEAM1 BtTRP). The full-length cDNA of MEAM1 BtTRP was 3871 bp, and the open reading frames of BtTRP was 3501 bp, encoding 1166 amino acids. Additionally, the BtTRP mRNA expression level was significantly increased at 35°C. Furthermore, compared with control treatments, the survival rate of B. tabaci MEAM1 adults was significantly decreased under high temperature stress conditions after feeding with dsRNA BtTRP. Collectively, these results showed that MEAM1 BtTRP is a key element in sensing high temperature and plays an essential role in B. tabaci MEAM1 heat tolerance ability. Our data improved our understanding of the mechanism of temperature sensation in B. tabaci MEAM1 at the molecular level and could contribute to the understanding of the thermal biology of B. tabaci MEAM1 within the context of global climate change. © 2014 Lu et al.

TI  - In situ monitoring and characterization of distortion during laser cladding of Inconel® 625
VL  - 220
SP  - 135-145
AB  - Laser cladding is a low heat input metal deposition process that provides lower dilution and distortion levels than comparable arc welding based processes. Even though distortion of the substrate material is significantly reduced in laser cladding, the high temperatures and rapid thermal cycles produced by the laser heat source still result in measurable distortion. This distortion is particularly concerning in repair or refurbishment applications where dimensional control is critical. The impact of multi-layer laser cladding on the amount and mode of distortion and thermal history at selected substrate locations in Inconel® 625 plates is investigated and quantified for different processing conditions and deposition patterns. In situ measurements of the longitudinal bowing and transverse angular distortion modes are made using a laser displacement sensor followed by post-process measurements. The results show that each distortion mode occurs simultaneously, causing the plate to twist in response to the deposition pattern. The selection of processing parameters also had several unexpected impacts on the magnitude and mode of distortions as well as the temperatures measured on the substrate. For example, similar substrate temperatures are observed for all processing conditions, regardless of the magnitude of the linear heat input or the length of the processing time. The addition of a second layer when using a transverse hatch pattern also shows that the transverse angular distortion mode can be minimized, unlike the case of longitudinal bowing with a longitudinal hatch pattern, which demonstrates a cumulative increase in longitudinal bowing with an additional layer. In order to account for these unexpected observations, a new metric is proposed to replace linear heat input for cladding. This new metric, clad heat, takes into account the laser power, travel speed, and hatch spacing and is shown to better predict the magnitude of cladding distortion. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicated that both the developmental period of T. japonicum and T. ostriniae decreased with the temperature increasing from 10 to 37°C. The developmental periods decreased rapidly from 10 to 30°C, which were 57.86, 28. 75, 12. 88, 9. 50, 7. 75d for T. japonicum and 61. 13, 28. 50, 13. 00, 9. 75, 8. 05d for T. ostriniae respectively under 5 constant temperature gradients (10, 15, 20, 25, 30°C). The differences of the developmental period were significant among these 5 temperature gradients. But the developmental periods decreased slowly with the temperature increasing from 30 to 37°C, which were 7. 75, 7.45, 7. 95d for T. japonicum and 8. 05, 7. 50, 7. 90d for T. ostriniae respectively under 3 constant temperature gradients (30, 35, 37°C). There was no significant difference among these 3 temperature gradients. The effects of temperature on the development of the 2 Trichogramma species were consistent with the linear regression and Wang-Lan_Ding models. The developmental thresholds of T. japonicum and T. ostriniae developing from egg to adult were 5. 23°C and 5. 24 °C respectively, and their generational effective accumulated temperatures were 212. 77 and 217. 39 degree\days respectively. Both the developmental threshold and the effective accumulated temperatures were calculated from the linear regression model. The lowest, optimum and highest lethal temperatures estimated by Wang-Lan-Ding model were 7.96°C, 18.91°C 1, 38.99°C respectively for the development of T. japonicum, and 6. 97, 18.87, 38. 99°C respectively for T. ostriniae. The developmental rates of both species increased with the temperature increasing from 10 to 37°C, rapidly from 10 to 30°C, but slowly from 30 to 35Tl. When temperature increased beyond the highest lethal temperature, the developmental rates did not increase anymore at the end. The design of the consistent temperature gradient and the mathematical model selection in the temperature-development study of Trichogramma were also analyze. The developmental threshold obtained from the linear regression model may provide introduction for the parasitoids reservation in lower temperature. Integration of the linear regression and Wang-Lan-Ding models is sufficient to get the result from the temperature-development study, because the generational effective accumulated temperature can be provided by the linear regression model, while Wang-Lan-Ding model can reflect the change of the developmental rate under the lowest to the highest lethal temperature. The number of the constant temperature gradients must not be less than the number of the parameters of Wang-Lan-Ding model, and the lowest temperature of the constant temperature gradients must be close to the lowest lethal temperature, while the highest temperature is close to the highest lethal temperature when using this model to theoretically simulate the relationship between temperature and development.

AB  - Different physiological thresholds of species across biogeographic boundaries can show a long-term scope for adaptation. Characterised by cold-stenothermal conditions, polar and deep-sea environments are constrained by thermal stability across wide regions, and polar invertebrates are broadly considered to be highly sensitive to only subtle changes in thermal regime. We examine the respiratory response of two distinct biogeographic populations of the widespread bivalve Lissarca notorcadensis from deep waters in the Southern Ocean to acute thermal changes, and present distinct respiratory responses for each population. Populations from the Weddell Sea living in cooler water temperatures (<0 °C) show a lower tolerance to temperature increases, identified by an increase in oxygen consumption at temperatures from −1 to 4 °C and mortality at 5 °C. In contrast, populations from the Scotia Sea, experiencing a thermally more variable cold-stenothermal environment driven by seasonality, show no significant increase in oxygen consumption up to 6 °C before peaking at 8 °C, and mortality during acclimation to 9 °C. Our results are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that long-term adaptation to thermal envelopes, over multiple generations, likely determines the degree of thermal resilience to warming and at population-specific levels. This contrasts to previous laboratory-based (short-term acclimation or acute) thermal response studies, which have shown high sensitivities and low acclimation capacities to temperature increases. We highlight the need for long-term acclimation studies and pose questions as to how selection for population-specific thermal tolerances may take place in a global warming scenario and within a macroecological context. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Many drivers tend to foster the development of renewable energy production in wastewater treatment plants as many expectations rely upon energy recovery from sewage sludge, for example through biogas use. This paper is focused on the assessment of grease waste (GW) as an adequate substrate for co-digestion with municipal sludge, as it has a methane potential of 479-710 LCH 4/kg VS, as well as the evaluation of disintegration technologies as a method to optimize the co-digestion process. With this objective three different pre-treatments have been selected for evaluation: thermal hydrolysis, ultrasound and enzymatic treatment. Results have shown that co-digestion processes without pre-treatment had a maximum increment of 128% of the volumetric methane productivity when GW addition was 23% inlet (at 20 days of HRT and with an OLR of 3.0 kg COD/m 3d), compared with conventional digestion of sewage sludge alone. Concerning the application of the selected disintegration technologies, all pre-treatments showed improvements in terms of methane yield (51.8, 89.5 and 57.6% more for thermal hydrolysis, ultrasound and enzymatic treatment, respectively, compared with non-pretreated wastes), thermal hydrolysis of GW and secondary sludge being the best configuration as it improved the solubilization of the organic matter and the hydrodynamic characteristics of digestates. © IWA Publishing 2012.

TI  - Novel Radiofrequency-Assisted Thermal Processing Improves the Gelling Properties of Standard Egg White Powder
VL  - 81
IS  - 3
SP  - E665-E671
AB  - Effect of radiofrequency (RF)-assisted thermal processing on quality and functional properties of high-foaming standard egg white powder (std. EWP, pH approximately 7.0) was investigated and compared with traditional processing (heat treatment in a hot room at 58 °C for at least 14 d). The RF-assisted thermal treatments were selected to meet the pasteurization requirements and to improve the functional properties of the std. EWP. The treatment conditions were: RF heating to 60, 70, 80, and 90 °C followed by holding in a hot air oven at those temperatures for different periods ranging from 4 h at 90 °C to 72 h at 60 °C. The quality (color and solubility) and functional properties (foaming properties: foaming capacity and foam stability; and gelling properties: water holding capacity and gel-firmness) of the std. EWP were investigated. RF-assisted thermal processing did not affect the color and solubility of std. EWP at any of the treatment conditions. In general, the foaming and gelling properties of RF-assisted thermally processed std. EWP increased with an increase in temperature and treatment duration. The optimal RF-assisted treatment conditions to produce std. EWP with similar functional properties as the traditionally processed (hot room processed) std. EWP were 90 °C for ≥8 h. These optimal conditions were similar to those for high gel egg white powder (HG-EWP, pH approximately 9.5). The RF-assisted thermal pasteurization improved the gelling properties of std. EWP to the levels of HG-EWP, leading to newer applications of this functionally improved safe product. The RF-assisted thermal processing allows the processor to produce a HG-EWP from std. EWP subsequent to processing while simultaneously pasteurizing the product, thus assuring the product safety. © 2016 Institute of Food Technologists®.

TI  - Thermal protection from a finite period of heat exposure - Heat survival of flight data recorders
VL  - 75
SP  - 748-755
AB  - This work relates to developing thermal protection for a finite period of exposure to a high temperature environment. This type of transient heat transfer problem starts with a heating period, which is then followed by a cooling period once the high temperature environment disappears. The study is particularly relevant to the thermal protection of flight data recorders from high temperature flame. In this work, transient heat conduction through a three-concentric-layer configuration is numerically studied, which includes a metal housing, a thermal insulation, and a phase change material. The thermal performance is evaluated using the center temperature changing with time. It is found that the center temperature reaches a peak during cooling period rather than heating period. Time taken to reach the peak and the peak value depend on the sizes and properties of the layers. The properties include latent heat of fusion, melting temperature, heat capacities, and thermal conductivities. Parametric study is conducted to analyze and distinguish the influence of these parameters. The study provides general guidance for determining sizes and selecting materials for the thermal design of flight data recorders. Additionally, the study is also useful for other similar applications, for which thermal management and protection over a period of time is needed. In this paper, analysis starts with a baseline configuration composed of specific materials and sizes. Finite changes are applied to sizes, properties of the materials, and the results are compared to understand the roles of the varied parameters in affecting the thermal protection performance.

TI  - Finite element analysis of thermal behavior of metal powder during selective laser melting
VL  - 104
SP  - 146-157
AB  - The thermal behavior during the selective laser melting of metal powders is a key issue to the product quality in 3D printing, so it is of benefit to the development of 3D printing industries to explore the heat transfer characteristics during the selective laser melting process. Based on the TiAl6V4 powder system, the energy conservation equation with a moving Gaussian energy source is developed, in which the temperature-dependent thermal physical properties of materials are taken into account. By means of the finite element methods, the temperature distribution and molten pool dimensions are presented, and the related modeling and numerical methods are validated by previous experimental and numerical works. The effects of the linear energy density, volume shrinkage, scanning track length, hatch spacing and time interval between two neighboring tracks on the temperature distribution and molten pool dimensions are obtained and analyzed. The results show that the increased laser power is superior to the reduced scan speed in thermal performance, which can improve the temperature distribution and molten pool dimensions. Shorter track, shorter hatch spacing and less time interval can lower the temperature gradient and increase the temperature of each track. The average temperature and dimensions of the molten pool are influenced by the volume shrinkage, which should be considered during the numerical simulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Vulnerability of Fraser River sockeye salmon to climate change: A life cycle perspective using expert judgments
VL  - 91
IS  - 12
SP  - 2771-2780
AB  - Fraser River sockeye salmon have been the basis for a major commercial fishery shared by Canada and the United States, and an important cultural foundation for many aboriginal groups; they are also of huge ecological significance throughout the Fraser Basin. The potential for altered aquatic habitat and temperature regimes due to climate change is an important concern for Fraser River sockeye salmon. This paper characterizes the vulnerability of Fraser River sockeye salmon to future climate change using an approach that is novel on three counts. First, previous efforts to assess the vulnerability of salmon to climate change have largely focused on only part of the life cycle, whereas we consider climate vulnerability at all stages in the life cycle. Second, we use the available scientific literature to provide a basis for structuring and eliciting judgments from fisheries science and management experts who research and manage these systems. Third, we consider prospects for mitigating the effects of climate change on sockeye salmon. Tests showed that participants' judgments differentiated in statistically significant ways among questions that varied in terms of life stages, spawning regions and climate scenarios. The consensus among participants was that Fraser River sockeye are most vulnerable to climate change during the egg and returning adult stages of the life cycle. A high temperature scenario was seen as imposing the greatest risk on sockeye stocks, particularly those that migrate to the upper reaches of the Fraser River system and spawn earlier in the summer. The inability to alter water temperature and the highly constrained nature of sockeye management, with competing gear types and sequential fisheries over a long distance, suggest the potential to mitigate adverse effects is limited. Fraser River sockeye already demonstrate a great deal of adaptive capacity in utilizing heterogeneous habitats in different river sub-basins. This adaptability points to the potential value of policies to make stocks more resilient to uncertain futures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 185

AB  - Intraspecific variation in the seasonal reproductive timing of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus sp.) has important implications for the resilience of salmon and for organisms in freshwater and terrestrial communities that depend on salmon resources. Stream temperature has well known associations with salmon spawn timing but how stream and watershed geomorphology relates to the variation in salmon spawn timing is less understood. We used multivariate statistics applied to five environmental variables to compare conditions across 36 watersheds in the Wood River basin in southwest Alaska. We found that the environmental conditions in the first two axes of a principal components analysis (PCA) explained 76% of the variation in summer temperature among streams and 45% of the variation in spawn timing of sockeye salmon. The average habitat characteristics of streams that characterized three spawn timing groups of sockeye salmon were significantly distinct from one another. Sites supporting early spawning populations tend to have steeper and smaller watersheds, while late spawning populations occur in streams draining large, lower gradient watersheds with lakes in the drainage network. Finally, we show that stream temperature and spawn timing among streams have little spatial correlation across the landscape, thereby producing a fine-scale mosaic of spawn timing across the river basin. These results demonstrate that geomorphology and hydrology interact to produce a heterogeneous thermal template for natural selection to influence salmon spawn timing across river basins.

TI  - Intensive voluntary wheel running may restore circadian activity rhythms and improves the impaired cognitive performance of arrhythmic Djungarian hamsters
VL  - 33

SP  - 1161-1170
AB  - Circadian rhythms are highly important not only for the synchronization of animals and humans with their periodic environment but also for their fitness. Accordingly, the disruption of the circadian system may have adverse consequences. A certain number of animals in our breeding stock of Djungarian hamsters are episodically active throughout the day. Also body temperature and melatonin lack 24-h rhythms. Obviously in these animals, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) as the central pacemaker do not generate a circadian signal. Moreover, these so-called arrhythmic (AR) hamsters have cognitive deficits. Since motor activity is believed to stabilize circadian rhythms, we investigated the effect of voluntary wheel running. Hamsters were bred and kept under standardized housing conditions with food and water ad libitum and a 14 L/10 D lighting regimen. AR animals were selected according to their activity pattern obtained by means of passive infrared motion detectors. In a first step, the daily activity behavior was investigated for 3 weeks each without and with running wheels. To estimate putative photic masking effects, hamsters were exposed to light (LPs) and DPs and also released into constant darkness for a minimum of 3 weeks. A novel object recognition (NOR) test was performed to evaluate cognitive abilities both before and after 3 weeks of wheel availability. The activity patterns of hamsters with low wheel activity were still AR. With more intense running, daily patterns with higher values in the dark time were obtained. Obviously, this was due to masking as LPs did suppress and DPs induced motor activity. When transferred to constant darkness, in some animals the daily rhythm disappeared. In other hamsters, namely those which used the wheels most actively, the rhythm was preserved and free-ran, what can be taken as indication of a reconstitution of circadian rhythmicity. Also, animals showing a 24-h activity pattern after 3 weeks of extensive wheel running were able to recognize the novel object in the NOR test but not so before. The results show that voluntary exercise may reestablish circadian rhythmicity and improve cognitive performance. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

VL  - 460
SP  - 75-82
AB  - Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing industries in the world, andmarine-based farming in particular is growing the fastest. With the ever-increasing demand for seafood, marine aquaculture (mariculture) has great potential to help meet this demand. Due to the highly diverse and variable nature of marine environments, it is critical to understand species-level trade-offs that can influence the suitability of a species or species groups for certain ocean conditions. Particularly for mariculture, physiological tolerance of a species to temperature fluctuations and low dissolved oxygen (DO) and its capacity to grow quickly are important attributes. Although there has been extensive research pertaining to the respective fields of tolerance and growth of marine organisms, there has been little overlap between the seemingly separate, yet related fields. More specifically, a relationship between traits of tolerance and growth is not well understood - especially across multiple taxonomic groups. In order to explore and compare possible tolerance and life-history relationships of mariculture species, we complied information on temperature tolerance range, minimum dissolved oxygen observations, growth parameters (asymptotic size and rate), trophic level (TL), taxon, region, and market value for 178 distinct marine farmed species, which included finfish (n= 101), crustaceans (n= 20), molluscs ( n= 52), and other aquatic invertebrates (n = 5), including a cephalopod, a cordate, and three echinoderms. Using descriptive statistics and regression modelling, we found a significant inverse relationship between temperature tolerance range and minimum DO observations (i.e., a positive trend between thermal and hypoxia tolerance, as defined). We also found evidence of a possible trade-off between overall tolerance ability and growth. Specifically, larger, slower growing species tend to have wider temperature ranges and lower minimum DO levels, but potentially at the cost of being less ecologically sustainable (as measured by TL). In addition, tropical species appear less resilient when accounting for both thermal extremes and lower observed DO levels compared to subtropical and temperate species. These patterns highlight associations and uncertainties of traits important for mariculture practices, including species and trait selection, as well as adaptive capacity of regional ventures relative to climate change.

VL  - 19

SP  - 416-431
AB  - The ground cricket Dianemobius nigrofasciatus overwinters as an egg in Japan, being univoltine in Hokkaido and northern Honshu and bivoltine farther south. In Hokkaido, however, this cricket is heard singing in winter in several fumarolic fields covered with moss and grasses locally known as “bokke”. In such warm “islets” the adult density was high in early summer and again in autumn, indicating that the cricket is bivoltine in contrast to the univoltine life cycle outside the bokke habitats in Hokkaido. Eggs laid by females collected at regular intervals from a bokke habitat showed a clear seasonal cycle of diapause incidence. At 26°C, the bokke strains produced non-diapause eggs under long days and diapause eggs under short days as in the southern bivoltine populations, although the critical day-length was longer than in the south. Several strains derived from non-bokke habitats in Hokkaido and northern Honshu produced high percentages of diapause eggs under long days as well as short days as expected for the univoltine life cycle. Winter adults singing in bokke habitats could be either survivors of the autumn generation or individuals derived from eggs laid in autumn and then matured in response to the high soil temperature. In the laboratory, the proportion of egg diapause in short days was decreased by selection only for several generations. Phylogenetic trees of bokke and non-bokke populations, based on both the nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial COI gene and four allozyme loci, suggest that bokke populations have not been isolated from non-bokke populations for an evolutionarily significant time. © 2016 The Entomological Society of Japan

VL  - 21

AB  - In the context of rising seawater temperatures associated with climate change, the issue of whether coral holobionts deal with this challenge by shuffling their associations with stress- and/or heat-tolerant Symbiodinium, by generating heat-resistant host genotypes, or both is important for coral survival. In this study, the composition of communities of the endosymbiont Symbiodinium and the population genetics of the coral host Platygyra verweyi were examined in a reef impacted by hot-water discharged from the outlet of a nuclear power plant in operation in Kenting, Southern Taiwan since 1984. The water at this site is 2.0-3.0 °C warmer than adjacent reefs in summer, which have an average seawater temperature of 29.0 °C. The data were compared with those for the same species at other sites within 12 km of the outlet site. Platygyra verwyei was associated with one or both of Symbiodinium types C3 (heat sensitive) and D1a (heat tolerant) at all sites with the latter being the dominant at the nuclear power plant outlet. The proportion of C3 in populations increased gradually with increasing distance from the hot-water discharge. Genetic analysis of the Platygyra verweyi host using mitochondrial and nuclear markers showed no genetic differentiation among sites. Changes in the composition of Symbiodinium types associated with P. verweyi among closely located sites in Kenting suggested that this coral might have acclimatized to the constant thermal stress by selective association with heat-tolerant Symbiodinium types, whereas the role of the host in adaptation was inconclusive. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - The antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 contributes to the protective effect of mild thermotolerance (40 °C) against heat shock-induced apoptosis
VL  - 99
SP  - 485-497
AB  - The exposure of cells to low doses of stress induces adaptive survival responses that protect cells against subsequent exposure to toxic stress. The ability of cells to resist subsequent toxic stress following exposure to low dose heat stress at 40 °C is known as mild thermotolerance. Mild thermotolerance involves increased expression of heat shock proteins and antioxidants, but the initiating factors in this response are not understood. This study aims to understand the role of the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway in acquisition of mild thermotolerance at 40 °C, and secondly, whether the Nrf2 pathway could be involved in the protective effect of thermotolerance against heat-shock (42 °C)-induced apoptosis. During cell preconditioning at 40 °C, protein expression of the Nrf2 transcription factor increased after 15–60 min. In addition, levels of the Nrf2 targets MnSOD, catalase, heme oxygenase-1, glutamate cysteine ligase and Hsp70 increased at 40 °C. Levels of these Nrf2 targets were enhanced by Nrf2 activator oltipraz and decreased by shRNA targeting Nrf2. Levels of pro-oxidants increased after 30–60 min at 40 °C. Pro-oxidant levels were decreased by oltipraz and increased by knockdown of Nrf2. Increased Nrf2 expression and catalase activity at 40 °C were inhibited by the antioxidant PEG-catalase and by p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α. These results suggest that mild thermotolerance (40 °C) increases cellular pro-oxidant levels, which in turn activate Nrf2 and its target genes. Moreover, Nrf2 contributes to the protective effect of thermotolerance against heat-shock (42 °C)-induced apoptosis, because Nrf2 activation by oltipraz enhanced thermotolerance, whereas Nrf2 knockdown partly reversed thermotolerance. Improved knowledge about the different protective mechanisms that mild thermotolerance can activate is crucial for the potential use of this adaptive survival response to treat stress-related diseases. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Genomics of variation in nitrogen fixation activity in a population of the thermophilic cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
SP  - 78-86
AB  - Variation in phenotypic traits that contribute to fitness influences a population's evolutionary response and its impact on ecosystem function following environmental change, yet its amount and nature are rarely known. Here, we investigated variation in nitrogen (N) fixation activity and its genetic basis for a random sample of laboratory strains of the cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus from a N-limited, geothermally influenced stream in Yellowstone National Park. In a linear mixed-effects model, temperature and genetic differences among strains were the most important factors explaining variation in activity. Genome-wide analyses of genetic divergence between groups of strains that varied in N fixation activity revealed that few loci were strongly associated with these phenotypic differences. Notably, a single nonsynonymous polymorphism in the sulfate assimilation gene apsK explained >25% of the variation in activity at high temperature. We further identified a role for allelic variation of multiple terminal cytochrome oxidases for different aspects of N fixation. In addition, genomes of strains that fixed the most N overall contained a nonsense mutation in a histidine kinase gene that is expected to disrupt normal protein function and may result in transcriptional rewiring. This study illustrates how taking complementary approaches to link phenotype and genotype can inform our understanding of microbial population diversity. © 2017 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.

TI  - Growth release determination and interpretation of Korean pine and Koyama spruce in Shengshan national nature reserve, Heilongjing province, China
VL  - 31
IS  - 5
AB  - Mixed broadleaf-Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) forests are a major ecosystem of the Xiaoxingàn Mountains of northeast China. It is critical to better understand the disturbance regimes and growth dynamics of the main conifer species in these forests, especially in the context of global climate change. The objective of this study was to investigate timing of tree recruitment and forest gap formation using growth releases recorded in tree-ring series of two conifer species, Korean pine and Koyama spruce (Picea koraiensis), and their responses to annual variation in temperature and precipitation. We sampled trees from three randomly selected stands in the experimental area of Shengshan National Nature Reserve, Heilongjiang Province. All Korean pine and Koyama spruce trees with diameter at breast height ≥ 10 cm in each plot were mapped and increment cores collected from each. All cores were dendrochronologically cross dated with a locally developed chronology and ring widths measured to the nearest 0. 001 mm. After measuring, growth release events on each series were determined using the boundary line release criteria and the relationship between percent growth change and prior growth. The results showed that the prior growth was an important decision factor to define growth release events. Both the tree-ring widths and percent growth change curve of each series indicated that Koyama spruce had stronger consistent between-tree growth responses, while Korean pine had lees consistent growth responses probably because of greater differences in microenvironments. Almost all Korean pine series had more than one growth release event, with 2. 75 average growth releases per tree. 87. 5, of the Korean pine series had at least one major release. Koyama spruce had a lower average growth release rate per tree due to the shorter length of their tree-ring series. The average release number of each Koyama spruce series was 0.92, and 41.7, of the growth series had more than one major release. Eight trees in plot 1 contained 15 growth release events (eight major and seven moderate releases). Four major and five moderate releases occurred during the period 1970 - 1990, which had the greatest frequency of release events. Twenty trees in plot 2 contained 29 growth releases, most of which were major (25 major releases and four moderate). Twelve trees in plot 3 had 22 growth release events with 13 major releases and nine moderate releases. There were four samples in each plot without growth release events. Seventeen major releases and three moderate releases in plot 2, and 10 major releases and two moderate releases in plot 3 occurred during the period 1970 -1990, while six in nine moderate releases in plot 3 occurred during 1930 - 1960, which was another high growth release period. For growth releases lasting less than 5 years, 71.4, of these releases also appeared in the periods 1930 - 1960 and 1970 -1990. Spatial distribution patterns of Korean pine and Koyama spruce trees indicated that forest gap opening due to a variety of mortality factors is likely the main reason for tree growth releases. A comparison analysis between the percent tree growth and climate changes showed that temperature and precipitation could be another important factor causing growth releases, especially for growth releases that occurred synchronously between plots. Precipitation was more important than temperature to cause growth releases in this area. Results from this study provide preliminary data and scientific support for the management of mixed broadleaved-Korean pine forests in this area, which is the northern limit of Korean pine distribution in Heihe.

TI  - Generalized crowding for genetic algorithms
SP  - 775-782
AB  - Crowding is a technique used in genetic algorithms to preserve diversity in the population and to prevent premature convergence to local optima. It consists of pairing each offspring with a similar individual in the current population (pairing phase) and deciding which of the two will remain in the population (replacement phase). The present work focuses on the replacement phase of crowding, which usually has been carried out by one of the following three approaches: Deterministic, Probabilistic, and Simulated Annealing. These approaches present some limitations regarding the way replacement is conducted. On the one hand, the first two apply the same selective pressure regardless of the problem being solved or the stage of the genetic algorithm. On the other hand, the third does not apply a uniform selective pressure over all the individuals in the population, which makes the control of selective pressure over the generations somewhat difficult. This work presents a Generalized Crowding approach that allows selective pressure to be controlled in a simple way in the replacement phase of crowding, thus overcoming limitations of the other approaches. Furthermore, the understanding of existing approaches is greatly improved, since both Deterministic and Probabilistic Crowding turn out to be special cases of Generalized Crowding. In addition, the temperature parameter used in Simulated Annealing is replaced by a parameter called scaling factor that controls the selective pressure applied. Theoretical analysis using Markov chains and empirical evaluation using Bayesian networks demonstrate the potential of this novel Generalized Crowding approach. Copyright 2010 ACM.

TI  - Thermal performance curves under daily thermal fluctuation: A study in helmeted water toad tadpoles
VL  - 70
SP  - 80-85
AB  - Most research in physiological ecology has focused on the effects of mean changes in temperature under the classic “hot vs cold” acclimation treatment; however, current evidence suggests that an increment in both the mean and variance of temperature could act synergistically to amplify the negative effects of global temperature increase and how it would affect fitness and performance-related traits in ectothermic organisms. We assessed the effects of acclimation to daily variance of temperature on thermal performance curves of swimming speed in helmeted water toad tadpoles (Calyptocephalella gayi). Acclimation treatments were 20 °C ± 0.1 SD (constant) and 20 °C ± 1.5 SD (fluctuating). We draw two key findings: first, tadpoles exposed to daily temperature fluctuation had reduced maximal performance (Zmax), and flattened thermal performance curves, thus supporting the “vertical shift or faster-slower” hypothesis, and suggesting that overall swimming performance would be lower through an examination of temperatures under more realistic and ecologically-relevant fluctuating regimens; second, there was significant interindividual variation in performance traits by means of significant repeatability estimates. Our present results suggest that the widespread use of constant acclimation temperatures in laboratory experiments to estimate thermal performance curves (TPCs) may lead to an overestimation of actual organismal performance. We encourage the use of temperature fluctuation acclimation treatments to better understand the variability of physiological traits, which predict ecological and evolutionary responses to global change. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - 1.Behavioural adaptations of ectotherms to thermally heterogeneous environments are still overlooked in the literature despite the fact that organismal behaviour could enhance survival in the warming world. This is particularly critical in the intertidal where most ectotherms live at, or near to the upper limit of thermal tolerance. 2.This study investigated (i) the environmental factors determining the body temperatures of the intertidal gastropod Nerita atramentosa, (ii) the space-time variability in environmental and individual body temperatures and (iii) the potential variability in N. atramentosa thermoregulatory behaviours, i.e. microhabitat selection and aggregation. 3.Thermal imaging was used to assess the body temperatures of N. atramentosa and surrounding substrata over two seasons (autumn and summer), at two shore levels (low- vs. high-shore levels) within two habitats of different topographic complexity (rock platform and boulders) on the same rocky shore. 4.Snail body and substratum temperatures were significantly and positively correlated within each habitat at both seasons. Substratum temperature may thus be considered as a primary driver of body temperatures of organisms that attach to a substratum. Substratum temperature and other variables such as solar irradiance critically need to be integrated in climate-change models that use single climatic variables (e.g. air temperature) that are not necessarily correlated with individual body temperatures in nature. 5.The high space-time variability in both substratum and body temperatures reinforces the growing evidence that small spatial scale variations may surpass those observed at larger spatial scales. 6.Nerita atramentosa thermoregulatory behaviour under high thermal stress appeared to be habitat specific. 7.The small spatial scale heterogeneity in environmental and individual temperatures and in thermoregulatory behaviours has stressed the need to focus on body temperature patterns at the niche level and to integrate the organismal behaviour in climate-change models. © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Evidence is accumulating that many marine ectotherms are undergoing rapid changes in their life-history characteristics. These changes have been variously attributed to fisheries-induced evolution, inhibited adult growth rate due to oxygen limitation at higher temperatures, and plastic responses to density dependence or changes in ocean productivity. Here, we review the diverse underlying mechanisms by which plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change and fisheries are likely to produce similar life-history trends in harvested marine ectotherms, leading to faster life-histories with earlier maturation and smaller adult size-at-age. While mechanistically understanding these growth and maturation changes may be difficult, it is becoming clear that changing life-histories will lead to modified population dynamics, productivity and natural mortality of the affected species. We discuss how the observed and expected life-history changes could affect the assumptions and uncertainty within single and multispecies models currently used in marine ecosystem management, highlighting that models which allow for dynamic life-history traits often report significantly different estimates of stock biomass. Given that both climate- and harvest-induced life-history changes are likely to intensify and possibly amplify each other, there is an urgent need to adequately assess the implications of faster life-histories for marine ecosystem management. This is especially true for data-poor stocks, where growth and maturation are not regularly assessed. Targeted monitoring can be used to inform responsive management, but for improved sustainability outcomes, a precautionary approach to management that is robust to life-history trends is advised. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Despite considerable interest in temporal and spatial variation of phenotypic selection, very few methods allow quantifying this variation while correctly accounting for the error variance of each individual estimate. Furthermore, the available methods do not estimate the autocorrelation of phenotypic selection, which is a major determinant of eco-evolutionary dynamics in changing environments. We introduce a new method for measuring variable phenotypic selection using random regression. We rely on model selection to assess the support for stabilizing selection, and for a moving optimum that may include a trend plus (possibly autocorrelated) fluctuations. The environmental sensitivity of selection also can be estimated by including an environmental covariate. After testing our method on extensive simulations, we apply it to breeding time in a great tit population in the Netherlands. Our analysis finds support for an optimum that is well predicted by spring temperature, and occurs about 33 days before a peak in food biomass, consistent with what is known from the biology of this species. We also detect autocorrelated fluctuations in the optimum, beyond those caused by temperature and the food peak. Because our approach directly estimates parameters that appear in theoretical models, it should be particularly useful for predicting eco-evolutionary responses to environmental change. © 2015 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

AB  - Summary: How thermal tolerance estimated in the laboratory can be extrapolated to natural settings remains a contentious subject. Here, we argue that the general premise that a single temperature can accurately describe upper or lower tolerance limits is incorrect. Survival probability is determined by both the intensity and the duration of a thermal stress, and the association between these variables can be adequately conveyed by a thermal tolerance landscape. Employing this framework, we demonstrate that the temperature range that an organism can tolerate is expected to narrow down with the duration of the thermal challenge. Analyses suggest that a trade-off exists between tolerances to acute and chronic exposition to thermal stress, and that changes in temperature means or extremes may result in drastically different selective pressures and subsequent evolutionary responses. After controlling for the duration of the thermal challenge, we also uncover latitudinal effects on upper lethal temperatures in insects that remained unnoticed in previous broad-scale comparative analyses. Ultimately, critical thermal limits have been adopted in the ecological literature for logistic reasons and are inadequate descriptors of thermal tolerance on conceptual grounds. We consider that tolerance landscapes provide a more suitable framework to study temperature tolerance and its potential impact in ecological settings. © 2014 British Ecological Society.

TI  - Multiple extreme climatic events strengthen selection for earlier breeding in a wild passerine
VL  - 372
IS  - 1723
AB  - Global climate warming results in an increase in mean temperatures and in the frequency of extreme climatic events (ECEs), which could both strongly impact ecosystems and populations. Most studies assessing the impact of global warming on ecosystems have focused on warming trends while neglecting ECEs. In particular, the effects of multiple ECEs on fitness, and their consequences for selection, are still missing. Here we explored the effects of daily extreme rainfalls, as well as the occurrence of extremely hot and cold days, on clutch size and laying date in a wild blue tit population (Cyanistes caeruleus) monitored over 25 years. During the nestling phase (8–15 days old), the number of fledglings in a brood was negatively correlated with extremely hot days. The presence of extremely hot days between days 8 and 15 was also associated with an increase in the strength of selection acting on laying date, independently of mean temperature trends during the same period: when 10% of broods in the population experienced this type of ECE, selection for earlier breeding increased by 39%. Our results represent a unique quantification of the impact of multiple ECEs on the fitness landscape and emphasize their role as climatic drivers of selection.

AB  - Individual heterogeneity in life history shapes eco-evolutionary processes, and unobserved heterogeneity can affect demographic outputs characterising life history and population dynamical properties. Demographic frameworks like matrix models or integral projection models represent powerful approaches to disentangle mechanisms linking individual life histories and population-level processes. Recent developments have provided important steps towards their application to study eco-evolutionary dynamics, but so far individual heterogeneity has largely been ignored. Here, we present a general demographic framework that incorporates individual heterogeneity in a flexible way, by separating static and dynamic traits (discrete or continuous). First, we apply the framework to derive the consequences of ignoring heterogeneity for a range of widely used demographic outputs. A general conclusion is that besides the long-term growth rate lambda, all parameters can be affected. Second, we discuss how the framework can help advance current demographic models of eco-evolutionary dynamics, by incorporating individual heterogeneity. For both applications numerical examples are provided, including an empirical example for pike. For instance, we demonstrate that predicted demographic responses to climate warming can be reversed by increased heritability. We discuss how applications of this demographic framework incorporating individual heterogeneity can help answer key biological questions that require a detailed understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.

TI  - Prospects of 2nd generation biodiesel as a sustainable fuel - Part: 1 selection of feedstocks, oil extraction techniques and conversion technologies
VL  - 55
SP  - 1109-1128
AB  - The transport sector, which heavily depends on oil-derived liquid products such as gasoline and diesel, globally occupies the 3rd place when total energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are considered (after the industry and the building sectors). This consumption level is predicted to increase by 60% by 2030 mainly because of population growth, industrialization and exposure to better living standards. Biodiesel is one of the sustainable sources of energy for meeting increasing global transport energy demand and reducing GHG emissions significantly. The use of non-edible plant oils is very significant because it can be grown in harsh and marginal lands which require less maintenance, less soil fertility and less water as opposed to arable lands for growing edible vegetable oils. However, it is noted that the 2nd generation feedstocks can also be grown in arable lands, but this is not a general practice and is not recommended. The 2nd generation biodiesel can be considered as a promising alternative because of its feedstocks, such as non-edible vegetable oils, animal fats and waste cooking oils are cheaper in most of the countries in the world than the 1st generation feedstocks which are produced from edible-vegetable oils (food crops). Furthermore, the price of biodiesel depends on the cost of feedstocks which makes up 70-95% of the total production costs. However, extraction of non-edible oils as well as conversion process of oil into biodiesel should be well scrutinized. This paper extensively reviews on the selection of 2nd generation biodiesel feedstocks, oil extraction as well as biodiesel conversion techniques with the aim to identify the most appropriate and cost-effective feedstocks, identify the most suitable oil extraction technique and most efficient technology for producing of the 2nd generation biodiesel which will substitute the current dependence on the fossil fuel worldwide. This paper will contribute to greater understanding of the recent development and prospects of 2nd generation biodiesel as a sustainable transport fuel. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Polarized light from excitonic recombination in selectively etched GaN/AlN quantum dot ensembles on Si(111)
VL  - 44
IS  - 50
AB  - Multiple layers of GaN/AlN quantum dot (QD) ensembles were grown by the Stranski-Krastanov method on Si(111) using molecular beam epitaxy. During the subsequent cooling from growth temperature, the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the Si substrate and GaN/AlN film containing the vertically stacked QDs leads to an additional biaxial tensile stress of 20-30 kbar in the III-nitride film. We have selectively modified the thermal stress in the QD layers by etching a cross-hatched pattern into the as-grown sample using inductively coupled Cl-2/Ar plasma reactive ion etching. The results show that a suitable choice of stripe width from similar to 2 to 10 mu m and orientation along [11-20] and [1-100] can create regions of in-plane uniaxial stress that enable a selective and local control of the polarized luminescence from ensembles of QDs which were probed with cathodoluminescence. Experimental results indicate that the polarization anisotropy vanishes at high temperatures (similar to 300 K) with an increasing e-h pair excitation for the QDs, while the anisotropy decreases more slowly with excitation at low temperatures (similar to 46 K). A theoretical modelling of the effect of carrier filling on the polarization anisotropy and the excitonic transition energy was performed, as based on three-dimensional self-consistent solutions of the Schrodinger and Poisson equations using the 6x6 k.p and effective-mass methods for calculations of the e-h wavefunctions and electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels for varying levels of state filling. We attribute carrier filling and a thermal excitation of holes into higher energy QD hole states during e-h pair excitation to account for the observed gradual decrease in the polarization anisotropy with an increasing e-h pair excitation density at T = 300 K.

TI  - Sex ratio bias and extinction risk in an isolated population of tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus)
VL  - 9
IS  - 4
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms underlying population declines is critical for preventing the extinction of endangered populations. Positive feedbacks can hasten the process of collapse and create an 'extinction vortex,' particularly in small, isolated populations. We provide a case study of a male-biased sex ratio creating the conditions for extinction in a natural population of tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus ) on North Brother Island in the Cook Strait of New Zealand. We combine data from long term mark-recapture surveys, updated model estimates of hatchling sex ratio, and population viability modeling to measure the impacts of sex ratio skew. Results from the mark-recapture surveys show an increasing decline in the percentage of females in the adult tuatara population. Our monitoring reveals compounding impacts on female fitness through reductions in female body condition, fecundity, and survival as the male-bias in the population has increased. Additionally, we find that current nest temperatures are likely to result in more male than female hatchlings, owing to the pattern of temperature-dependent sex determination in tuatara where males hatch at warmer temperatures. Anthropogenic climate change worsens the situation for this isolated population, as projected temperature increases for New Zealand are expected to further skew the hatchling sex ratio towards males. Population viability models predict that without management intervention or an evolutionary response, the population will ultimately become entirely comprised of males and functionally extinct. Our study demonstrates that sex ratio bias can be an underappreciated threat to population viability, particularly in populations of long-lived organisms that appear numerically stable. © 2014 Grayson et al.

VL  - 26
IS  - 1
SP  - 31-42
AB  - Aim: Gymnosperms do not follow a latitudinal diversity gradient across the Northern Hemisphere but are influenced by geography at continental scales. Tolerance to physiological aridity is thought to be the main driver of this distribution, yet through evolutionary time conifers have also faced conditions of frost, shade and fire. We tested four predictions to evaluate how environmental stressors and geographical and evolutionary patterns of traits influence conifer distributions: (1) environmental variables related to aridity are most important in explaining geographical patterns of traits; (2) traits responsible for survival in stressful conditions have evolved under a niche conservatism constraint; (3) phylogenetic correlations among traits as the result of complex evolutionary responses to multiple abiotic stressors are widespread; (4) there are parallelisms between spatial trait associations and correlated trait evolution. Location: The conterminous United States. Methods: We combined conifer occurrences with 10 traits related to drought, freezing, shade and fire. The spatial distribution of traits was mapped and the relationship between environment and the geographical patterns of traits was explored. Niche conservatism was assessed comparing patterns of trait evolution against Brownian motion. We computed geographical and phylogenetic correlations among traits to determine the correspondence between spatial and evolutionary trade-offs. Results: (1) Maximum temperature followed by precipitation were the environmental variables that best described the geographical distributions of traits. (2) Most traits contain a phylogenetic signal consistent with niche conservatism: major exceptions being fire-related traits and frost tolerance. (3) Drought and shade tolerances show one of the strongest negative phylogenetic correlations. (4) The drought–shade tolerance trade-off is mirrored at the biogeographical scale. Main conclusions: Unlike in angiosperms, cold does not seem to have been a major driver in the evolutionary history of temperate conifers. A strong trade-off between drought and shade tolerance is the simplest explanation for understanding the current distribution of conifers in North America. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Successful recovery and stimulation of a long HP/HT horizontal well in one intervention: A case history of acid fracturing and new generation of diversion systems combination, middle marrat carbonate formation
VL  - 2017
AB  - The proper fracture stimulation of high-pressure/high-temperature (HP/HT) carbonate formations completed with horizontal wellbores is a challenging task for any operator or service company, particularly because of concerns associated with HP/HT, acid reactivity, completion and production equipment corrosion, and acid distribution. The case history presented in this paper describes the performance of an acid fracture intervention in a HP/HT well where, because of a number of problems encountered during the well construction stage, this intervention was the last procedure considered to evaluate the productivity of a Marrat formation well. In view of the stimulation challenges encountered, the architecture of the wellbore, and the intervention stimulation requirement to evaluate the productivity of the horizontal well completed in the Marrat formation, it was necessary to change the proppant fracture stimulation technique originally planned. Instead, it was decided that a selective acid fracture stimulation would be performed in the prospective part of the horizontal section where three long perforation clusters had been placed. Acidizing fracture stimulation was performed in one intervention using a next-generation liquid and soluble solid diversion system that enabled the generation of one selective fracture per perforation cluster. The planned acidizing fracture stimulation process was implemented properly in the field in accordance with the design constraints. The reactive fluid system diversion and the generation of a new fracture when the diversion system reached the perforation were clearly observed. The post-acid fractured well productivity index (PI) showed the high quality of the stimulation performed in a challenging environment, demonstrating the effectiveness of the new diversion system for creating selective fractures in a horizontal wellbore with multiple perforation clusters. Considering the well's architecture, HP/HT nature, and single intervention requirement, the case study documented in the paper can be helpful in the decision-making process when selecting a proper stimulation technique for challenging conditions. The effectiveness of the new diversion systems is also discussed. © 2017, Society of Petroleum Engineers.

AB  - Objective This review discusses the current status and progress in studies on the roles of hydrogen sulfide (H 2S) in regulation of neurotoxicity, neuroprotection, and neuromodulator, as well as its therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disorders. Data sources The data used in this review were mainly from Medline and PubMed published in English from 2001 to August 2011. The search terms were "hydrogen sulfide", "neuron", and "neurodegenerative disorders". Study selection Articles regarding the regulation of neuronal function, the protection against neuronal damage and neurological diseases, and their possible cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with H 2S were selected. Results The inhibited generation of endogenous H 2S is implicated in 1-methy-4-phenylpyridinium ion, 6-OHDA, and homocysteine-triggered neurotoxicity. H 2S elicits neuroprotection in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease models as well as protecting neurons against oxidative stress, ischemia, and hypoxia-induced neuronal death. H 2S offers anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, as well as activates ATP-sensitive potassium channels and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl - channels. H 2S regulates the long-term potentiation (LTP) and GABA B receptors in the hippocampus, as well as intracellular calcium and pH homeostasis in neurons and glia cells. Conclusions These articles suggest that endogenous H 2S may regulate the toxicity of neurotoxin. H 2S not only acts as a neuroprotectant but also serves as a novel neuromodulator.

TI  - Evolution of long larval life in the Australasian rock lobster Jasus edwardsii
VL  - 576
SP  - 69-87
AB  - The Australasian red (southern) rock lobster, Jasus edwardsii (Hutton, 1875), has a pelagic larval duration (PLD) of 18-20 mo, which may be the longest PLD of any crustacean. This PLD compares with 8-12 mo for 2 other species of rock lobster that occupy overlapping latitudinal ranges in Australia and New Zealand, Sagmariasus verreauxi and Panulirus cygnus. In this article, we examine 2 hypotheses using a Lagrangian individual-based bio-physical model (IBBM). The first hypothesis is that the long PLD of J. edwardsii occurs simply because it is a cool-water species, and its larvae require longer to develop in the cool ocean temperatures around southern Australia and New Zealand. The second hypothesis is that the long PLD of J. edwardsii evolved because some feature in the ocean circulation around Australia and New Zealand led to selection for longer larval duration. We find that potential settlement around Australia shows strong annual cycles with higher settlement in winter, probably caused by stronger onshore Ekman flow in winter. For larvae hatching in spring, those that can delay metamorphosis for 20-21 mo after hatching can take advantage of this higher potential settlement and thereby increase recruitment. Although we cannot exclude temperature as a factor in the evolution of long PLD, we suggest that the long PLD of J. edwardsii may well be an evolutionary response to these strong annual cycles of oceanic circulation that impact potential settlement. © Inter-Research 2017.

VL  - 51

AB  - Many organisms have complex life cycles with distinct life stages that experience different environmental conditions.How does the complexity of life cycles affect the ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms to climate change? We address this question by exploring several recent case studies and synthetic analyses of insects. First, different life stages may inhabit different microhabitats, and may differ in their thermal sensitivities and other traits that are important for responses to climate. For example, the life stages of Manduca experience different patterns of thermal and hydric variability, and differ in tolerance to high temperatures. Second, life stages may differ in their mechanisms for adaptation to local climatic conditions. For example, in Colias, larvae in different geographic populations and species adapt to local climate via differences in optimal and maximal temperatures for feeding and growth, whereas adults adapt via differences in melanin of the wings and in other morphological traits. Third, we extend a recent analysis of the temperature-dependence of insect population growth to demonstrate how changes in temperature can differently impact juvenile survival and adult reproduction. In both temperate and tropical regions, high rates of adult reproduction in a given environment may not be realized if occasional, high temperatures prevent survival to maturity. This suggests that considering the differing responses of multiple life stages is essential to understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of climate change. © The Author 2011.

VL  - 249
IS  - 1
SP  - 21-32
AB  - The mating strategy of Halicarcinus cookii was investigated to ascertain how males maximised their fitness through mate choice. An intertidal population at Kaikoura, New Zealand, was dominated by mature crabs of both sexes in summer and by immature crabs in the colder months. More than 95% of mature females were ovigerous with early stage and late stage broods found in almost every month, indicating that egg production and larval release is continuous. The operational sex ratio was less than 1 male/female in summer, but often more than 1.0 in the colder months. The gonosomatic index increased along with brood development so that as soon as zoeae were released, the next clutch of eggs was ready to be fertilised. Males searched for receptive females and began pre-copulatory mate guarding without any courtship display. They mated preferentially with late stage or non-ovigerous females: copulation duration was longest for stage 5 females as was post-copulatory guarding (mean 18.3 h). Late stage females were up to 14% of the female population. Mate attraction seems to be the result of an ovarian signal rather than from the developing brood. Manipulation of the sex ratio had effects upon copulation duration and post-copulatory guarding: presence of a rival male increased duration of guarding. Females showed precocious mating in the penultimate instar and were able to lay fertilised eggs after their pubertal moult in the absence of males. H. cookii females have many mates, but males attempt to ensure paternity by preferentially pursuing mature females close to egg laying and by guarding these females after copulation. These behaviours are all elements of a competitive strategy to ensure that a male loses (not wins) the race to copulate because females have a ventral seminal receptacle, giving sperm precedence to the last male to mate. Male mating behaviour is a consequence and evolutionary response to female morphology. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ocean acidification research in the 'post-genomic' era: Roadmaps from the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
VL  - 185
SP  - 33-42
AB  - Advances in nucleic acid sequencing technology are removing obstacles that historically prevented use of genomics within ocean change biology. As one of the first marine calcifiers to have its genome sequenced, purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) have been the subject of early research exploring genomic responses to ocean acidification, work that points to future experiments and illustrates the value of expanding genomic resources to other marine organisms in this new 'post-genomic' era. This review presents case studies of S. purpuratus demonstrating the ability of genomic experiments to address major knowledge gaps within ocean acidification. Ocean acidification research has focused largely on species vulnerability, and studies exploring mechanistic bases of tolerance toward low pH seawater are comparatively few. Transcriptomic responses to high pCO2 seawater in a population of urchins already encountering low pH conditions have cast light on traits required for success in future oceans. Secondly, there is relatively little information on whether marine organisms possess the capacity to adapt to oceans progressively decreasing in pH. Genomics offers powerful methods to investigate evolutionary responses to ocean acidification and recent work in S. purpuratus has identified genes under selection in acidified seawater. Finally, relatively few ocean acidification experiments investigate how shifts in seawater pH combine with other environmental factors to influence organism performance. In S. purpuratus, transcriptomics has provided insight into physiological responses of urchins exposed simultaneously to warmer and more acidic seawater. Collectively, these data support that similar breakthroughs will occur as genomic resources are developed for other marine species. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Climate change, phenological shifts, eco-evolutionary responses and population viability: Toward a unifying predictive approach
VL  - 55
IS  - 6
SP  - 905-919
AB  - The debate on emission targets of greenhouse gasses designed to limit global climate change has to take into account the ecological consequences. One of the clearest ecological consequences is shifts in phenology. Linking these shifts to changes in population viability under various greenhouse gasses emission scenarios requires a unifying framework. We propose a box-in-a-box modeling approach that couples population models to phenological change. This approach unifies population modeling with both ecological responses to climate change as well as evolutionary processes. We advocate a mechanistic embedded correlative approach, where the link from genes to population is established using a periodic matrix population model. This periodic model has several major advantages: (1) it can include complex seasonal behaviors allowing an easy link with phenological shifts; (2) it provides the structure of the population at each phase, including the distribution of genotypes and phenotypes, allowing a link with evolutionary processes; and (3) it can incorporate the effect of climate at different time periods. We believe that the way climatologists have approached the problem, using atmosphere-ocean coupled circulation models in which components are gradually included and linked to each other, can provide a valuable example to ecologists. We hope that ecologists will take up this challenge and that our preliminary modeling framework will stimulate research toward a unifying predictive model of the ecological consequences of climate change. © 2011 The Author(s).

TI  - Analysis of subjective assessment of thermal-humidity microclimatic conditions in selected production organizations
VL  - 68
IS  - 3
SP  - 77-86
AB  - The contribution presents basic groundwork and results of investigation reached in the authors' research. The authors deal with evaluation of physical factors of working environment, particularly noise, vibrations, illumination and thermal-humidity microclimatic conditions. Subjected and objective influences of these factors on human health are investigated. The microclimatic conditions of the working environment, also denominated as thermal-humidity conditions are determined by temperature, humidity and air flow. These parameters significantly influence the human subjective feeling, quality of relaxation as well as working productivity. That is why the authors set to investigate subjective feelings of the employees, who assessed the thermal-humidity conditions in selected production organizations. The attention was devoted to theoretical and empirical part of evaluating thermal-humidity microclimatic parameters of the working environment and their effects on the employees. A questionnaire survey was included in the evaluation and two areas were of interest: 1. thermal-humidity microclimatic conditions at the workplace; 2. health problems of the employees associated with the workplace conditions. Two hundred employees working in the production machinery organizations in eastern Slovakia participated in the research. The entry criterion for eligibility into the cohort was a good health state of the respondents, without any serious health problems. It has become obvious that there is a significant statistical relationship between some observed indices including the age of the employee and occurrence of the observed health problems (headache, the feeling of catching a cold, backache), as well as between the type of working activity and satisfaction with humidity at the workplace or the feeling of dried nasal mucosa. Results of the questionnaire survey also revealed a significant relationship between the type of working organization and thermal-humidity conditions at the workplace or the incidence of health problems of the respondents. Moreover, the authors observed a relationship between thermal-humidity microclimatic parameters and the feeling of fatigue and headache (or the feeling of catching cold, backache and the feeling of dry nasal mucosa). In evaluating the questionnaire survey the authors used statistical methods suitable for determination of relationship between the category characteristics.

TI  - Contrasting effects of climate change in continental vs. oceanic environments on population persistence and microevolution of Atlantic salmon
VL  - 19
IS  - 3
SP  - 711-723
AB  - Facing climate change (CC), species are prone to multiple modifications in their environment that can lead to extinction, migration or adaptation. Identifying the role and interplay of different potential stressors becomes a key question. Anadromous fishes will be exposed to both river and oceanic habitat changes. For Atlantic salmon, the river water temperature, river flow and oceanic growth conditions appear as three main stressing factors. They could act on population dynamics or as selective forces on life-history pathways. Using an individual-based demo-genetic model, we assessed the effects of these factors (1) to compare risks of extinction resulting from CC in river and ocean, and (2) to assess CC effects on life-history pathways including the evolution of underlying genetic control of phenotypic plasticity. We focused on Atlantic salmon populations from Southern Europe for a time horizon of three decades. We showed that CC in river alone should not lead to extinction of Southern European salmon populations. In contrast, the reduced oceanic growth appeared as a significant threat for population persistence. An increase in river flow amplitude increased the risk of local extinction in synergy with the oceanic effects, but river temperature rise reduced this risk. In terms of life-history modifications, the reduced oceanic growth increased the age of return of individuals through plastic and genetic responses. The river temperature rise increased the proportion of sexually mature parr, but the genetic evolution of the maturation threshold lowered the maturation rate of male parr. This was identified as a case of environmentally driven plastic response that masked an underlying evolutionary response of plasticity going in the opposite direction. We concluded that to counteract oceanic effects, river flow management represented the sole potential force to reduce the extinction probability of Atlantic salmon populations in Southern Europe, although this might not impede changes in migration life history. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

TI  - Persistent Unequal Sex Ratio in a Population of Grayling (Salmonidae) and Possible Role of Temperature Increase
VL  - 27
IS  - 1
SP  - 229-234
AB  - In some fishes, water chemistry or temperature affects sex determination or creates sex-specific selection pressures. The resulting population sex ratios are hard to predict from laboratory studies if the environmental triggers interact with other factors, whereas in field studies, singular observations of unusual sex ratios may be particularly prone to selective reporting. Long-term monitoring largely avoids these problems. We studied a population of grayling (Thymallus thymallus) in Lake Thun, Switzerland, that has been monitored since 1948. Samples of spawning fish have been caught about 3 times/week around spawning season, and water temperature at the spawning site has been continuously recorded since 1970. We used scale samples collected in different years to determine the average age of spawners (for life-stage specific analyses) and to identify the cohort born in 2003 (an extraordinarily warm year). Recent tissue samples were genotyped on microsatellite markers to test for genetic bottlenecks in the past and to estimate the genetically effective population size (Ne). Operational sex ratios changed from approximately 65% males before 1993 to approximately 85% males from 1993 to 2011. Sex ratios correlated with the water temperatures the fish experienced in their first year of life. Sex ratios were best explained by the average temperature juvenile fish experienced during their first summer. Grayling abundance is declining, but we found no evidence of a strong genetic bottleneck that would explain the apparent lack of evolutionary response to the unequal sex ratio. Results of other studies show no evidence of endocrine disruptors in the study area. Our findings suggest temperature affects population sex ratio and thereby contributes to population decline. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - Little is known about the tolerance mechanisms that reduce the negative effects of microbial infection on host fitness. Here, we demonstrate that the histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase G9a regulates tolerance to virus infection by shaping the response of the evolutionary conserved Jak-Stat pathway in Drosophila. G9a-deficient mutants are more sensitive to RNA virus infection and succumb faster to infection than wild-type controls, which was associated with strongly increased Jak-Stat dependent responses, but not with major differences in viral load. Genetic experiments indicate that hyperactivated Jak-Stat responses are associated with early lethality in virus-infected flies. Our results identify an essential epigenetic mechanism underlying tolerance to virus infection. © 2015 Merkling et al.

TI  - Contrasting latitudinal variations in vertebral number and sex determination in pacific versus Atlantic silverside fishes
IS  - 2
SP  - 341-350
AB  - Organisms that are distributed across spatial climate gradients often exhibit adaptive local variations in morphological and physiological traits, but to what extent such gradients shape evolutionary responses is still unclear. Given the strong natural contrast in latitudinal temperature gradients between the North-American Pacific and Atlantic coast, we asked how increases in vertebral number (VN, known as Jordan's Rule) with latitude would differ between Pacific (Atherinops affinis) and Atlantic Silversides (Menidia menidia), two ecologically equivalent and taxonomically similar fishes with similar latitudinal distributions. VN was determined from radiographs of wild-caught adults (genetic environmental differences) and its genetic basis confirmed by rearing offspring in common garden experiments. Compared to published data on VN variation in M. menidia (a mean increase of 7.0 vertebrae from 32 to 46°N, VN slope 0.42 lat-1), the latitudinal VN increase in Pacific Silversides was approximately half as strong (a mean increase of 3.3 vertebrae from 28 to 43°N, VN slope 0.23 lat-1). This mimicked the strong Atlantic (1.11°C lat-1) versus weak Pacific latitudinal gradient (0.40°C lat-1) in median annual sea surface temperature (SST). Importantly, the relationship of VN to SST was not significantly different between the two species (average slope -0.39 vertebrae°C-1), thus suggesting a common thermal dependency of VN in silverside fishes. Our findings provide novel support for the hypothesis that temperature gradients are the ultimate cause of Jordan's Rule, even though its exact adaptive significance remains speculative. A second investigated trait, the mode of sex determination in Atlantic versus Pacific Silversides, revealed patterns that were inconsistent with our expectation: M. menidia displays temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) at low latitudes, where growing seasons are long or unconstrained, but also a gradual shift to genetic sex determination (GSD) with increasing latitude due to more and more curtailed growing seasons. Sex ratios in A. affinis, on the other hand, were independent of latitude and rearing temperature (indicating GSD), even though growing seasons are thermally unconstrained across most of the geographical distribution of A. affinis. This suggests that additional factors (e.g., longevity) play an important role in shaping the mode of sex determination in silverside fishes. © 2012 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists.

AB  - The aquatic environment of fish can vary over developmental and evolutionary time scales, eliciting responses at levels of organization ranging from the gene to the whole-animal (Johnston and Wilson, 2006). Temperature and environmental variables such as oxygen availability, pH, salinity, pollution and turbidity can directly and/or indirectly influence physiological processes and behaviour in fish (Bennett, 1990; Prosser, 1991). Many of these factors, such incidences of hypoxia and pollution, are also becoming more commonplace in coastal areas, and can have profound effects on fish swimming behavior (Domenici et al., 2007a). Although numerous studies have successfully elucidated the functional consequences of environmental variation on locomotion, and their underlying mechanisms, the link between such variation and fitness is not often established (Garland and Carter, 1994; Irschick and Garland, 2001; Wilson, 2005). In this context, studies of prey capture/escape success and reproductive performance are also likely to be of direct relevance. © 2010 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Spatially organized aggregation of misfolded proteins as cellular stress defense strategy
VL  - 427
IS  - 7
SP  - 1564-1574
AB  - An evolutionary conserved response of cells to proteotoxic stress is the organized sequestration of misfolded proteins into subcellular deposition sites. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three major sequestration sites for misfolded proteins exist, IPOD (insoluble protein deposit), INQ (intranuclear quality control compartment) [former JUNQ (juxtanuclear quality control compartment)] and CytoQ. IPOD is perivacuolar and predominantly sequesters amyloidogenic proteins. INQ and CytoQs are stress-induced deposits for misfolded proteins residing in the nucleus and the cytosol, respectively, and requiring cell-compartment-specific aggregases, nuclear Btn2 and cytosolic Hsp42 for formation. The organized aggregation of misfolded proteins is proposed to serve several purposes collectively increasing cellular fitness and survival under proteotoxic stress. These include (i) shielding of cellular processes from interference by toxic protein conformers, (ii) reducing the substrate burden for protein quality control systems upon immediate stress, (iii) orchestrating chaperone and protease functions for efficient repair or degradation of damaged proteins [this involves initial extraction of aggregated molecules via the Hsp70/Hsp104 bi-chaperone system followed by either refolding or proteasomal degradation or removal of entire aggregates by selective autophagy (aggrephagy) involving the adaptor protein Cue5] and (iv) enabling asymmetric retention of protein aggregates during cell division, thereby allowing for damage clearance in daughter cells. Regulated protein aggregation thus serves cytoprotective functions vital for the maintenance of cell integrity and survival even under adverse stress conditions and during aging. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The impact of spatial structure on viral genomic diversity generated during adaptation to thermal stress
VL  - 9
IS  - 2
AB  - Background: Most clinical and natural microbial communities live and evolve in spatially structured environments. When changes in environmental conditions trigger evolutionary responses, spatial structure can impact the types of adaptive response and the extent to which they spread. In particular, localized competition in a spatial landscape can lead to the emergence of a larger number of different adaptive trajectories than would be found in well-mixed populations. Our goal was to determine how two levels of spatial structure affect genomic diversity in a population and how this diversity is manifested spatially. Methodology/Principal Findings: We serially transferred bacteriophage populations growing at high temperatures (40°C) on agar plates for 550 generations at two levels of spatial structure. The level of spatial structure was determined by whether the physical locations of the phage subsamples were preserved or disrupted at each passage to fresh bacterial host populations. When spatial structure of the phage populations was preserved, there was significantly greater diversity on a global scale with restricted and patchy distribution. When spatial structure was disrupted with passaging to fresh hosts, beneficial mutants were spread across the entire plate. This resulted in reduced diversity, possibly due to clonal interference as the most fit mutants entered into competition on a global scale. Almost all substitutions present at the end of the adaptation in the populations with disrupted spatial structure were also present in the populations with structure preserved. Conclusions/Significance: Our results are consistent with the patchy nature of the spread of adaptive mutants in a spatial landscape. Spatial structure enhances diversity and slows fixation of beneficial mutants. This added diversity could be beneficial in fluctuating environments. We also connect observed substitutions and their effects on fitness to aspects of phage biology, and we provide evidence that some substitutions exclude each other. © 2014 Ally et al.

TI  - Pursuing best cost solar concentration
VL  - 1
SP  - 665-698
AB  - Solar concentrating systems offer the hope of being the most cost-effective method of capturing and utilizing solar energy, but the fact remains that traditional combustionbased generation of thermal and electrical energy is still considerably less expensive for the typical industrial user. Government incentives help to close this cost gap, as will future cap and trade markets for the CO2 and other greenhouse gases resulting from competing combustion processes. Large solar developers base their business models strongly on the leverage provided by these incentives, but most small to medium sized industrial companies still make decisions regarding electrical and thermal energy needs based on simple return on investment calculations. The recent recession has brought this home, as companies are compelled to select the most economical thermal and electrical power generation possible in order to survive. The public relations advantages of "being green" are difficult to justify for the typical industrial user in these tough economic times. This paper discusses one method of closing the cost gap between traditional and solar power generation- achieving best cost concentration of solar energy though the use of film-based reflective materials incorporated into a point focus concentrating dish design with sun tracking capability. The cost advantages of reflective films are considerable in comparison to traditional mirrors using glass substrates (thick or thin), and film production also leaves a significantly lower carbon footprint. Point focus implementation offers lower radiant thermal losses compared to line focus/ trough-based systems. A lightweight yet strong dish design enables a very low mass for the tracking structure to move, and a weathervaning stowage mode protects the dishes from high wind and hail events. The ability to dynamically adjust focal length on the dishes offers flexibility in implementation, and also provides the ability to quickly return dishes to a safe unfocused condition in the event that tracking control is lost. Reflective film or "stretched membrane" reflectors have been well-studied in the past as a method of concentrating solar energy. This paper will discuss the problems experienced designing focusing systems utilizing reflective films, and cover the author's latest improvements. An operational 1/4 scale model of a 4-dish system with tracking apparatus will be discussed, along with thermal and survival testing of this unit in heavy wind conditions. The resulting concentrating solar system is configured as a "dish/thermal" system, with two possible thermal receiver arrangements. One design will contain an integral receiver mounted to the tracking frame which will maintain direct on-axis orientation to the reflected radiation from the sun. Another design is for a stationary receiver mounted to a small scalable power tower, fed by multiple focusing tracking structures. In summary, this paper will discuss an important, yet rarely discussed problem with solar energy- the continued high substitution cost for solar energy over traditional combustion-based generation. One method of lowering the delivered cost of concentrated solar energy will be discussed, with test results presented for a concentrating dish design utilizing durable reflective film, and mounted to a lightweight tracking structure. Survival testing in high winds will be presented. A thermal receiver design integral to the tracking structure will be discusses, as well as a single receiver mounted to a mini-tower.

AB  - Introduction: Pinus is a diverse genus of trees widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Understanding pine life history is critical to both conservation and fire management. Objectives: Here I lay out the different pathways of pine life history adaptation and a brief overview of pine evolution and the very significant role that fire has played. Results: Pinus originated ∼150 Ma in the mid-Mesozoic Era and radiated across the northern continent of Laurasia during the Cretaceous Period. Pines have followed two evolutionary strategies interpreted as responses to competition by the newly emerging angiosperms. The Strobus lineage mostly has radiated into stressful sites of low nutrient soils and extremes in cold or heat. The Pinus (subgenus) lineage has radiated into fire-prone landscapes with diverse fire regimes. Examination of life history traits illustrates syndromes associated with fire-avoider, fire-tolerater, fire-embracer, and fire-refuge strategies. Conclusion: Understanding the current pattern of pine distribution requires interpreting their evolution in terms of climate, geology, and fire. All three of these factors have played a role since the Mesozoic origin of the genus. All are important to the appropriate management of these resources. © INRA /Springer-Verlag France 2012.

TI  - Novel transcriptome resources for three scleractinian coral species from the Indo-Pacific
VL  - 6
IS  - 9
AB  - Transcriptomic resources for coral species can provide insight into coral evolutionary history and stress-response physiology. Goniopora columna, Galaxea astreata, and Galaxea acrhelia are scleractinian corals of the Indo-Pacific, representing a diversity of morphologies and life-history traits. G. columna and G. astreata are common and cosmopolitan, while G. acrhelia is largely restricted to the coral triangle and Great Barrier Reef. Reference transcriptomes for these species were assembled from replicate colony fragments exposed to elevated (31 degrees C) and ambient (27 degrees C) temperatures. Trinity was used to create de novo assemblies for each species from 92-102 million raw Illumina Hiseq 2 x 150 bp reads. Host-specific assemblies contained 65 460-72 405 contigs, representing 26 693-37 894 isogroups (similar to genes) with an average N50 of 2254. Gene name and/or gene ontology annotations were possible for 58% of isogroups on average. Transcriptomes contained 93.1-94.3% of EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups comprising the core eukaryotic gene set, and 89.98-91.92% of the single-copy metazoan core gene set orthologs were complete, indicating fairly comprehensive assemblies. This work expands the complement of transcriptomic resources available for scleractinian coral species, including the first reference for a representative of Goniopora spp. as well as species with novel morphology.

TI  - Ecological and evolutionary response of Tethyan planktonic foraminifera to the middle Eocene climatic optimum (MECO) from the Alano section (NE Italy)
VL  - 292
IS  - 1
SP  - 82-95
AB  - The enigmatic middle Eocene climatic optimum (MECO) is a transient (similar to 500 kyr) warming event that significantly interrupted at similar to 40 Ma the long-term cooling through the middle and late Eocene, eventually resulting in establishment of permanent Antarctic ice-sheet. This event is still poorly known and data on the biotic response are so far scarce Here we present a detailed planktonic foraminiferal analysis of the MECO Interval from a marginal basin of the central-western Tethys (Alano section, northeastern Italy). The expanded and continuous Alano section provides an excellent record of this event and offers an appealing opportunity to better understand the role of climate upon calcareous plankton evolution A sapropel-like interval, characterized by excursions in both the carbon and oxygen bulk-carbonate Isotope records, represents the lithological expression of the post-MECO event in the study area and follows the 6180 negative shift, Interpreted as representing the MECO warming. High-resolution quantitative analysis performed on both >38 mu m and >63 mu m fractions reveals pronounced and complex changes in planktonic foraminiferal assemblages indicating a strong environmental perturbation that parallels the variations of the stable isotope curves corresponding to the MECO and post-MECO Intervals These changes consist primarily in a marked increase in abundance of the relatively eutrophic subbotinids and of the small, low-oxygen tolerant Streptochilus. Chiloguembelina and Pseudohastigerina At the same time, the arrival of the abundant opportunist eutrophic Jenkinsina and Pseudoglobigerinella bolivariana, typical species of very high-productivity areas, also occurs. The pronounced shift from oligotrophic to more eutrophic, opportunist, low-oxygen tolerant planktonic foraminiferal assemblages suggests increased nutrient input and surface ocean productivity in response to the environmental perturbation associated with the MECO. Particularly critical environmental conditions have been reached during the deposition of the sapropel-like beds as testified by the presence of common giant and/or odd morphotypes. This is Interpreted as evidence of transient alteration in the ocean chemistry. The enhanced surface water productivity inferred by planktonic foraminiferal assemblages at the onset of the event should have resulted in heavier delta C-13 values. The recorded lightening of the carbon stable isotope preceding the maximum warmth therefore represents a robust indication that it derives principally by a conspicuous increase of pCO(2). The increased productivity of surface waters, also supported by geochemical data, may have acted as mechanism for pCO(2) reduction and returned the climate system to the general Eocene cooling trend. The oxygen-depleted deep waters and the organic carbon burial following the peak of the MECO event represent the local response to the MECO warming and suggest that high sequestration of organic matter, if representing a widespread response to this event, might have contributed to the decrease of pCO(2) as well. Though the true mechanisms are still obscure, several lines of evidence indicate a potential pressure on planktonic foraminiferal evolution during the MECO event including permanent changes besides transient and ecologically controlled variations.

TI  - The evolution of phenotypic plasticity under global change
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
AB  - Marine ecosystems are currently in a state of flux, with ocean warming and acidification occurring at unprecedented rates. Phenotypic plasticity underpins acclimatory responses by shifting the mean phenotype in a population, which may buffer the negative effects of global change. However, little is known about how phenotypic plasticity evolves across multiple generations. We tested this by reciprocally-transplanting the polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica between control and global change scenarios (ocean warming and acidification in isolation and combined) over five generations. By comparing the reaction norms of four life-history traits across generations, we show that juvenile developmental rate in the combined scenario was the only trait that changed its plastic response across generations when transplanted back to control conditions, and that adaptive plasticity was conserved in most traits, despite significant levels of selection and strong declines in individual fitness in the multi-generational exposure. We suggest the change in level of plasticity in the combined scenario is caused by differential allocation of energy between the mean and the plasticity of the trait along the multigenerational exposure. The ability to maintain within-generational levels of plasticity under global change scenarios has important eco-evolutionary and conservation implications, which are examined under the framework of assisted evolution programs. © 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Fitness costs of thermal reaction norms for wing melanisation in the large white butterfly (Pieris brassicae)
VL  - 9
IS  - 2
AB  - The large white butterfly, Pieris brassicae, shows a seasonal polyphenism of wing melanisation, spring individuals being darker than summer individuals. This phenotypic plasticity is supposed to be an adaptive response for thermoregulation in natural populations. However, the variation in individuals' response, the cause of this variation (genetic, non genetic but inheritable or environmental) and its relationship with fitness remain poorly known. We tested the relationships between thermal reaction norm of wing melanisation and adult lifespan as well as female fecundity. Butterflies were reared in cold (18°C), moderate (22°C), and hot (26°C) temperatures over three generations to investigate variation in adult pigmentation and the effects of maternal thermal environment on offspring reaction norms. We found a low heritability in wing melanisation (h2 = 0.18). Rearing families had contrasted thermal reaction norms. Adult lifespan of males and females from highly plastic families was shorter in individuals exposed to hot developmental temperature. Also, females from plastic families exhibited lower fecundity. We did not find any effect of maternal or grand-maternal developmental temperature on fitness. This study provides new evidence on the influence of phenotypic plasticity on life history-traits' evolution, a crucial issue in the context of global change. © 2014 Chaput-Bardy et al.

TI  - Multigenerational contaminant exposures produce non-monotonic, transgenerational responses in Daphnia magna
VL  - 207
SP  - 176-182
AB  - Generally, ecotoxicologists rely on short-term tests that assume populations to be static. Conversely, natural populations may be exposed to the same stressors for many generations, which can alter tolerance to the same (or other) stressors. The objective of this study was to improve our understanding of how multigenerational stressors alter life history traits and stressor tolerance. After continuously exposing Daphnia magna to cadmium for 120 days, we assessed life history traits and conducted a challenge at higher temperature and cadmium concentrations. Predictably, individuals exposed to cadmium showed an overall decrease in reproductive output compared to controls. Interestingly, control D. magna were the most cadmium tolerant to novel cadmium, followed by those exposed to high cadmium. Our data suggest that long-term exposure to cadmium alter tolerance traits in a non-monotonic way. Because we observed effects after one-generation removal from cadmium, transgenerational effects may be possible as a result of multigenerational exposure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Differential effects of developmental thermal plasticity across three generations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata): Canalization and anticipatory matching
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
AB  - Developmental plasticity can match offspring phenotypes to environmental conditions experienced by parents. Such epigenetic modifications are advantageous when parental conditions anticipate offspring environments. Here we show firstly, that developmental plasticity manifests differently in males and females. Secondly, that under stable conditions, phenotypic responses (metabolism and locomotion) accumulate across several generations. Metabolic scope in males was greater at warmer test temperatures (26-36 °C) in offspring bred at warm temperatures (29-30 °C) compared to those bred at cooler temperatures (22-23 °C), lending support to the predictive adaptive hypothesis. However, this transgenerational matching was not established until the second (F2) generation. For other responses, e.g. swimming performance in females, phenotypes of offspring bred in different thermal environments were different in the first (F1) generation, but became more similar across three generations, implying canalization. Thirdly, when environments changed across generations, the grandparental environment affected offspring phenotypes. In females, the mode of the swimming thermal performance curve shifted to coincide with the grandparental rather than the parental or offspring developmental environments, and this lag in response may represent a cost of plasticity. These findings show that the effects of developmental plasticity differ between traits, and may be modulated by the different life histories of males and females. © The Author(s) 2017.

TI  - Synergy effects of fluoxetine and variability in temperature lead to proportionally greater fitness costs in Daphnia: A multigenerational test
VL  - 193
SP  - 268-275
AB  - Increased variability in water temperature is predicted to impose disproportionally greater fitness costs than mean increase in temperature. Additionally, water contaminants are currently a major source of human-induced stress likely to produce fitness costs. Global change models forecast an increase in these two human-induced stressors. Yet, in spite the growing interest in understanding how organisms respond to global change, the joint fitness effects of water pollution and increased variability in temperature remain unclear. Here, using a multigenerational design, we test the hypothesis that exposure to high concentrations of fluoxetine, a human medicine commonly found in freshwater systems, causes increased lifetime fitness costs, when associated with increased variability in temperature. Although fluoxetine and variability in temperature elicited some fitness cost when tested alone, when both stressors acted together the costs were disproportionally greater. The combined effect of fluoxetine and variability in temperature led to a reduction of 37% in lifetime reproductive success and a 17.9% decrease in population growth rate. Interestingly, fluoxetine and variability in temperature had no effect on the probability of survival. Freshwater systems are among the most imperilled ecosystems, often exposed to multiple human-induced stressors. Our results indicate that organisms face greater fitness risk when exposed to multiple stressors at the same time than when each stress acts alone. Our study highlights the importance of using a multi-generational approach to fully understand individual environmental tolerance and its responses to a global change scenario in aquatic systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Cold Temperatures Increase Cold Hardiness in the Next Generation Ophraella communa Beetles
VL  - 8
IS  - 9
AB  - The leaf beetle, Ophraella communa, has been introduced to control the spread of the common ragweed, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, in China. We hypothesized that the beetle, to be able to track host-range expansion into colder climates, can phenotypically adapt to cold temperatures across generations. Therefore, we questioned whether parental experience of colder temperatures increases cold tolerance of the progeny. Specifically, we studied the demography, including development, fecundity, and survival, as well as physiological traits, including supercooling point (SCP), water content, and glycerol content of O. communa progeny whose parents were maintained at different temperature regimes. Overall, the entire immature stage decreased survival of about 0.2%-4.2% when parents experienced cold temperatures compared to control individuals obtained from parents raised at room temperature. However, intrinsic capacity for increase (r), net reproductive rate (R0) and finite rate of increase (λ) of progeny O. communa were maximum when parents experienced cold temperatures. Glycerol contents of both female and male in progeny was significantly higher when maternal and paternal adults were cold acclimated as compared to other treatments. This resulted in the supercooling point of the progeny adults being significantly lower compared to beetles emerging from parents that experienced room temperatures. These results suggest that cold hardiness of O. communa can be promoted by cold acclimation in previous generation, and it might counter-balance reduced survival in the next generation, especially when insects are tracking their host-plants into colder climates. © 2013 Zhou et al.

TI  - Can acclimation of thermal tolerance, in adults and across generations, act as a buffer against climate change in tropical marine ectotherms?
VL  - 68
SP  - 195-199
AB  - Thermal acclimation capacity was investigated in adults of three tropical marine invertebrates, the subtidal barnacle Striatobalanus amaryllis, the intertidal gastropod Volegalea cochlidium and the intertidal barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite. To test the relative importance of transgenerational acclimation, the developmental acclimation capacity of A. amphitrite was investigated in F-1 and F-2 generations reared at a subset of the same incubation temperatures. The increase in CTmax (measured through loss of key behavioural metrics) of F-0 adults across the incubation temperature range 25.4-33.4 degrees C was low: 0.00 degrees C (V. cochlidium), 0.05 degrees C (S. amaryllis) and 0.06 degrees C (A. amphitrite) per 1 degrees C increase in incubation temperature (the acclimation response ratio; ARR). Although the effect of generation was not significant, across the incubation temperature range of 29.4-33.4 degrees C, the increase in CTmax in the F-1 (0.30 degrees C) and F-2 (0.15 degrees C) generations of A. amphitrite was greater than in the F-0 (0.10 degrees C). These correspond to ARR's of 0.03 degrees C (F-0), 0.08 degrees C (F-1) and 0.04 degrees C (F-2), respectively. The variability in CTmax between individuals in each treatment was maintained across generations, despite the high mortality of progeny. Further research is required to investigate the potential for transgenerational acclimation to provide an extra buffer for tropical marine species facing climate warming.

TI  - Reduction in the cumulative effect of stress-induced inbreeding depression due to intragenerational purging in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 116
IS  - 3
SP  - 304-313
AB  - Environmental stress generally exacerbates the harmful effects of inbreeding and it has been proposed that this could be exploited in purging deleterious alleles from threatened inbred populations. However, understanding what factors contribute to variability in the strength of inbreeding depression (ID) observed across adverse environmental conditions remains a challenge. Here, we examined how the nature and timing of stress affects ID and the potential for purging using inbred and outbred Drosophila melanogaster larvae exposed to biotic (larval competition, bacteria infection) and abiotic (ethanol, heat) stressors compared with unstressed controls. ID was measured during (larval survival) and after (male mating success) stress exposure. The level of stress imposed by each stressor was approximately equal, averaging a 42% reduction in outbred larval survival relative to controls. All stressors induced on average the same ID, causing a threefold increase in lethal equivalents for larval survival relative to controls. However, stress-induced ID in larval success was followed by a 30% reduction in ID in mating success of surviving males. We propose that this fitness recovery is due to 'intragenerational purging' whereby fitness correlations facilitate stress-induced purging that increases the average fitness of survivors in later life history stages. For biotic stressors, post-stress reductions in ID are consistent with intragenerational purging, whereas for abiotic stressors, there appeared to be an interaction between purging and stress-induced physiological damage. For all stressors, there was no net effect of stress on lifetime ID compared with unstressed controls, undermining the prediction that stress enhances the effectiveness of population-level purging across generations. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - Comparative studies on the life history characteristics of two Brachionus calyciflorus strains belonging to the same cryptic species
VL  - 69
SP  - 138-144
AB  - The life history characteristics of rotifers usually vary at different temperatures, depending on their species or strains. However, differences in the adaptability of rotifers sampled from two climatic zones and belonging to the same cryptic species in response to temperature changes remain undescribed. In this study, the phylogenetic relationships of Brachionus calyciflorus collecting from two climatic zones were reconstructed, and two clones of the same potential cryptic species were selected as representatives of two populations. The life history charatteristics of the two B. calyciflorus strains were comparatively studied at four different temperatures (20 degrees C, 24 degrees C, 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C). The results showed that the responses of the life history traits of B. calyciflorus to temperature were strain-dependent. The Xishuangbanna strain is more suitable for growth at the higher temperature and that the Kunming strain grows preferentially at the lower temperature. Temperature significantly affected the durations of all developmental stages, offspring production, life expectancy at hatching, age-specific fecundity and survivorship of the two strains, which adopted the identical life history strategy (high population growth and low survivorship with increasing temperature). The discrimination of cryptic species is necessary to test the ecological or evolutionary characteristics of species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multigenerational maternal inhibition of prepupal diapause in two Trichogramma species (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)
VL  - 81
SP  - 14-20
AB  - It is known that in some insect species the incidence of diapause among the progeny of females that had undergone diapause is relatively low or zero even under strong diapause-inducing conditions. Moreover, the maternal inhibition, preventing the induction of a maladaptive diapause in spring, can persist over several generations. This multigenerational effect based on hypothetical 'interval timer' was thoroughly studied in Aphididae. We first described a similar phenomenon in Hymenoptera: laboratory experiments demonstrated that the proportion of diapausing progeny of Trichogramma females that had undergone diapause was practically zero independently of photoperiodic and temperature conditions used (day lengths of 12 and 18 h and temperatures of 12-15 degrees C). Then the ability to enter diapause recovered gradually and returned to the normal level over two (in Trichogramma telengai) or even five (in Trichogramma principium) generations. We conclude that the observed effect may be based on an interval timer similar to that in aphids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Selecting for rust (Puccinia psidii) resistance in Eucalyptus grandis in São Paulo State, Brazil
VL  - 303
SP  - 91-97
AB  - In Brazil, Eucalyptus grandis is a key species for wood production. However, some genotypes are susceptible to rust (Puccinia psidii), mainly in Sao Paulo State, where climatic conditions are favorable for its development. Rust represents a high economic risk to forest companies because of the high potential of damage to commercial eucalypt plantations. The aims of the present study were (i) to select progenies of E. grandis for stability and adaptability regarding resistance to rust at different locations; (ii) compare the selections under these different climatic conditions; and (iii) compare rust severity in the field with the theoretical model. We observed that climatic conditions were extremely influential factors for rust development, but even under favorable conditions for disease development, we found rust-resistant progenies. In sites unfavorable for rust development, we detected highly susceptible progenies. We found significant correlation among the genetic material, environmental conditions and disease symptoms, however, we observed a simple genotype-environmental interaction and significant genetic variability among the progenies. The average heritability was high among the progenies in all sites, indicating substantial genetic control for rust resistance. We also observed a good relationship between rust severity in the field and the theoretical model that considered annual average temperature and leaf wetness. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Temperature-sensitive fitness cost of insecticide resistance in Chinese populations of the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella
VL  - 24
IS  - 7
SP  - 1611-1627
AB  - Alleles conferring a higher adaptive value in one environment may have a detrimental impact on fitness in another environment. Alleles conferring resistance to pesticides and drugs provide textbook examples of this trade-off as, in addition to conferring resistance to these molecules, they frequently decrease fitness in pesticide/drug-free environments. We show here that resistance to chlorpyrifos, an organophosphate (OP), in Chinese populations of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, is conferred by two mutations of ace1 - the gene encoding the acetylcholinesterase enzyme targeted by OPs - affecting the amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein. These mutations were always linked, consistent with the segregation of a single resistance allele, ace1R, carrying both mutations, in the populations studied. We monitored the frequency of ace1R (by genotyping more than 20 000 adults) and the level of resistance (through bioassays on more than 50 000 individuals) over several generations. We found that the ace1R resistance allele was costly in the absence of insecticide and that this cost was likely recessive. This fitness costs involved a decrease in fecundity: females from resistant strains laid 20% fewer eggs, on average, than females from susceptible strains. Finally, we found that the fitness costs associated with the ace1R allele were greater at high temperatures. At least two life history traits were involved: longevity and fecundity. The relative longevity of resistant individuals was affected only at high temperatures and the relative fecundity of resistant females - which was already affected at temperatures optimal for development - decreased further at high temperatures. The implications of these findings for resistance management are discussed. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Life-history plasticity in anadromous brown trout: A Norwegian perspective
SP  - 251-265
AB  - The wide geographical distribution of brown trout Salmo trutta demonstrates a species with considerable plasticity as well as adaptability in various life history traits. Plasticity is the ability to respond phenotypically to abiotic and biotic factors. The Norwegian rivers running into salt water situated at 58-71 °N, 5-30 °E vary significantly in physical conditions - such as discharge, water temperature and length of passable river reaches. These conditions give rise to a large matrix of physical conditions for the anadromous brown trout inhabiting and using these rivers as spawning and rearing habitats. We address some important life history traits and show how these vary at a latitudinal and elevation scale. Age at smolting, sea age at sexual maturity and longevity demonstrate a significant positive latitudinal cline. Considerable variation in life history traits also occurs within river systems. Sea age and length at sexual maturity increases whereas fecundity decreases with increasing length of river migration. Time of smolt descent appears later in spring in northern than southern rivers, as well as the descent is becoming earlier in later years. The plasticity may make anadromous brown trout robust to climate changes. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Thermal environment and maternal effects shape egg size in a freshwater fish
VL  - 7
IS  - 5
AB  - Offspring size determines offspring survival rates; thus, understanding factors influencing offspring size variability could elucidate variation in population dynamics. Offspring size variation is influenced through multigenerational adaptation to local environments and within-lifetime plastic responses to environmental variability and maternal effects among individuals. Moreover, offspring size variation may represent trade-offs in energy allocation within individuals that influence lifetime reproductive success. However, the mechanisms whereby environmental conditions influence offspring size, e.g., via inducing adaptive and plastic variation in population-scale maternal effects, remain poorly understood. We evaluated intra-specific variation in maternal effects, egg size, and intra-individual egg size variation in six populations of walleye (Sander vitreus) and related among-and within-population patterns to thermal conditions. Egg size was conserved within populations and negatively related to long-term thermal conditions among populations, while maternal effect strengths were positively related to thermal conditions, suggesting that populations inhabiting warmer environments adapted to produce smaller eggs but stronger maternal effects. Within a population, egg size was positively related to colder winters, suggesting cold winters may alter egg size through effects on maternal condition or as an adaptive maternal effect to improve offspring survival. Intra-individual egg size variation varied little among populations or with female size, but declined with increasing summer and decreasing winter temperatures. Our result suggests that environmental conditions could impact not only short-term offspring production but also spur adaptive changes in offspring phenotypes. Thus, it is necessary to account for adaptive responses to predict population dynamics under environmental changes. © 2016 Feiner et al.

TI  - Transgenerational responses of molluscs and echinoderms to changing ocean conditions
VL  - 73
IS  - 3
SP  - 537-549
AB  - We are beginning to understand how the larvae of molluscs and echinoderms with complex life cycles will be affected by climate change. Early experiments using short-term exposures suggested that larvae in oceans predicted to increase in acidification and temperature will be smaller in size, take longer to develop, and have a greater incidence of abnormal development. More realistic experiments which factored in the complex life cycles of molluscs and echinoderms found impacts not as severe as predicted. This is because the performance of one life history stage led to a significant carryover effect on the subsequent life history stage. Carryover effects that arise within a generation, for example, embryonic and larval stages, can influence juvenile and adult success. Carryover effects can also arise across a generation, known as transgenerational plasticity (TGP). A transgenerational response or TGP can be defined as a phenotypic change in offspring in response to the environmental stress experienced by a parent before fertilization. In the small number of experiments which have measured the transgenerational response of molluscs and echinoderms to elevated CO2, TGP has been observed in the larval offspring. If we are to safeguard ecological and economically significant mollusc and echinoderm species against climate change then we require more knowledge of the impacts that carryover effects have within and across generations as well as an understanding of the underlying mechanisms responsible for such adaptation. © International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2016.

VL  - 84

SP  - 702-711
AB  - Environmental variation can induce life-history changes that can last over a large part of the lifetime of an organism. If multiple demographic traits are affected, expected changes in climate may influence environmental covariances among traits in a complex manner. Thus, examining the consequences of environmental fluctuations requires that individual information at multiple life stages is available, which is particularly challenging in long-lived species. Here, we analyse how variation in climatic conditions occurring in the year of hatching of female goshawks Accipiter gentilis (L.) affects age-specific variation in demographic traits and lifetime reproductive success (LRS). LRS decreased with increasing temperature in April in the year of hatching, due to lower breeding frequency and shorter reproductive life span. In contrast, the probability for a female to successfully breed was higher in years with a warm April, but lower LRS of the offspring in these years generated a negative covariance among fecundity rates among generations. The mechanism by which climatic conditions generated cohort effects was likely through influencing the quality of the breeding segment of the population in a given year, as the proportion of pigeons in the diet during the breeding period was positively related to annual and LRS, and the diet of adult females that hatched in warm years contained fewer pigeons. Climatic conditions experienced during different stages of individual life histories caused complex patterns of environmental covariance among demographic traits even across generations. Such environmental covariances may either buffer or amplify impacts of climate change on population growth, emphasizing the importance of considering demographic changes during the complete life history of individuals when predicting the effect of climatic change on population dynamics of long-lived species. © 2014 The Authors.

VL  - 6
AB  - Boreal coniferous species with wide geographic distributions show substantial variation in autumn cold acclimation among populations. To determine how this variation is inherited across generations, we conducted a progeny test and examined the development of cold hardening in open-pollinated second-generation (F2) progeny of Abies sachalinensis. The F1 parents had different genetic backgrounds resulting from reciprocal interpopulational crosses between low-elevation (L) and high-elevation (H) populations: L × L, L × H, H × L, and H × H. Paternity analysis of the F2 progeny using molecular genetic markers showed that 91.3% of the fathers were located in surrounding stands of the F1 planting site (i.e., not in the F1 test population). The remaining fathers were assigned to F1 parents of the L × L cross-type. This indicates that the high-elevation genome in the F1 parents was not inherited by the F2 population via pollen flow. The timing of autumn cold acclimation in the F2 progeny depended on the cross-type of the F1 mother. The progeny of H × H mothers showed less damage in freezing tests than the progeny of other cross-types. Statistical modeling supported a linear effect of genome origin. In the best model, variation in freezing damage was explained by the proportion of maternally inherited high-elevation genome. These results suggest that autumn cold acclimation was partly explained by the additive effect of the responsible maternal genome. Thus, the offspring that inherited a greater proportion of the high-elevation genome developed cold hardiness earlier. Genome-based variation in the regulation of autumn cold acclimation matched the local climatic conditions, which may be a key factor in elevation-dependent adaptation. © 2015 Ishizuka, Ono, Hara and Goto.

TI  - Extreme environments facilitate hybrid superiority - The story of a successful daphnia galeata × longispina hybrid clone
VL  - 10
IS  - 10
AB  - Hybridization within the animal kingdom has long been underestimated. Hybrids have often been considered less fit than their parental species. In the present study, we observed that the Daphnia community of a small lake was dominated by a single D. galeata × D. longispina hybrid clone, during two consecutive years. Notably, in artificial community set-ups consisting of several clones representing parental species and other hybrids, this hybrid clone took over within about ten generations. Neither the fitness assay conducted under different temperatures, or under crowded and non-crowded environments, nor the carrying capacity test revealed any outstanding life history parameters of this hybrid clone. However, under simulated winter conditions (i.e. low temperature, food and light), the hybrid clone eventually showed a higher survival probability and higher fecundity compared to parental species. Hybrid superiority in cold-adapted traits leading to an advantage of overwintering as parthenogenetic lineages might consequently explain the establishment of successful hybrids in natural communities of the D. longispina complex. In extreme cases, like the one reported here, a superior hybrid genotype might be the only clone alive after cold winters. Overall, superiority traits, such as enhanced overwintering here, might explain hybrid dominance in nature, especially in extreme and rapidly changing environments. Although any favoured gene complex in cyclic parthenogens could be frozen in successful clones independent of hybridization, we did not find similarly successful clones among parental species. We conclude that the emergence of the observed trait is linked to the production of novel recombined hybrid genotypes. Copyright: © 2015 Griebel et al.

VL  - 93
IS  - 8
SP  - 942-953
AB  - Variations in the tendency to diapause were investigated in 5 successive generations of 6 parthenogenetic clones of Trichogramma telengai Sor. reared under constant laboratory conditions (the temperature of 20°C and the day length of 18 h). The tendency to diapause was estimated by the proportion of the progeny which diapaused at temperatures of 13, 14 and 15°C. Although the variations in the tendency to diapause in successive generations of different clones were positively correlated, the dynamics of the proportion of diapausing progeny in one of the studied clones was significantly different from that in the other clones reared under the same conditions. Moreover, the differences among subclones originated from the same female were also revealed. Analysis of the results suggests that the interclonal variations in the proportion of diapausing progeny were at least partly caused by endogenous factors. The differences between clones can arise during the development of one generation but can also damp very fast or, at least, they are not accumulated over generations. These variations are probably based on the same epigenetic mechanisms that form the basis of the maternal effect on the progeny diapause in Trichogramma species. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

VL  - 3

SP  - 1005-1030
AB  - Predicting the impact of warming and acidifying on oceans on the early development life history stages of invertebrates although difficult, is essential in order to anticipate the severity and consequences of future climate change. This review summarises the current literature and meta-analyses on the early life-history stages of invertebrates including fertilisation, larval development and the implications for dispersal and settlement of populations. Although fertilisation appears robust to near future predictions of ocean acidification, larval development is much more vulnerable and across invertebrate groups, evidence indicates that the impacts may be severe. This is especially for those many marine organisms which start to calcify in their larval and/or juvenile stages. Species-specificity and variability in responses and current gaps in the literature are highlighted, including the need for studies to investigate the total effects of climate change including the synergistic impact of temperature, and the need for long-term multigenerational experiments to determine whether vulnerable invertebrate species have the capacity to adapt to elevations in atmospheric CO2 over the next century. © 2011 by the authors.

TI  - Evaluation of the copepod Eurytemora affinis life history response to temperature and salinity increases
VL  - 55
AB  - Zooplankton and particularly copepods have a key role in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. However, the mechanisms involved in the physiological responses of copepods to temperature and salinity increases are little understood, and the role of plasticity involved in facing environmental changes has rarely been demonstrated experimentally. In this study, the copepod Eurytemora affinis, widely distributed in the northern hemisphere, was selected as a biological model to test the effect of a 4°C temperature increase at two salinities. In addition to the optimal salinity (15 psu), a stressful condition of salinity 25 psu was also verified. Copepods from the Seine estuary were acclimated in laboratory to their optimal temperature of 15°C at salinity 15 PSU and then they were acclimated during several generations to their upper thermal limit (20°C) at two salinities (15 and 25 PSU), after which the temperature was raised by 4°C. This experiment revealed that after long-term acclimation and under unlimited food conditions, E. affinis maintained good fitness at 20°C and at both optimal and stressful salinities. After temperature increase to 24°C, the population remained viable but copepod size was significantly decreased as well as female’s fecundity. The decrease of fitness was accentuated under the additional stressful condition of salinity 25 psu. This study demonstrated that the mechanisms of response to temperature and salinity increases (i.e. global warming) are complex, and should be investigated through experimental studies that consider acclimation and multigenerational factors. Our results will enrich the development of Individual-Based Models (IBMs) capable to test the role of microevolution and plasticity of E. affinis in the framework of future climate scenarios. © 2016, Academia Sinica.

TI  - Multigenerational maternal effect on diapause induction in Trichogramma species (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)
VL  - 22
IS  - 4
SP  - 429-445
AB  - Maternal photoperiodic response is known to influence the percentage of diapausing prepupae in Trichogramma species. However, the influence of several preceding generations has not yet been studied. We have investigated the stability of photoperiod-induced changes in multiple generations of Trichogramma buesi Voegele and Trichogramma principium Sug. et Sor. Short-day conditions during preimaginal development induced an increase in the percentage of diapausing progeny and grand progeny of both Trichogramma species. A similar trend was also detected in the fourth and fifth generations, but the response was weak although statistically significant. This grand-grandmaternal photoperiodic effect (which has not been demonstrated before for Trichogramma or for any other insect parasitoid) is most probably based on the transgenerational transmission of variations in DNA expression. We conclude that in mass rearing, to facilitate diapause induction before cold storage, it is advisable to rear both maternal and grandmaternal generations under the short-day conditions. In scientific studies, several generations preceding the experiment should be kept under equal conditions to exclude multigenerational maternal effects. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Do pigmentation and the melanocortin system modulate aggression and sexuality in humans as they do in other animals?
VL  - 53
IS  - 1
SP  - 4-8
AB  - Pigmentation of the hair, skin, cuticle, feather and eye is one of the most salient and variable attributes of vertebrates. In many species, melanin-based coloration is found to be pleiotropically linked to behavior. We review animal studies that have found darker pigmented individuals average higher amounts of aggression and sexual activity than lighter pigmented individuals. We hypothesize that similar relationships between pigmentation, aggression, and sexuality occur in humans. We first review the literature on non-human animals and then review some of the correlates of melanin in people, including aggression and sexual activity. Both within human populations (e.g., siblings), and between populations (e.g., races, nations, states), studies find that darker pigmented people average higher levels of aggression and sexual activity (and also lower IQ). We conceptualize skin color as a multigenerational adaptation to differences in climate over the last 70,000 years as a result of "cold winters theory" and the "Out-of-Africa" model of human origins. We propose life history theory to explain the covariation found between human (and non-human) pigmentation and variables such as birth rate, infant mortality, longevity, rate of HIV/AIDS, and violent crime.

TI  - Low Annual Fidelity and Early Upstream Migration of Anadromous Arctic Char in a Variable Environment
VL  - 145
IS  - 5
SP  - 931-942
AB  - The life histories of anadromous Arctic Char Salvelinus alpinus are complex and vary greatly between populations and environments. Here, we detail key aspects of the physical environment and life history of a population of Arctic Char from Nulahugyuk Creek, Nunavut, Canada, to characterize migration traits in a highly variable environment. Over the course of this migration, creek discharge declined precipitously, forcing Arctic Char to migrate through shallow water with large diel temperature fluctuations (>10°C) and high temperature extremes (>21°C). The downstream migration of adults (>55 cm) began in mid-June and continued into early July, while the downstream migration of smolts (<30 cm) began in late June and continued until late July. The upstream adult migration began in late June and ended in late July, far earlier than most upstream migrations in the region. There was no appreciable upstream migration of juveniles, and Arctic Char 30 to 55 cm in length were absent from the up- and downstream migrations. The average age at first migration was 4 years, and the youngest adult Arctic Char migrating upstream were 8 and 9 years old. The missing size- and age-classes, and the fact that most upstream migrants were near reproductive maturity, indicate that Arctic Char in this system typically leave at a length of 19 cm and an age of 4 years and do not return for 4 to 5 years, when they are ready to reproduce. Anadromous Nulahugyuk Creek Arctic Char appear to employ strategies that limit their exposure to restrictive migratory conditions and facilitate their existence in an otherwise uninhabitable system. Understanding such population-specific migratory strategies is critical to the management of Arctic Char fisheries, which are comprised of populations with highly diverse life histories, and to our understanding of how these life histories may contribute to the adaptability and persistence of the species as climate change progresses.

TI  - Developmental synchrony in multivoltine insects: generation separation versus smearing
VL  - 58
IS  - 4
SP  - 479-491
AB  - Many insect species undergo multiple generations each year. They are found across biomes that vary in their strength of seasonality and, depending on location and species, can display a wide range of population dynamics. Some species exhibit cycles with distinct generations (developmental synchrony/generation separation), some exhibit overlapping generations with multiple life stages present simultaneously (generation smearing), while others have intermediate dynamics with early season separation followed by late season smearing. There are two main hypotheses to explain these dynamics. The first is the ‘seasonal disturbance’ hypothesis where winter synchronizes the developmental clock among individuals, which causes transient generation separation early in the season that erodes through the summer. The second is the ‘temperature destabilization’ hypothesis where warm temperatures during the summer cause population dynamics to become unstable giving rise to single generation cycles. Both hypotheses are supported by detailed mathematical theory incorporating mechanisms that are likely to drive dynamics in nature. In this review, we synthesize the theory and propose a conceptual framework—where each mechanism may be seen as an independent axis shaping the developmental (a)synchrony—that allows us to predict dynamic patterns from insect life-history characteristics. High fecundity, short adult life-span and strong seasonality enhance synchrony, while developmental plasticity and environmental heterogeneity erode synchrony. We further review current mathematical and statistical tools to study multi-generational dynamics and illustrate using case studies of multivoltine tortrix moths. By integrating two disparate bodies of theory, we articulate a deep connection among temperature, stability, developmental synchrony and inter-generational dynamics of multivoltine insects that is missing in current literature. © 2016, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan.

AB  - The induction of diapause in the populations of Trichogramma evanescens Westw. and T. chilonis Ishii from the south of Primorskii Territory in the Russian Far East was studied at the constant temperatures of 7, 8, 10, 15, 20, and 25°C. The parental generations developed at either 25° or 20°C and a day length of 16 or 10 hours. The maximum fraction of diapausing prepupae of T. evanescens (nearly 100 %) was observed at the temperatures of 8–10°C, that of T. chilonis only at 10°C, regardless of parental photoperiodic or thermal conditions. The influence of parental temperature and photoperiod on diapause of the progeny was found only in T. evanescens. In this species, after the parental generation had been kept under short-day conditions and a temperature of 25°C, the progeny showed higher incidence of prepupal diapause in the short-day line than in the long-day line at the temperatures of 7 and 15°C. © 2015, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.

VL  - 42

SP  - 2118-2129
AB  - Forty-one range-wide Callitropsis nootkatensis (D. Don) Orsted (syn. Chamaecyparis nootkatensis (D. Don) Spach) populations were tested at 12 geographically and ecologically diverse sites throughout British Columbia, Canada. There were significant region and population within region effects for 15-year height at most sites but not for adaptability, a binary trait combining survival and cold hardiness. Across-site analysis revealed significant site by population within region interaction for both traits. These interactions were less pronounced when just the core sites were analysed and without two southern disjunct populations. Based on a productivity index that combined height, survival, and cold hardiness, populations were adapted to broad temperature gradients compared with most temperate tree species and were relatively insensitive to moisture. Only the northern California population from the extreme southernmost part of the species' range had consistent and significant adaptive differentiation, showing maladaptation characterized by severe cold damage and mortality at all test sites. Northern populations grew slowly but survived well. Productivity of this montane species is likely to increase in situ with projected warming across the range of tested sites. Transfer to sites warmer than the population origin increases productivity. Currently and in the long term, populations from the core of the species' range can be widely transferred for reforestation with minimal risk of maladaptation, provided highly inbred sources from isolated, small populations and sites at risk for yellow cypress decline are avoided.

TI  - Extremely rapid acclimation of Escherichia coli to high temperature over a few generations of a fed-batch culture during slow warming
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SP  - 52-63
AB  - This study aimed to demonstrate that adequate slow heating rate allows two strains of Escherichia coli rapid acclimation to higher temperature than upper growth and survival limits known to be strain-dependent. A laboratory (K12-TG1) and an environmental (DPD3084) strain of E. coli were subjected to rapid (few seconds) or slow warming (1°C 12 h-1) in order to (re)evaluate upper survival and growth limits. The slow warming was applied from the ancestral temperature 37°C to total cell death 46-54°C: about 30 generations were propagated. Upper survival and growth limits for rapid warming (46°C) were lower than for slow warming (46-54°C). The thermal limit of survival for slow warming was higher for DPD3084 (50-54°C). Further experiments conducted on DPD3084, showed that mechanisms involved in this type of thermotolerance were abolished by a following cooling step to 37°C, which allowed to imply reversible mechanisms as acclimation ones. Acquisition of acclimation mechanisms was related to physical properties of the plasma membrane but was not inhibited by unavoidable appearance of aggregated proteins. In conclusion, E.coli could be rapidly acclimated within few generations over thermal limits described in the literature. Such a study led us to propose that rapid acclimation may give supplementary time to the species to acquire a stable adaptation through a random mutation. © 2013 The Authors.

SP  - 541-549
AB  - Insects are ectotherms and their ability to resist temperature stress is limited. The immediate effects of sub-lethal heat stress on insects are well documented, but longer-term effects of such stresses are rarely reported. In this study, survival, development and reproduction of the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) biotype B, were compared over five consecutive generations at 27, 31 and 35°C and for one generation at 37°C. Both temperature and generation significantly affected the fitness of the whitefly. These impacts were more dramatic with increasing generations and temperatures. Among the experimental temperatures, the most favorable for development and reproduction were 27°C and 31°C. At 27°C, survival, development and fecundity were all stable over these five generations. At 31°C, immature survival rate was the highest in the fifth generation, but female fecundities decreased in the fourth and fifth generations. At 35°C, egg hatching rate, immature survival rate and female fecundity decreased significantly in the fourth and fifth generations. At 37°C, survival of B. tabaci was not adversely affected, but female fecundity at 37°C was less than 10% of that at 27°C or 31°C. These results demonstrate that the lethal high temperature for B. tabaci is over 37°C, and the whitefly population continued expanding in the five generations at 35°C. The ability of B. tabaci biotype B to survive high temperature stress will play an important role in its population extension under global warming. © 2012 The Authors Insect Science © 2012 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The biological control of insect pests using parasitoids may have limited success without an understanding of the effect of temperature on natural enemies. The objective was to determine the parasitism, egg viability and sex ratio of Thichogramma exiguum and Trichogramma acacioi (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) to control Heliothis virescens (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) eggs after two generations on eggs of Anagasta kuehniella at 18, 20, 25, 30 and 33 degrees C. The increase in temperature favored the parasitism of T exiguum. The egg viability of T exiguum ranged between 70.1 and 97.1% and from 81.5 to 98.4% for T acacioi in H. virescens eggs. The sex ratio of T acacioi was constant at all temperatures studied, with only females in the progeny. Trichogramma exiguum reared in H. virescens eggs met the standards of quality control for mass production. Trichogramma exiguum showed higher parasitism than T. acacioi at high temperatures. However, both species had low parasitism on H. virescens eggs.

TI  - Influence of climate change on the multi-generation toxicity to Enchytraeus crypticus of soils polluted by metal/metalloid mining wastes
VL  - 222
SP  - 101-108
AB  - This study aimed at assessing the effects of increased air temperature and reduced soil moisture content on the multi-generation toxicity of a soil polluted by metal/metalloid mining wastes. Enchytraeus crypticus was exposed to dilution series of the polluted soil in Lufa 2.2 soil under different combinations of air temperature (20 degrees C and 25 degrees C) and soil moisture content (50% and 30% of the soil water holding capacity, WHC) over three generations standardized on physiological time. Generation time was shorter with increasing air temperature and/or soil moisture content. Adult survival was only affected at 30% WHC (similar to 30% reduction at the highest percentages of polluted soil). Reproduction decreased with increasing percentage of polluted soil in a dose-related manner and over generations. Toxicity increased at 30% WHC (>50% reduction in EC50 in F0 and F1 generations) and over generations in the treatments at 20 degrees C (40-60% reduction in EC50 in F2 generation). At 25 degrees C, toxicity did not change when combined with 30% WHC and only slightly increased with 50% WHC. So, higher air temperature and/or reduced soil moisture content does affect the toxicity of soils polluted by metal/metalloid mining wastes to E. crypticus and this effect may exacerbate over generations.

VL  - 15

AB  - While genetic rescue is known to benefit population viability, the duration of that benefit is poorly understood. We document what appears to be the waning benefit of genetic rescue after approximately 2–3 generations for the wolf population in Isle Royale National Park. The fitness benefit of genetic rescue declined because of inbreeding and population abundance declined when the inbred individuals exhibited low reproduction and survival. Only detailed studies of other cases will reveal what aspects of these dynamics represent general features of genetic rescue. We also present evidence indicating that numerous past immigration events have likely gone undetected. This finding is of particular significance because the Isle Royale wolf population has maintained good population viability for decades even though it was small and thought to be isolated from the mainland population of wolves. Past gene flow also suggests that human-assisted gene flow is necessary to conserve the ecosystem services associated with predation, since climate warming has reduced the frequency of ice bridges and with it the only opportunity for unassisted gene flow. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - Comparative estuarine and marine migration ecology of Atlantic salmon and steelhead: Blue highways and open plains
VL  - 24
IS  - 3
SP  - 757-780
AB  - This synthesis focuses on the estuarine and ocean ecology of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) across their southern ranges in North America. General life history and ecology share many common traits including iteroparity, duration of freshwater (0-3 years) and marine (2-5 years) rearing, ocean emigration at relatively large sizes and strong surface orientation compared to other salmonids. Despite parallels in life history and anthropogenic pressures, several differences emerged for these species. First, steelhead have greater life history diversity and a broader geographic distribution. Generally, estuary habitats serve as short-term migration corridors for both species. However, some steelhead populations used lagoon habitat in south-coast watersheds. While both species are epipelagic, Atlantic salmon exhibit more vertical migration. Atlantic salmon tend to follow migratory highways-relatively narrow bands along the coastal shelf, then crossing the Atlantic to feed inshore and in fjords of West Greenland. Conversely, steelhead exit the coastal shelf quickly, dispersing across the Pacific, and rarely use coastal environments. Despite inhabiting rivers in warm dry Mediterranean climates, the extended range and stability of southern steelhead distribution is likely buffered by cool upwelled waters of the California Current. Whereas Atlantic salmon populations are restricted by warmer Northwest Atlantic circulation patterns lacking cool upwelling with greater susceptibility to warming associated with climate change. Determining the rate of marine habitat changes in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans is important to the conservation of these species, including subtleties of temporal and spatial habitat use, and adaptability to ocean ecosystems under climate change. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA).

VL  - 57

SP  - 988-998
AB  - Historical data show that recent climate change has caused advances in seasonal timing (phenology) in many animals and plants, particularly in temperate and higher latitude regions. The population and fitness consequences of these phenological shifts for insects and other ectotherms have been heterogeneous: warming can increase development rates and the number of generations per year (increasing fitness), but can also lead to seasonal mismatches between animals and their resources and increase exposure to environmental variability (decreasing fitness). Insect populations exhibit local adaptation in their developmental responses to temperature, including lower developmental thresholds and the thermal requirements to complete development, but climate change can potentially disrupt seasonal timing of juvenile and adult stages and alter population fitness. We investigate these issues using a global dataset describing how insect developmental responds to temperature via two traits: lower temperature thresholds for development (T0) and the cumulative degree-days required to complete development (G). As suggested by previous analyses, T0 decreases and G increases with increasing (absolute) latitude; however, these traits and the relationship between G and latitude varies significantly among taxonomic orders. The mean number of generations per year (a metric of fitness) increases with both decreasing T0 and G, but the effects of these traits on fitness vary strongly with latitude, with stronger selection on both traits at higher (absolute) latitudes. We then use the traits to predict developmental timing and temperatures for multiple generations within seasons and across years (1970-2010). Seasonality drives developmental temperatures to peak mid-season and for generation lengths to decline across seasons, particularly in temperate regions. We predict that climate warming has advanced phenology and increased the number of generations, particularly at high latitudes. The magnitude of increases in developmental temperature varies little across latitude. Increases in the number of seasonal generations have been greatest for populations experiencing the greatest phenological advancements and warming. Shifts in developmental rate and timing due to climate change will have complex implications for selection and fitness in seasonal environments. © The Author 2017.

VL  - 168
SP  - 161-169
AB  - The aquatic ecotoxic profile of the fungicide pyrimethanil and its acute and chronic thermal dependence in two aquatic invertebrates Chironomus riparius and Daphnia magna were investigated. The ecotoxicity of pyrimethanil at optimal thermal conditions did not depend on the trophic level, but was species-specific. The acute pyrimethanil-toxicity on C. riparius increased with higher temperature. The chronic response of Daphnia magna to the NOEC of the fungicide was examined in a multigenerational experiment under three near-natural temperature regimes. A pyrimethanil-induced increase of total mortality was buffered by the strongly related increase of the general reproductive capacity, while population growth was stronger influenced by temperature than by the fungicide. At a LOEC, however, a second generation could not be established with D. magna at all thermal regimes. This clearly shows that thermal and multigenerational effects should be considered when appraising the ecotoxicity of pesticides and assessing their future risk for the environment.

VL  - 7

AB  - Understanding the combined effects of anthropogenic impacts such as climate change and pollution on aquatic ecosystems is critical. However, little is known about how predicted temperature increases may affect the activity of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), particularly in species with plasticity in sex determination. We investigated the effects of a concomitant increase in temperature and exposure to estrogenic EDCs on reproduction and development in an estuarine model organism (Menidia beryllina) across multiple generations. Parents (P) were exposed to environmental levels of the estrogenic insecticide bifenthrin or ethinylestradiol (EE2) at 22 °C and 28 °C for 14 days prior to the initiation of spawning trials. Embryos in the F1 generation were exposed to EDCs until 21 days post hatch (dph), reared to adulthood in clean water at elevated temperatures, and spawned. F1 sex ratios were significantly influenced by elevated temperature and EDCs, potentially altering adaptive development. We also observed fewer viable offspring and increased developmental deformities in the F1 and F2 generations, with a greater impact on F2 juveniles. These findings enhance our understanding of responses to EDCs in the context of climate change and may demonstrate heritable effects. Our study represents the first multigenerational assessment of elevated temperatures in combination with environmentally relevant concentrations of commonly detected endocrine disruptors in a model vertebrate species. © 2017 The Author(s).

VL  - 27

SP  - 2113-2122
AB  - The adaptability of organisms to novel environmental conditions depends on the amount of genetic variance present in the population as well as on the ability of individuals to adjust their phenotype through phenotypic plasticity. Here, we investigated the phenotypic plasticity induced by a single generation's exposure to three different temperature regimes with respect to several life-history and stress-resistance traits in a natural population of Drosophila simulans. We studied a constant as well as a predictably and an unpredictably fluctuating temperature regime. We found high levels of phenotypic plasticity among all temperature regimes, suggesting a strong influence of both temperature fluctuations and their predictability. Increased heat tolerance was observed for flies developed in both types of fluctuating thermal environments compared with flies developed in a constant environment. We suggest that this was due to beneficial hardening when developing in either fluctuating temperature environment. To our surprise, flies that developed in constant and predictably changing environments were similar to each other in most traits when compared to flies from the unpredictably fluctuating environment. The unpredictably changing thermal environment imposed the most stressful condition, resulting in the lowest performance for stress-related traits, even though the absolute temperature changes never exceeded that of the predictably fluctuating environment. The overall decreased stress resistance of flies in the unpredictably fluctuating environment may be the consequence of maladaptive phenotypic plasticity in this setting, indicating that the adaptive value of plasticity depends on the predictability of the environment.

AB  - Tolerance and adaptability to changing environmental parameters have made Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758) a hardy and desirable aquaculture species. These traits have also enabled this fish to become a highly successful invasive species into temperate and subtropical aquatic environments. Otolith-based ages of Nile tilapia (41.3 - 400.0 mm TL, 1.34 - 1,293 g WW, n = 259) collected from a power plant cooling reservoir and the Pascagoula River proper indicated that feral populations overwintered reaching ages up to 4+ years old in coastal Mississippi, USA; these data confirm their establishment. A survey of mean daily winter (December - February) water temperatures from 2004 - 2010 in this region showed minimum lethal temperatures of < 10°C to occur nearly 11% of the time attesting to the adaptability of the Nile tilapia as an invasive species. One annulus (opaque zone) per year was being deposited from April to August based on marginal increment analysis along with sulcal groove length-age estimation of the young-of-the-year Nile tilapia. Additionally, life history metrics measured for this temperate population of Nile tilapia were nearly identical to those reported from African environments, indicating they are flourishing in this non-native habitat. © 2012 The Author(s).

AB  - Genetic rescue has been proposed as a management strategy to improve the fitness of genetically eroded populations by alleviating inbreeding depression. We studied the dynamics of genetic rescue in inbred populations of Drosophila. Using balancer chromosomes, we show that the force of heterosis that accompanies genetic rescue is large and allows even a recessive lethal to increase substantially in frequency in the rescued populations, particularly at stress temperatures. This indicates that deleterious alleles present in the immigrants can increase significantly in frequency in the recipient population when they are in linkage disequilibrium with genes responsible for the heterosis. In a second experiment we rescued eight inbred Drosophila populations with immigrants from two other inbred populations and observe: (i) there is a significant increase in viability both 5 and 10 generations after the rescue event, showing that the increase in fitness is not transient but persists long-term. (ii) The lower the fitness of the recipient population the larger the fitness increase. (iii) The increase in fitness depends significantly on the origin of the rescuers. The immigrants used were fixed for a conditional lethal that was mildly deleterious at 25A degrees C but lethal at 29A degrees C. By comparing fitness at 25A degrees C (the temperature during the rescue experiment) and 29A degrees C, we show that the lethal allele reached significant frequencies in most rescued populations, which upon renewed inbreeding became fixed in part of the inbred lines. In conclusion, in addition to the fitness increase genetic rescue can easily result in a substantial increase in the frequency of mildly deleterious alleles carried by the immigrants. This can endanger the rescued population greatly when it undergoes recurrent inbreeding. However, using a sufficient number of immigrants and to accompany the rescue event with the right demographic measures will overcome this problem. As such, genetic rescue still is a viable option to manage genetically eroded populations.

TI  - Early life history of the daubed shanny (Teleostei: Leptoclinus maculatus) in Svalbard waters
VL  - 41
IS  - 3
SP  - 383-394
AB  - The daubed shanny (Leptoclinus maculatus, Family Stichaeidae) is considered to be an ecologically significant species in the arctic waters of Norway because of high abundance and the unique energy storage abilities of its postlarvae. Both postlarvae and adults are found in relative large abundances in Svalbard fjords as well as along the ice edge of north-east Svalbard, even at sub-zero temperatures. The postlarva feeds primarily on Calanus spp. and stores lipids from this high-energy diet in a unique lipid sac on the ventral side of its body. This energy storage enables it to survive pelagically during the arctic winters when food is scarce. The postlarvae are pelagic for the first 2-3 years of their life before they descend to the bottom and transform to a benthic mode of life. Our results indicated that this transition takes place when the postlarva reach about 80 mm in length and an age of 3 years. The relative size of the lipid sac, as well as changes in the morphology of the postlarvae, can be used as indices of the transition from pelagic postlarva to benthic juvenile. The lipid sac index (% of gutted weight) was negatively correlated with length and age and started to decrease when the postlarva transformed to a benthic lifestyle. At this point, the growth in terms of the length-weight relationship shifted from a positive asymptotic growth to a negative asymptotic growth, reflecting the changes in the lipid sac index, while several changes in morphological traits took place. The benthic mode of early juveniles is largely influenced by environmental conditions and prey abundance, since the fish is depleted from their energy stores and need to rapidly switch to benthic prey in their new habitat. In conclusion, this is the first study on the early life history of the daubed shanny and it presents evidence that the first 5 years in the life of this species is divided in two distinct parts, one pelagic and one benthic, in which postlarvae display unique growth and morphological traits adapted to the challenges of these arctic marine environments. © 2011 The Author(s).

TI  - Transgenerational seasonal timer for suppression of sexual morph production in the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum
VL  - 101
SP  - 1-6
AB  - Many aphid species switch reproductive modes seasonally, with the sexual generations appearing in autumn. Sexual generations are induced by short days. It has been reported that the appearance of sexual morphs is suppressed by a transgenerational factor (a seasonal timer) over several generations after hatching from overwintered eggs. The present study examined whether the seasonal timer measures the number of days from hatching or the number of generations from hatching using the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Homoptera: Aphididae). Effects of temperature and photoperiod on the seasonal timer were also examined by successive rearing. The ability to produce sexual morphs was strongly suppressed in stem mothers (the foundress generation), and gradually recovered over successive generations produced during a few months. The duration for which the seasonal timer could function depended on the number of days from hatching and temperature, but not on photoperiod or the number of generations from hatching. We thus showed in a single study that the seasonal timer of the pea aphid has all the physiological characteristics shown in separate studies in different aphid species. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

TI  - Environmental factors affecting longevity, Adaptability and diapause termination of Exochomus quadripustulatus L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae): A predator of Lepidosaphes ulmi L. (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) on apple

AB  - Adults Exochomus quadripustulatus L. were utilized to determine the effect of various environmental factors (mainly temperature) on the longevity, adaptability (hysteresis) and diapause termination either under controlled laboratory conditions or field insectary conditions. Newly eclosed male and female adults E. quadripustulatus from previously field collected pupae were studied for the lifespan of adults under different constant temperatures (15° and 20°C) and naturally fluctuating (ambient) temperatures using starved (no food), liquid diets (water, and 10% honey solution) and natural prey (mussel scale Lepidosaphes ulmi L.) on apple. Access to distilled water compared to starvation did not increase the longevity of adult but significantly prolonged the life span when honey solution was provided. Longevity in constant conditions and ambient depended on both temperature and food. Coccinellid E. quadripustulatus survived longer time (≥10 months) under field conditions on natural prey L. ulmi than under constant temperature (≥4 months). Prey L. ulmi was the best food for survival than 10% honey solution. The degree of adaptability (hysteresis) of adult E. quadripustulatus at alternating temperature regimes (ascending and descending) showed significant differences in feeding at decreasing temperature than increasing ones. The results indicate that, in natural conditions, the adult beetles may be well adapted if they are introduced to different climatic regions where it has not yet been tested. Still more detailed information is to be investigated to prove this hypothesis. Results on diapause termination of female adult E. quadripustulatus showed that temperature did not effect diapause termination under the present experimental conditions. This may be because this species is of univoltine strain in the north-east England. Copyright 2013 Zoological Society of Pakistan.

AB  - Whole person adaptive comfort is discussed with reference to recent findings in molecular scale systems biology. The observations are upscaled to hypotheses relating to less traditional interpretations of thermal processes, which have new implications for indoor climate management and design. Arguments are presented for a revision of current focus, model and paradigm. The issue is seen as a problem of integrating theoretical development, conceptual modeling and as an investigation of the extent to which environments and acclimatization can be used to achieve individual fitness and health, not only at the subjective comfort level, as hitherto promoted. It is argued that there are many questions yet to be asked about adaptability before celebrating a particular adaptive state. © 2013 The Author(s).

AB  - We evaluated the effects of constant low-temperature storage on Diaeretiella rapae (McIntosh) (Braconidae, Aphidiinae). Diaeretiella rapae mummies were stored at 5 ± 1°C for 0-36 days. The percentage of D. rapae emergence varied (100-83%) after 0-32 days of storage. After 32 days, emergence reduced to 55%. According to our Probit analysis, 50% mortality (LT50) of the population of D. rapae was reached after 40 days of storage at 5°C. Storage for up to 32 days did not negatively affect emergence and survival. Cold exposure of D. rapae for 36 days did not influence morphological malformations, sex ratio, and emergence of the F1 generation. After 4-36 days of storage, D. rapae showed a gradual decrease in emergence, longevity, reproductive capacity, and F1 sex ratio. Diaeretiella rapae can be stored for up to 24 days at 5°C, at which time the percentage of parasitism and the F1 sex ratio remain above 38% and at 0.50, respectively. © 2013 Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.

AB  - Fish mycobacteriosis should be considered as one possible means of transmission of mycobacterial infections to humans. In our study, we examined the survival of three field Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis (MAH) isolates in fish meat during thermal processing technologies using culture and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) methods. Minced carp meat mixture was artificially contaminated with known amount of MAH cells and survival and absolute numbers of MAH was monitored after hot smoking and frying. The viability of MAH was significantly lower after the frying process, whereas in response to hot smoking viable MAH cells could still be cultured even after 10 min at 70 °C. Significant differences in thermal stability were also observed among the three different MAH isolates. The human isolate was the most resistant, whereas the environmental isolate was the least resistant, which is probably due to host adaptability. In this work we confirmed that MAH can survive temperatures of 70 °C and thus can pose a risk to consumers. © 2012 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

TI  - The temperature adaptability of solar greenhouse vegetable in winter in Guanzhong and Northern Shaanxi
SP  - 2783-2786
AB  - To analyse the vegetable adaptability of greenhouse, the temperature and humidity of greenhouse was measured in Yulin, Yan'an and Yangling solar greenhouse. The effective temperature and single factor ecological distance were introduced to evaluate the temperature adaptability of vegetable. The results showed that the relative humidity inside the greenhouse was the largest, and the diurnal temperature variation was the minimum in Yangling. It was not propitious to the growth of fruit vegetables. The temperature adaptability of leafy vegetables was greater than fruit vegetables. The temperature adaptability of fruit vegetables was tomato > cucumber > capsicum > Eggplant; The temperature adaptability of leafy vegetables was leaf lettuce > celery> cabbage> greengrocery. The temperature adaptation index of 8 kinds of vegetables was the best in Yangling. The temperature in Yangling can meet the requirement of cucumber, tomato and other temperature-resistant vegetables growth. The temperature wais low in January in Yulin and Yan'an, so thermal insulation and other measures need to be strengthened to meet the cucumber, tomato and other temperature-resistant vegetables growth requirement. © 2011 IEEE.

SP  - 103-112
AB  - California red scale (CRS) parasitoids of 121 citrus groves belonging to three different Mediterranean-climate ecosystems (inland, coastal and subtropical) of eastern Spain were used as a model to study the effects of climate on composition and distribution of parasitoid communities. Then we evaluate the success of a biocontrol program based on releases of three new CRS parasitoid species. Field surveys were complemented by laboratory trials under simulated common and extreme climate conditions (15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C combined with 25%, 45% and 65% RH) to know parasitoid's life-history traits. In the inland area Aphytis melinus was the only parasitoid present, in the coastal it coexisted with Aphytis chrysomphali and in the subtropical also with Encarsia perniciosi. Comperiella bifasciata established in all inland groves where it was released whereas E. perniciosi and Aphytis lingnanensis only in the groves within the subtropical agroecosystem. In the laboratory, the highest intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) values for C. bifasciata and E. perniciosi were reached at temperature-humidity regimes typical from inland and subtropical areas respectively. The longevity of both species at different temperature-humidity conditions also reflected their adaptability to dry or humid areas. Our results with CRS endoparasitoids, together with previous studies on Aphytis species, demonstrate the validity of r(m) analysis at different extreme temperature-humidity combinations to predict the potential areas of distribution of newly introduced organisms. Slight differences in average winter and summer temperatures or relative humidity between neighbor agroecosystems caused large variation in species composition and introduction success ratio.

TI  - Progressive acclimation alters interaction between salinity and temperature in experimental Daphnia populations
VL  - 139
SP  - 126-132
AB  - Environmental stressors rarely act in isolation, giving rise to interacting environmental change scenarios. However, the impacts of such interactions on natural populations must consider the ability of organisms to adapt to environmental changes. The phenotypic adaptability of a Daphnia galeata clone to temperature rise and salinisation was investigated in this study, by evaluating its halotolerance at two different temperatures, along a short multigenerational acclimation scenario. Daphniids were acclimated to different temperatures (20 degrees C and 25 degrees C) and salinities (0 g L-1 and 1 g L-1, using NaCl as a proxy) in a fully crossed design. The objective was to understand whether acclimation to environmental stress (combinations of temperature and salinity) influenced the response to the latter exposure to these stressors. We hypothesize that acclimation to different temperature x salinity regimes should elicit an acclimation response of daphniids to saline stress or its interaction with temperature. Acute (survival time) and chronic (juvenile growth) halotolerance measures were obtained at discrete timings along the acclimation period (generations F1, F3 and F9). Overall, exposure temperature was the main determinant of the acute and chronic toxicity of NaCI: daphniid sensitivity (measured as the decrease of survival time or juvenile growth) was consistently higher at the highest temperature, irrespective of background conditions. However, this temperature-dependent effect was nullified after nine generations, but only when animals had been acclimated to both stressors (high salinity and high temperature). Such complex interaction scenarios should be taken in consideration in risk assessment practices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Much attention has been focused on insects' ability to survive long-term high-temperature stress and on their resulting population distributions under global warming. In this study, life tables of the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) biotype B, were collected over five consecutive generations at 27, 31, and 35 degrees C and for one generation at 37 degrees C. At 37 degrees C, the intrinsic rate of increase (r) and the net reproductive rate (R-0) of the whitefly were 0.0383 d(-1) and 2.8 offspring, respectively. These results demonstrate that the lethal high temperature for B. tabaci is >37 degrees C. At 27 degrees C, neither R-0 nor r decreased over the generations studied. However, both of these values decreased over time at 31 and 35 degrees C, and the decrease was more evident at 35 degrees C. Our results on the ability of B. tabaci biotype B to survive long-term high-temperature stress are important for understanding its population distribution under global warming.

The simulation results show that the hobbing process has a lot of excellent process characteristics, such as good adaptability, continuous cutting, no extra stroke, higher productivity. By the MASTA software simulation the maximum value of the gear heat treatment deformation is about 70 um. The trend of thermal deformation first increases, then decreases, and then increases. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

VL  - 9

SP  - 1072-1081
AB  - Predicting the impacts of climate change to biological systems requires an understanding of the ability for species to acclimate to the projected environmental change through phenotypic plasticity. Determining the effects of higher temperatures on individual performance is made more complex by the potential for environmental conditions experienced in previous and current generations to independently affect phenotypic responses to high temperatures. We used a model coral reef fish (Acanthochromis polyacanthus) to investigate the influence of thermal conditions experienced by two generations on reproductive output and the quality of offspring produced by adults. We found that more gradual warming over two generations, +1.5°C in the first generation and then +3.0°C in the second generation, resulted in greater plasticity of reproductive attributes, compared to fish that experienced the same increase in one generation. Reproduction ceased at the projected future summer temperature (31.5°C) when fish experienced +3.0°C for two generations. Additionally, we found that transgenerational plasticity to +1.5°C induced full restoration of thermally affected reproductive and offspring attributes, which was not possible with developmental plasticity alone. Our results suggest that transgenerational effects differ depending on the absolute thermal change and in which life stage the thermal change is experienced. © 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Environmental stresses induce transgenerationally inheritable survival advantages via germline-to-soma communication in Caenorhabditis elegans
VL  - 8
AB  - Hormesis is a biological phenomenon, whereby exposure to low levels of toxic agents or conditions increases organismal viability. It thus represents a beneficial aspect of adaptive responses to harmful environmental stimuli. Here we show that hormesis effects induced in the parental generation can be passed on to the descendants in Caenorhabditis elegans. Animals subjected to various stressors during developmental stages exhibit increased resistance to oxidative stress and proteotoxicity. The increased resistance is transmitted to the subsequent generations grown under unstressed conditions through epigenetic alterations. Our analysis reveal that the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling effector DAF-16/FOXO and the heat-shock factor HSF-1 in the parental somatic cells mediate the formation of epigenetic memory, which is maintained through the histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylase complex in the germline across generations. The elicitation of memory requires the transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf in somatic tissues. We propose that germ-to-soma communication across generations is an essential framework for the transgenerational inheritance of acquired traits, which provides the offspring with survival advantages to deal with environmental perturbation. © The Author(s) 2017.

VL  - 6
AB  - Understanding how temperature affects fitness is important for conservation and pest management, especially in the era of global climate change. Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Oliver) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a worldwide pest of many economically important crops. Although much is known about this pest's life cycle, its adaptability to different temperatures is not fully understood. Here, we used age-and stage-specific life tables to investigate the effects of temperature on fitness-related traits and demographic parameters of R. ferrugineus under eight constant temperature regimens in the laboratory. The growth potential of these populations was also evaluated. The greatest longevity for males and females was 158.0 d at 24 degrees C and 144.5 d at 21 degrees C, respectively, but mean total fecundity was the highest at 27 degrees C. The intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (lambda), and net reproductive rate (R-0) increased initially at low temperatures and then decreased. All metrics reached a maximum at 27 degrees C and a minimum at 36 degrees C. Mean generation times (T) decreased across the temperature range with a minimum at 36 degrees C. Our results indicate that the optimum temperature for growth of R. ferrugineus was approximately 27 degrees C. Our work will be of value for developing strategies for control management of this pest species.

VL  - 105

SP  - 1524-1531
AB  - Previous studies reported that of the two egg parasitoids of Riptortus pedestris (F.) (Hemiptera: Alydidae) found in Korea, Gryon japonicum (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) appears in soybean fields much earlier than Ooencyrtus nezarae Ishii (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae). To explain this phenomenon, we evaluated the interactive influence of temperature and relative humidity (RH) on the biological attributes of these parasitoids, including adult parasitoid longevity and survival. Temperature had significant effects on all the biological attributes examined for both parasitoids, while RH only affected rates of parasitism and adult emergence. Interaction between temperature and species, but not RH and species was found to affect significantly on parasitism. G. japonicum showed higher relative increment in parasitism than O. nezarae at temperatures higher than 25°C. No significant differences in progeny sex ratio were detected for either species at any temperature X humidity combination. RH had no effect on the developmental time of O. nezarae but on the developmental time of G. japonicum, which was longer at low RH. Although the biological attributes of adult parasitoids of both species showed a wide range of adaptability, but it did not explain the patterns of occurrence of these species in the field. However, G. japonicum showed greater longevity than O. nezarae at all combinations of temperature and RH and this may partially explain the seasonal pattern of occurrence of adult parasitoids in the field previously observed. © 2012 Entomological Society of America.

SP  - 499-506
AB  - The productivity of steam flooding production wells is determined by numerous factors. In the paper the dominant influence factors of the productivity have been revealed using Gray Relation Analysis (GRA). Based on the Gray Relation Analysis, a model was established for predicting the productivity of steam flooding production wells by Support Vector Machine (SVM), the training algorithm was used to train the model and predict the productivity of test samples. The results show that high precision can be achieved from SVM, the error committed by the model was about ± 10% which is acceptable in field application. The results of SVM were compared with those of Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) and Backward Propagation (BP) Artificial Neural Network, it indicated that the prediction precision of SVM was obviously higher than that of the two mentioned above. It was demonstrated that the SVM had a good adaptability and practicability for predicting the productivity of steam flooding production wells. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

TI  - Future architecture, ancient wisdom: Adaptable structures from arctic tradition
VL  - 5
IS  - 4
SP  - 583-592
AB  - In the Canadian high Arctic, subsistence hunters and fishers have learned, over generations, to construct shelters from available materials so they can survive inclement weather while harvesting food. Now, as accelerating climate change exacerbates the intensity and unpredictability of extreme weather, scientists and country food harvesters once again worry about becoming stranded. To envision how tradition-based dwellings might serve as modern short-term survival/emergency structures, we reconstructed four vernacular structures in largely-Indigenous Arctic communities and compared them with a Sami reconstruction from Arctic Scandinavia. Local knowledge-holders and students participated and proposed adaptations using modern materials and concepts. The five structures were qualitatively evaluated for replicability, adaptability to modern situations, on-going usefulness, thermal performance, and materials availability. Quantitative evaluations included speed of construction relative to length of use and approximate mass of structure per person. The structures that were most adaptable, replicable, and efficient were elliptic paraboloid-shaped dwellings: Inuvialuit willow-framed moss-and-skin-clad dwellings (Western Canadian Arctic), Inuinnaqtun snow houses (iglus and qarmaqs) (central Canadian high Arctic), and birch-framed turf-clad homes (Scandinavian Arctic). All shared the following characteristics: (1) catenary- or elliptic paraboloid-domed framework, (2) materials accessed from immediate vicinity of building site, (3) ease of construction by 1 or few people, (4) passive heating and insulated assemblies, (5) windbreaks incorporated into siting and design, (6) strong structure resistant to high winds and inclement weather, and (7) siting along routes where foods are harvested. These characteristics are now serving as design principles for temporary Arctic dwellings, demonstrating how recording, adapting, and sharing long-resident peoples’ architectural knowledge facilitates survival during extreme events associated with accelerated climate change. © 2017 WIT Press.

TI  - The mutation breeding and mutagenic effect of air plasma on Penicillium chrysogenum
VL  - 14
IS  - 4
SP  - 297-302
AB  - Low temperature air plasma was used as the mutation tool for penicillin-producing strain Penicillium chrysogenum. The discharge conditions were RF power of 360 W, temperature of 40 degrees C in a sealed chamber, and pressure of 10 Pa to 30 Pa. The result showed that the kinetics of the survival rate followed a typical saddle-shaped curve. Based on a statistic analysis, at the treating duration of 10 min, the positive mutation rate was as high as 37.5% while the negative mutation rate was low. The colonial morphology changed obviously when the plasma treating duration reached or exceeded 45 min. After both primary and secondary screening, a mutant designated as aPc051310 with high productivity of penicillin was obtained, and a strong mutagenic effect on P. chrysogenum was observed in the process. It was proved that after five generations, the mutant aPc051310 still exhibits a high productivity. All the results prove that the plasma mutation method could be developed as a convenient and effective tool to breed high-yield strains in the fermentation industry, while expanding the plasm application at the same time.

TI  - Potential changes in benthic macrofaunal distributions from the English Channel simulated under climate change scenarios
VL  - 99
SP  - 153-161
AB  - Climate-induced changes in the distribution of species are likely to affect the functioning and diversity of marine ecosystems. Therefore, in economic and ecological important areas, such as the English Channel, projections of the future distributions of key species under changing environmental conditions are urgently needed. Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) have been applied successfully to determine potential distributions of species based on the information of the environmental niche of a species (sensu Hutchinson). In this study, the niches of two commercially exploited benthic species, Pecten maximus and Glycymeris glycymeris, and two ecologically important species, Abra alba and Ophelia borealis were derived using four contemporary hydrographic variables, i.e. sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, water depth and sediment type. Consequently, using these ecological envelopes, the Non-Parametric Probalistic Ecological Niche model (NPPEN) was applied to calculate contemporary probabilities of occurrence for each species in the North East Atlantic and to predict potential re-distributions under the climate change scenario A2 for two time periods 2050-2059 and 2090-2099. Results show general northern displacements of the four benthic species from the English Channel into the North Sea and southern Norwegian coast. The projections mostly indicate a reduction of suitable habitat for benthic species with a notable disappearance of their distributions in the English Channel, except for A. alba. However, interpretations should be treated with caution since many uncertainties and assumptions are attached to ecological niche models in general. Furthermore, opening up potential habitats for benthic species does not necessarily imply that the species will actually occupy these sites in the future. The displacement and colonisation success of species are a function of many other non-climatic factors such as species life histories, dispersal abilities, adaptability and community interactions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Stay cool, travel far: Cold-acclimated oriental fruit moth females have enhanced flight performance but lay fewer eggs
VL  - 151
IS  - 1
SP  - 11-18
AB  - Acclimation to a particular environment may provide organisms with advantages in that environment. In species with multiple generations per year, acclimation may cause life-history traits to vary with season and between generations. We investigated flight performance, lifetime egg production, and longevity in relation to the temperature experienced during development and adulthood in the invasive moth pest Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). We found that females that developed at low temperature had good flight abilities when they were flown at low, intermediate, and high temperatures. At high temperature, females that developed at high temperature did not outperform females that developed at low temperature. Flight performance was generally poor at low ambient temperature. Our findings suggest a beneficial acclimation effect, occurring at low temperature. Nonetheless, there were potential costs of development at low temperature: development took longer, resulting in smaller females, which laid fewer eggs. Given temporal and spatial temperature variability in the field, dispersal potential should not be considered homogeneous within populations or across generations. Our results suggest that the most favourable time periods for female dispersal are at the beginning and towards the end of the host crop growing season, which has potential implications for monitoring the occurrence and range expansion of this invasive pest species. © 2014 The Netherlands Entomological Society.

VL  - 21

SP  - 2954-2962
AB  - Global warming poses a threat to organisms with temperature-dependent sex determination because it can affect operational sex ratios. Using a multigenerational experiment with a marine fish, we provide the first evidence that parents developing from early life at elevated temperatures can adjust their offspring gender through nongenetic and nonbehavioural means. However, this adjustment was not possible when parents reproduced, but did not develop, at elevated temperatures. Complete restoration of the offspring sex ratio occurred when parents developed at 1.5 °C above the present-day average temperature for one generation. However, only partial improvement in the sex ratio occurred at 3.0 °C above average conditions, even after two generations, suggesting a limitation to transgenerational plasticity when developmental temperature is substantially increased. This study highlights the potential for transgenerational plasticity to ameliorate some impacts of climate change and that development from early life may be essential for expression of transgenerational plasticity in some traits. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

VL  - 2

SP  - 139-151
AB  - Although acclaimed as a biofuel crop with high potential to sustainably replace fossil fuels, Jatropha curcas L. remains a poorly studied plant. Reliable yield assessments with conventional methods require agroclimatic and physiological knowledge, which is not yet available for Jatropha. To fill this gap, we tested a novel two-step approach integrating knowledge from biogeography and population biology with available Jatropha field data. In the first step, using MaxEnt, a widely implemented model in biogeography, we predicted Jatropha fitness in response to climate by relating natural occurrence recorded in herbaria with bioclimatic geodatasets. In the second step, we relied on population biology principles supported by seed mass addition experiments to relate fitness to reproductive potential, hence seed yield. Jatropha seed yield in response to climate was mapped worldwide for actual (1950-2000 average) and future (2020) climate conditions. The modelled Jatropha seed yield was validated against a set of on-field yield assessments (R2=0.67, P&lt;0.001). The discrepancies between estimated and measured yields were partially explained by model uncertainties, as quantified by the sensitivity analysis of our modelling (R2=0.57, P=0.001). Jatropha has a pan-tropical distribution, plus specific adaptability to hot temperate areas. Climate variables most significantly affecting modelled yield response were annual average temperature, minimum temperature, annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - We investigate, numerically and experimentally, the effect of thermo-optical (TO) chaos on soliton generation dynamics in microresonators. Numerical simulations that include the thermal dynamics show that the generated solitons can either survive or annihilate when the pump laser is scanned from blue to red and then stop at a fixed wavelength; the outcome is stochastic and is strongly related to the number of solitons generated. The random fluctuations of the cavity resonance occurring under TO chaos are also found to trigger delayed spontaneous soliton generation after the laser scan ends, which could enable soliton excitation with slow laser tuning speed. Stochastic soliton annihilation/survival, as well as delayed spontaneous soliton generation, is observed experimentally in a silicon-nitride microresonator. © 2017 Optical Society of America.

AB  - At present, a possible radiation effect is estimated as a function of dose irradiation although it is strongly dependent more on the environmental factors. The consequences of low doses of internal irradiation linked to chronic soil contamination and of external irradiation associated with short or prolonged atmospheric impacts for plant populations in nature are analysed in this paper. The results revealed that the internal and external lab short and prolonged irradiations showed the same effects. In nature, soil contamination (∼30 Bq/kg) limited survival of seeds to ∼50% and increased their resistance to heat stress, whereas atmospheric impact (∼0.12 μSv/h) combined with high summer temperature decreased viability to 20-30%. External atmospheric irradiations compared with background originate sporadically synergic radiation-heat effect which can be lethal for populations from time to time, whereas low-chronic internal soil contamination decreases seed survival significantly but increases resistance caused by adaptation processes continued in lifespan and over generations.

TI  - The external domains of the HIV-1 envelope are a mutational cold spot
VL  - 6
AB  - In RNA viruses, mutations occur fast and have large fitness effects. While this affords remarkable adaptability, it can also endanger viral survival due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations. How RNA viruses reconcile these two opposed facets of mutation is still unknown. Here we show that, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), spontaneous mutations are not randomly located along the viral genome. We find that the viral mutation rate experiences a threefold reduction in the region encoding the most external domains of the viral envelope, which are strongly targeted by neutralizing antibodies. This contrasts with the hypermutation mechanisms deployed by other, more slowly mutating pathogens such as DNA viruses and bacteria, in response to immune pressure. We show that downregulation of the mutation rate in HIV-1 is exerted by the template RNA through changes in sequence context and secondary structure, which control the activity of apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (A3)-mediated cytidine deamination and the fidelity of the viral reverse transcriptase. © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

TI  - Estimating reaction norms for predictive population parameters, age specific mortality, and mean longevity in temperature-dependent cohorts of Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae)
VL  - 35

SP  - 354-362
AB  - Culex quinquefasciatus plays a major role in the transmission of important parasites and viruses throughout the world. Because temperature is an important limiting factor on growth and longevity of all mosquito species, estimating the reaction norms provides very important basic information for understanding both plasticity and individual variations of the population. In the present study, Cx. quinquefasciatus were maintained at five different constant temperatures (15°, 20°, 23°, 27°, and 30°C) for two subsequent generations. Reproductive population parameters in blood-fed mated females and longevities of virgin and blood-fed mated adults reared at different temperatures were compared for the two generations. Longevity increased as temperature decreased within a range of 15° to 30°C for the unmated adults, and 15° to 27°C for the mated and blood-fed adults. Generation times were as long as 124.07 and 106.76 days for two subsequent generations reared at 15°C, and the highest intrinsic rate of increase (rm) values were estimated at 0.22 and 0.18, respectively, from the cohorts reared at 27°C. For survival rates, reproductive rates (R0), and rm values, 30°C was found to be a critical temperature for this species. These cohorts produced the smallest amount of eggs (R0= 5.06), rm values decreasing across generations (from 0.11 to 0.06), and the survival rates from egg to adult were found to be insufficient (16.1 and 10.8%). Additionally, the rate of exponential increase with age and age specific mortalities (b) were calculated for the virgin cohorts. Age specific mortality rates increased as temperature decreased. The increase in mortality rates started to accelerate at 27°C and was more pronounced at 30°C, for both females and males. We estimated the coefficients of variation for the b values in which females have smaller coefficients than those of the males at all temperatures. © 2010 The Society for Vector Ecology.

TI  - Generation of reactive oxygen species during cryopreservation may improve Lilium × siberia pollen viability
VL  - 50
IS  - 3
SP  - 369-375
AB  - During biotic and abiotic stress in plants, reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play two very different roles: high ROS concentrations can exacerbate damage, whereas low concentrations can activate defense responses. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between ROS generation and pollen viability after cryopreservation. ROS generation was detected from 'Siberia' (Lilium × siberia) pollen using flow cytometry with 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate as a fluorescent probe. Pollen viability was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. ROS generation was slightly increased by rapid cooling (26.13 ± 4.74 vs. 15.80 ± 2.30 for fresh pollen) and significantly increased by vitrification (49.74 ± 1.43; P < 0.01). Pollen viabilities after rapid cooling and vitrification were significantly increased (58.88 ± 3.76% and 70.35 ± 2.90%, respectively) over that of fresh pollen (46.65 ± 1.61%; P < 0.01). No significant differences in ROS generation were associated with cold acclimation at different temperatures before rapid cooling. However, sharp decreases in viability were observed with cold acclimation at 4°C and -20°C relative to rapid cooling without acclimation (P < 0.01). We observed nonsignificant decreases in ROS generation among vitrification treatments that omitted different steps and a significant decrease when the unloading step was omitted (P < 0.05). Pollen viabilities were significantly reduced when the loading or dehydration steps were omitted (P < 0.01). No significant differences were observed in ROS generation or pollen viability among the treatments when 200 U/ml catalase was added to different solutions used in the vitrification process. Comprehensive analysis of all data indicated a positive correlation between ROS generation and pollen viability (r = 0.651, P < 0.001). Therefore, increasing ROS generation during cryopreservation may improve the viability of 'Siberia' pollen. © 2014 The Society for In Vitro Biology.

TI  - Differences in lethal response between male and female calanoid copepods and life cycle traits to cadmium toxicity
VL  - 26
IS  - 9
SP  - 1227-1239
AB  - This study determined the effect of cadmium (Cd) toxicity comparatively on two copepods, Eurytemora affinis (Poppe 1880) from a temperate region (Seine Estuary, France) and Pseudodiaptomus annandalei (Sewell 1919) from a subtropical region (Danshuei Estuary, Taiwan), according to their sex and reproductive stages. In addition, the effect of Cd to their life cycle traits was quantified. In the first experiment, both copepod sexes were exposed to 40, 80, 150, 220, and 360 µg/L of Cd and a control cultured in salinity 15, except that the temperature was 18 °C for E. affinis and 26 °C for P. annandalei. This allowed calculating median lethal concentration (LC50) of Cd after 96 h. This was 120.6 µg/L Cd for P. annandalei males which were almost twice as sensitive as P. annandalei females (LC50 = 239.5 µg/L Cd). For E. affinis females, the LC50 was 90.04 µg/L Cd, reflecting a 1.4 times higher sensitivity of females than of males (LC50 = 127.75 µg/L Cd). The males of both species were similarly sensitive; however, the E. affinis females were 2.7 times more sensitive than the P. annandalei females. We also compared the sensitivity of ovigerous females (OVF) and non-ovigerous females (NOF) of both species to Cd. Mortality was higher in NOF than in OVF of both copepod species in both the control and the 40 µg/L Cd treatment. Finally, the total population, fecundity and female morphology of both copepod species were estimated after exposing one generation cycle (nauplius to adult) to 40 μg/L Cd (for E. affinis) and 160 μg/L Cd (for P. annandalei). A significant decrease in cohort production, survival and clutch size but no significant difference in the prosome length of both copepod species exposed to Cd were detected. The ratio of OVF:NOF was high in both copepod species exposed to Cd. Cd toxicity did not significantly affect the M:F sex ratio and % OVF of E. affinis. However, the effect of Cd toxicity in P. annandalei was significant in the M:F sex ratio and was in favor of females and their reproductive activities due to an increase in % OVF. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in total production of P. annandalei due to high mortality in their nauplii and copepodid developmental stages. Toxicity to Cd appears to be affected by multiple factors including sex, reproductive life stage and species. The ecological implication of Cd toxicity on E. affinis and P. annandalei copepod ecology is more related to a skewed sex ratio, low egg production, reduced hatchability and reduced survival that affects the recruitment potential of the copepod nauplii resulting in a decreasing copepod population. Mortality, reproduction and population growth of model species may provide important bio-indicators for environmental risk assessment. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

VL  - 448
SP  - 243-249
AB  - The temperate-water Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai, has replaced the local subtropical species Haliotis diversicolor, as the main cultured abalone species in southern China in recent years. Although the ability to tolerate high temperature has increased for Pacific abalone, summer mortality still has a serious effect on cultivation success, as the temperature in southern China is significantly higher than the temperature in natural habitats. Hybridization has been demonstrated as an effective way to improve adaptability to particular environmental conditions. In this study, we introduced green abalone, Haliotis fulgens, from North America into China and successfully conducted hybridization trials with Pacific abalone. Fertilization rate for H. discus hannai female x H. fulgens male was at an acceptable level for commercial production. The hybrids exhibited hybrid vigor for growth and survival, as well as a higher temperature tolerance, showing great potential for application in the abalone aquaculture industry in southern China. Moreover, two-step PCR methods using three primers were developed, which can be used for quick genetic identification of green abalone, Pacific abalone and their reciprocal hybrids. Statement of relevance Summer mortality still has a serious effect on cultivation success of abalone farming in China. In this study, green abalone, H. fulgens were introduced and successfully conducted hybridization trials with Pacific abalone. The hybrids exhibited exciting hybrid vigor and adaptation to the higher temperature tolerance, which showed great potentials on application to the abalone aquaculture industry in southern China.

TI  - Regulation of thermal acclimation varies between generations of the short-lived mosquitofish that developed in different environmental conditions
VL  - 28
IS  - 1
SP  - 137-148
AB  - Environmental variability and perturbations can influence population persistence. It is therefore important to understand whether and how animals can compensate for environmental variability and thereby increase resilience of natural populations. Evolutionary theory predicts that in fluctuating environments, selection should favour developmental modifiers that reduce phenotypic expression of genetic variation. The expected result is that phenotypes are buffered from environmental variation across generations. Our aim was to determine whether phenotypes of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) remain stable across generations in which individuals were born into different thermal environments. We predicted that the spring generation (cool environment) would acclimate by increasing the concentration of regulatory transcription factor mRNA and activities of rate-limiting enzymes (hierarchical regulation) to compensate for the negative thermodynamic effects of lower temperatures on metabolic and locomotor performance. In contrast, the summer-born generation (warm environment) would show less capacity for acclimation and hierarchical regulation. We show that fish from both generations acclimated, but that there were significant differences in the phenotypic consequences of acclimation. The overall result was that burst performance, metabolic scope, and the activities of cytochrome c oxidase and lactate dehydrogenase were buffered from environmental change and did not differ between spring and summer fish at their natural water temperatures of 15 °C and 25 °C, respectively. However, there were differences between generations in sustained swimming performance and citrate synthase activity. We used metabolic control analysis to show that modes of regulation of metabolic scope and locomotor performance differed between generations. Spring-born fish relied to a greater extent on rate-limiting enzymes and transcriptional regulator (PGC-1α and β) mRNA concentrations than summer-born fish. We suggest that developmental modifiers are favoured in fluctuating environments to maximize phenotypic fitness of each generation. We show that the interaction between developmental and reversible acclimation can increase the resilience of physiological performance in a natural population to climate variation. © 2013 The Authors.

TI  - An optimal convective heat transfer coefficient calculation method in thermal analysis of spindle system
VL  - 91
IS  - 5
SP  - 2549-2560
AB  - Accurate calculation of convective heat transfer coefficients (CHTCs) is the premise to obtain accurate results of finite element thermal analysis (FETA). This paper presents an optimization method of CHTCs in steady state FETA of a spindle system using genetic algorithm (GA), which is especially suitable for complicated FETA with many CHTCs, such as 10 CHTCs. Firstly, the temperature values at thermal critical points, the temperature field, and the thermal fluctuations of a spindle system were obtained by experiment. Secondly, based on similarity theory, the initial values of CHTCs, which are inaccurate but close to real ones, were calculated by empirical formulas, and then, the FETA of the spindle system was conducted. The inaccurate initial CHTCs lead to inaccurate FETA results, so the optimal CHTCs closer to real ones were searched by GA automatically. The CHTCs were regarded as the target values of interest, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the experimental temperature values and the simulation temperature values was regarded as the fitness function. After 200 generations, the optimal CHTCs were searched with which the RMSE was the lowest. Finally, by conducting the FETA of the spindle system with the searched optimal CHTCs and comparing with the experimental results, the effectiveness of the proposed method was proved. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London.

VL  - 17

SP  - 2275-2285
AB  - Among the factors limiting species distribution, low temperatures play a key role for tropical invasive species in temperate areas. Susceptibility to cold winter conditions has been recognized as the limiting factor in Europe for Tetranychus evansi, an invasive spider mite feeding on Solanaceous plants originated from tropical South America and now present on every continent except Australia. Two genetically distinct lineages of this species were introduced to Europe; one (lineage 1) is widely distributed, while the other (lineage 2) has a limited distribution. Whether this difference corresponds to differences in cold hardiness is evaluated here by assessing phenotypic response of T. evansi to the winter conditions that the mite encounters in the coldest parts of the current invaded area. We designed the thermal regimes to mimic winter conditions, including temperature fluctuations between day and night (L:D 8:16, 12:4 °C) and exposed mites to this regime for 5, 10 or 15 weeks. We tested T. evansi from three locations, one from the tropical native area (Piracicaba, Brazil) and two, corresponding to the two introduced lineages, from the temperate invaded area (lineage 1 from Nice and lineage 2 from Perpignan, France). After 5 weeks of treatment, mites from all the locations showed high survival rates but the two introduced populations grew, producing more than one offspring per female. After 10 weeks, survival rates declined for mites from Brazil and Perpignan, but not Nice. After 15 weeks, only the mites from Nice survived and produced offspring.

TI  - Genomics basis of Arthrobacter spp. environmental adaptability– A review
VL  - 56
IS  - 4
SP  - 570-577
AB  - Arthrobacter species are found ecologically diverse and can survive in various environments. Many strains of these species have metabolic versatility and can degrade many environmental pollutants. Arthrobacter species are thought to play important roles in catabolism of environmental pollutants in nature. In recent years, the genomes of many Arthrobacter strains have been sequenced, which provides comprehensive information to clarify the molecular mechanisms related to environmental adaptability of Arthrobacter species. These genomics findings revealed several features that are commonly observed in Arthrobacter strains allowing for survival under stressful conditions. These include an array of genes associated with sigma factors and responses to oxidative, osmotic, starvation and temperature stresses. The genomics basis of their environmental adaptability are reviewed, which is expected to provide useful information for applying Arthrobacter strains in pollution remediation and shed some light on other bacterial environmental adaptability researches.

TI  - Transgenerational effects persist down the maternal line in marine sticklebacks: gene expression matches physiology in a warming ocean
VL  - 9
IS  - 9
SP  - 1096-1111
AB  - Transgenerational effects can buffer populations against environmental change, yet little is known about underlying mechanisms, their persistence or the influence of environmental cue timing. We investigated mitochondrial respiratory capacity (MRC) and gene expression of marine sticklebacks that experienced acute or developmental acclimation to simulated ocean warming (21°C) across three generations. Previous work showed that acute acclimation of grandmothers to 21°C led to lower (optimized) offspring MRCs. Here, developmental acclimation of mothers to 21°C led to higher, but more efficient offspring MRCs. Offspring with a 21°C × 17°C grandmother-mother environment mismatch showed metabolic compensation: their MRCs were as low as offspring with a 17°C thermal history across generations. Transcriptional analyses showed primarily maternal but also grandmaternal environment effects: genes involved in metabolism and mitochondrial protein biosynthesis were differentially expressed when mothers developed at 21°C, whereas 21°C grandmothers influenced genes involved in hemostasis and apoptosis. Genes involved in mitochondrial respiration all showed higher expression when mothers developed at 21° and lower expression in the 21°C × 17°C group, matching the phenotypic pattern for MRCs. Our study links transcriptomics to physiology under climate change, and demonstrates that mechanisms underlying transgenerational effects persist across multiple generations with specific outcomes depending on acclimation type and environmental mismatch between generations. © 2016 The Authors.

VL  - 46
IS  - 4
SP  - 995-1004
AB  - Biological features of Diaeretiella rapae (McIntosh), an aphid parasitoid, are conditioned by temperature and host. However, studies of host quality changes due to temperature adaptability have not been performed previously. Therefore, this study evaluated the adaptability of Lipaphis pseudobrassicae (Davis) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer) to high temperature, high temperature effect on their quality as hosts for D. rapae, and on parasitoid's thermal threshold. Aphid development, survivorship, fecundity, and longevity were compared at 19 °C and 28 °C. Host quality in different temperatures was determined through evaluation of parasitoid biology. Thermal threshold of D. rapae was determined using development time data. At 28 °C, development time, rate of immature survival, and total fecundity rates were greater in L. pseudobrassicae than in M. persicae. Development time of D. rapae in L. pseudobrassicae was shorter than that in M. persicae at 28 °C and 31 °C for females and at 31 °C for males. The thermal threshold of D. rapae was 6.38 °C and 3.33 °C for females and 4.45 °C and 3.63 °C for males developed on L. pseudobrassicae and M. persicae, respectively. Diaeretiella rapae size gain was greater in L. pseudobrassicae than that in M. persicae at 25 °C and 28 °C. Lipaphis pseudobrassicae showed better adaptation than M. persicae to elevated temperatures, which resulted in a better quality host for D. rapae at temperatures of 28 °C and 31 °C and a higher lower thermal threshold when the parasitoid developed within L. pseudobrassicae. The host's adaptation to high temperatures is a determinant of host quality for the parasitoid at that same climatic condition. © The Authors 2017.

TI  - Adaptation of the egg of the desert beetle, Microdera punctipennis (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), to arid environment
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
AB  - Microdera punctipennis Kaszab (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) is an endemic species in Guerbantonggut desert in China. To explore the ways that M. punctipennis egg adapts to dry desert environment, morphological characteristics of the egg was investigated along with the egg of the nondesert beetle Tenebrio molitor (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Water loss rate and survival rate of these eggs under different dry treatments (relative humidity0, 10, and 20%) were measured to evaluate the desiccation resistance of the eggs at different developmental stages (day 0, 2, and 5 eggs). Our results showed that the 50-egg weight in T. molitor was heavier than M. punctipennis, while the 50-first-instar larva weight in T. molitor was almost the same as in M. punctipennis. The water loss rate of M. punctipennis egg under dry conditions was significantly lower than T. molitor, and the egg survival rate was significantly higher than T. molitor. The estimated developmental threshold temperature of M. punctipennis egg was 18.30°C, and the critical thermal maximum of M. punctipennis egg is above 39°C. These features partly account for the adaptability of M. punctipennis to desert environment in egg stage. © The Author 2014.

TI  - Trans-generational plasticity in physiological thermal tolerance is modulated by maternal pre-reproductive environment in the polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica
VL  - 217
IS  - 11
SP  - 2004-2012
AB  - Maternal temperature is known to affect many aspects of offspring phenotype, but its effect on offspring physiological thermal tolerance has received less attention, despite the importance of physiological traits in defining organismal ability to cope with temperature changes. To fill this gap, we used the marine polychaete Ophryotrocha labronica to investigate the influence of maternal temperature on offspring upper and lower thermal tolerance limits, and assess whether maternal influence changed according to the stage of offspring pre-zygotic development at which a thermal cue was provided. Measurements were taken on adult offspring acclimated to 18 or 30°C, produced by mothers previously reared at 24°C and then exposed to 18 or 30°C at an early and late stage of oogenesis. When the shift from 24°C was provided early during oogenesis, mothers produced offspring with greater cold and heat tolerance whenever mother-offspring temperatures did not match, with respect to when they matched, suggesting the presence of an anticipatory maternal effect triggered by the thermal variation. Conversely, when the cue was provided later during oogenesis, more tolerant offspring were observed when temperatures persisted across generations. In this case, maternal exposure to 18 or 30°C may have benefited offspring performance, while limitations in the transmission of the thermal cue may account for the lack of correlation between maternal experiences and offspring performance when mother-offspring environments did not match. Our results provided evidence for a trans-generational effect of temperature on physiological performance characterised by a high context dependency, and are discussed in the light of maternal pre-reproductive experiences. © 2014.

TI  - Enhanced production of d -lactic acid by Sporolactobacillus sp.Y2-8 mutant generated by atmospheric and room temperature plasma
VL  - 62
IS  - 2
SP  - 287-292
AB  - To improve the production of d-lactic acid, atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) was used to generate mutations in Sporolactobacillus sp. Y2-8. An efficient mutant YBS1-5 was rapidly isolated by implanting ARTP twice with a 100W radio-frequency power input, 10 standard liters per minute of the helium flow, and a 2mm treatment distance. Significant improvement of d-lactic acid productivity (1.39gL(-1)H(-1)) by YBS1-5 was achieved, and it was 41.84% higher than the productivity (0.98gL(-1)H(-1)) of Y2-8. Moreover, the dry cell weight of YBS1-5 was 16.7% higher than that of Y2-8. Metabolic activities of concerned substrates related with key enzymes of d-lactic acid fermentation were analyzed by Biolog approach. Results showed that the activities of the key enzymes glucokinase and d-lactate dehydrogenase in mutant YBS1-5 were increased by approximately 45% and 66%, respectively, in comparison with those of the strain Y2-8. Fed-batch fermentation further improved the productivity; 127gL(-1) d-lactic acid in 74H by YBS1-5 with higher productivity (1.72gL(-1)H(-1)) was achieved. The subculture experiments indicated that YBS1-5 was genetically stable after eight generations. (C) 2014 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - With the development of economy, pollutions of energy and environment have severely threatened the survival of human beings. Besides, the increasing population and disordered urban expansion also have aroused the deterioration of urban hardening and heat island effect. Therefore, effective ecological design strategies of landscape will become the key point to deal with the current situation. While microclimate, as one of the most significant elements to improve small-scale landscape, requires much more attention. Based on such thought, the thesis takes pains to analyze the different impacts on thermal comfort caused by soft landscape and hard landscape in urban architectural environment, and to put forward ecological design strategies of pavements in urban architectural landscape from the aspect of feasibility. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.

TI  - Selfish drive can trump function when animal mitochondrial genomes compete
VL  - 48
IS  - 7
SP  - 798-802
AB  - Mitochondrial genomes compete for transmission from mother to progeny. We explored this competition by introducing a second genome into Drosophila melanogaster to follow transmission. Competitions between closely related genomes favored those functional in electron transport, resulting in a host-beneficial purifying selection. In contrast, matchups between distantly related genomes often favored those with negligible, negative or lethal consequences, indicating selfish selection. Exhibiting powerful selfish selection, a genome carrying a detrimental mutation displaced a complementing genome, leading to population death after several generations. In a different pairing, opposing selfish and purifying selection counterbalanced to give stable transmission of two genomes. Sequencing of recombinant mitochondrial genomes showed that the noncoding region, containing origins of replication, governs selfish transmission. Uniparental inheritance prevents encounters between distantly related genomes. Nonetheless, in each maternal lineage, constant competition among sibling genomes selects for super-replicators. We suggest that this relentless competition drives positive selection, promoting change in the sequences influencing transmission. © 2016 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Relationship between maximum oxygen uptake and peripheral vasoconstriction in a cold environment
VL  - 36
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Various individual characteristics affect environmental adaptability of a human. The present study evaluates the relationship between physical fitness and peripheral vasoconstriction in a cold environment. Methods: Seven healthy male students (aged 22.0 years) participated in this study. Cold exposure tests consisted of supine rest for 60 min at 28 °C followed by 90 min at 10 °C. Rectal and skin temperatures at seven sites, oxygen consumption, and the diameter of a finger vein were measured during the experiment. Metabolic heat production, skin heat conductance, and the rate of vasoconstriction were calculated. Individual maximum oxygen consumption, a direct index of aerobic fitness, was measured on the day following the cold exposure test. Results: Decreases in temperature of the hand negatively correlated with the changes in rectal temperature. Maximum oxygen consumption and the rate of vasoconstriction are positively correlated. Furthermore, pairs of the following three factors are also significantly correlated: rate of metabolic heat production, skin heat conductance, and the rate of vasoconstriction. Conclusion: The results of this study suggested that the capacity for peripheral vasoconstriction can be improved by physical exercise. Furthermore, when exposed to a cold environment, fitter individuals could maintain metabolic heat production at the resting metabolic level of a thermoneutral condition, as they correspondingly lost less heat. © The Author(s).

AB  - Adaptability is the key word when referring to the social history of opera, its institutions, its protagonists, its sponsors, its audiences and publics. This paper intends to illuminate only a limited number of certain historical aspects of opera's social life in terms of its publics, audiences, consumers, appreciators and supporters. Opera's social power has been for centuries in service to legitimate the power of authorities, to ensure the prestige of elites, and to heat the passion of masses. By referring to relevant literature and illustrative examples, it will be established at the end of this article that the element that ensured opera's success and long survival was and remains its adaptability to whatever historical contexts, social conditions, economic situations, political regimes and cultural milieus surrounded it.

TI  - The key issues on plant phenology under global change
VL  - 31
IS  - 9
SP  - 2593-2601
AB  - Plant phenology is an indicator of climate change. Both global warming and extreme climate lead to a critical change in plant phenological characteristics. It is of great importance to elucidate the evolution and mechanism of plant phenology in response to climate change. Natural plant phenological system contains the most direct and effective ecophysiological evidences as a product of global environmental change, which acts as an important complement to instrumental records. Plant phenological performance is extensively considered as a series of life history strategies for plants in a changing environment, which is in general closely related to reproduction of plant population and maintenance of biological diversity. It is highly sensitive to climate change and displays fine adaptability to the change as well. The combination of current phenological database with historical phenological records provides a facility to reveal the coupling relationship between climate change and plant phenological cycle. Previous studies showed that long-term located observation and relevant integrated analysis on plant phenological performance would help reveal the ecological adaptive characteristics of plant phonology, and assess the positive and negative feedbacks between plant phenology and climate change. With the rise of global change ecology in recent years, great efforts have been made on quantitatively assessing material production and carbon cycle in ecosystem in field of plant phenology, particularly underlying that interaction between plant phenological cycle and carbon cycle in ecosystem has become a hot issue. This paper summarizes major progresses in plant phenology under global change and proposes a few domestic and international hot issues in this field. The research interest of plant phenology has gradually shifted the focus from previous field observations and preliminary statistical analysis to current environmental outcome assessement and regulatory mechanism investigation of phenological cycle. The methodology of plant phenology has been upgraded from the superficial description on the response of plant phenological cycle to climate change to the coupling exploration on plant phenology at the multi-scale and multi-element scales. With the development of interdisciplinary research, plant phenology has been extended to a systematic evaluation on the impacts of phenological changes on ecosystems, climatic change, agricultural production and even human health. With these transitions, a few key issues has been raised accordingly, such as the differentiate contribution of atmospheric temperature and photoperiod to plant phenological cycle in different temperature belts, the nonlinear characteristics of the change in plant phenology versus climate change, the complexity of plant phenology at the community level, as well as the importance of crop phenology in agricultural ecosystems. It can be argued that the initiative of plant phenology would play a critical role in practical fields such as agricultural production, human health and landscape design, but also significantly boosts the progress in interdisciplinary research involved in ecology, climatology and geography. Finally, a few recommendations are proposed in terms to the construction of phenological observation network, the exploitation and application of new technologies and the integration of relevant research programs.

TI  - Environmental heat stress induces epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of robustness in parthenogenetic Artemia model
VL  - 28
IS  - 8
SP  - 3552-3563
AB  - The notion that phenotypic traits emerging from environmental experiences are heritable remains under debate. However, the recent report of nonmendelian transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, i.e., the inheritance of traits not determined by the DNA sequence, might make such a phenomenon plausible. In our study, by carrying out common garden experiments, we could provide clear evidences that, on exposure to nonlethal heat shocks, a parental population of parthenogenetic (all female) Artemia (originating from one single female) experiences an increase in levels of Hsp70 production, tolerance toward lethal heat stress, and resistance against pathogenic Vibrio campbellii. Interestingly, these acquired phenotypic traits were transmitted to three successive generations, none of which were exposed to the parental stressor. This transgenerational inheritance of the acquired traits was associated with altered levels of global DNA methylation and acetylated histones H3 and H4 in the heat-shocked group compared to the control group, where both the parental and successive generations were reared at standard temperature. These results indicated that epigenetic mechanisms, such as global DNA methylation and histones H3 and H4 acetylation, have particular dynamics that are crucial in the heritability of the acquired adaptive phenotypic traits across generations. © FASEB.

SP  - 51-58
AB  - Thaumetopoea pityocampa winter nests were collected in January 2011 and 2015 from six localities situated in different regions over pest's range in Bulgaria. In each site, ten winter nests were randomly selected and the larval instar structure and their survival were determined. The 'silk index' of winter nests and the level of their building were assessed. Using data about average daily and minimal monthly temperatures from November (2010, 2014) to February (2011, 2015), the number of favourable days for T. pityocampa larval development was evaluated. A relationship between the climatic characteristics over the cold period of year and the larval instar structure, survival, adaptability expressed by the level of building winter nests and the time of nest leaving and moving of the larvae into the soil was found out.

TI  - The homology gene BtDnmt1 is essential for temperature tolerance in invasive bemisia tabaci mediterranean cryptic species
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
AB  - The Bemisia tabaci Mediterranean (MED) cryptic species has been rapidly invading most parts of the world owing to its strong ecological adaptability, particularly its strong resistance to temperature stress. Epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in mediating ecological plasticity. In particular, DNA methylation has been the focus of attempts to understand the mechanism of phenotypic plasticity. The relationship between temperature and DNA methylation and how it affects the adaptability of invasive insects remain unknown. To investigate the temperature resistance role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) in MED, we cloned and sequenced BtDnmt1 homology and identified its functions under various temperature conditions. The full-length cDNA of MED BtDnmt1 homology was 5,958 bp and has a 4,287 bp open reading frame that encodes a 1,428-amino-acid protein. BtDnmt1 mRNA expression levels were significantly down-regulated after feeding with dsRNA. Furthermore, after feeding with dsBtDnmt1, the MED adults exhibited significantly higher mortality under temperature stress conditions than the controls, suggesting that MED BtDnmt1 homology plays an essential role in the temperature tolerance capacity of MED. Our data improve our understanding of the temperature resistance and temperature adaptability mechanisms that have allowed the successful invasion and colonization of various environments by this alien species. © The Author(s) 2017.

TI  - Exploring parallel programming models for heterogeneous computing systems
SP  - 98-107
AB  - Parallel systems that employ CPUs and GPUs as two heterogeneous computational units have become immensely popular due to their ability to maximize performance under restrictive thermal budgets. However, programming heterogeneous systems via traditional programming models like OpenCL or CUDA involves rewriting large portions of application-code. They also lead to code that is not performance portable across different architectures or even across different generations of the same architecture. In this paper, we evaluate the current state of two emerging parallel programming models: C++ AMP and OpenACC. These emerging programming paradigms require minimal code changes and rely on compilers to interact with the low-level hardware language, thereby producing performance portable code from an application standpoint. We analyze the performance and productivity of the emerging programming models and compare them with OpenCL using a diverse set of applications on two different architectures, a CPU coupled with a discrete GPU and an Accelerated Programming Unit (APU). Our experiments demonstrate that while the emerging programming models improve programmer productivity, they do not yet expose enough flexibility to extract maximum performance as compared to traditional programming models. © 2015 IEEE.

TI  - Cold tolerance of the overwintering egg of Apolygus lucorum Meyer-Dür (Hemiptera: Miridae)
VL  - 32
IS  - 5
SP  - 1553-1561
AB  - Apolygus lucorum has become one of the most pestiferous pests of cotton and fruits with widely applications of transgenic Bt cotton in China. Cold tolerance of its overwintering eggs was studied, and the content of biochemical substances was also determined, to evaluate its overwintering adaptability. The results showed that there were significant differences on cold survival ability of the overwintering eggs among months. Lt50 of the overwintering eggs was in order of January > February > December > March > April at the temperature of -10 °C or -20 °C, and in order of January > December > March >February > April at the temperature of -30 °C. The mortality of protected eggs in the April (4. 32%, 5. 36%, 5. 42%, 6. 79% and 7. 63%) was significantly lower than non-protected eggs in the April (46. 06%, 51. 84%, 54. 59%, 63. 07% and 74. 41%) when they were treated at the temperature of -20 °C for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days. The cold tolerance to lower temperature of artificial diapause eggs was higher than the normal eggs,while lower than the diapause overwintering eggs. The cold acclimation increased the cold tolerance of overwintering eggs of A. lucorum. The mortality of overwintering eggs at the temperature of -20 °C for 100 hours decreased significantly after the overwintering eggs was treated at 0 °C for 20 minutes, and the mortality was always about 37% at the temperature of -20 °C for 100 hours after was treated at 0 °C for more than 40 minutes. The content of biochemical substances of overwintering eggs changed seasonally. The water content of overwintering eggs in winter was significantly higher than those after winter, and was highest in January (43. 98%) and lowest in April (38. 79%). The fat content of overwintering eggs decreased from 38. 24% in December to 27. 08% in April over the winter. The protein content and glycogen content all reduced at first, then increased. The protein content decreased from 78. 77 μg/ mg in December to 59. 80 μg/ mg in January, then increased gradually to 73. 62 μg/ mg in April. The glycogen content decreased from 39. 60 μg/ mg in December to 21. 17 μg/ mg in January, then increased gradually to 35. 10 μg/ mg in April. In conclusion, cold tolerance of overwintering eggs of A. lucorum changed seasonally. The overwintering eggs showed high tolerance to the low temperature in winter, and the protection of overwintering place improved its overwintering adaptability.

TI  - Adaptability of agricultural ecosystems in the hilly areas in Southern China: A case study in Hengyang Basin
VL  - 35
IS  - 6
SP  - 1991-2002
AB  - Adaptability is the response to external pressures or actions that people make efforts to reduce the adverse effects caused by global change with the aim of harmoniously inhabiting the environment. In studies focused on global change, adaptability has attracted great attention. There have been many studies on the ecological adaptability of plants under global change. The model of water ecological adaptability of upland crops has been discussed, and the eco-environment adaptability under changing climates in the past decade has been investigated. However, little research has been conducted on agricultural ecosystem adaptability (AEA). Agricultural ecosystem adaptability is affected by the natural environment, as well as by social and economic factors. Different factors have different driving or restraining effects on AEA values. The rice farming regions of the hilly area in the Hengyang basin in southern China is the basis for our AEA study. Our study on AEA values is quantitative and applies principal component analysis to analyze the main driving factors affecting adaptability in the different regions of our study area. Based on the calculation of the size of the driving force and AEA values, we analyzed the adaptability of the different regions. The AEA concept helps maintain sustainable agricultural development. Sustainable agricultural development is more likely to recover quickly from environmental disasters (such as floods or droughts) or economic (i.e. poor, lack of food, fluctuations in commodity prices) crises. Based on natural, social and economic factors, we establish the AEA indexes for different regions in the Hengyang Basin. Our findings show that AEA is highest in Hengyang. In the other regions, the central parts of the basin have low adaptability and the surrounding regions have high adaptability. Good economic conditions are the main driving factors of a high AEA, and good hydrothermal and irrigation systems induce high adaptability. Hengyang is the economic, political and cultural center of the Hengyang Basin. The per- capita net income of farmers in Hengyang is the highest in region, and the farmers'Engel coefficient is the lowest. Nevertheless, the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers are still prevalent in Hengyang. Changning and Leiyang have good hydrothermal and irrigation systems. Flood and drought disasters seldom occur in these cities and this contributes to a high adaptability. Population size and the conservation of soil and water are the primary driving factors in low adaptability areas. Extreme heat and harsh terrain conditions lead to the lowest agricultural ecosystem adaptability. The application of pesticides and chemical fertilizers result in a temporary high AEA, which cannot be sustained. High AEAs resulting from good hydrothermal and irrigation systems are sustainable. The development potential of a region with high AEAs is greater than that of regions with low AEAs. The low adaptability areas can improve their AEA ratings by not only using the natural environment in a sustainable way, but also improving social and economic factors. Increasing the production of good crop strains, improving irrigation and drainage conditions and developing advantageous agricultural policies are very effective ways of enhancing adaptability. © 2015, Ecological Society of China.

AB  - Rebar is the number one construction material for the growing economies of the Far East and the Middle East, spurring the growth of new plants in the area. The level of technology and operational expertise in order to produce this basic product is minimal, and thus the market is wide open to newcomers. The Stefana group, a family-owned operation, with a consolidated multi-generational tradition in steel production, ordered this mill in mid-2005, after a careful evaluation of market conditions and the state of the art in equipment and process technology. The mill is based on the proven housingless stand concept. A 130 tph cold/155 tph hot walking beam furnace supplies the 160-mm square billets to the 16-stand rolling mill in horizontal and vertical configuration. One of the main benefits of this approach is the flexibility of using different outlets and setups. This maximizes plant utilization and minimizes downtime.

AB  - The genome of the Antarctic bacterium Pseudomonas extremaustralis was analyzed searching for genes involved in environmental adaptability focusing on anaerobic metabolism, osmoregulation, cold adaptation, exopolysaccharide production and degradation of complex compounds. Experimental evidences demonstrated the functionality of several of these pathways, including arginine and pyruvate fermentation, alginate production and growth under cold conditions. Phylogenetic analysis along with genomic island prediction allowed the detection of genes with probable foreign origin such as those coding for acetate kinase, osmotic resistance and colanic acid biosynthesis. These findings suggest that in P. extremaustralis the horizontal transfer events and/or gene redundancy could play a key role in the survival under unfavorable conditions. Comparative genome analysis of these traits in other representative Pseudomonas species highlighted several similarities and differences with this extremophile bacterium. © 2014, Springer Japan.

VL  - 17

SP  - 1507-1516
AB  - Piezodorus guildinii (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is an important soybean pest, and one of its main natural enemies is Telenomus podisi (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae). Rearing of the parasitoid is constrained by the hosts' egg quality, which deteriorates after few generations in laboratory, therefore, cold-stored host eggs utilization could be a useful tool for augmentative biological control. Thus, the objective was to evaluate the quality of P. guildinii cold-stored eggs, on the performance of parental and F1 generation of T. podisi. Host eggs 24 hour old were stored at -18°C for one (N= 53), two (N= 28) or three months (N= 29), and approximately 40 host eggs were offered to a T. podisi female per treatment, for 48 hours. The control treatment consisted of 24-hour-old non-frozen host eggs, obtained and kept at 24°C (N= 55). Parental generation parasitism and progeny´s emergence on frozen eggs was significantly lower than on non-frozen eggs, even for the shorter storage period. Male proportion and preimaginal development time of the progeny increased with freezing period. However, parasitism proportion caused by adults of F1, and emergence, male proportion, and preimaginal development time of F2 were not affected. Although the performance of T. podisi on frozen P. guildinii eggs was significantly lower than on nonfrozen ones, host eggs storage for up to two months allowed obtaining a parasitism rate of 40% with a high emergence rate. This could be helpful enough to maintain mass rearings, mainly during the host hibernation period, and to enhance field parasitism when host is scarce. © 2015, Tarbiat Modares University.

VL  - 2
IS  - 4
SP  - 210-224
AB  - The Indian power generation industry has undergone a paradigm shift during the past two decades largely due to private sector participation and restructuring of the sector. In order to assess the performance of the power generation sector, the present study takes annual data of 14 major states in India for the period 2000-01 to 2007-08 and estimates a stochastic translog production frontier. The decline in technical efficiency of the Indian power generation sector over the study period, as obtained from the econometric estimation, appears to indicate that it has failed to bring in the desired results in terms of efficiency improvement. The total factor productivity (TFP) of the power generation industry, which includes technical change, technical efficiency change, and scale change, however, has shown some improvement. Technical efficiency of the power generation industry is explained by technical manpower employed, per capita state domestic product, year of unbundling of State Electricity Boards (SEBs) and time variable. The study concludes that inefficiency in Indian power sector is caused by the above mentioned factors rather than stochastic error.

TI  - Optimal dynamic dispatch of wind integrated thermal generators with compressed air energy storage
VL  - 4
IS  - 3
SP  - 689-697
AB  - Maintaining reliability of power supply is a big challenge when renewable energy sources (RES) are integrated in the traditional power grid. Allocation of adequate storage of energy is essential in order to maintain power balance with changing demand levels and uncertain and intermittent renewable power generation. After the Kyoto protocol on climate change there is global focus on limiting emissions from fossil fuels. As a result increasing number of RES is being integrated with existing power grids. Their intermittent and uncertain nature however creates difficulty in maintaining reliability particularly when large scale integration of these resources is planned. Efficient energy storage systems are therefore essential to store surplus power when renewable generation is in abundance and to release it during periods when renewable generation is insufficient. This paper explores the viability of operating wind farm coupled with compressed air energy storage (CAES) system to meet the demand in a reliable manner and control the electricity prices during peak loads. The optimal dispatch of thermal units is computed using an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) such that all thermal, wind generator and CAES system constraints are satisfied. A 24-hour dispatch period is considered by applying thermal generator ramp-rate limits between consecutive time periods. Two separate models are employed for optimizing cost and profit. The proposed method is tested on a test power system consisting of six thermal generating units integrated with 50 wind turbines.

VL  - 19

SP  - 306-316
AB  - Abiotic stresses such as drought, high salinity, and extreme temperatures are common adverse environmental conditions that significantly reduce the crop productivity. Plants have the capability to sense and adjust to abiotic stresses, although the degree of adaptability to specific stresses varies from species to species. The adaptability to environmental stresses is controlled by either simple or complex cascades of molecular networks. Transcription factors (TFs) play vital regulatory roles in abiotic stress responses in plants by interacting with cis-elements present in the promoter region of various abiotic stress responsive genes. The identification and molecular tailoring of novel TFs involved in environmental stress responses have the potential to overcome a number of important limitations encountered in the generation of transgenic crop plants with superior yield under stress conditions. This opens an excellent opportunity to develop stress tolerant crops in future. This review summarizes the role of various transcription factors in crop improvement through transgenic technology. © Indian Society for Plant Physiology 2014.

TI  - Reduction of rejections in cold rolled strip welding by intelligent analysis of image and process data
SP  - 408-413
AB  - Welding plays an important role in the metallurgic process, being a critical part of continuous processes. The early detection of welding defects is a key aspect to guarantee productivity. There are factories in which the welding testing is performed visually by an operator. In this scenario, the physiological and psychological aspects of the operator can determine the productivity due to unnecessary repetitions of welds. This paper proposes an on-line intelligent system for operator support. The goal is to reduce the unnecessary repetitions of welds. The proposed method uses data mining and machine learning techniques fed by the information extracted from the process data and from the data obtained by an infrared camera, creating an objective model that estimates the weld reliability. Flexibility and adaptability are two key concepts in the proposed design. © 2011 IEEE.

TI  - Iron ore pellet dustiness part II: Effects of firing route and abrasion resistance on fines and dust generation
VL  - 36
IS  - 5
SP  - 340-347
AB  - Iron ore pellets abrade during their production and handling, which lowers product quality and leads to dustiness issues. Pellets were collected from a variety of plants (operating either Straight-Grate (SG) or Grate-Kiln (GK) furnaces) to understand whether furnace type affects fines and dust formation. Results showed that pellets fired in SG furnaces were less abrasion-resistant (3.5 × lower) than pellets fired in GK furnaces. Concurrently, laboratory pellets were prepared using various ores, binders, and firing temperatures. These were tested to understand the relationship between abrasion index and dustiness. AI was observed to range from 1 to 14%. Dustiness, determined via AI and size distributions of abrasion progeny, ranged from 0.2 to 1.6%. For AI greater than 5%, AI can be used to indicate potentially high levels of dust. For AI less than 5%, there was a poor correlation between AI and dustiness. This was explained by the observation that as AI decreased, the abrasion product fineness increased. The results from parts I and II of this investigation suggest that material loss and levels of pellet dustiness may be significantly affected by pellet quality up to a certain point. Poorly fired pellets will be dusty during handling and transportation, while well-fired pellets will generate less - but finer - material as their quality improves. This could lead to little observed changes in dust generation over a wide range of pellet quality. Dust generation at each site would then depend on the quantity of material produced and their extent of handling. Copyright © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

TI  - Trichogrammatids: Adaptation to stresses
SP  - 105-125
AB  - Mass-reared trichogrammatids species require to be fortified with adequate levels of tolerance to the common physical and chemical stresses encountered in the target crop ecosystems. Past studies on the effects of the two physical factors temperature and humidity on the biology of Trichogramma have shown that temperature below 15 or above 35 °C tends to cause mostly negative effects on their survival and/or performance. It is possible to identify higher temperature tolerant strains among native species focused surveys as undertaken recently in East Africa. The other approach being successfully pursued at NBAII is to develop such strains by exposing the colonies to incremental levels of rearing temperature across generations. For instance, the temperature-tolerant strains recorded significantly higher parasitism than the laboratory strain up to 40 °C. Greater progress has been made in India in developing insecticide-tolerant strains in the last two decades. The first attempt led to endosulfan tolerant strain (T. chilonis commercially named as Endogram). Most recently, multiple insecticide strain (MITS-TC) has been developed against endosulfan, monocrotophos and fenvalerate. The available information on the genetics of stress tolerant Trichogramma species is limited and needs to be enriched by more holistic studies. Future research on stress tolerant strain development should include studies of heat shock protein (HSP), the genes and alleles responsible for stress tolerance and the mode of inheritance, besides seeking out for suitable mutants and assessing the role of endosymbionts on the stress tolerance and other fitness attributes. © Springer India 2013.

TI  - Spatial analysis of the sensitivity of wheat yields to temperature in India
VL  - 200
SP  - 192-202
AB  - Over large wheat growing areas of India, a rise in minimum temperature (T-n) is occurring at a faster rate (@ 0.32 degrees C 10 yr(-1)) than maximum temperature (T-x) (@ 0.28 degrees C 10 yr(-1)). During February, coinciding with post-anthesis period of wheat, about 79.4% area showed significant warming in T-n (@ 0.37 degrees C 10 yr(-1)) for 1970-2012 period. Indian wheat yields were observed to be prone to continual heat stress and especially to short-term temperature extremes. Wheat yields appear to be becoming more sensitive to Tn, especially during post-anthesis period. Mean wheat yields for the period 1980-2011 declined by 7% (204 kg ha(-1)) for a 1 degrees C rise in T-n. Exposure to continual T-n exceeding 12 degrees C for 6 days and terminal heat stress with T-x exceeding 34 C for 7 days during post-anthesis period are the other thermal constraints in achieving high productivity. Improved understanding from this study on the role of Tn during post-anthesis period may further reduce the uncertainties in anthropogenic climate change assessments on Indian wheat yields. There is a need to consider inclusion of early maturing, high yielding and heat tolerant wheat lines in the breeding program for Indian conditions. Thermally sensitive areas evolved from this study may guide the researchers to identify such wheat lines for their adaptability in to future climates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lyophilized artificial diet for rearing the neotropical euschistus heros (hemiptera: Pentatomidae)
VL  - 16
IS  - 1
AB  - An artificial diet to mass-rear Euschistus heros (F. 1798) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) was developed in the laboratory. Biological studies were conducted under controlled conditions of temperature (25±2°C), RH: 60±10%, and photoperiod of 14:10 (L:D) h. Out of 13 diets tested, 2 diets (D9 and D11) were the most suitable. The artificial diets selected had the same composition (green beans, peanuts, sucrose, water, Nipagin, and sorbic acid) except for different antimicrobial agents (D11 has tetracycline, and D9 doesn't). The 68% viability for the egg-adult period of insects reared on these lyophilized artificial diets (LAD) was almost twice as high as the 38% viability obtained with the natural diet. Although adults reared on LAD weighed 17% less than those reared on the natural diet, mean fecundity was higher than on the natural diet (282 eggs/female), reaching 430 eggs/female. The net reproductive rate (Ro) increased over the generations for the diets with lyophilized material and antimicrobial agents. The opposite occurred with the diet of lyophilized material without antimicrobial agents, showing that the insects either adapted or degenerated through generations. Lyophilized diets supported the production of E. heros through at least 10 generations, with no degeneration. © The Author 2016.

VL  - 51
SP  - 227-239
AB  - A unique accumulation of workers ('colony') of the wood ant Formica polyctena Först., trapped within an old bunker for storing nuclear weapons, is described. The source of the 'colony' is a large colony nesting outdoors, on top of the bunker. Individuals that have fallen down through a ventilation pipe are not able to find their way back to the mother nest. In total darkneb, they have constructed an earthen mound, which they have maintained all-year-round by moulding it and keeping the nest entrances open. Judging from the huge deposits of wood-Ant corpses in the bunker, the 'colony' has survived for years. Through these years, the mortality has been more than compensated by new workers that fall down during the active season of the free-living colony outside, and at present the number of the bunker workers is counted in hundreds of thousands. The 'colony' has evidently produced no offspring, which is due to low (though relatively stable) temperatures and scanty food in the bunker. Copyright © 2016 Wojciech Czechowski et al.

TI  - Multilevel assessment of Cry1Ab Bt-maize straw return affecting the earthworm Eisenia fetida
VL  - 137
SP  - 59-69
AB  - Non-target effects of two varieties of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-maize straw (5422Bt1 [event Bt11] and 5422CBCL [MON810]) return on the Eisenia fetida were investigated by using multilevel assessments, compared to near-isogenic non-Bt-maize (5422). 5422Bt1 straw return had no deleterious effects on adult earthworms and had significantly positive effects on juveniles over three generations. Negative, no, and positive effects on adults treated with 5422CBCL straw were observed in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation, respectively. Negative and positive effects were observed on juveniles produced from the 1st- and 2nd-generation adults treated with 5422CBCL straw, respectively. Glutathione peroxidase activity of earthworms from Bt-maize treatments was significantly higher than that of control on the 90th d. Translationally controlled tumour protein (TCTP) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes were down-regulated, while annetocin (ANN) expression was up-regulated in 5422Bt1 treatments. TCTP and SOD genes were up-regulated, while ANN and heat shock protein 70 were down-regulated in E. fetida from 5422CBCL treatments. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that Cry1Ab released from 5422Bt1 and 5422CBCL straw degraded rapidly on the 15th and 30th d and had a slow decline in the rest testing time. Cry1Ab concentrations in the soil, casts and guts of earthworm significantly decreased over the course of the experiment. This study was the first to evaluate generational effects of Bt-maize straw return on earthworms under laboratory conditions. The responses of enzymes activity and genes expression may contribute to better understand above different effects of Bt-maize straw return on earthworms from the 1st generation.

VL  - 5

SP  - 465-468
AB  - Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare, Asteraceae) is one of the most spreaded species and medical plant on the same time. However, Tansy is principally used in tradition medicine as antihypertensive, antispasmodic, antihelminthic, carminative, antidiabetic and diuretic. The Tanacetum species are rich in essential oils, bitter components and sesquiterpene lactones. Environmental adaptability of the plants can be tested through from essential oil contents. Essential oil helps to easily submit plant environmental stress conditions: drought, intense radiation, high temperature, heavy metal contents. Also, essential oils are not constant in the qualitative and quantitative terms. Quality of essential oil depends on the external environmental condition. Natural selection favors survival of the population with the composition of essential oil which has a higher adaptive value. The goal was to measure the quantity and quality of essential oil, as adaptability indicator and to prove the statement that the plants answer on environmental stress by production of essential oil. The laboratory experiment is realised by analizing the essential oil contents in Tansy from two completally different locations: one location was the unpolluted zone, but the other location was the most polluted industrial zone. Essential oil constituents were separated and identyfied using the GC-MS chromatography. Results showed that the plants react on environmental stress by higher production of essential oils. In conclusion, elevated content of the essential oils in tansy on the same time presents the high level of environmental adaptability.

VL  - 5
IS  - 2
SP  - 150-158
AB  - A field survey was conducted in March 2009 in upland rice growing agro-ecosystem of four districts in Tanzania namely Ulanga, Kyela, Morogoro and Korogwe to investigate the agronomic and socioeconomic factors which influence rice productivity and suitability of these areas for NERICA cultivation so as to increase rice productivity. Questionnaire was used to gather primary information from ten farmers from each district. Secondary information was obtained from district agricultural offices and weather data from Tanzania Meteorological Agency. A composite soil sample was collected from upland rice fields of sampled farmers and analyzed for complete soil fertility. The findings showed that rice is the most important crop in all areas as both food and cash crop. However, rice yield is as low as 1 tha-1. Low yields are attributed to diseases and pests, poor inputs, insufficient water, poor soil fertility, short supply of fertilizers and use of low yielding traditional varieties, among other factors. The soils are potentially low in nitrogen and phosphorus and therefore N and P fertilization is recommended. Rainfall and temperature pattern is adequate for NERICA cultivation which gives higher yields compared to traditional upland varieties under stress-prone environments such as poor soil fertility, disease and pests and moisture stress which characterize the upland agro-ecosystem. © 2010 Academic Journals.

TI  - Multigenerational analysis of temperature and salinity variability affects on metabolic rate, generation time, and acute thermal and salinity tolerance in Daphnia pulex
VL  - 37
IS  - 3
SP  - 185-194
AB  - Climate change, sea level rise, and human freshwater demands are predicted to result in elevated temperature and salinity variability in upper estuarine ecosystems. Increasing levels of environmental stresses are known to induce the cellular stress response (CSR). Energy for the CSR may be provided by an elevated overall metabolic rate. However, if metabolic rate is constant or lower under elevated stress, energy for the CSR is taken from other physiological processes, such as growth or reproduction. This study investigated the examined energetic responses to the combination of temperature and salinity variability during a multigenerational exposure of partheogenetically reproducing Daphnia pulex. We raised D. pulex in an orthogonal combination of daily fluctuations in temperature (15, 15-25, 15-30 degrees C) and salinity (0,0-2, 0-5). Initially metabolic rates were lower under all variable temperature and variable salinity treatments. By the 6th generation there was little metabolic variation among low and intermediate temperature and salinity treatments, but metabolic suppression persisted at the most extreme salinity. When grown in the control condition for the 6th generation, metabolic suppression was only observed in D. pulex from the most extreme condition (15-30 degrees C, 0-5 salinity). Generation time was influenced by acclimation temperature but not salinity and was quickest in specimens reared at 15-25 C, likely due to Q(10) effects at temperatures closer to the optima for D. pulex, and slowest in specimens reared at 15-30 degrees C, which may have reflected elevated CSR. Acute tolerance to temperature (LT50) and salinity (LC50) were both highest in D. pulex acclimated to 15-30 degrees C and salinity 0. LT50 and LC50 increased with increasing salinity in specimens raised at 15 degrees C and 15-25 degrees C, but decreased with increasing salinity in specimens raised at 15-30 degrees C. Thus, increasing temperature confers cross-tolerance to salinity stress, but the directionality of synergistic effects of temperature and salinity depend on the degree of environmental variability. Overall, the results of our study suggest that temperature is a stronger determinant of metabolism, growth, and tolerance thresholds, and assessment of the ecological impacts of environmental change requires explicit information regarding the degree of environmental variability.

TI  - The effect of temperature on the development and life cycle regulation of the pine weevil Hylobius abietis and the potential impacts of climate change
VL  - 14
IS  - 4
SP  - 348-357
AB  - 1 The pine weevil Hylobius abietis is widely distributed in the Palaearctic region where it is a major pest. Although predominantly semi-voltine, with a 2-year life cycle, the generation time across its range can vary from 1 to 4 years. The duration of the life cycle and the seasonal timing of weevil activity affect the economic impact and management of this pest, all of which are likely to change in a warming climate. 2 To determine the effect of temperature and tree species on weevil growth and development, laboratory experiments were performed with eggs, larvae, prepupae, pupae and adults, using, as appropriate, the host species Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. and Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. under constant or alternating temperatures. 3 The development rate was linearly related to temperature, with developmental thresholds for eggs, larvae and pupae of 8, 4.5 and 7.3 °C, respectively. Day-degrees were estimated for each life stage. Larval development was affected by tree species, being slower on Sitka spruce than on Scots pine, and was faster under alternating than constant temperatures. 4 The development time for prepupae was highly variable, with an apparent facultative prepupal diapause initiated by temperature. The temperature range 20-17.5 °C marked the transition between median prepupal development times of approximately 25 and 90 days. The prepupal stage may serve to minimize the risk of overwintering mortality in the pupal stage and help to synchronize the life cycle. 5 Larval and adult mass was positively related to developmental temperature, demonstrating an inverse temperature size rule, and weevils were heavier when developing on Scots pine than Sitka spruce. Development in alternating temperatures reduced weevil mass on Scots pine. The influence of temperature on weevil mass is likely to have a positive effect on fecundity and overwintering survival. The effects of climate change on development, voltinism and weevil mass are discussed. © 2012 Crown copyright.

TI  - Probabilistic RNA partitioning generates transient increases in the normalized variance of RNA numbers in synchronized populations of Escherichia coli
VL  - 8
IS  - 2
SP  - 565-571
AB  - We explore the effects of probabilistic RNA partitioning during cell division on the normalized variance of RNA numbers across generations of bacterial populations. We first characterize these effects in model cell populations, where gene expression is modeled as a delayed stochastic process, as a function of the synchrony in cell division, the rate of division, and the RNA degradation rate. We further explore the additional variance that arises if the partitioning is biased. Next, in Escherichia coli cells expressing RNA tagged with MS2d-GFP, we measured the normalized variance of RNA numbers across several generations, with cell divisions synchronized by heat shock. We show that synchronized cell populations exhibit transient increases in normalized variance following cell divisions, as predicted by the model, which are not observed in unsynchronized populations. We conclude that errors in partitioning of RNA molecules generate diversity between the offspring of individual bacteria and thus constitute a form of reproductive bet-hedging. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

TI  - Tracking collector consideration of tilted collector solar updraft tower power plant under Malaysia climate conditions
VL  - 93
SP  - 1467-1477
AB  - SUPP (Solar Updraft Tower power plant) is a technology in the power generation sector. The power productivity and efficiency represent important performance characteristics of SUPP. In the present work a mathematical model was developed to estimate the performance of SUPP based on tracking solar collector consideration in Malaysia. The objective is to verify the suggested model and to optimize the slope angle of tilted tracking solar collector. Basically, the hourly solar data were analysed considering solar azimuth angle for tracking case calculation to determine the solar energy incident on the collector. Then, the useful energy gain was calculated based on heat transfer relations. The model was validated with experimental work and well agreement was achieved. Results revealed that the SUPP of slope collector angle of 100 can produce higher power generation over the whole the year. Also, the tracking solar consideration enhanced the performance characteristics especially the power productivity by around 3.5 kW over that of fixed collector. The maximum collector and SUPP efficiencies of 51% and 0.165% respectively were obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bioaerosol generation by raindrops on soil
VL  - 8
AB  - Aerosolized microorganisms may play an important role in climate change, disease transmission, water and soil contaminants, and geographic migration of microbes. While it is known that bioaerosols are generated when bubbles break on the surface of water containing microbes, it is largely unclear how viable soil-based microbes are transferred to the atmosphere. Here we report a previously unknown mechanism by which rain disperses soil bacteria into the air. Bubbles, tens of micrometres in size, formed inside the raindrops disperse micro-droplets containing soil bacteria during raindrop impingement. A single raindrop can transfer 0.01% of bacteria on the soil surface and the bacteria can survive more than one hour after the aerosol generation process. This work further reveals that bacteria transfer by rain is highly dependent on the regional soil profile and climate conditions. © 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Impact of Spodoptera frugiperda neonate pretreatment conditions on Vip3Aa19 insecticidal protein activity and laboratory bioassay variation
VL  - 72
IS  - 4
SP  - 837-844
AB  - BACKGROUND: Variation in response to insecticidal proteins is common upon repetition of insect bioassays. Understanding this variation is a prerequisite to detecting biologically important differences. We tracked neonate Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) susceptibility to Vip3Aa19 over 17 generations using standardized bioassay methods. Five larval pretreatment conditions and one bioassay condition were tested to determine whether susceptibility was affected. These included: storage time; prefeeding; storage at reduced temperature; storage at reduced humidity; colony introgression of field-collected individuals. Extremes of photoperiod during the bioassay itself were also examined. RESULTS: LC50 values for two strains of S. frugiperda varied 6.6-fold or 8.8-fold over 17 generations. Storage time and humidity had no impact on Vip3Aa19 susceptibility, whereas prefeeding significantly reduced subsequent mortality (by 27%). Storage at reduced temperature increased mortality for one colony (from 45.6 to 73.0%) but not for the other. Introgression of field-collected individuals affected susceptibility at the first generation but not for subsequent generations. A 24 h bioassay photophase significantly reduced susceptibility (by 26%) for both colonies. CONCLUSION: Certain pretreatment and bioassay conditions were identified that can affect S. frugiperda Vip3Aa19 susceptibility, but innate larval heterogeneity was also present. Our observations should help to increase the consistency of insecticidal protein bioassay results. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry.

VL  - 49

SP  - 1001-1007
AB  - Global climate fluctuations have profoundly affected the current distribution patterns and created opportunities and challenges for the survival and development of species. Studies on geographical distribution and eco-adaptability are necessary for both biodiversity conservation and sustainable biological resource utilization. In this study, we focus on five species of Calligonum in Tarim Basin, i.e. Calligonum roborovskii, C. kurlaense, C. yengisaricum, C. juochiangense and C. taklimakanense to confirm the distribution range by carrying out field population survey, along with the studies of herbarium specimen and relevant literature and also to find out the associations between the five species, distribution correlated with climate and soil characteristics through the mean variance analysis and principal component analysis. The results of the study were as follows: (1) C. roborovskii was widely distributed in Tarim Basin, but C. kurlaense, C. yengisaricum, C. juochiangense and C. taklimakanense have narrow distribution. The distribution areas of four latter species were overlapping with that of C. roborovskii showing sympatric distribution. (2) All the five species belonged to the warm and arid zone. The adaptability of C. roborovskii to moisture was higher, that of C. juochiangense and C. taklimakanense which grew in more arid areas than that of C. kurlaense and C. yengisaricum, had stronger drought tolerance. The soil type of the five species main was brown desert soil with high salinity, alkaline, and low content of organic matter in the top soil. (3) Low temperature, moisture factor, salinity and alkalinity were the main reasons leading to the different distribution of the four narrow distributed species. (4) The main factors limiting the distribution range of the five species were high temperature and moisture factor, followed by soil properties. For C. juochiangense and C. taklimakanense, moisture factor was much stronger than temperature. The results of the research will provide basis for the protection, revegetation and reasonable utilization of Calligonum © 2017, Pakistan Botanical Society. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessment of vascular perfusion and cholesterol and estrogen levels in preovulatory follicles of mares in conditions of thermal discomfort
VL  - 38
SP  - 67-74
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of blood perfusion of dominant follicles after ovulation induction with hCG by ultrasound Color Doppler, and cholesterol and estrogen levels in preovulatory follicles of mares submitted or not to thermal discomfort. Therefore, estrous cycles of 15 mares were randomly distributed between comfort (Group I) and thermal discomfort (Group II) groups and monitored by transrectal ultrasonography periodically until the largest follicle reached at least 32mm of diameter. At this time, the mares received 1000IU of Chorulon® (hCG), and had the preovulatory follicle accompanied by Doppler ultrasound every 6 hours up to 24 hours, at which time the aspirations were taken from the follicular?uid of cholesterol and estrogen dosing. The follicular vascular perfusion was estimated subjective basis, taking into account the percentage of the circumference of the follicular wall with Color Doppler signals. Aspirated follicular fluid was recovered and centrifuged at 1000G for 15 minutes, and the supernatant recovered and stored in cryovials at-20°C until the estrogen dosage and cholesterol were performed. To characterize the thermal environment, the temperature and humidity index test (THI), described by Hansen (2005), was used. In order to characterize the adaptation of animals to the thermal environment, the heat tolerance coeffcient (HTC) and the adaptability coeffcient (AC) were used. The average THI found for the analyzed period (March and April/2014) was 58.33, which does not characterize stressful environment for the animals. After bioclimatic analysis found HTC average values of Group I and Group II 95.47, 87.14, these averages were statistically different (p<0.05), indicating a greater tolerance of Group I when compared to Group II. The AC average found for the group I was 3.84 and the Group II 4.29, values that differed statistically (p<0.05), showing greater adaptability in Group I compared to Group II. The average values of vascular perfusion of preovulatory follicles were: Group I: H0=32.5%; H6=43.75%; H12=41.85%; H18=33.75%; H24=42.5%; Group II: H0=24.85%; H6=41.42%; H12=48.57%; H18=38.57%; H24=47.14%. There were no statistically signifcant differences (p>0.05) between the percentages of follicular vascular perfusion between the groups in the analyzed moments. The mean values of cholesterol and estrogen for Groups I and II were respectively 51.62mg/ml and 46.14mg/ml and 325739.64pg/dL and 316381.05pg/dL. There were no statistically signifcant differences (p>0.05) between groups. These results demonstrate that environments that deprive the shadow animals are likely to generate thermal discomfort, even if the indices do not point stressful environment for the animal. However, this discomfort is not enough to harm steroidogenesis or percentage follicular vascularization in 24 hours.

VL  - 39
IS  - 2
SP  - 155-161
AB  - Aim: HSP90, one of the most important and multifunctional stress proteins in cells, plays important role in cell self-protection and environmental adaptability in crustacean. Our previous study showed that application of imidazole derivative KK-42 can increase survival rate of Penaeus vannumei. In an attempt to research the possible molecular mechanism of KK-42 increasing survival rate in P. vannumei, one HSP90 cDNA sequence from the hepatopancreas was first isolated and then its spatiotemporal expressions were analyzed. Material and Methods: The HSP90 was cloned from the hepatopancreas of P. vannumei using the rapid amplification of cDNAends methods and its sequence was analyzed with biological software. Expression level was determined by real-time PCR. Results: The full-length cDNA contains a 2163 bp open reading frame encoding a predicted protein of 721 amino acids. The P. vannumei HSP90 protein sequence is most closely related to other HSP90 enzymes, the higher mRNA level is detected in hepatopancreas. The hepatopancreas HSP90 expression is significantly induced by KK-42 and increases more than 69.1 %, even up to 505.5 % and 481.7 % on day 2 and day 3, respectively. Conclusion: The up-regulation of HSP90 expression induced by KK-42 is beneficial to improve adaptability that is likely one of the molecular mechanisms of KK-42 increasing survival rate in P. vannumei. © TurkJBiochem.com.

AB  - The goals of sustainability are to meet people’s basic needs and improve their quality of life while simultaneously ensuring that the natural systems, resources, and diversity upon which they depend are maintained and enhanced, both today and for future generations. Construction activities over a facility’s life cycle are also connected with the broader problems and issues affecting the environment, including global warming, climate change, pollution and the depletion of valuable resources. Built facilities significantly impact human health, comfort, and productivity. Modular building is becoming increasingly popular in many countries due to its many benefits, including greater construction efficiency and productivity. This study investigated how modular building can support sustainability goals in the built environment via a deep case study of ‘The Stack’, a recently completed modular rental housing block in New York City. The building’s architect and manufacturer were interviewed for the case study and the design, manufacturing and construction process analysed to examine how modular processes can contribute to achieving the goals of sustainability. The ultimate goal of this study is to improve the processes involved in modular construction to help all stakeholders to achieve the goals of sustainability. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

TI  - Adaptations of an RNA virus to increasing thermal stress
VL  - 12
IS  - 12
AB  - Environments can change in incremental fashions, where a shift from one state to another occurs over multiple organismal generations. The rate of the environmental change is expected to influence how and how well populations adapt to the final environmental state. We used a model system, the lytic RNA bacteriophage Φ6, to investigate this question empirically. We evolved viruses for thermostability by exposing them to heat shocks that increased to a maximum temperature at different rates. We observed increases in the ability of many heat-shocked populations to survive high temperature heat shocks. On their first exposure to the highest temperature, populations that experienced a gradual increase in temperature had higher average survival than populations that experienced a rapid temperature increase. However, at the end of the experiment, neither the survival of populations at the highest temperature nor the number of mutations per population varied significantly according to the rate of thermal change. We also evaluated mutations from the endpoint populations for their effects on viral thermostability and growth. As expected, some mutations did increase viral thermostability. However, other mutations decreased thermostability but increased growth rate, suggesting that benefits of an increased replication rate may have sometimes outweighed the benefits of enhanced thermostability. Our study highlights the importance of considering the effects of multiple selective pressures, even in environments where a single factor changes. © 2017 Singhal et al.

TI  - Grandparental immune priming in the pipefish Syngnathus typhle
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-15
AB  - Background: Phenotypic changes in response to environmental influences can persist from one generation into the next. In many systems parental parasite experience influences offspring immune responses, known as transgenerational immune priming (TGIP). TGIP in vertebrates is mainly maternal and short-term, supporting the adaptive immune system of the offspring during its maturation. However, if fathers and offspring have a close physical connection, evolution of additional paternal immune priming can be adaptive. Biparental TGIP may result in maximized immunological protection. Here, we investigate multigenerational biparental TGIP in the sex-role reversed pipefish Syngnathus typhle by exposing grandparents to an immune challenge with heat-killed bacteria and assessing gene expression (44 target genes) of the F2-generation. Results: Grandparental immune challenge induced gene expression of immune genes in one-week-old grandoffspring. Similarly, genes mediating epigenetic regulation including DNA-methylation and histone modifications were involved in grandparental immune priming. While grand-maternal impact was strong on genes of the complement component system, grand-paternal exposure changed expression patterns of genes mediating innate immune defense. Conclusion: In a system with male pregnancy, grandparents influenced the immune system of their grandoffspring in a sex-specific manner, demonstrating multigenerational biparental TGIP. The involvement of epigenetic effects suggests that TGIP via the paternal line may not be limited to the pipefish system that displays male pregnancy. While the benefits and costs of grandparental TGIP depend on the temporal heterogeneity of environmental conditions, multigenerational TGIP may affect host-parasite coevolution by dampening the amplitude of Red Queen Dynamics. © 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Cold-hardiness mechanisms in third instar larvae of Spodoptera exigua hübner (lepidoptera: Noctuidae)
VL  - 22
IS  - 4
SP  - 863-871
AB  - The mechanisms of cold tolerance in insects which are exposed to suboptimal temperatures for survival include accumulation of cryoprotectants and expression of heat shock protein genes (hsps). Spodoptera exigua is a freeze avoidance insect, which can overwinter as third instar larvae in China. Our previous study illustrated that seasonal and diel fluctuating temperatures enhanced its cold hardening. The survival mechanism for this stage, however, is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the survival mechanisms in third instar larvae of S. exigua were correlated with the induction of cryoprotectants and/or expression of hsps. Results showed that trehalose as the main cryoprotectant was accumulated during the cold acclimation (CA), and the level of accumulation fell off sharply when the CA treatment was discontinued (discontinued cold acclimation, DCA). Furthermore, inducible hsp90 was down-regulated in all treatments compared with the control, and hsp70 was up-regulated under conditions of CA and RCH (rapid cold hardening), which induced 1.23- and 44.00-fold increases compared with the control. Therefore, we considered that both trehalose (as the main cryoprotectant) and hsps (i.e. hsp90 and hsp70) were involved in the regulation of physiological activity of third instar larvae of S. exigua to resist low temperatures during winter. These results are helpful for us to understand the mechanisms underlying this species' ecological adaptability and stress tolerance.

TI  - Demographic parameters of adults of Pseudodiaptomus annandalei (Copepoda: Calanoida): Temperature-salinity and generation effects
VL  - 404
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-14
AB  - The calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomus annandalei is distributed exclusively in the Indo-Pacific regions from subtropical to tropical estuaries and shallow coastal waters. Its population dynamics is not well understood despite its ecological importance to natural ecosystems and potential applications to aquaculture. We studied the combined effects of temperature and salinity on survivorship and reproduction of P. annandalei. The experimental protocol included adult cohort life table analysis and observations on reproductive parameters of individual females (paired with males) in relation to 9 different temperature-salinity combinations. At salinity level 10-20, the average survival (l(x)= 0.5) and life expectancy at moulting was significantly higher at 18 degrees C (38 days); however, at salinity 30, the survival was significantly higher at 25 degrees C (22.17 days) than either of those at 18 or 32 degrees C. The gross and net reproductive rates were higher (267 and 176 nauplii female(-1) respectively) at salinity 10 and temperature 25 degrees C. Neither interclutch duration nor embryonic development time was affected by salinity; whereas, temperature had a significant effect on both parameters. The clutch size was significantly affected by salinity, but not by temperature. Across temperature-salinity combinations tested in the present study, the total lifetime fecundity was significantly correlated with adult generation time, but not with longevity. The population growth rate (Euler's Gamma) was negatively related to the adult generation time across temperature-salinity levels tested. Continued production of viable fertile clutches by the female required remating with the male at frequent intervals. Our results suggest that the most appropriate temperature-salinity combination for this species is 25 degrees C at salinities 10-15 for reproduction, and 20 degrees C at salinity 10 for survival.

VL  - 2

SP  - 858-861
AB  - Carbon dioxide concentrations in the surface ocean are increasing owing to rising CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere(1). Higher CO2 levels are predicted to affect essential physiological processes of many aquatic organisms(2,3), leading to widespread impacts on marine diversity and ecosystem function, especially when combined with the effects of global warming(4-6). Yet the ability for marine species to adjust to increasing CO2 levels over many generations is an unresolved issue. Here we show that ocean conditions projected for the end of the century (approximately 1,000 mu atm CO2 and a temperature rise of 1.5-3.0 degrees C) cause an increase in metabolic rate and decreases in length, weight, condition and Survival of juvenile fish. However, these effects are absent or reversed when parents also experience high CO2 concentrations. Our results show that non-genetic parental effects can dramatically alter the response of marine organisms to increasing CO2 and demonstrate that some species have more capacity to - acclimate to ocean acidification than previously thought.

VL  - 43
IS  - 2
SP  - 197-203
AB  - The objective of this work was to establish, under experimental laboratory conditions, a colony of Lucilia sericata, Bogota-Colombia strain, to build life tables and evaluate two artificial diets. This blowfly is frequently used in postmortem interval studies and in injury treatment. The parental adult insects collected in Bogota were maintained in cages at 22 degrees C +/- 1 average temperature, 60%+/- 5 relative humidity and 12 h photoperiodicity. The blowflies were fed on two artificial diets that were evaluated over seven continuous generations. Reproductive and population parameters were assessed. The life cycle of the species was expressed in the number of days of the different stages: egg = 0.8 +/- 0.1, larvae I = 1.1 +/- 0.02, larvae II = 1.94 +/- 0.16, larvae III = 3.5 +/- 1.54, pupae = 6.55 +/- 0.47, male adult = 28.7 +/- 0.83 and female adult = 33.5 +/- 1.0. Total survival from egg stage to adult stage was 91.2% for diet 1, while for diet 2 this parameter was 40.5%. The lifetime reproductive output was 184.51 +/- 11.2 eggs per female. The population parameters, as well as the reproductive output of the blowflies that were assessed, showed relatively high values, giving evidence of the continuous increase of the strain over the different generations and making possible its maintenance as a stable colony that has lasted for more than two years.

VL  - 60
IS  - 12
SP  - 1897-1906
AB  - The natural occurrence of Salvadora persica L., stretching from the coastal area of the Arabian sea to northward along the Indus floodplains, was surveyed to document the pattern of its occurrence with the available meteorological record showing increasing trends of frost northwards. Information was compiled from various sources to generate the past and present temperature data in order to establish relationship between the changing temperature factors and the extent of the area available due to climate change over the years for introducing species beyond its range of natural distribution. In addition, the species was experimentally introduced in the warmed-up zones to monitor its performance and to evaluate its adaptability. The reconnaissance survey showed that the natural populations of thorn forest communities with S. persica, as associate, are now surviving only as degraded remnants. Its common occurrence is documented in zones where the mean winter temperatures are above the threshold level of frost, whereas it is rarely found in zones where it drops below this level for a single month, which seems to be its range edge. S. persica does not occur in zones where low temperature could persist for 2 months. Recent temperature data suggests that the month of December has warmed up above the threshold level; therefore, it was expected that correspondingly the range edge of the frost-sensitive species has potentially shifted further northwards. The response of the species introduced at the experimental sites beyond its natural occurrence suggests high survival and growth, demonstrating its adaptability to the new sites beyond its limit of distribution. © 2016, ISB.

TI  - Mountain pine beetle seasonal timing and constraints to bivoltinism: A comment on Mitton and Ferrenberg, “Mountain pine beetle develops an unprecedented summer generation in response to climate warming”
VL  - 184
IS  - 6
SP  - 787-796
AB  - Mountain pine beetle tree colonization typically occurs in July and August, with completion of a generation one (univoltinism) or two (semivoltinism) years later. In a 2012 publication, Mitton and Ferrenberg suggested that climate change resulted in an unprecedented generation between June and September (a summer generation), with a concomitant shift to two generations in one year (bivoltinism). Although summer generations are not uncommon in this species, completion of a second generation across winter, between September and June, would be required for bivoltinism, a phenomenon not previously observed. Mitton and Ferrenberg showed that a summer generation can occur, but they failed to adequately track cohorts and provided no compelling evidence for bivoltinism. We demonstrate that a winter generation—and hence bivoltinism— would have been physiologically impossible at the high-elevation site used in Mitton and Ferrenberg due to lower thermal developmental thresholds. The mountain pine beetle is indeed being influenced by climate change. To address the challenges of future population outbreaks of this significant tree mortality agent, however, it is imperative to consider evolved, thermally dependent traits that serve to maintain seasonality. © 2014 by The University of Chicago.

TI  - RelE-mediated dormancy is enhanced at high cell density in escherichia coli
VL  - 194
IS  - 5
SP  - 1169-1176
AB  - Bacteria show remarkable adaptability under several stressful conditions by shifting themselves into a dormant state. Less is known, however, about the mechanism underlying the cell transition to dormancy. Here, we report that the transition to dormant states is mediated by one of the major toxin-antitoxin systems, RelEB, in a cell density-dependent manner in Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. We constructed a strain, IKA121, which expresses the toxin RelE in the presence of rhamnose and lacks chromosomal relBE and rhaBAD. With this strain, we demonstrated that RelE-mediated dormancy is enhanced at high cell densities compared to that at low cell densities. The initiation of expression of the antitoxin RelB from a plasmid, pCA24N, reversed RelEmediated dormancy in bacterial cultures. The activation of RelE increased the appearance of persister cells against β-lactams, quinolones, and aminoglycosides, and more persister cells appeared at high cell densities than at low cell densities. Further analysis indicated that amino acid starvation and an uncharacterized extracellular heat-labile substance promote RelE-mediated dormancy. This is a first report on the induction of RelE-mediated dormancy by high cell density. This work establishes a population-based dormancy mechanism to help explain E. coli survival in stressful environments. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this paper is to point out the kinds of measures that should be implemented to protect the population from the health effects of cold and when to put them into action, thanks to meteorological thresholds. Study design: The authors used pertinence criteria to determine if an alert system would be relevant to trigger preventive measures. Methods: The pertinence criteria included ability to prevent health impact through specific measures, simplicity, reactivity, adaptability, and the possibility to find indicators able to predict a health impact of cold. This was investigated in two pilot cities, using time-series models to identify mortality-relevant thresholds, if any. Results: Short-term measures are mainly directed at homeless people while actions focussing on the general population are mostly limited to providing advice on how to protect oneself from exposure to cold. The main long-term measures are housing insulation and heating. Combined minimum and maximum temperatures are the best indicators to predict the health impact of cold temperatures on mortality. Associated optimal thresholds for action in Paris were -9 degrees C and -2 degrees C for minimum and maximum temperatures respectively while thresholds in Marseille were -3 degrees C and -4 degrees C. When both thresholds are reached in a given city, the risk of excess mortality is greater than 15%. Conclusion: Simple meteorological indicators could be used to improve the detection of dangerous cold episodes and promote communication. Nevertheless, long-term housing improvement and financial aids for home heating remain the best means to prevent the adverse effects of cold weather on community health.

TI  - On how we can non-canonically increase hereditary drought resistance in plants (by an example of cereals)
VL  - 52
IS  - 3
SP  - 487-500
AB  - Improvement of hereditary drought resistance in crops is recently being among the main objectives for food security of humanity because of global warming and the growing costs for bakery and forage grain. Analysis of complex properties of drought resistance in cereals (phenotyping) shows the limitations of a canonical genocentric approach and the approaches based on molecular genetics to solve the problem of significant hereditary improvement of drought resistance. The priority epigenetic approach that we propose is based on the theory of eco-genetic organization of quantitative traits (TEGOQT). In TEGOQT seven genetic-physiological systems (GPS) involved in harvest increasing, but not particular traits of productivity, are to be operated with. These GPS are attractions; micro-distribution of attractive plastic substances between grains and chaff in ear; adaptability to drought, cold, frost, heat, salt, etc; horizontal immunity; «payment» by dry biomass for a limitative factor of soil nutrition - N, P, K, etc; tolerance to plant density in phytocenosis; hereditary variability in duration of the phases of ontogenesis). In this paper we discuss drought adaptability as a part of GPS complex. It is shown that phenotyping evaluation is necessary to analyze drought tolerance, the complex property to which no less than 22 component characters contribute. This allows to construct a set of eco-genetic portraits (EGP) of parent plants at different types of drought simulated in an artificial climate control chamber. The EGP are histograms which reflect the values of all components of drought resistance for each parent thus allowing to select pairs complementary in the elements of the EGP. Based on a predictive EGP, it is possible to define, through mathematical models that reflect the contribution of each component to the resulting drought tolerance, the optimum combination of components for ensuring maximum positive additive effect, and thus to manage selection of the parents for hybridization in view to create new drought resistant varieties.

TI  - Protecting our water compacts: The looming threat of unilateral congressional interaction
VL  - 2010
IS  - 3
SP  - 875-905
AB  - The United States is entering a period in which the combination of increasing population, rising temperatures, and growing resource scarcity will seriously threaten human survival. In a warmer world, water basins will be highly coveted. This demand will require steadfast attention to water-resource management. Currently, interstate compacts are the primary mechanism for multistate basin management. Increasing scarcity places pressure on Congress to reevaluate and potentially revoke consent from these compacts. The alternative methods for allocating water are unstable at best. This Comment argues that Congress does not have the power unilaterally to revoke consent from an interstate compact. The interstate compact is one of the Founding Fathers' lasting mechanisms designed to protect the people from federal overreaching. Three of the nation's largest freshwater basins and their compacts provide illustrations of the interstate compact's resilience, adaptability, and importance in a changing world. Further, an examination of how the nation chooses to manage its most important resource provides valuable insight in to our future-when it is a question of survival, is it "We the People" or "We the Nation"?

VL  - 3
SP  - 1157-1175
AB  - This paper attempts to understand the climatic and socio-economic factors influencing the efficiency and thereby the livelihood of fishing community in Mumbai. Efficiency in fishing is influenced by the scale of production, technology and inputs used, socio-economic and climate sensitive factors such as temperature, current, wind, rainfall etc. A primary survey of 164 fishing households is conducted in five fishing villages of Mumbai to collect input-output and other relevant data related to socioeconomic and climatic factors. Using stochastic frontier function, it is found that the number of working days, fuel costs, number of workers along with type of family, education, electronic gadgets used in fishing and observation on temperature change significantly affects the productivity and thereby their preparedness. The fishermen belonging to nuclear family and using advanced fishing equipments along with those are observing a rise in temperature successfully adapted and their efficiency level is increased. Mostly rich and affluent fishermen are more efficient than others. The estimated technical efficiencies for the fishing households range from 0.12 to 0.87, with a mean efficiency level of 0.39. Technological advancement in the production process with large scale of operation significantly influences fishermen's awareness, adaptability to climate change and also the efficiency. © 2017 by IGI Global.

TI  - Metallothionein and Hsp70 trade-off against one another in Daphnia magna cross-tolerance to cadmium and heat stress
VL  - 170
SP  - 112-119
AB  - The association between the insensitivity of adapted ecotypes of invertebrates to environmental stress, such as heavy metal pollution, and overall low Hsp levels characterizing these organisms has been attracting attention in various studies. The present study seeks to induce and examine this phenomenon in Daphnia magna by multigenerational acclimation to cadmium in a controlled laboratory setting. In this experiment, interclonal variation was examined: two clones of D. magna that have previously been characterized to diverge regarding their cadmium resistance and levels of the stress protein Hsp70, were continuously exposed to a sublethal concentration of Cd over four generations to study the effects of acclimation on Hsp70, metallothionein (MT), reproduction and cross-tolerance to heat stress. The two clones differed in all the measured parameters in a characteristic way, clone T displaying Cd and heat resistance, lower Hsp70 levels and offspring numbers on the one hand and higher MT expression on the other hand, clone S the opposite for all these parameters. We observed only slight acclimation-induced changes in constitutive Hsp70 levels and reproductive output. The differences in MT expression between clones as well as between acclimated organisms and controls give evidence for MT accounting for the higher Cd tolerance of clone T. Overall high Hsp70 levels of clone S did not confer cross tolerance to heat stress, contrary to common expectations. Our results suggest a trade-off between the efforts to limit the proteotoxic symptoms of Cd toxicity by Hsp70 induction and those to sequester and detoxify Cd by means of MT.

VL  - 1901
AB  - WC-Co, which is also known as cemented carbide, is widely used in metal cutting industry and wear related application due to their excellent mechanical properties. Manufacturing industries are focusing on improving productivity and reducing operational cost with machining operation is considered as one of the factors. Thus, machining conditions are becoming more severe and required better cutting tool bit with improved mechanical properties to withstand high temperature operation. Numerous studies have been made over the generation for further improvement of cemented carbide properties to meet the constant increase in demand. However, the results of these studies vary due to different process parameters and manufacturing technology. This paper summarizes the studies to improve the properties of WC-Co composite using different consolidation (powder size, mixing method, formulation, etc) and sintering parameters (temperature, time, atmosphere, etc). © 2017 Author(s).

VL  - 106
IS  - 2
SP  - 193-198
AB  - Loligo vulgaris is the most abundant and commercially important species of squid in Portuguese waters. The species presents a complex population structure clue to a short life-cycle, highly variable growth rates and a long spawning period. The latter characteristics combined with the marked seasonality of the Portuguese coast results in individuals that are born in different seasons being influenced by different environmental conditions, notably water temperature, as has previously been shown. In the present study, we have taken animals belonging to each of two temperature-based hatching cohorts (cold and warm cohorts - CC and WC) and determined the fecundity and egg size of individuals on either one, in order to determine whether animals in different cohorts followed different reproductive strategies. Significant differences were found between the cohorts regarding reproductive investment, fecundity and size of oocytes. Individuals of the CC (larger and older when reaching maturity) had lower fecundity than individuals of the WC, but presented larger oocytes. WC females (smaller and younger at maturity) present higher fecundities and higher GSIs. Such differences further demonstrate the high plasticity and adaptability of these organisms to environmental conditions and highlight the advantage of integrating environmental variables in fisheries assessment.

VL  - 54

AB  - Rising temperatures associated with global climatic change threaten the persistence of species. Determining how species adapt to environmental change is paramount. Much work has shown that environmental stressors have the potential to induce phenotypic changes that span multiple generations. Such transgenerational plasticity (TGP) represents a mechanism that may allow for rapid responses to global climatic change. Yet, our understanding of thermal TGP beyond the relationship between parent and offspring is limited. We evaluated thermal TGP in development across three generations (i.e., F0, F1, and F2) in zooplankton (Daphnia ambigua) from lakes in Connecticut. We found that the temperatures at which parents and grandparents were reared significantly influenced age at maturation in the grand-offspring. Comparisons between the F0 and F1 generation show that the offspring of parents reared at low temperatures matured significantly faster than the offspring of parents reared at a higher temperature. However, age at maturation in the grand-offspring was influenced by the interactive effects of parents and grandparents. Such an effect yielded trends that were not readily predicted from the previous generations and whose adaptive significance is unclear. Our results thus call for additional theoretical and empirical work to better understand the transgenerational effects of temperature. © The Author 2014.

TI  - Crambe abyssinica a non-food crop with potential for the Mediterranean climate: Insights on productive performances and root growth
VL  - 90
SP  - 152-160
AB  - Within a framework of renewed interest in crambe (Crambe abyssinica Hochst ex R.E. Fries) sourcing raw materials for the bio-based industry, the adaptability and productive performances of this oil crop have been evaluated under contrasting Mediterranean environments (i.e., a fertile site in the northern part of Po valley vs. a semi-arid site of southern Sicily) during two consecutive growing seasons, aiming at its possible stable introduction in this area. The trial set in northern Italy compared three commercial varieties of crambe (Galactica, Nebula and Mario) in spring sowing, while in southern Italy only the var. Mario was tested with autumn sowing. Regardless of location and variety, thermal time for maturity was quite stable (1200-1400 degrees C), and the crop provided satisfactory seed yields (grand mean 2.29 Mg hulled seeds ha(-1)), with average oil content of 400 g kg(-1) (on dehulled seeds) and 52% of erucic acid. Significantly higher seed and oil yields were reached in northern than in southern Italy. Furthermore, crambe thermal use efficiency (THUE) was also higher in the north than in the south, possibly due to better environmental adaptability of the crop. The limited intraspecific variability within crambe was confirmed, with better productive performances showed by the domestic selection Mario. Promising traits were revealed in Nebula, showing greater seed weight, root length density and area, and thinner roots, although the root growth of crambe was generally modeft compared with modern high erucic acid rapeseed hybrids. Available crambe varieties could be efficiently included in crop rotations across a wide range of environments within the Mediterranean basin. The short growth cycle represents an outstanding added value for this species, allowing the avoidance of prolonged drought and heat stress typical of late spring/early summer months under the Mediterranean climate. However, increased yields are needed to meet the market requests; nonetheless, the little genetic variability suggests that there is large scope for future breeding improvements, maybe exploiting advanced techniques to improve the existing genetic resources.

VL  - 107

AB  - The main use of leather is to protect the body against external environment and to provide comfort. However, leather may be used for additional functions specific to 1) an adverse or extreme climate and 2) job-ambience or profession so as to enhance adaptability and productivity of the user. When such an application arises, the leather is termed as "smart material". Making leather perform the functions it did as a skin on a live animal renders it as smart leather. Hence, the futuristic objective is to make the processed skin termed "leather" retain its memory so as to result in "smart or intelligent leather". In this paper, it has been attempted to incorporate thermo responsive function into leathers using smart materials such as phase changing materials (PCM). PCMs are capable of absorbing or releasing large amount of heat during phase transitions between two solid states and/or liquid and solid states. Manufacture of syntans using PCM based on two different prepolymers viz, melamine formaldehyde and naphthalene sulfonic acid has been attempted in this paper. The retanning agents synthesized have been characterized using various techniques like FT-IR, DSC, TGA and SEM analysis. Leathers made using PCM incorporated retanning agents have been tested for various properties viz. strength properties, thermal stability, organoleptic properties to study the influence of the PCM incorporated retanning agents.

VL  - 483
SP  - 31-48
AB  - Bay of Bengal is a shallow marine basin exposed to seasonal fluctuation in precipitation and run-off. Thus, salinity, temperature, nutrient and productivity vary along the latitudinal and onshore-offshore gradient in the Bay of Bengal. These parameters directly affect primary productivity, including that of dinoflagellate cysts. The spatial distribution of organic walled dinoflagellates cyst is studied in the 50 surface samples of eight transects from the western Bay of Bengal, to infer variation in the environmental conditions in the region. The cyst diversity consists of 40 taxa with an overall high dominance of protoperidinioid cysts over gonyalaucoides. Based on the study distinct onshore and offshore dinocyst assemblages are identified. The high productive coastal upwelling region is characterised by the dominance of gonyalaucoid dinocyst species Bitectatodinium spongium (Zonneveld 1997) Zonneveld and Jurkschat 1999 indicating its adaptability to the fluctuating salinity and high nutrient conditions. The outer shelf to middle slope regions of western Bay of Bengal is dominated by the protoperidinioid species. This is in contrast to the gonyalaucoid dinocyst assemblages of the outer shelf to middle slope regions in other oceans. Since protoperidinioids prefer high nutrient and reducing environmental conditions for growth and preservation, their presence suggest high nutrient availability due to the river discharge and low oxygen condition in the slope region in Bay of Bengal. Statistical analyses of the sea surface parameters and dinoflagellate cyst abundance data indicate that salinity and silicates as a major source of nutrient played a major role in the distribution of dinoflagellate cyst in the Bay of Bengal.

TI  - Review of climate change impacts on marine fisheries in the UK and Ireland
VL  - 22
IS  - 3
SP  - 368-388
AB  - Commercial fishing is an important socio-economic activity in coastal regions of the UK and Ireland. Oceanatmospheric changes caused by greenhouse gas emissions are likely to affect future fish and shellfish production, and lead to increasing challenges in ensuring long-term sustainable fisheries management. The paper reviews existing knowledge and understanding of the exposure of marine ecosystems to ocean-atmospheric changes, the consequences of these changes for marine fisheries in the UK and Ireland, and the adaptability of the UK and Irish fisheries sector. Ocean warming is resulting in shifts in the distribution of exploited species and is affecting the productivity of fish stocks and underlying marine ecosystems. In addition, some studies suggest that ocean acidification may have large potential impacts on fisheries resources, in particular shell-forming invertebrates. These changes may lead to loss of productivity, but also the opening of new fishing opportunities, depending on the interactions between climate impacts, fishing grounds and fleet types. They will also affect fishing regulations, the price of fish products and operating costs, which in turn will affect the economic performance of the UK and Irish fleets. Key knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of the implications of climate and ocean chemistry changes for marine fisheries in the UK and Ireland, particularly on the social and economic responses of the fishing sectors to climate change. However, these gaps should not delay climate change mitigation and adaptation policy actions, particularly those measures that clearly have other co-benefits.

VL  - 78

SP  - 1051-1057
AB  - Rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss is a cold-water aquaculture species, and a thermally selected strain has been developed by multigenerational high-temperature breeding in Japan. We examined the expression of heat-shock proteins as candidates responsible for thermotolerance in rainbow trout using F2 offspring from F1 hybrids produced between thermally selected and normal strains. From F2 offspring, two groups were selected for western blot analysis, namely, low- and high-thermotolerance groups (times to loss of equilibrium were <30 and ≥60 min, respectively). We demonstrated that the expression levels of Hsp70, Hsp60, and Hsp40 in tail fin tissues were significantly higher in the individuals with high thermotolerance than in those with low thermotolerance under non-heat-shock conditions. In particular, Hsp70 was expressed only in the individuals with high thermotolerance. These results suggest that Hsp70 is a major protein responsible for conferring thermotolerance in rainbow trout. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

VL  - 144

AB  - Anthropogenic changes to the environment have the opportunity to impact natural systems, particularly in organisms that exhibit phenotypic plasticity. Species with environmental sex determination (ESD) are uniquely susceptible to changes in the stimuli that affect sexual development, potentially leading to maladaptive sex ratios. We studied the factors affecting sex determination and sex ratios in the common snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina, in an area heavily impacted by agricultural practices. We investigated the effects of soybean, corn, and sunflower planting on incubation temperatures, sex ratios, and depredation in naturally laid nests. We also identified and analyzed a novel mitochondrial microsatellite in order to examine the presence of natal homing and determine the likelihood that nest sites impacted by agricultural practices could be transmitted across generations. Females frequently chose to nest in agricultural fields over sand prairie sites, and offspring sex ratios and depredation rates were significantly influenced by crop planting. Despite detecting considerable genetic variation in our population, we found no relationship between relatedness and nesting location, suggesting that females are not transmitting nesting sites across generations. Our results suggest that agricultural practices can directly impact populations of animals with ESD, and will need to be considered in management decisions. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Anesthesia in oysters of the genus crassostrea cultured in Brazil
VL  - 41
SP  - 785-793
AB  - This study evaluated: 1) the time required for anaesthesia induction and recovery of oysters Crassostrea rhizophorae, Crassostrea gasar and Crassostrea gigas using magnesium chloride (MgCl2); 2) the survival after anaesthesia and gonad sampling; and 3) the D-larvae generation after anaesthesia. For each species, three groups of 10 animals were kept in 50 g L-1 MgCl2, salinity of 36 and temperature of 22 ºC. One control group was kept in solution without MgCl2. Every 1 h anaesthetised oysters were recorded, sampled to determine sex and placed in clean seawater to assess recovering every 30 min. Gonad samplings were made beside the posterior adductor muscle, using 1 mL syringes and needles (0.60 x 25 mm). Factorial crosses were generated within and between anaesthetised and non-anaesthetised oyster groups to produce D-larvae in C. gigas. The survival after 10 days of anaesthesia was 100% for the three studied species. For C. rhizophorae and C. gigas, 100% of the animals were anaesthetised after 360 min and were recovered after 240 and 150 min, respectively. For C. gasar, 87% were anesthetised after 720 min and recovered after >240 min. There were no significant differences in D-larvae numbers between factorial crosses. The salt MgCl2 served as an efficient relaxant and caused no deleterious effect on the survival of the three studied species, or on the D-larvae generation in C. gigas. © 2015, Instytut Technologii Drewna.

TI  - Mortality on fruit in citrus orchards caused by naturally occurring enemies of red scale Aonidiella aurantii: relation to spatial distribution of patch density and season
VL  - 162
IS  - 2
SP  - 218-233
AB  - The efficacy of biological control agents depends on the amount of mortality they impose on pests in the field. Quantifying their impact on a pest is critical for guiding decision-making in its management. Here, we quantify the relation of population levels of natural unmanipulated populations of a pest to mortality rates imposed by naturally occurring enemies. Mortality beyond first instar caused by natural enemies of Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell) (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) on fruit was studied in four unsprayed citrus orchards in a warm temperate coastal environment in New South Wales, Australia, over approximately three pest generations in the course of a year. The percentage of hosts on fruit suffering parasitism and predation was usually independent of host density. There was no consistent evidence that one parasitoid influenced another, nor that parasitism and predation rates were related. At the orchard scale, it was apparent that parasitism and predation over a time series were related to current or previous host numbers and could become high enough in relation to fecundity rates to cause pest numbers to decline. Temporal feedback to density could be causing the pest populations to fluctuate between limits at economically sustainable levels given additional mortality of the first instars due to expected rates of dispersal and subsequent pre- and post-settlement failures. © 2017 The Netherlands Entomological Society

VL  - 7
IS  - 1
AB  - In this study, we investigated the effects of dietary restriction (DR) and variable diets on phenotypes and gene expression in oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), one of the most economically important pests in the family Tephritidae around the world. As expected, we found that DR altered the B. dorsalis phenotypes by significantly increasing stress resistance and lifespan, but reduced egg production when compared with the control diet. The results suggested a trade-off between reproduction versus somatic maintenance (stress resistance) and lifespan in B. dorsalis. Diet also had a significant effect on hatchability, and DR could increase the egg hatching success of B. dorsalis. Furthermore, DR up-regulated metabolic pathways involved in energy homeostasis and down-regulated pathways in egg production, which might mediate trade-offs between somatic maintenance and reproduction under DR regimes. The gene expression profiles in response to the acute dietary switches indicated that the digestive and metabolic pathways maybe involved in the adaptability of flies to variable dietary resources. In summary, the research facilitates a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the B. dorsalis' phenotypic adjustments to the different qualities of the available diets. © 2017 The Author(s).

VL  - 51

AB  - This study compares the performance of three different approaches to modeling namely the classical pore-blocking models, artificial neural networks (ANN) and the novel genetic programming (GP) approach. Among the available models proposed by Hermia, standard pore-blocking and cake filtration models were opted because of their better fitness with experimental measurements. A feedforward backpropagation network using Bayesian Regulation as well as Levenberg-Marquardt training methods was developed based on the experimental results. Network inputs include the controlling parameters of permeate flux namely: temperature, transmembrane pressure, crossflow velocity, pH, and filtration time. The architecture and internal parameters of the network have substantial effect on the prediction performance of the ANN. Hidden layers and neuron numbers were regulated using trial-and-error approach. The individual program proposed by GP, which has satisfied the required fitness value after 500 generations, had a depth of 10 among a population of 700 individuals. Relative error with respect to experimental results was used to compare the aforementioned models. It was found that ANN outperformed pore-blocking and GP models. The GP-based model had an acceptable coincidence with the experimental data and its ability to correlate the input and target variables by a mathematical relation showed the high potentiality of GP as a modeling tool. © 2013 © 2013 Balaban Desalination Publications.

AB  - Eucalyptus grandis × Eucalyptus nitens (G×N) hybrid clones are selected to combine complimentary characteristics of E. nitens and E. grandis. G×N hybrid clones also have the potential to increase growth rates and provide adaptability to a changing climate. A series of three trials planted across a range of high-productivity, mid-altitude sites in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands was established to test the suitability of a suite of G×N hybrid clones. Seven commercially available G×N clones together with two widely planted pure species controls, Eucalyptus dunnii and Eucalyptus smithii, were chosen for this study. The trials were set out in random complete block designs with nine treatments and four replications set out in square plots of 25 trees. The trials were measured for diameter at breast height at 23 months and monitored for snow damage over two winter seasons. Snow was noted at the Baynesfield site and subsequent snow damage assessments were performed. Basal area per hectare was calculated for each plot as a function of diameter at breast height and survival. Significant differences were observed between G×N hybrid clones in both growth and snow tolerance. The top-performing clones significantly outperformed both pure species controls in terms of growth and snow tolerance. Early results indicate that G×N hybrids may be better suited to high-potential, mid-altitude sites exposed to light snow risk than the currently recommended pure species. © 2013 Copyright © NISC (Pty) Ltd.

TI  - The clonal growth of Hippophae rhamniodes L. ssp. sinensis in response to irrigation intensity
VL  - 30
IS  - 24
SP  - 6952-6960
AB  - The survival, growth, breed and the population succession direction of Hippophae rhamniodes L. ssp. Sinensis is seriously effected by water for the average precipitation is lack. The annual average precipitation is 500 - 600mm at the suitable distribution area. Hovewer the annual average precipitation is only 200mm and the aridity is 2. 0 -4. 0 at the Loess Plateau, Mu Us Sandland and Feldspathic sandstone zone where are the distribution centers of Hippophae rhamniodes L. ssp. Sinensis. One of the solving ways are irrigation, so it has the important ecological meaning and guidance meaning of planting forest that research on the clonal growth of Hippophae rhamniodes L. ssp. sinensis in response to irrigation intensity. The experiments of different irrigation intensities were done in plantation which included four treats, three repetitions. The experiment adopted 2 × 2 regression design and took the advantage of Latin layout. It can get the mathematical statistics repetitions more than 6 times. The irrigation respectively is 0 times (it is controlled trial), 1. 0 times, 1. 5 times, 2. 5 times of annual average precipitation. The relationships between the growth, biomass, the number of daughter ramet, clonal indexes and different irrigations were researched. The results showed: (1) Relationship between the population parameters and irrigation intensity was accord with quadratic parabola. It meant each population parameter has an certain optimum irrigation intensity, the parameters increased below the optimum irrigation intensity and decreased above the optimum irrigation intensity with the increasing of irrigation intensity. (2) The optimum irrigation intensities were difference among different population parameters. The optimum irrigation intensities of height, ground diameter and crown width were 4.0 times per month, which was equivalent to 2.0 times than local annual average precipitation. The optimum irrigation intensities of population and its modular biomasses were 4. 0 times per month, which was equivalent to 2. 0 times than local annual average precipitation. And the optimum irrigation intensities of daughter ramet number and stretching as well as branching capacity of clonal organ were 3.0 times per month, which was equivalent to 1.5 times than local annual average precipitation. (3) The appropriate irrigation could not only increase the population growth but also improve the capacity of clonal propagation, but there was a trade-off relation between population growth and clonal propagation at the certain irrigation intensity. The increasing of underground biomass was beneficial to promote the clonal breed, stretching and branching of clonal organ while the increasing of aboveground biomass inhibited them. However, the relationship show cooperative effect between population growth and biomasses accumulation, between the number of daughter ramet and the stretching capacity as well as the branching intensity of clonal organ. They jointly accomplished the adaptability adjustment of clonal breed. (4) To the number of daughter ramet and the foraging growth pattern, it is a continuum of ecological strategy that the clonal growth in response to irrigation intensity. With the increasing of irrigation intensity, the numbers of daughter ramet from few to more then to few, the foraging growth pattern from guerrilla type to phalanx type and then to guerrilla type, population fitness from low to high then to low. This adjustment result of clonal growth has made the adaptability population characteristics and ecological adaptability strategy to irrigation intensity. Thus these conclusions were drawn: The less water must lead to drought stress, unfortunately the more water must lead to the temperature and the permeability decrease. They all inhibit the growth. But proper irrigation can promote the growth of Hippophae rhamniodes L. ssp. sinensis in Mu Us Sandland where is drought and strong sunlight illumination. In the production practice, the irrigation can be controlled in 1.5 -2. 0 times of local annual average precipitation. In same time, Hippophae rhamniodes L. ssp sinensis does response to different soil water resource supplying levels by adjustments of individual size, population biomass distribution, the number of daughter ramet, stretching capacity and branching intensity of clonal organ. These adjustments can improve the clonal breed of population and be beneficial to population stability maintenance and clonal growth persistence.

TI  - Adaptability to energy, production efficiency and the crude oil price: Evidence from a small open economy
VL  - 195
SP  - 173-184
AB  - Taiwan is an economy which is highly dependent on energy imports. A change in oil price not only affects the cost of production, but also the economic growth. Since the year 2000, the crude oil price has risen and become an unstable factor for economic development. In response to the rapid rising of emerging economies and the competitive international economic environment, Taiwan is facing a moment of industrial restructuring. Energy-saving technologies and improved efficiency might play important roles. It is necessary for Taiwan to improve its industrial productivity and production technology to contribute to the global warming problem. From crude oil intensity and change in spillover effects of crude oil price, we might detect whether industrial production efficiency and adaptability to energy and production technology improves or not. Based on the input-output table showing the monetary value of inputs to each sector and each row represents the value of each sector's outputs during the periods of 1981 to 2011, the present study employs the industry-related price model and factor decomposition model to investigate the change in Taiwan's reliance on crude oil through crude oil intensity. Although efforts have been made to advance technology and improve energy dependence, the results of this study indicate that imported crude oil intensity and price responsiveness have actually increased. Thus, the speed of improvement in energy technology is insufficient to keep up with the extent of economic growth. © 2015 WIT Press.

TI  - Present limits to heat-adaptability in corals and population-level responses to climate extremes
VL  - 6
IS  - 9
AB  - Climate change scenarios suggest an increase in tropical ocean temperature by 1-3 degrees C by 2099, potentially killing many coral reefs. But Arabian/Persian Gulf corals already exist in this future thermal environment predicted for most tropical reefs and survived severe bleaching in 2010, one of the hottest years on record. Exposure to 33-35 degrees C was on average twice as long as in non-bleaching years. Gulf corals bleached after exposure to temperatures above 34 degrees C for a total of 8 weeks of which 3 weeks were above 35 degrees C. This is more heat than any other corals can survive, providing an insight into the present limits of holobiont adaptation. We show that average temperatures as well as heat-waves in the Gulf have been increasing, that coral population levels will fluctuate strongly, and reef-building capability will be compromised. This, in combination with ocean acidification and significant local threats posed by rampant coastal development puts even these most heat-adapted corals at risk. WWF considers the Gulf ecoregion as "critically endangered". We argue here that Gulf corals should be considered for assisted migration to the tropical Indo-Pacific. This would have the double benefit of avoiding local extinction of the world's most heat-adapted holobionts while at the same time introducing their genetic information to populations naive to such extremes, potentially assisting their survival. Thus, the heat-adaptation acquired by Gulf corals over 6 k, could benefit tropical Indo-Pacific corals who have <100 y until they will experience a similarly harsh climate. Population models suggest that the heat-adapted corals could become dominant on tropical reefs within similar to 20 years.

TI  - Genetic algorithm optimization of an HPT vane pressure side film cooling array
VL  - 4
SP  - 1151-1161
AB  - The following work is an in-depth investigation of the heat transfer characteristics and cooling effectiveness of a full-scale fully-cooled modern high-pressure turbine (HPT) vane as a result of genetic algorithm (GA) optimization, relative to the baseline cooling configuration. Individual designs were evaluated using 3-D Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) that modeled film cooling injection using a transpiration boundary condition. 1,800 total different film cooling arrays were assessed for fitness within the optimization where film cooling parameters such as axial and radial hole location, hole size, injection angle, compound angle, and custom-designed row patterns were varied in the design space. The GA was able to find a unique pressure side (PS) cooling array after only 13 generations. The fitness functions prescribed for the problem successfully lowered the PS average surface temperature, lowered the maximum temperature, and increased the average overall effectiveness. Results clearly show how the optimized design redistributed flow from over-cooled areas on the vane PS to under-cooled areas near the shroud. Methods used in substantially improving pressure side film cooling performance here are promising in terms of eliminating durability problem areas for individual HPT components in their proper operating environments as well as increasing the potential to use less air from the compressor for cooling purposes in a gas turbine engine.

VL  - 53
SP  - 31-52
AB  - We present here a mechanistic view of adsorption processes for separation of gas mixtures. The moving-bed adsorber (abandoned due to practical difficulties) is shown to offer orders of magnitude higher productivity than the conventional pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and yields 'perfect separation'. To realize its potential in fixed beds, simulated moving bed (SMB) with pressure or thermal swing and 3-bed and 4-bed PSAs that emulate moving-bed adsorbers have been proposed. Based on their characteristics of phase equilibria and separating agents employed, a classification of adsorption processes has been proposed as 'absorption like', 'distillation like' and 'chromatographic' processes, which provides insight into these processes and a rational basis for their design. The mechanism of separation in moving bed, SMB and the conventional PSA are shown to be similar to that of either absorption or distillation. On the other hand, the duplex, molecular-gate and rapid PSAs are shown to share the same separation mechanism that is akin to heat-transfer mechanism in heat regenerators. Subtle but significant differences in the role of 'reflux' in absorption-like and distillation-like processes and their implications in process design have been highlighted. Though process intensification in molecular-gate PSA and duplex PSA is modest compared to the SMB, they appear to hold promise since they are based on a proven technology. Their adaptability for absorption and extraction using immobilized solvent has been presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A temperature shock can lead to trans-generational immune priming in the Red Flour Beetle, Tribolium castaneum
VL  - 5
IS  - 6
SP  - 1318-1326
AB  - Trans-generational immune priming (TGIP) describes the transfer of immune stimulation to the next generation. As stress and immunity are closely connected, we here address the question whether trans-generational effects on immunity and resistance can also be elicited by a nonpathogen stress treatment of parents. General stressors have been shown to induce immunity to pathogens within individuals. However, to our knowledge, it is as of yet unknown whether stress can also induce trans-generational effects on immunity and resistance. We exposed a parental generation (mothers, fathers, or both parents) of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, a species where TGIP has been previously been demonstrated, to either a brief heat or cold shock and examined offspring survival after bacterial infection with the entomopathogen Bacillus thuringiensis. We also studied phenoloxidase activity, a key enzyme of the insect innate immune system that has previously been demonstrated to be up-regulated upon TGIP. We quantified parental fecundity and offspring developmental time to evaluate whether trans-generational priming might have costs. Offspring resistance was found to be significantly increased when both parents received a cold shock. Offspring phenoloxidase activity was also higher when mothers or both parents were cold-shocked. By contrast, parental heat shock reduced offspring phenoloxidase activity. Moreover, parental cold or heat shock delayed offspring development. In sum, we conclude that trans-generational priming for resistance could not only be elicited by pathogens or pathogen-derived components, but also by more general cues that are indicative of a stressful environment. The interaction between stress responses and the immune system might play an important role also for trans-generational effects. Trans-generational immune priming describes the transfer of immune stimulation to offspring. Here we show that also the exposure of parents to non-pathogen stress (cold shock) increased offspring resistance and immunity. This suggests that connections between stress and immunity also act across generations. © 2015 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

VL  - 33

AB  - Background: Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) is a novel biological polymer for biomedical application with high biocompatibility, mechanical properties near to soft tissues of body and a adaptability of properties during synthesis. But, this polymer tends to undergo rather rapid biodegradation which is usually faster than peripheral nerve regeneration and needs optimization of degradability properties for using as a nerve conduit. Methods: First, PGS pre-polymer was synthesized and then, equal to 5% of its weight, calcium titanate ceramic, which is highly biocompatible, was added to it and the acquired mixture was exposed to heat in vacuum oven to increase its strength. The obtained biocomposite came under scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, in-vitro biodegradation and cytotoxicity evaluation. Findings: A composite with high particle distribution was obtained which represented a chemical bond between its two precursors. The in-vitro degradation time showed 23% reduction in overall weight loss for the composite in comparison to pure PGS over a period of 60 days degradation. The cell culture showed more than 90% of viability after 5 days of culture for the composite. Conclusion: Regarding to biodegradation rate, molecular mass and high cytocompatibility, this composite is encouraging enough to merit further investigation for nerve conduit application. © 2016, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS).

TI  - Ontogenesis from embryo to juvenile and salinity tolerance of Japanese devil stinger Inimicus japonicus during early life stage
VL  - 2
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-13
AB  - Embryonic development and morphological characteristics of Japanese devil stinger Inimicus japonicus during early life stage were investigated. Larvae were hatched out 50 h after fertilization at temperature 21 degrees C. Total length of the newly hatched larva was 4.03 mm, the mouth of the larva opened at 3 days after hatching (DAH), and the yolk sac of the larva disappeared at 5 DAH. After hatching, the pectoral fin first developed, then the tail fin, dorsal fin, anal fin and pelvic fin continuously developed, and all fins formed completely at 15 DAH. The metamorphosis was complete at 25 DAH, and the body color and habit of the metamorphosed individuals were different from the larvae. At 30 DAH, the morphology and habit of the juveniles were the same to adults. In order to determine the suitable salinity for larviculture of I. japonicus, salinity tolerance at different early developmental stages was compared in terms of the survival activity index (SAI) and mean survival time (MST). The results indicated that salinity tolerance varied with development stages. The optimum salinity range for newly hatched larvae was 10-25 parts per thousand. Larvae showed low tolerance to low salinity (5 parts per thousand) before the mouth opened, and the suitable salinities for the larvae with open mouth, yolk-sac larvae, post yolk-sac larvae were 10-15 parts per thousand. The flexion larvae showed a wider salinity tolerance with range of 5-20 parts per thousand. After metamorphosis, the juveniles showed a preferable adaptability of salinities of 15-20 parts per thousand. The SAI and MST of individuals at various stages under different salinity conditions were positively correlated.

AB  - All microorganisms have an optimum set of environmental conditions under which they grow actively. When conditions become less than optimum this may affect their rate of growth and under more extreme conditions, they undergo stress which can cause injury and at the extreme, will affect their survival. In foods and food-production environments, the production of stressful conditions to reduce or prevent microbial growth is a widely used approach. However, the adaptability of microbes means they can respond to nonlethal stressful conditions and this can result in them developing greater resistance to the imposed stress. This article will look at the most common stresses microbes encounter in food environments and the mechanisms they use to overcome these. Because most of the organisms of concern are bacteria the main focus of this latter aspect will be on their responses to stress, which is a widely studied area. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Better cold tolerance of Bt-resistant Spodoptera exigua strain and the corresponding cold-tolerant mechanism
VL  - 140
SP  - 51-57
AB  - Spodoptera exigua is a secondary target pest of Bt cotton commercialized in China. With the continuous adoption of Bt cotton, populations of S. exigua have gradually increased. However, the cold tolerance ability of Bt-resistant S. exigua and the effect of continuous Bt diet on anti-cold materials are unknown. In our study, it was found that Bt-resistant S. exigua (Bt10) developed better with shorter larval and pupal duration and higher pupation rate compared to CM at the suboptimal low temperature. The supercooling points and freezing points of the Bt-resistant S. exigua strain were determined, and body water content and anti-cold materials such as total sugar, trehalose and glycogen, glycerol and fat were examined to explore the effect of Bt toxin on overwintering and on population increase. The results showed that the supercooling point and the freezing point of the Bt-resistant S. exigua pupae were both significantly lower than that of the Bt-susceptible strain. No difference was found in the body water content of pupae and adults between the two strains. Total sugar content of the Bt-resistant strain at both the pupal and adult stages was higher than that of the susceptible strain at the corresponding stages, and glycogen content of the Bt-resistant strain at the larval stage was higher than that of the susceptible larval S. exigua. Fat content of the Bt-resistant larvae, pupae and adults was for each higher than that of the susceptible strain, but the difference was not significant except for that of the 3rd instar larvae. Glycerol content of the Bt-resistant strain at larval, pupal and adult stages was for each higher than that of the corresponding life stages of the susceptible strain. It can be seen that more glycerol was accumulated in Bt-resistant S. exigua. The results indicate that Bt-resistant S. exigua has better cold tolerance. The contents of the anti-freeze substances of progeny, especially glycerol, were increased after previous generations were continuously fed on Bt protein, which means that the Bt-resistant secondary target pests could more easily overcome the overwinter season and become a source of crop damage the following year.

TI  - Olive root growth observed by field rhizotron
VL  - 949
SP  - 271-278
AB  - The olive (Olea europaea L.) is characterized by high drought tolerance and its roots show high transmigration capability and adaptability to changing conditions. Root growth is affected by the environment as is the functional specialization of each root structure. A quantity based analysis gives just a partial notion of the complexity of the process which allows the olive to be so adaptable. An experiment using rhizotrones was carried out that allowed sequential root growth, distribution, differentiation and mortality to be directly observed. Four olive trees were selected and a glass window for each tree (0.8 m deep by 1.3 m wide) was placed underground, 0.5 m away from the trunk in September 2007. Bi-weekly observations throughout the growing season made it possible to identify root growing rate and morphological changes. Based on their morphology roots observed have been divided into two different clusters <0.2 mm very fine (VF) roots, and >0.2 mm fine (F) roots. At no point during the observation period (from September 2007 to September 2008) did root growth stop, including winter months. The two clusters of roots behaved in a different way during the season. VF root growth peaked in February and F root growth from April to May. In both cases root growth drastically weakened from June to August with a faster reduction of VF roots. Root mortality was very low during the winter accelerating in May, likely influenced by an increase in temperatures. Root mortality slowed down deeper in the soil where moisture and temperature changes were not as high. All the presented results seem to be applicable to modern oliviculture, in high density orchard management, to obtain better control of the development of the whole plant and to reduce costs.

TI  - Stand density and drought interaction on water relations of Nothofagus antarctica: Contribution of forest management to climate change adaptability
VL  - 25
IS  - 6
SP  - 1111-1120
AB  - Nothofagus antarctica is the most representative species of the native mixed forest occupying ecotone areas between forests and steppe in NW Patagonia, South-America. In this type of environment, vulnerability to climate change is particularly enhanced. Predictions of future climatic conditions for this region indicate an increment of atmospheric temperature and also, a high variability of rain events, threatening forest persistence and productivity. In this framework, management strategies are crucial to guarantee sustainability of native vegetation systems. The objective of this study was to study the effect of tree density on the ecophysiological limitations of water use of N. antarctica, as a proxy to its productivity, during a drought period. Compared with the unthinned forest, the thinned forest showed higher soil water availability, higher sapflow density (Js) and canopy conductance (Gc) values, similar aerodynamic conductance (Ga) and a low degree of coupling to vapor pressure deficit. Ecophysiological results demonstrated a high limitation over gas exchange of individual N. antarctica trees imposed by the resistance in the hydraulic soil-to-leaf pathway in the unthinned-natural condition. Surprisingly, our results suggest structural limitations in the unthinned stand which reduce the ability of N. antarctica trees to take advantage of wet seasons, at least in the short term. Thinning could decrease the susceptibility of N. antarctica-based systems to drought stress, by increasing resource availability to the remaining trees, thus contributing to enhance the persistence of this species under climate change conditions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - There are large populations in developing and under-developed countries which do not have an access to the electrical grid. Reasons for this non-accessibility include remote locations of such communities with reference to the penetration of the grid as well as inadequate availability of sufficient electrical connections due to supply side power shortages. It is expensive to provide grid connectivity to populations located in isolated, geographically difficult areas. However, in absence of electrical power, living needs cannot be met and grid isolated populations are forced to exploit fast depleting natural sources of energy such as wood for survival. Such communities primarily have two types of energy requirements, first as electrical energy for lighting and for operating electrical appliances such as fans, TV, Radio, etc and secondly for meeting their energy needs of cooking. To meet such types of energy demand through renewable (e.g. solar and wind etc.) alone becomes expensive, particularly for cooking or other small thermal applications. In this study, a general model is suggested which meet both types of energy need for remote populations along with its techno-economic feasibility. Among known renewable sources, wind energy is cost effective but inconsistent. Therefore, a suitable ESS (Energy Storage System) is essential for off-grid, stand alone, wind turbine to ensure consistent energy availability. Oversized wind turbine with battery can not only meet the peak electricity demands but can provide spare capacity for running processes that can store energy, which can be later pumped into the network, when real time wind generation stops due to absence or reduction in wind velocity. If, one now couples a water based electrolyser to generate Hydrogen with this system, the excess generation from the over-designed wind turbine can be diverted to the water electrolyser to generate Hydrogen. The generated Hydrogen can be stored to meet all thermal energy needs of the isolated communities, particularly for cooking. Thus in such an envisaged system, electrical energy is used only for lighting and running electrical appliances and thermal needs - such as that for cooking - are met by burning clean - green - Hydrogen fuel. Objective of the study is to explore use of Hydrogen directly for cooking through catalytic combustion. This study reveals that direct use of Hydrogen for thermal application is more efficient and economically viable than converting generated Hydrogen back to electrical energy through fuel cell or internal combustion engine forthermal application.

TI  - Metabolome variations in the Porphyromonas gingivalis vimA mutant during hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress
VL  - 30
IS  - 2
SP  - 111-127
AB  - The adaptability and survival of Porphyromonas gingivalis in the oxidative microenvironment of the periodontal pocket are indispensable for survival and virulence, and are modulated by multiple systems. Among the various genes involved in P. gingivalis oxidative stress resistance, vimA gene is a part of the 6.15-kb locus. To elucidate the role of a P. gingivalis vimA-defective mutant in oxidative stress resistance, we used a global approach to assess the transcriptional profile, to study the unique metabolome variations affecting survival and virulence in an environment typical of the periodontal pocket. A multilayered protection strategy against oxidative stress was noted in P. gingivalis FLL92 with upregulation of detoxifying genes. The duration of oxidative stress was shown to differentially modulate transcription with 94 (87%) genes upregulated twofold during 10 min and 55 (83.3%) in 15 min. Most of the upregulated genes (55%), fell in the hypothetical/unknown/unassigned functional class. Metabolome variation showed reduction in fumarate and formaldehyde, hence resorting to alternative energy generation and maintenance of a reduced metabolic state. There was upregulation of transposases, genes encoding for the metal ion binding protein transport and secretion system. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

TI  - Gas detonation cell width prediction model based on support vector regression
VL  - 49
IS  - 7
SP  - 1423-1430
AB  - Detonation cell width is an important parameter in hydrogen explosion assessments. The experimental data on gas detonation are statistically analyzed to establish a universal method to numerically predict detonation cell widths. It is commonly understood that detonation cell width, lambda, is highly correlated with the characteristic reaction zone width, lambda. Classical parametric regression methods were widely applied in earlier research to build an explicit semiempirical correlation for the ratio of lambda/delta. The obtained correlations formulate the dependency of the ratio lambda/delta on a dimensionless effective chemical activation energy and a dimensionless temperature of the gas mixture. In this paper, support vector regression (SVR), which is based on nonparametric machine learning, is applied to achieve functions with better fitness to experimental data and more accurate predictions. Furthermore, a third parameter, dimensionless pressure, is considered as an additional independent variable. It is found that three-parameter SVR can significantly improve the performance of the fitting function. Meanwhile, SVR also provides better adaptability and the model functions can be easily renewed when experimental database is updated or new regression parameters are considered.

TI  - Marine gametes in a changing ocean: Impacts of climate change stressors on fecundity and the egg
VL  - 128
SP  - 12-24
AB  - In marine invertebrates, the environmental history of the mother can influence fecundity and egg size. Acclimation of females in climate change stressors, increased temperature and low pH, results in a decrease in egg number and size in many taxa, with the exception of cephalopods, where eggs increase in size. With respect to spawned eggs, near future levels of ocean acidification can interfere with the egg's block to polyspermy and intracellular pH. Reduction of the extracellular egg jelly coat seen in low pH conditions has implications for impaired egg function and fertilization. Some fast generation species (e.g. copepods, polychaetes) have shown restoration of female reproductive output after several generations in treatments. It will be important to determine if the changes to egg number and size induced by exposure to climate change stressors are heritable. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 32

SP  - 29-35
AB  - This paper quantifies the effects of climate change on the production of olive in Yarada, Tacna-Peru region, from yield estimates of the production of olive through cointegration analysis and model of vector error correction (VEC), using 1993-2012 data information. Econometric Model results indicate climatic variables such as maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation and soil humidity significantly affect the performance of the olive harvest, the goodness of fit or validity of the model is explained by more than 70%. At present, the average maximum temperature has not reached the threshold of break (24.07 °C), so that increases in temperature improves the performance of the crop, the opposite happens with the minimum temperature level, this has surpassed the threshold (16.24 °C), the minimum temperature falls has an adverse impact on the productivity of olive. By 2030 it will experience a slight performance drops olive production of 4.94% in the low and 6.42% forecast in the high level.

TI  - The environment's influence on regional stability and conflict
VL  - 48
IS  - 2
SP  - 11-40
AB  - The evolution of the global strategic situation following the Cold War suggests the need to expand the definition of national security to include environmental threats to stability. Environmental security refers to a range of security issues triggered or intensified by environmental factors such as climate change, resources, demographic factors, natural disasters, environmental change, and non-sustainable practices. Environmental stress has the potential to destabilize states, but especially in the developing world because they are characteristically more dependent on the environment for economic productivity and lack the resiliency to overcome these challenges. This paper examines the linkages between environmental stress, instability, and conflict; and illustrates these connections with two case studies. This analysis suggests that developing states are more vulnerable to environmental stress and suffer from four fundamental causally-related social effects: 1) reduced agricultural production; 2) economic decline; 3) population displacement; and 4) civil disruption. These effects determine the vulnerability and adaptability of the society. Furthermore, environmental conflict evolves from four underlying processes: non-sustainable practices; natural environmental change; governmental practices; and human activity.

TI  - New evidence may support the persistence and adaptability of the near-extinct Chinese sturgeon
VL  - 193
SP  - 66-69
AB  - Damming the Yangtze River has resulted in a shortened spawning migration distance and time period, created altered and fewer spawning locations, reduced spawning population size, and narrowed the spawning temperature range for the Chinese sturgeon, Acipenser sinensis. No sign of spawning activity was detected in 2013 and 2014, raising concern about the possible extinction of the species. However, the recent discovery of four wild juvenile Chinese sturgeon in the Yangtze Estuary in 2015 suggests that following a short time period when spawning was suspended, a few Chinese sturgeon have resumed spawning at an unknown location in the Yangtze River. This demonstrates that Chinese sturgeon have an extraordinary ability to adapt to environmental changes. However, they appear to have reached their limit in adapting to the drastically changed riverine environment. Innovative conservation efforts are needed to improve the chances for survival of this critically endangered species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Bactericidal Effects against S. aureus and Physicochemical Properties of Plasma Activated Water stored at different temperatures
VL  - 6
AB  - Water activated by non-thermal plasma creates an acidified solution containing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, known as plasma-activated water (PAW). The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of different storage temperatures (25 °C, 4 °C, -20 °C, -80 °C) on bactericidal activities against S. aureus and physicochemical properties of PAW up to 30 days. Interestingly, PAW stored at -80 °C yielded the best antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, 3∼4 log reduction over a 30-day period after PAW generation; meanwhile, PAW stored at 25 °C, 4 °C, and -20 °C, respectively, yielded 0.2∼2 log decrease in cell viability after the same exposure and storage time. These results were verified by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The physicochemical properties of PAW stored at different temperatures were evaluated, including pH, oxidation reduction potential (ORP), and hydrogen peroxide, nitrate, nitrite anion and NO radical levels. These findings suggested that bacterial activity of PAW stored at 25 °C, 4 °C, -20 °C decreased over time, and depended on three germicidal factors, specifically ORP, H 2 O 2, and NO 3 -. Moreover, PAW stored at -80 °C retained bactericidal activity, with NO 2 - contributing to bactericidal ability in association with H 2 O 2. Our findings provide a basis for PAW storage and practical applications in disinfection and food preservation.

TI  - Cross tolerance in beet armyworm: long-term selection by cadmium broadens tolerance to other stressors
VL  - 26
IS  - 10
SP  - 1408-1418
AB  - Long lasting exposure of animals to stressing factor may lead to the selection of population able to cope with the stressor at lower cost than unexposed individuals. The aim of this study was to assess whether 130-generational selection of a beet armyworm to cadmium in food might have induced tolerance also to other stressors. The potential tolerance was assessed by means of unspecific stress markers: HSP70 concentration, DNA damage level, and energy budget indices in L5 larval instars of beet armyworm. The animals originated from Cd-exposed and control strains exposed additionally in a short-term experiment to high/low temperature or pesticide—spinosad. The application of the additional stressors caused, in general, an increase in the levels of studied parameters, in a strain-dependent manner. The most significant increase was found in HSP70 level in the individuals from the Cd-strain exposed to various spinosad concentration. Therefore, multigenerational contact with cadmium caused several changes that enable the insect to survive under a chronic stress, preparing the organism to the contact with an additional, new stressor. This relationship may be described as a sort of cross tolerance. This may, possibly, increase the probability of population survivorship and, at the same time, decrease the efficiency of pesticide-based plant protection efforts. © 2017, The Author(s).

TI  - Adaptations of prokaryotes to their biotopes and to physicochemical conditions in natural or anthropized environments
SP  - 261-291
AB  - Microorganisms live in a constantly changing environment and must modify their physiology and morphology to cope with these changes. The main systems for molecular adaptation to modifications of environmental conditions and the behavioral responses of prokaryotes in various habitats, excluding extreme habitats, are discussed. The main regulation systems that are described are transcription, signal transduction, and protein modifications. Three specialized systems are also presented in details: quorum sensing, phase variation, and antibiosis. Quorum sensing allows bacteria to trigger some responses when their density is high enough to permit the function to be successful. Phase variation is an adaptive process by which a bacterial subpopulation undergoes frequent, usually reversible phenotypic changes resulting from genetic or epigenetic alterations, allowing rapid modification of the cells physiology. Antibiosis is the ability to synthesize molecules that will impact other taxa and eventually provide a selective advantage to which some microbes respond by resisting to these molecules. Finally are described the physiological responses to various environmental parameters such as temperature, oxidants, salinity, acidity, pressure, desiccation, and how this translates in different biotopes such as soil, water bodies, sediments, biofilms, mats, air, and manmade biotopes. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.

SP  - 1562-1567
AB  - This paper presents modified artificial fish swarm algorithm (MAFSA) for automated design and optimization of self-organizing fuzzy logic controller (SOFLC). MAFSA has main improvement in the information of global best AF which is added to the behaviours of AF. It is proposed a novel method of adaptive step and visual based on food concentration. These improvements not only increase the capability of global searching, but also have considerable advantages like high convergence speed, flexibility and high accuracy. Then on the basis of MAFSA, SOFLC is designed and optimized by seven parameters, including three correlation factors of membership functions, one modifying factor of fuzzy logic rules, two quantitative factors and one scaling factor. The fitness function as optimized objective is defined by comprehensive performance index of the controller. Finally, simulation in temperature control of dyeing machine is implemented by using the above proposed method. Moreover, the simulation results show that MAFSA based SOFLC can avoid premature effectively and possesses strong adaptability and high control precision. © 2013 IEEE.

VL  - 2
IS  - 1
SP  - 30-32
AB  - Understanding the capacity of species to acclimate and adapt to expected temperature increases is critical for making predictions about the biological impacts of global warming, yet it is one of the least certain aspects of climate change science. Tropical species are considered to be especially sensitive to climate change because they live close to their thermal maximum and exhibit limited capacity for acclimation. Here, we demonstrate that a tropical reef fish is highly sensitive to small increases in water temperature, but can rapidly acclimate over multiple generations. Acute exposure to elevated temperatures (+1.5 °C and +3.0 °C) predicted to occur this century caused a 15% and 30% respective decrease in individual's maximum ability to perform aerobic activities such as swimming or foraging, known as aerobic scope. However, complete compensation in aerobic scope occurred when both parents and offspring were reared throughout their lives at elevated temperature. Such acclimation could reduce the impact of warming temperatures and allow populations to persist across their current range. This study reveals the importance of transgenerational acclimation as a mechanism for coping with rapid climate change and highlights that single generation studies risk underestimating the potential of species to cope. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - This paper studies the genetic diversity in different geographical conditions can help to understand geographic variation pattern of black locust in China,which can be a reference for the cultivation. Contrast experimental forests were built in Baoding,Hebei with black locust seeds collected from 19 provenances,and the growth traits were investigated. Analysis of SSR markers of 19 populations of total 570 samples are done. Investigation of 5-year-old experimental forest showed that different groups in survival rate,height and diameter at breast height(DBH)had significant differences,that survival rate ranged 53.33%-83.33%,height changed in 5.65-6.61 m,DBH distributed in 4.28-5.48 cm. There was a significant differences in growth traits among populations of different origins,that the performance of the experimental forests planting area as the center radiates outside. The population which farther away from the test site,has a lower survival rate and growth,that indicates the black locust have formed geographical variations in growth traits,with abundant genetic diversity. SSR analysis showed that the total genetic diversity(HT)changes in amplitude of 0.5154-0.7569,and coefficient of genetic differentiation(GST) has an average of 0.0128. The variation among populations only 1.28% shows that the most variation within populations. The number of effective alleles,expected heterozygosity and observed heterozygosity of 19 black locust populations show increasing from north to south. Correlation analysis of growth traits and genetic parameters showed significant negative correlations. The black locust from different origins have an abundant genetic diversity,that has initially formed a geographical variation. The results show that the farther away from the test site,the populations have the lower survival rate and growth;affected by latitude and the annual mean temperature,number of effective allele,expected heterozygosity and observed heterozygosity both showed trend of increasing from north to south.

VL  - 100
IS  - 4
SP  - 795-801
AB  - Euspilotus azureus (Sahlberg, 1823) (Coleoptera: Histeridae) is one of the most frequently sampled species of Histeridae on carcasses in South America. Determining its physiological responses to different temperatures is essential for providing development rate equations to estimate the period of insect activity and postmortem interval of the body. Thus, to evaluate the influence of temperature on their life cycle and to understand their developmental threshold, experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions at 6 different temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C). All E. azureus life stages were responsive to thermal variations. Eggs of E. azureus did not hatch at extreme temperatures (10 and 35 °C) and the development time from egg to adult was longer at low temperatures (15 and 20 °C). Their biological responses, such as mean number of eggs produced, the number of eggs per egg mass, and development time at different temperatures, indicate that 20 to 25 °C is optimal for growth. The results suggest that E. azureus shows tolerance and adaptability in its ontogenetic stages over a wide temperature range, which is common in generalist species. Also, this study provides the development rate equation for the species, which is applicable to studies of forensic entomology.

TI  - Low disturbances favor steady state: Case of cyanobacterial monodominance in a Brazilian coastal lagoon
VL  - 4
IS  - 2
SP  - 243-254
AB  - Steady state occurs mainly under less pronounced abiotic variation, leading to low diversity and nonsuccessional change, opposite from the nonequilibrium concept. Permanent circulation of a waterbody creates a low disturbance status but does not represent a disturbance because it does not change the diversity and dominance of species. Phytoplankton composition was analyzed in a shallow Brazilian coastal lagoon, Peri (Santa Catarina State, Brazil), in the cold-dry and hot-rainy periods during 2009-2010. Uninterrupted steady state conditions occurred along with the monodominance of the cyanobacteria Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, which dominated under a nonstratification regime and low availability of dissolved nutrients. Primary production measured as resource-use efficiency indicated a capacity for this species to convert phosphorus into biomass as well as its ability to effective exploit resources. Differences in temperature and nitrogen availability seemed to be the driving parameters for interseasonal changes in the phytoplankton community in Peri Lagoon. Models of competition that predict greater diversity, which lead to greater levels of primary productivity and more complete utilization of limiting resources, were not confirmed in this study. The presence of the dinoflagellate Peridinium umbonatum and C. raciborskii together is suggested to represent shallow, mixed, turbid, and nutrient-deficient ecosystems. Although competitive exclusion would be the primary mechanism that selects for species equilibrium, higher adaptability by a few species under selective conditions seems to be the most important factor in the occurrence of steady states. © International Society of Limnology 2014.

TI  - Evolution of robust circadian clocks in drosophila melanogaster populations reared in constant dark for over 330 generations
VL  - 103
IS  - 9
AB  - Robustness is considered to be an important feature of biological systems which may evolve when the functionality of a trait is associated with higher fitness across multiple environmental conditions. Thus, the ability to maintain stable biological phenotypes across environments is thought to be of adaptive value. Previously, we have reported higher intrinsic activity levels (activity levels of free-running rhythm in constant darkness) and power of rhythm (as assessed by amplitude of the periodogram) in Drosophila melanogaster populations (stocks) reared in constant darkness (DD stocks) as compared to those reared in constant light (LL stocks) and 12:12-h light-dark cycles (LD stocks) for over 19 years (∼330 generations). In the current study, we intended to examine whether the enhanced levels of activity observed in DD stocks persist under various environments such as photoperiods, ambient temperatures, non-24-h light-dark (LD) cycles, and semi-natural conditions (SN). We found that DD stocks largely retain their phenotype of enhanced activity levels across most of the above-mentioned environments suggesting the evolution of robust circadian clocks in DD stocks. Furthermore, we compared the peak activity levels of the three stocks across different environmental conditions relative to their peaks in constant darkness and found that the change in peak activity levels upon entrainment was not significantly different across the three stocks for any of the examined environmental conditions. This suggests that the enhancement of activity levels inDDstocks is not due to differential sensitivity to environment. Thus, these results suggest that rearing in constant darkness (DD) leads to evolution of robust circadian clocks suggesting a possible adaptive value of possessing such rhythms under constant dark environments. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.

VL  - 24
IS  - 3
SP  - 478-488
AB  - Countergradient variation (CGV) is defined as genetic variation that counteracts the negative influences of the physical environment, minimising phenotypic variability along an environmental gradient. CGV is thought to have relevance in predicting the response of organisms to climate variability and change. To test the hypothesis that growth rate increased with latitude, consistent with CGV, young-of-the-year (YOY) Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, were examined along a ~27° latitudinal gradient in central and eastern Canada. Growth rates were estimated from fork lengths standardised by the thermal opportunity for growth based on experienced water temperatures derived using otolith oxygen stable isotopes. Results demonstrated patterns consistent with CGV, where northern populations demonstrated faster growth rates. A secondary aim was to test for similar geographical patterns in otolith-inferred metabolic rates, which reflect the energetic costs of standard metabolic rate (SMR) and other processes such as feeding, locomotion, thermoregulation, reproduction and growth. Results demonstrated a significant, positive relationship between otolith-inferred metabolic rate and latitude, which may reflect an increase in one, or a combination, of the above-noted physiological processes. The similar latitudinal pattern in growth and otolith-inferred metabolic rates suggests greater intake of food per unit of time by northern fish. The phenotypic variation in physiological traits observed here demonstrates the significant adaptability of Arctic charr to different thermal regimes with different growing season lengths. Determining the relative contributions of phenotypic plasticity and genetic variation to the observed latitudinal variation will be critical to predicting the responses of Arctic charr to climate change more accurately. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

TI  - Integration of time-resolved transcriptomics data with flux-based methods reveals stress-induced metabolic adaptation in Escherichia coli
VL  - 6
AB  - Background: Changes in environmental conditions require temporal effectuation of different metabolic pathways in order to maintain the organisms' viability but also to enable the settling into newly arising conditions. While analyses of robustness in biological systems have resulted in the characterization of reactions that facilitate homeostasis, temporal adaptation-related processes and the role of cellular pathways in the metabolic response to changing conditions remain elusive.Results: Here we develop a flux-based approach that allows the integration of time-resolved transcriptomics data with genome-scale metabolic networks. Our framework uses bilevel optimization to extract temporal minimal operating networks from a given large-scale metabolic model. The minimality of the extracted networks enables the computation of elementary flux modes for each time point, which are in turn used to characterize the transitional behavior of the network as well as of individual reactions. Application of the approach to the metabolic network of Escherichia coli in conjunction with time-series gene expression data from cold and heat stress results in two distinct time-resolved modes for reaction utilization-constantly active and temporally (de)activated reactions. These patterns contrast the processes for the maintenance of basic cellular functioning and those required for adaptation. They also allow the prediction of reactions involved in time- and stress-specific metabolic response and are verified with respect to existing experimental studies.Conclusions: Altogether, our findings pinpoint the inherent relation between the systemic properties of robustness and adaptability arising from the interplay of metabolic network structure and changing environment. © 2012 Töpfer et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

TI  - Parental and hybrid Daphnia from the D. longispina complex: Long-term dynamics in genetic structure and significance of overwintering modes
VL  - 29
IS  - 4
SP  - 810-823
AB  - In recent decades, hybridization has become a focus of attention because of its role in evolutionary processes. However, little is known about changes in genetic structure within and between parental species and hybrids over time. Here, we studied processes of genetic change in parental species and hybrids from the Daphnia longispina complex (Crustacea, Cladocera) over a period of six years across ten habitats. These cyclical parthenogens respond to fluctuating environments by switching from asexual to sexual reproduction. Importantly, sexually produced diapausing eggs, which resist extreme conditions such as low temperatures and serve as dispersal stages, are produced to a lower extent by hybrids. Long-term microsatellite data revealed clear differences between hybrids and parental species. In hybrids, clonal diversity values were lower, whereas heterozygosity and linkage disequilibrium values were higher compared to parental species. Clonal diversity of hybrids responded to the strength of the winter, with cold winters resulting in few genotypes in the following spring. In time windows when only asexual hybrid females survive, priority effects will favour the establishment of the hybrid offspring before hatchlings from parental diapause eggs can enter the community. The constant high levels of heterozygosity maintained by clonal reproduction in hybrids might lead to their successful establishment over time, when they are able to escape competition from both parental species. Although we found evidence that hybrids diversity depends on fluctuating environments, a direct link between hybrid abundance and the strength of winter was missing. Because of reduced adaptability in clonally reproducing hybrids, multiple factors must contribute to promoting their long-term success in fluctuating environments. © 2016 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.

TI  - Genetic algorithm optimization of a high-pressure turbine vane pressure side film cooling array
VL  - 136
IS  - 1
AB  - The following work is an in-depth investigation of the heat transfer characteristics and cooling effectiveness of a full-scale fully cooled modern high-pressure turbine (HPT) vane as a result of genetic algorithm (GA) optimization, relative to a modern baseline film cooling configuration. Individual designs were evaluated using 3D Reynoldsaveraged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) that modeled film cooling injection using a transpiration boundary condition and evaluated 10 cells from the wall with an isothermal surface condition. 1800 different cooling arrays were assessed for fitness within the optimization where film cooling parameters such as axial and radial hole location, hole size, injection angle, compound angle, and customdesigned row patterns were varied in the design space. The GA optimization terminated with a unique pressure side (PS) cooling array after only 13 generations. The fitness functions prescribed for the problem lowered the PS average near-wall surface temperature, lowered the near-wall maximum temperature, and maintained the level of near-wall average overall effectiveness. Results show how the optimization resulted in redistributed flow from overcooled areas on the vane PS to undercooled areas near the shroud. The optimized cooling array yielded a reduction of average near-wall gas temperature of 2 K, a reduction in the maximum near-wall gas temperature of 3 K, a reduction in maximum heat flux of 2 kW/m2 and a reduction in pressure loss over the vane, all while maintaining a constant level of surface-averaged overall effectiveness. Methods used to improve pressure side film cooling performance here are promising in terms of eliminating hot spots on individual HPT components in their proper operating environments as well as increasing the potential to use less air for cooling purposes in a gas turbine engine. © 2014 by ASME.

AB  - Enteroviurs 71 (EV71) is the main cause for hand-foot-mouth disease and some diseases such as nervous system disorder, pulmonary edema and pulmonary hemorrhage. Non-structural proteins 2A, 3C and 3D are foundations of replication and survival of EV71 in host cells, which are different in structure and mechanism of action with other members of enterovirus family. 2A and 3C can inhibit the expression of host cell protein so as to induce the cell apoptosis, while 3C can inhibit the natural immunity of host cell, and 3D is associated with the heat-resistance and the adaptability of EV71. Some small molecules can inhibit EV71 infection at various stages of virus invasion. This paper reviews the characters of structure and function of 2A, 3C and 3D proteins during replication of EV71 as well as inhibitory effect of some small molecules on the replication.

TI  - Induced Gynogenesis in Grass Carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) Using Irradiated Sperm of Allotetraploid Hybrids
VL  - 13
IS  - 5
SP  - 1017-1026
AB  - Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) eggs were activated by UV-irradiated diploid sperm of allotetraploid hybrids derived from red crucian carp (♀) × common carp (♂) and then duplicated by cold shock in 4-6°C water for 10-12 min. Different cold shock initiation times resulted in two types of diploid gynogenetic grass carp: meiotic gynogenetic (meiG) and mitotic gynogenetic (mitG). Over a 5-year period, a total of 17,170 meiG and 1,080 mitG fry were produced and 6,862 meiG and 372 mitG grass carp survived. The gynogenetic fish were confirmed by morphological characteristics, chromosome examination, and microsatellite DNA analysis. The morphological traits of the gynogenetic grass carp were similar to those of wild diploid grass carp. Normal gynogenetic fish were identified as diploid with 48 chromosomes by chromosomal metaphases examination, while nonviable abnormal embryos were detected as haploid with 24 chromosomes. Microsatellite DNA analysis indicated that after one generation of gynogenesis, the genetic purity of meiG and mitG grass carp was significantly increased over that of wild grass carp. In addition, both meiG and mitG grass carp groups were 100% female, and 88% of these showed normal ovary development. Thus, the sex determination mechanism in female grass carp was homogamety. The ability to establish pure all-female groups of meiG and mitG grass carp should be a valuable contribution to both fish genetics and grass carp breeding. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

TI  - Growth performance and lignin content of Acacia mangium Willd. and Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth. under normal and stressed conditions
VL  - 63
IS  - 8
SP  - 381-392
AB  - Acacia mangium Willdenow and Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunningham ex Bentham are fast-growing species with wide environmental adaptability. Fast-growing species which thrive in otherwise non-arable problematic soil and which hold the added advantage of improving the condition of the soil, can be used to increase production area, and, thus, are highly desired. We investigated the growth performance and lignin content under normal and stressed conditions for these Acacia mangium Willd. and Acacia auriculiformis A. Cunn. ex Benth. Normal growing conditions was represented by fertile soil, high water-holding capacity due to low soil drainage, high organic matter, low soil temperature, overall consistent rainfall and relatively milder temperatures, whilst stressed conditions were achieved with a sandy soil with low fertility, low waterholding capacity due to high drainage and low organic matter, and high soil temperature accompanied by inconsistent monthly temperature and rainfall. Growth performance under normal conditions was significantly better compared to the stressed conditions. A. mangium performed better than A. auriculiformis under the normal conditions. However A. auriculiformis performed better under stressed conditions due to better adaptability. The lignin content under normal conditions fluctuated from one DBH class to another. As for the stress conditions, A. mangium exhibited incremental increases in lignin content with increasing biomass. In contrast, lignin content in A. auriculiformis decreased with increasing biomass. The differences in performance may be attributable to both the micro- and macro-environments and adaptive differences between the two species. For growth under normal conditions, A. mangium appears to be the superior choice, whereas for problematic soils, A. auriculiformis can be recommended. However, for the selection of superior plants with a combination of desired growth rates and lower lignin content the breeding of interspecific hybrids would be a desirable approach.

AB  - Customized electrode materials with good temperature adaptability and high-rate capability are critical to the development of wide-temperature power sources. Herein, high-quality TiC nanowires are uniformly grown on flexible carbon cloth as free-standing electric-double-layer supercapacitor electrode. The TiC nanowires, 20-40 nm wide and 3-6 mu m long, are single-crystalline and highly conductive that is close to typical metal. Symmetric supercapacitors are constructed with ionic liquid electrolyte and TiC nanowires electrodes as wide-temperature and long-cycle stable power source. Ultrastable high-rate cycling life of TiC nanowire arrays electrodes is demonstrated with capacitance retention of 96.8% at 60 degrees C (approximate to 440 F g(-1)), 99% at 25 degrees C (approximate to 400 F g(-1)), and 98% at -25 degrees C (approximate to 240 F g(-1)) after 50 000 cycles at 10 A g(-1). Moreover, due to high electrical conductivity, the TiC nanowire arrays show ultrafast energy release with a fast response time constant of approximate to 0.7 ms. The results demonstrate the viability of metal carbide nanostructures as wide-temperature, robust electrode materials for high-rate and ultrastable supercapacitors.

TI  - The invasive legacy of forage grass introductions into Florida
VL  - 37
IS  - 2
SP  - 254-264
AB  - Exotic African warm-season forage grasses were first introduced into the Americas in the 16th century, and have become invasive in many areas. In Florida, 16 exotic grasses are considered invasive, with the majority originating in Africa and introduced as forages. The high propensity of Africa warm-season grasses to become invasive may be related to the same characteristics that are associated with their value as forages, including adaptability to a wide range of abiotic conditions, rapid establishment, persistence in the environment with minimal husbandry, high productivity under grazing pressure, and adaptation to disturbance. The majority of African warm-season grasses in Florida reproduce vegetatively, a trait known to be associated with invasiveness, and many have been widely planted leading to high propagule pressure and opportunities to invade a variety of niches. In spite of a long history of introduction and promotion in Florida, few African forage grasses are in use today, while many have become invasive. The benefit/cost ratio appears to be tilted in the direction of environmental and economic costs, with minimal benefits. We support newly enacted restrictions on the importation of potentially invasive plants into the USA, and suggest the establishment of a more comprehensive and transparent system for tracking past and future introductions.

TI  - Resilience of sulfate-reducing granular sludge against temperature, pH, oxygen, nitrite, and free nitrous acid
VL  - 100
IS  - 19
SP  - 8563-8572
AB  - Sulfate-reducing granular sludge has recently been developed and characterized in detail as part of the development of the sulfate reduction, autotrophic denitrification, nitrification integrated (SANI) process. However, information regarding temperature of granules to environmental fluctuation is lacking, an aspect that is important in dealing with real wastewater. A comprehensive assessment of sulfate-reducing granular sludge performance under various environmental conditions was thus conducted in this study, including temperature, pH, oxygen, nitrite, and free nitrous acid (FNA) as possible encountering conditions in the removal of organics and/or nitrate. Specific chemical oxygen demand removal rate of the granules was determined to be reduced by 65 % when the temperature varied between 10–15 °C, reduced by 70 % when dissolved oxygen (DO) was 0.5 mg/L or greater, and at least, reduced by 75 % when nitrite was 30 mg N/L or above. Nevertheless, the sludge activity recovered by 82, 100, and 86 % from exposure to high oxygen and nitrite and low temperature levels, respectively. Combined inhibition of nitrite and FNA on the sludge is strong and complex, while FNA alone reduced cell viability from 60 to 40 % when its concentration increased to 2.3 mg N/L. The present study demonstrates that sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) granules possess high resilience against varying environmental conditions, showing the high application potential of sulfate-reducing granular sludge in dealing with brackish and saline industrial or domestic wastewaters. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Alternative procedures for the cryopreservation of brown bear ejaculates depending on the flexibility of the "in cooling" period (5°C)
VL  - 69
IS  - 3
SP  - 434-441
AB  - The adaptability of cryopreservation protocols for brown bear spermatozoa collected under field conditions and frozen in a nearby laboratory (transported for a few hours) or shipped to a reference laboratory for sex sorting (transported for a few days) was evaluated. Forty-nine electroejaculates from 15 mature brown bears were extended to 100×106sperm/mL in a TES-Tris-Fructose based extender and cryopreserved (-20°C/min to -100°C and stored at -196°C). After thawing, the quality of the seminal samples was assessed for total (TM), progressive (PM) motility and kinetic parameters - by CASA -, and viability (VIAB), viable and non-apoptotic status (YOPRO-), high membrane mitochondrial potential (MIT) and intact acrosomes (iACR) - by flow cytometry - In Experiment 1, we assessed different storage times (0, 0.5, 1 - control -, 4-5, 7-8 and 11-12h) at 5°C from final dilution to freezing. After thawing, non-equilibrated samples (0h) showed lower values of iACR, TM and PM. No significant differences were found for the different periods of equilibration tested. In Experiment 2, we evaluated three long-term storage times (24, 48 and 72h) at 5°C before freezing using storage for 1h as control. The post-thawing quality of brown bear spermatozoa declined markedly after 48-72h of pre-freezing. In conclusion, our findings suggest the possibility of extending the pre-freezing cooling period up to 24h post-collection without freezing. This knowledge should enable the adaptation of the freezing protocols for when a special handling conditions are required such as the shipment of seminal samples to technological centers for the pre-freezing application of enhancer spermatic biotechnologies. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Dendritic platinum nanoparticles (DPNs) have been synthesized from l-ascorbic acid and an amphiphilic non-ionic surfactant (Brij-58) via a sonochemical method. The particle size and shape of the DPNs could be tuned by changing the reduction temperature, resulting in a uniform DPN with a size of 23 nm or 60 nm. The facets of DPNs have been studied by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The cytotoxicity of DPNs has been investigated using human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293), and the biological adaptability exhibited by DPNs has opened a pathway to biomedical applications such as drug-delivery systems, photothermal treatment, and biosensors. © 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

TI  - Narrowed temperature adaptability in non-natal osmotic environments of two euryhaline wanderers, dace and black porgy: implications for seasonal habitat changes
VL  - 82
IS  - 2
SP  - 261-268
AB  - Many euryhaline wanderer species exhibit seasonal habitat changes, and temperature is suggested to play a key role in this phenomenon. To examine this possibility, we tested the hypothesis that adaptable temperature ranges of euryhaline wanderers are narrower in a non-natal osmotic environment than in their natal osmotic environment using dace Tribolodon hakonensis, a freshwater born euryhaline fish, and black porgy Acanthopagrus schlegelii, a marine born euryhaline fish. In both species, all individuals survived for 48 h in all the tested temperatures in their natal osmotic environments. In non-natal osmotic environments, however, both low (dace: 6 A degrees C, black porgy: 10 A degrees C) and high temperatures (dace: 30 A degrees C, black porgy: 33 A degrees C) significantly reduced their survival. These results indicate that euryhaline wanderers have a narrowed adaptable temperature range in non-natal osmotic environments. The similar trend observed in these two species of freshwater and marine fishes suggests that this may be a general characteristic in euryhaline wanderers and could be one of the causes of their seasonal movements.

AB  - The ability to make a living in the Arctic represents one of humanity’s truly exceptional achievements. The fact that it was accomplished by people who depended exclusively on wild (that is, uncultivated) resources attests to the levels of human imagination and ingenuity in creating cultural systems that effectively buffered against the physical elements of the Arctic. For these reasons, studies of North American Arctic foraging peoples have long played an important role in the early foundations and development of American anthropology (Collins, 1984; Dumond, 1987; Burch, 1988). North American Arctic foragers represent one end of the range of variation of the human foraging spectrum (Bettinger, 1991; Kelly, 1995; Binford, 2001), but, as they exist at one end of that range, they especially present insight into human adaptability. Arctic peoples clearly push the boundaries of human adaptation and resiliency by living in areas marked by long periods of cold temperatures, limited availability of plant resources for food, and marked seasonal variation in daylight hours. North American Arctic foragers, both today and in the past, present a broad range of sophisticated technology, dietary flexibility, social organization, and residential mobility as they expanded across large areas of the North American Arctic landscapes. Given this remarkable resiliency in the face of adverse conditions, researchers have examined numerous aspects of cultural and biological characteristics of North American Arctic foragers in order to understand the complex problems related to survival in these circumpolar environments, and the many solutions taken by humans to overcome them. © Cambridge University Press 2014.

AB  - In response to climate change a species may move, adapt, or go extinct. For the adaptability of a population its genetic diversity is essential, but climate change-induced range shifts can cause a loss of genetic diversity. We investigated how landscape structure affects the level and distribution of genetic diversity in metapopulations subject to climate change-induced range shifts. For this we used the spatially explicit, individual-based model METAPHOR which simulates metapopulation demography and genetics under different temperature increase scenarios. The results indicated that increasing total habitat area may enhance the maintenance of the genetic diversity in metapopulations while they are shifting their range under climate change. However, the results also showed that a high level of total habitat area did not prevent the populations in the newly colonised habitat area of being depleted of much of the original genetic diversity. We therefore conclude that enhancing landscape connectivity may lead to a delayed loss of genetic diversity in metapopulations under climate change, but that additional measures would be necessary to ensure its long-term conservation. Importantly, our simulations also show that a landscape which could be regarded as well-structured under stable climatic conditions, may be inferior for the conservation of genetic diversity during a range shift. This is important information for landscape management when developing strategies for the in situ conservation of genetic variation in natural populations under climate change. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

TI  - Is the Interplay between Epigenetic Markers Related to the Acclimation of Cork Oak Plants to High Temperatures?
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
AB  - Trees necessarily experience changes in temperature, requiring efficient short-term strategies that become crucial in environmental change adaptability. DNA methylation and histone posttranslational modifications have been shown to play a key role in both epigenetic control and plant functional status under stress by controlling the functional state of chromatin and gene expression. Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) is a key stone of the Mediterranean region, growing at temperatures of 45°C. This species was subjected to a cumulative temperature increase from 25°C to 55°C under laboratory conditions in order to test the hypothesis that epigenetic code is related to heat stress tolerance. Electrolyte leakage increased after 35°C, but all plants survived to 55°C. DNA methylation and acetylated histone H3 (AcH3) levels were monitored by HPCE (high performance capillary electrophoresis), MS-RAPD (methylation-sensitive random-amplified polymorphic DNA) and Protein Gel Blot analysis and the spatial distribution of the modifications was assessed using a confocal microscope. DNA methylation analysed by HPCE revealed an increase at 55°C, while MS-RAPD results pointed to dynamic methylation-demethylation patterns over stress. Protein Gel Blot showed the abundance index of AcH3 decreasing from 25°C to 45°C. The immunohistochemical detection of 5-mC (5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine) and AcH3 came upon the previous results. These results indicate that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone H3 acetylation have opposite and particular dynamics that can be crucial for the stepwise establishment of this species into such high stress (55°C), allowing its acclimation and survival. This is the first report that assesses epigenetic regulation in order to investigate heat tolerance in forest trees. © 2013 Correia et al.

AB  - Astrobiology strives to increase our knowledge on the origin, evolution and distribution of life, on Earth and beyond. In the past centuries, life has been found on Earth in environments with extreme conditions that were expected to be uninhabitable. Scientific investigations of the underlying metabolic mechanisms and strategies that lead to the high adaptability of these extremophile organisms increase our understanding of evolution and distribution of life on Earth. Life as we know it depends on the availability of liquid water. Exposure of organisms to defined and complex extreme environmental conditions, in particular those that limit the water availability, allows the investigation of the survival mechanisms as well as an estimation of the possibility of the distribution to and survivability on other celestial bodies of selected organisms. Space missions in low Earth orbit (LEO) provide access for experiments to complex environmental conditions not available on Earth, but studies on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of adaption to these hostile conditions and on the limits of life cannot be performed exclusively in space experiments. Experimental space is limited and allows only the investigation of selected endpoints. An additional intensive ground based program is required, with easy to access facilities capable to simulate space and planetary environments, in particular with focus on temperature, pressure, atmospheric composition and short wavelength solar ultraviolet radiation (UV). DLR Cologne operates a number of Planetary and Space Simulation facilities (PSI) where microorganisms from extreme terrestrial environments or known for their high adaptability are exposed for mechanistic studies. Space or planetary parameters are simulated individually or in combination in temperature controlled vacuum facilities equipped with a variety of defined and calibrated irradiation sources. The PSI support basic research and were recurrently used for pre-flight test programs for several astrobiological space missions. Parallel experiments on ground provided essential complementary data supporting the scientific interpretation of the data received from the space missions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

TI  - System Identification Using a Hybrid Estimation of Distribution Algorithm With Minimum Entropy and Its Application
VL  - 37

SP  - 6363-6372
AB  - A novel hybrid approach combining a minimum entropy criterion and estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is proposed to solve the identification problem for nonlinear non-Gaussian systems. A minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion is introduced for system identification since most conventional identification criteria have those shortages: 1) providing the system is Gaussian; 2) needing the priori knowledge, which cannot be satisfied in many cases; 3) lacking adaptability. Random individuals are added into offspring generations of EDA to maintain population diversity. Simulations have been designed on some benchmark functions and a nonlinear system to validate the performance of the proposed MEE-EDA. Results show it outperforms some other methods. Its application to the identification for a coordinated control system (CCS) in a power plant demonstrates that the proposed MEE-EDA method provides an efficient and practical way to tackle the identification problem for thermal dynamic processes. © 2017 Chin.

AB  - Chironomidae larvae are important macroinvertebrates in limnic environments, but little knowledge exists about their biometrics development characteristics. This study aims to describe the immature Chironomus calligraphus Goeldi, 1905 under laboratory conditions by the accomplishment of thirteen egg masses from eggs eclosion to adults emergency, at controlled room temperature (25?C) and photoperiod (12-12h). Larvae were feed ad libitum with "Alcon Basic - MEP 200 Complex" fish food and commercial dehydrated Spirulina. The postures had a mean length of 9±1 mm (n = 13) and 348±66 eggs. The brownish colored eggs with elliptical shape had length of 160.3±17.7 μm (n = 130), being arranged as an organized string in a pseudo spiral form. The time duration from the first to the four instars were three, four, four and eight days, and the average length of a cephalic capsule to each one of the instars (66.3±12.3 μm, 102.9±22.1 μm, 159±24.6 μm, 249.2±29.7 μm, n = 456) were significantly different (ANOVA, p < 0.001). The Dyar's Rule showed a constant growth rate, r = 1.5. Our results demonstrated that C. calligraphus is a species with short life cycle, low mortality rate, food adaptability, fast larval growth and easily maintained at laboratory, factors that allowed the use of this native species as a tool for ecotoxicological tests. Key words: aquatic insects, laboratory development, larval instars, life cycle.

VL  - 56

SP  - 283-293
AB  - Psyttalia lounsburyi (Silvestri) and P. humilis (Silvestri) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) were evaluated in California for their potential to control the invasive olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) (Diptera: Tephritidae). Psyttalia lounsburyi is a specialist on B. oleae while P. humilis also attacks other tephritid species. Field cage trials, conducted from 2006 to 2009, were used to compare P. lounsburyi and two populations of P. humilis (Kenya and Namibia) in California's interior valley and coastal regions. Both parasitoid species reproduced on B. oleae in all trials. Under similar abiotic conditions, offspring production per female was higher in P. humilis than in P. lounsburyi, suggesting that host specificity by P. lounsburyi does not confer a higher efficiency on B. oleae in cultivated olives. Two abiotic factors were shown to impact parasitoid efficiency. First, adult parasitoid survival was poor during periods of high summer temperatures, common to the olive production areas in California's interior valleys. Second, parasitism levels were lower on B. oleae larvae feeding in larger Ascolano cv. fruit than in smaller Manzanillo cv. fruit. Results are discussed relative to biological control of B. oleae in commercial olives and the usefulness of natural enemies specialized to attack fruit flies in wild olives compared with the larger cultivated olive fruit. © 2010 The Author(s).

TI  - Parameter design on the multi-objectives of PEM fuel cell stack using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and genetic algorithms
VL  - 39
IS  - 9
SP  - 4502-4515
AB  - This work considers a design of a PEM fuel cell (PEMFC) stack that consists of 10 cells and expects to carry out an analysis of performance. In this work, PEMFC performance as affected by different combinations of control factors, such as the cathode and anode operating pressures, the humidification temperatures, and the stoichiometric flow ratio of reaction gas, is studied. On the PEMFC stack performance, the gas supply that is expected to be the minimum and the output power that is hoped to be the maximum are a result of the demand of the multi-objectives characteristics. Due to the Taguchi orthogonal array, the screen experiment is carried out by using a fractional factorial design in order to determine main factors and interaction effects first, and then the robust design is conducted. The intelligent parameter design is developed via an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System combined with the definition of percentage reduction of quality loss (PRQL) in order to supply a fitness function to the genetic algorithms (GA). The best parameter design is proposed after an analysis and comparison is conducted. Finally, the adaptability of prediction for the model created by this approach is confirmed by the confirmation experiment. This work shows that the PEMFC performance is improved by 35.8% via the average PRQL. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 21

SP  - 36-44
AB  - Evolution hinges on the ability of organisms to adapt to their environment. A key regulator of adaptability is mutation rate, which must be balanced to maintain genome fidelity while permitting sufficient plasticity to cope with environmental changes. Multiple mechanisms govern an organism's mutation rate. Constitutive mechanisms include mutator alleles that drive global, permanent increases in mutation rates, but these changes are confined to the subpopulation that carries the mutator allele. Other mechanisms focus mutagenesis in time and space to improve the chances that adaptive mutations can spread through the population. For example, environmental stress can induce mechanisms that transiently relax the fidelity of DNA repair to bring about a temporary increase in mutation rates during times when an organism experiences a reduced fitness for its surroundings, as has been demonstrated for double-strand break repair in Escherichia coli. Still, other mechanisms control the spatial distribution of mutations by directing changes to especially mutable sequences in the genome. In eukaryotic cells, for example, the stress-sensitive chaperone Hsp90 can regulate the length of trinucleotide repeats to fine-tune gene function and can regulate the mobility of transposable elements to enable larger functional changes. Here, we review the regulation of mutation rate, with special emphasis on the roles of tandem repeats and environmental stress in genome evolution. Copyright © 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel.

TI  - Smart materials for stimuli responsive leather
AB  - Leather as a material is being used for various utility purposes like footwear, garment, glove, handbags, accessories etc. The main use of leather is to protect the body against external environment and to provide comfort. However, leather may be used for additional functions specific to 1) an adverse or extreme climate and 2) job-ambience or profession so as to enhance adaptability and productivity of the user. When such an application arises the leather is termed as "smart material". Smart or intelligent materials are those that have one or more properties that can be significantly changed in a controlled fashion by external stimuli, such as stress, temperature, moisture, pH, electric or magnetic fields. For example, incorporating thermo responsive function will not only open up new areas of application but also will have extensive application in many areas where leather is presently used like in automobile upholstery leather, where if the smart leather keeps the outside heat away, it prevents the interiors from getting heated up when parked under the sun. Making leather perform the functions what it did as a skin on a live animal lends itself as smart leather. Hence, the futuristic objective is to make the processed skin termed "leather" retain its memory so as to result in "smart or intelligent leather". In this paper, it has been attempted to incorporate thermo responsive function into leathers using smart materials such as phase changing materials (PCM). PCMs are capable of absorbing or releasing large amount of heat during phase transitions between two solid states and/or liquid and solid states. Manufacture of syntan using PCM has been attempted and the properties of the leathers made are presented.

TI  - Techno-economics of integrating bioethanol production from spent sulfite liquor for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from sulfite pulping mills
VL  - 7
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Flow sheet options for integrating ethanol production from spent sulfite liquor (SSL) into the acid-based sulfite pulping process at the Sappi Saiccor mill (Umkomaas, South Africa) were investigated, including options for generation of thermal and electrical energy from onsite bio-wastes, such as bark. Processes were simulated with Aspen Plus® for mass- And energy-balances, followed by an estimation of the economic viability and environmental impacts. Various concentration levels of the total dissolved solids in magnesium oxide-based SSL, which currently fuels a recovery boiler, prior to fermentation was considered, together with return of the fermentation residues (distillation bottoms) to the recovery boiler after ethanol separation. The generation of renewable thermal and electrical energy from onsite bio-wastes were also included in the energy balance of the combined pulping-ethanol process, in order to partially replace coal consumption. The bio-energy supplementations included the combustion of bark for heat and electricity generation and the bio-digestion of the calcium oxide SSL to produce methane as additional energy source. Results: Ethanol production from SSL at the highest substrate concentration was the most economically feasible when coal was used for process energy. However this solution did not provide any savings in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the concentration-fermentation-distillation process. Maximizing the use of renewable energy sources to partially replace coal consumption yielded a satisfactory economic performance, with a minimum ethanol selling price of 0.83 US$/l , and a drastic reduction in the overall greenhouse gas emissions for the entire facility. Conclusion: High substrate concentrations and conventional distillation should be used when considering integrating ethanol production at sulfite pulping mills. Bio-wastes generated onsite should be utilized at their maximum potential for energy generation in order to maximize the GHG emissions reduction. © 2014 Petersen et al.

AB  - In recent years, the use of commercial nanoparticles in different industry and health fields has increased exponentially. However, the uncontrolled application of nanoparticles might present a potential risk to the environment and health. Toxicity of these nanoparticles is usually evaluated by a fast screening assay in zebrafish (Danio rerio). The use of this vertebrate animal model has grown due to its small size, great adaptability, high fertilization rate and fast external development of transparent embryos. In this review, we describe the toxicity of different micro- and nanoparticles (carbon nanotubes, dendrimers, emulsions, liposomes, metal nanoparticles, and solid lipid nanoparticles) associated to their biophysical properties using this model. The main biophysical properties studied are size, charge and surface potential due to their impact on the environment and health effects. The review also discusses the correlation of the effects of the different nanoparticles on zebrafish. Special focus is made on morphological abnormalities, altered development and abnormal behavior. The last part of the review debates changes that should be made in future directions in order to improve the use of the zebrafish model to assess nanotoxicity. © 2017, International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (IUPAB) and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

TI  - Low Connectivity between Mediterranean Marine Protected Areas: A Biophysical Modeling Approach for the Dusky Grouper Epinephelus marginatus
VL  - 8
IS  - 7
AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are major tools to protect biodiversity and sustain fisheries. For species with a sedentary adult phase and a dispersive larval phase, the effectiveness of MPA networks for population persistence depends on connectivity through larval dispersal. However, connectivity patterns between MPAs remain largely unknown at large spatial scales. Here, we used a biophysical model to evaluate connectivity between MPAs in the Mediterranean Sea, a region of extremely rich biodiversity that is currently protected by a system of approximately a hundred MPAs. The model was parameterized according to the dispersal capacity of the dusky grouper Epinephelus marginatus, an archetypal conservation-dependent species, with high economic importance and emblematic in the Mediterranean. Using various connectivity metrics and graph theory, we showed that Mediterranean MPAs are far from constituting a true, well-connected network. On average, each MPA was directly connected to four others and MPAs were clustered into several groups. Two MPAs (one in the Balearic Islands and one in Sardinia) emerged as crucial nodes for ensuring multi-generational connectivity. The high heterogeneity of MPA distribution, with low density in the South-Eastern Mediterranean, coupled with a mean dispersal distance of 120 km, leaves about 20% of the continental shelf without any larval supply. This low connectivity, here demonstrated for a major Mediterranean species, poses new challenges for the creation of a future Mediterranean network of well-connected MPAs providing recruitment to the whole continental shelf. This issue is even more critical given that the expected reduction of pelagic larval duration following sea temperature rise will likely decrease connectivity even more. © 2013 Andrello et al.

TI  - Factor decomposition of responsiveness of the domestic price to crude oil price
VL  - 7
IS  - 6
SP  - 136-140
AB  - Taiwan is an economy that is highly dependent on energy imports. Changes in oil price affect not only the cost of production but also economic growth. Since 2000, the crude oil price has risen and become an unstable factor for economic development. Due to the rapid rise of emerging economies and the competitive international economic environment, Taiwan is facing a moment of industrial restructuring. Energy-saving technologies and improved efficiency may play an important role. Taiwan must improve its industrial productivity and production technology to contribute to the alleviation of the global warming problem. From the crude oil intensity and the change in spillover effects of the crude oil price, we may detect whether industrial production efficiency and adaptability to energy and production technology improves or not. Based on the input-output table during the period of 1981 to 2016, the present study employs the industry-related price model and factor decomposition model to investigate the change in Taiwan’s reliance on crude oil through the oil intensity index. Although efforts have been made to advance technology and improve energy dependence, the results of this study indicate that imported crude oil intensity and price responsiveness have actually increased and that the negative effects of the structural efficiency of production and domestic market demand have substantially increased imported crude oil intensity and price responsiveness, again emphasizing the vulnerability of Taiwan’s production. Thus, the speed of improvement in energy technology is insufficient to keep up with economic growth. © 2017, Econjournals. All rights reserved.

TI  - Dynamic modeling and parameter optimization of single phase heating surface of heat recovery steam generator
VL  - 67
IS  - 11
SP  - 4599-4608
AB  - Heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) is the most important part of the waste heat utilization, and the start-up, shutdown and off-design operation of the HRSG directly determines its life and efficiency. Based on the thermodynamic properties and mass, momentum and energy conservation equations, and taking Matlab/Simulink as the research platform, a dynamic simulation model of the single phase heat transfer surface of HRSG is built in this paper. Combined with the experimental data of the HRSG designed by research group in a cement plant, the parameter optimization of the dynamic model is carried out based on genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithm. The results show that after optimization, the dynamic model of the waste heat boiler is matched with the experimental data, and the error of the model is 0.93%-4.39%. The dynamic model can be used to simulate the temperature change of the heat transfer surface under different working conditions. And through the comparison of the two algorithms, it shows that particle swarm optimization algorithm has obvious advantages in parameter optimization. The fitness function convergence value is better, and in the convergence iteration, it finishes between the 54 and 64 generation. The genetic algorithm achieves convergence after the 93 generation. © All Right Reserved.

TI  - Moving ocean acidification research beyond a simple science: Investigating ecological change and their stabilizers
VL  - 13
SP  - 53-59
AB  - The response of complex ecological communities to ocean acidification reflects interactions among species that propagate or dampen ecological change. Yet, most studies have been based on short-term experiments with limited numbers of interacting species. Both limitations tend to exaggerate measured effects and when combined with our predisposition for investigating change, we reduce insight into pathways of stability, acclimation and adaptation. Here, we review accepted and emerging insights into processes that drive ecological change (top-down and bottom-up) and the stabilizing processes by which ecological complexity may dampen change. With an emphasis on kelp forest examples, we show that boosted primary productivity from enriched CO2 creates competitive imbalances that drive habitat change, but we also recognise intensifying herbivory on these habitats dampens this change. Foraging herbivores thrive on CO2 enriched plants and over successive generations their populations expand. When we consider such population level responses, we open new questions regarding density-effects (e.g. competition, susceptibility to predation and disease), as well as the bottom-up benefits to predators. Nevertheless, research on predators has lagged behind because their wide-ranging behaviour typically imposes logistical difficulties for observational and experimental research. We know that ocean warming imposes elevated metabolic costs on their foraging whilst acidification hampers navigation of their larvae towards suitable habitat and impairs their hunting and avoidance of predators as adults. Connecting such top-down with bottom-up responses is fundamental for progress, and is also contingent on understanding the mechanisms that dampen change. These stabilizers have the potential to keep pace with abiotic change and thereby influence the drivers of acclimation and adaption. Certainly, we acknowledge that investigating change is often simpler and the associated bold messages appeal to citation impact. Yet, if we are to anticipate the ability of complex ecological communities to persist in changing environments, then understanding the shifting balance between the propagation of resource enrichment and its consumption across trophic levels is central to this challenge. © 2017

AB  - A wastewater isolate identified as Escherichia coli HPC781 was adapted for high salt concentration through sequential transfers in Luria Broth (LB). The cells were grown in LB with 5% sodium chloride (NaCl) and were analyzed for the acquired salt resistance network through gene expression profiles. Microarray studies revealed TCA, glyoxylate shunt and acetyl Co-A metabolism as key nodes for stress combat to arrive at compromised physiology. It also proposed that the cells were receiving signals from salt environment via OmpR-EnvZ two component systems and stress dependent general regulatory protein rpoH and rpoE. The salt adapted culture, when challenged with wastewater having additional 5% salt showed growth. The work represents a tactic to adjust biochemical network towards stress and reveals its applicability via real-time PCR measurement of genes in wastewater. The study proposes that the recycled biomass with an adaptation strategy could be applied for treatment of wastewater with high salt levels. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

SP  - 741-757
AB  - An integrated approach was studied for in-house cellulase production, pretreatment, and enzymatic conversion of sugarcane bagasse into glucose followed by the production of second generation bioethanol. Solid state cultures of Aspergillus sp. S4B2F produced significant levels of cellulase complex on wheat bran, supplemented with 1% (w/w) soyabean meal, moistened with 1.5 parts of distilled water after 96 h of incubation at 30°C. The highest productivities of endoglucanase, exoglucanase, and β-glucosidase were 66, 60, and 26 IU/g of fermented dry bran, respectively. The enzyme components had a temperature and pH optima at 50°C and 4.0, respectively and revealed high thermostability at 50°C, retaining 66, 54, and 84% residual activities after 72 h. Pretreatment with 2% alkali in combination with steam was the most efficient pre-hydrolysis method for enzymatic bioconversion and fermentation of cellulosic residue of sugarcane bagasse, which produced the highest cellulose conversion (67%), with glucose and alcohol yields of 323 mg and 175 μl respectively per dry gram of bagasse.

SP  - 48-56
AB  - Objective: The study was to analyze patterns of geographical variation and to identify provenance regions or seed zones, based on observations on a 16-year-old Betula platyphylla provenance trial, in order to provide a scientific basis for selection of superior provenances with high productivity and strong adaptability for each provenance region or seed zone. Method: Eighteen provenances of B. platyphylla planted in Maoershan Experimental Forest Farm of Shangzhi City, Heilongjiang Province, Shancheng Experimental Forest Farm of Benxi, Liaoning Province and Jinhe Forestry Bureau of Inner Mongolia, were used to study height (H), diameter at breast height (DBH), volume(V) by analysis of variance and multiple comparisons for single site and multiple sites.Then correlation analysis and cluster analysis was conducted between growth traits and their geographical and climatic factors. Superior provenances were selected and provenance regions or seed zones were identified. Result: The results showed that there were statistically significant (P<0.01) differences in H,DBH,and V among different sites and provenances,and also significant in site × provenance interaction.Superior provenances were selected based on average volume of individual trees. At Maoershan site, the top provenances were Qingyuan, Caohekou, Maoershan, Huinan, Xiaobeihu and Dongfanghong. These six superior provenances had a volume 23.23% higher than the average of all provenances. At Caohekou site, the top provenances were Caohekou, Qingyuan and Tianshui. These three superior provenances were 22.14% higher in volume than the average of all provenances. At Jinhe site, the top provenances were Moerdaoga, Wuyiling and Chaoer, 105.00% higher in volume than the average of all provenances. For provenances at Maoershan and Caohekou sites, geographical variation analysis showed negative correlation between growth and latitude, and significant correlation between growth and the average annual temperature. Provenances located in low latitudes and high average annual temperatures, performed better in growth traits at Maoershan and Caohekou sites. However, for provenances at Jinhe site, significant correlation was found between growth and latitudes, and negative correlation between growth and the average annual temperature. Provenances located in high latitudes and low average annual temperatures, displayed better growth traits at Jinhe site, and provenances from low latitudes and high average annual temperatures displayed inferior traits because of weak adaptation. The above results indicated that the growth of B. platyphylla was mainly regulated by temperature and latitude, belonging to the type of “cold-warm” geographic variation trend, which conforms to the main pattern of geographical variation of tree species in north China, under the main effects of temperature together with effects of water and heat, and in a clinal variation with latitudes. Correlation analysis and cluster analysis showed that the 18 provenances were divided into 5 provenance regions, of which 3 regions distributed in the northeast and 2 regions in the northwest.Conclusion: Superior provenances were selected respectively for the three trial sites, including 6 provenances for Maoershan site, 3 for Caohekou site and 3 for Jinhe site. Correlation analysis showed that the 18 tested provenances displayed a “cold-warm” geographic variation pattern. Considering results from the correlation analysis and the clustering analysis, 5 provenance regions or seed zones were identified. © 2016, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

TI  - Numerical analysis of inter-specific relationships in Alpine steppe community in Bayanbulak
VL  - 32
IS  - 6
SP  - 1898-1907
AB  - Highland ecosystems are believed to be of vital importance in ecological study, partly due to the rapid climate change worldwide and the highest sensitive feature of this special system, not only its productivity and biodiversity but also its inter-specific relationship, to environmental alterations. The Bayabulak Steppe distributes in the middle part of Tianshan Mountains, and is situated at 42°18 ́-43°34 ́ N, 82°27 ́-86°17 ́ E with altitude between 2460-2760 m. Climate here belongs to typical alpine cold climate with yearly mean temperature of -4. 8 °C, yearly mean precipitation here is 276. 2 mm, yearly evaporation is (1 135. 2±112. 3) mm, the snow period in Bayabulak is about 150-180d, and there is no frostfree time in this region. Stipa purpurea and Festuca ovina grassland are the dominant vegetation types in our study site. In order to clarify the species composition and inter-specific association of the alpine grassland community of Bayanbulak in Xinjiang, China, variance ratio (VR) of the overall association, association coefficient (AC), Ochiai index (OI) and Spearman rank correlation coefficient, based on the 2 × 2 contingency table, were used in our quantitative analysis. Field data were collected in July 2009. Three parallel transect were firstly set up and the distance between each of them was 50 m, then 20 plots (0. 50 m × 0. 50 m for each unit) were randomly set within each transect, in so doing total of 60 plots were involved in the present work. Our results showed that: 1) There are 36 species with 14 common species of plants in Bayinbulak alpine steppe, and they belong to 26 Genus of 16 Family. W = 61. 52, a statistic index to test whether the VR is significant or not, indicated that the overall correlation of all plant species was positive but not significant. 2) Inter-specific associations of keystone species with others were neutral or not significant. Keystone species showed greater independence and occupied prior ecological niche in the community, and their distributions were not susceptible to other species. Values of OI were basically identical to those of association coefficient; Based on the measuring of OI, 19. 79% of total 91species-pairs composed by 14 common species was significant or very significant, and 72. 21% of them showed positive correlation while 27. 79% showed negative correlation for those significantly related species-pairs; 3) Inter-specific associations of accompanying species or weeds with others were significant (negative or positive), suggesting higher dependency of accompanying species or weeds on other species, namely they were susceptible to other species and only occupied inferior ecological niche in the community. Furthermore, populations of these plant species are instability in the process of ecosystem development; 4) This study provides new dimensions for the theory of species association. According to their adaptability to the environment and the relationships between plants and environment, the 14 common species were divided into three ecological species groups. Positive correlations occurred among the species in the same ecological species groups, while the negative correlations were found in the different ecological species groups. It mainly due to their different biological features induced by different adaptability to habitats or separated niches; 5) Several suggestions were proposed to promote the ecological restoration of degraded steppe systems in the study region.

TI  - Effect of storage parameters on stability of Jatropha-derived biodiesel
VL  - 4
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-9
AB  - Jatropha curcas L. seeds as a raw material for biodiesel production is a rapidly growing interest over the world because of its high oil content, ecological adaptability, and excellent fuel properties. Though there is an increase in productivity of biodiesel, showing solution for future energy insecurity, there still remains some concern for commercialization due to its susceptibility to degradation during long storage. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of temperature and ambient condition on Jatropha biodiesel storage. An experiment was conducted for a period of 12 months, where Jatropha biodiesel stored in three groups at different temperatures (4°C, 25°C, and 35°C) and environmental conditions (exposed in dark, light, and air). At regular intervals, the samples were taken out to analyze acid value, density, kinematic viscosity, and thermogravimetric profile to monitor the quality of biodiesel. Analysis showed that acid value, density, kinematic viscosity, and the onset temperature of volatilization and distillation increases with the increase in storage time of biodiesel samples. However, Jatropha biodiesel stored at 35°C, in contact with ambient air and light showed highest degradation compared to those which were stored at 25°C and 4°C. Among all the parameters studied, high temperature and air exposure are the two most potent parameters which accelerate the degradation process. Along with that, light exposure had mild but significant effect on Jatropha biodiesel degradation over a long storage period. © 2013 Mazumdar et al.; licensee Springer.

TI  - Numerical simulation of the hydrodynamics of a fluidized bed combined with an entrained bed gasifier
VL  - 3
SP  - 2048-2057
AB  - The ash agglomerating fluidized bed (AFB) coal gasification process, developed by the Institute of Coal Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, has the advantages of moderate operation temperature, lower oxygen consumption, lower operation cost, higher coal adaptability, and especially the fitness to coals of high ash content and high ash fusion temperature. The commercial pressured AFB gasifier (300t/d, 0.6MPa) have been put into operation for the ammonia and methanol synthesis. However, the carbon conversion (∼90%) still has the potential to be highly improved by increasing the gasification efficiency of fly ash with high carbon content and low reactivity. Therefore, a new concept for coal gasification was evolved for coal gasification, combining the fluidized bed gasifier and the entrained flow gasifier into one unit. The combined gasifier can gasify feedstock with higher reactivity in the fluidized bed and further gasify fly ash with lower reactivity in the entrained flow bed at higher temperature (∼1200°C). The preliminary experiments have been carried out to confirm its feasibility. The present work aims to establish a rational mathematic model to simulate the fluidization dynamics to assist with the design, operation and scale-up of the gasifier. The CFD model is established base on the results from the simulation on the entrained flow bed and the fluidized bed. The advanced hybrid grid technology was used to build the numerical mesh. A series of simulation works were carried out using the CFD model established for the pilot scale coal gasifier. The gas-solid flow field, particle distribution, the mutual influence of the gas and particle flow between the entrained flow bed and the fluidized bed were discussed in detailed.

AB  - Reproductive behavior of Opistognathus rosenblatti (Perciformes: Opistognathidae) in captivity. The Blue Spotted Jawfish O. rosenblatti, is an endemic species from the Gulf of California, included in the local list of protected species. With few biological reports, this species is appreciated in the aquarium industry due to its coloration and digging behaviour, and has a considerable value. With the aim to generate valuable biological information, eight fishes were caught at Loreto Natural Marine Protected Area. Captured fishes were juveniles, and just three of them were kept in an aquarium conditioned with gravel, pieces of shells and coral as substrata. Temperature and photoperiod conditions were stable, and they were supplied with a variety of live and inert feeds. Fishes reached maturity in eight months, according to literature reports, displaying mature male courtship coloration and upward movements in the water column. Fishes spawned several times over more than two years in captivity. Presences of egg masses, or some evidence of egg shell or larvae, were registered in 50 occasions. Male took care of eggs in his shelter, but never in his mouth. Egg masses had an average of 3 592 eggs, with a hatching rate close to 99%. Eggs were apparently rounded having three diameter measurements with significant differences (1.17mm mean higher diameter, SD=0.054; 1.13mm mean lower diameter, 0.058; 0.99mm mean height, 0.045; n=125). Most of corion eggs had four, rarely six filaments; with a single oil drop (0.30mm mean diameter, 0.021, n=59). Incubation lasted 10.4 days (9-14), depending on water temperature (21.0-25.3 degrees C). Egg hatching occurred after darkness, emerging newly hatched larvae of 4.51mm mean notochord length (0.082, n=30), with reserves exhausted, eyes pigmented and mouth opened, ready to eat. This study represents the first report on this species courtship displaying, spawning and some basic characteristics of eggs masses and larvae in captivity. Also, their flexibility and adaptability of individual behaviour to particular environment conditions, lead to consider worth their commercial culture, as already occur with other species of this family.

VL  - 34

SP  - 479-486
AB  - In the present study we used both cytogenetics (measurement of DNA content, detection of chromosome number, observation of gonadal development)and molecular genetics(microsatellite analysis)to analyze the biological characteristics of gynogenetic M. amblycephala, which werecreatedthrough gynogenesis induced via UV-irradiated E. ilishaeformis spermatozoa to fertilize M. amblycephala eggs. The maternal genome was duplicated by cold shock in 0~4 cold water to form a population of M. amblycephala with 48 chromosomes whose DNA content was identical to the diploid maternal parent. Morphologically, this group of gynogenetic M. amblycephala was similar to the control group. All gynogenetic M. amblycephala were female, and no males were found in any of the examined gynogenetic M. amblycephala, providing cytogenetic evidence that our gynogenetic M. amblycephala are type XY. At the same time, microsatellite analysis showed that 63 alleles were amplified in the three test groups of gynogenetic M. amblycephala. Overall, the population of gynogenetic M. amblycephala observed heterozygosity average, and the expected average was significantly lower than the parental averages, demonstrating that after generation gynogenesis the gene homozygosity of M. amblycephala was significantly higher than the ordinary bream and E. ilishaeformis, making it a pure line. The genetic proximity of gynogenetic M. amblycephala to M. amblycephala demonstrates that gynogenesis passes on maternal DNA. Gynogenetic groups developed in this study may provide good genetic material for future breeding projects of M. amblycephala.

VL  - 195

AB  - Wilhelm Weinberg (1862-1937) is a largely forgotten pioneer of human and medical genetics. His name is linked with that of the English mathematician G. H. Hardy in the Hardy-Weinberg law, pervasive in textbooks on population genetics since it expresses stability over generations of zygote frequencies AA, Aa, aa under random mating. One of Weinberg's signal contributions, in an article whose centenary we celebrate, was to verify that Mendel's segregation law still held in the setting of human heredity, contrary to the then-prevailing view of William Bateson (1861-1926), the leading Mendelian geneticist of the time. Specifically, Weinberg verified that the proportion of recessive offspring genotypes aa in human parental crossings Aa × Aa (that is, the segregation ratio for such a setting) was indeed p = 1/4. We focus in a nontechnical way on his procedure, called the simple sib method, and on the heated controversy with Felix Bernstein (1878-1956) in the 1920s and 1930s over work stimulated by Weinberg's article. © 2013 by the Genetics Society of America.

AB  - Objective: The leaf phenotypic traits of an endangered plant Tetracentron sinense were measured to understand the phenotypic variation. The purpose is to discuss the mechanism causing its endangering from the perspective of genetics and the ability to adapt to hostile conditions in order to provide some references for effective conservation and management. Method: Seventeen leaf morphological characteristics and leaf epidermis micromorphological characteristics from 90 individuals of fourteen populations were measured. Nested analysis of variance, multi-comparison, principal components analysis, cluster analysis, and correlation analysis were used to study the leaf phenotypic variation and its relation to environmental factors. Result: (1) Analysis of nested variance for all the traits showed significant differences among and within populations. (2) The mean phenotypic differentiation coefficient for all the traits was 46.69%, and the variation within populations (31.83%) was higher than that among populations (28.85%), indicating that the variance within population is the main source of the phenotypic variation of the species. (3) The range of variation of coefficient of variance among the 17 traits was 4.17%~26.25%, and the average was 12.56%. (4) The leaf phenotypic variation of T. Sinense was related to the environmental factors, such as mean annual sunshine duration, mean temperature in July, and mean annual precipitation. The gradient rule of leaf phenotypic characteristics is presented along with longitude, latitude and altitude. (5) According to the cluster analysis based on the results of principal components analysis, the 14 natural populations of T. sinense could be divided into three groups. Conclusion: There were moderate level of phenotypic differentiation among populations and low level of phenotypic variation within populations. The decreasing distribution range and poorer adaptability to changing environment were the main factors influencing the survival of T. sinense. According to above conclusions, some corresponding conservation measures were proposed to protect natural populations of T. sinense. © 2016, Chinese Academy of Forestry. All right reserved.

AB  - Capacity acclimation is a measurement of understanding the degree of adaptation that take place in physiological activities or biological functions in altered environmental conditions. Precht and Prosser in different ways classified capacity acclimation due to alterations of environmental temperature with respect to various physiological processes in a variety of organisms. We hypothesized that the same may be applied to understand the degree of adaptation in various physiological processes of organisms due to change in the salinity or any other environmental parameters. In order to understand the adaptive capability or the degree of compensation in different saline environment in some of the physiological processes of chloride cells, the chloride cells from 1 psu and or 35 psu acclimated crabs were cultured further in vitro, in L-15 media maintained with 12 psu salinity for another 5 h without any mortality. Rate of ion transport across the chloride cell membrane, and the activity of ion transporting enzyme were recorded. Over compensation or perfect compensation in the transport rate of K+, Na+ and Ca++ ions, due to hypo saline as well as hyper saline acclimation, clearly indicates their role in maintaining the homeostasis in osmoregulatory processes during salinity adaptation. On the other hand, inverse compensation or partial compensation in the transport rate of Cl− ions and the activity of ATPases indicate about their involvement in adjusting the osmoregulatory processes in altered saline environment rather that contributing to adaptability processes during change in the environmental salinity. © 2015, Zoological Society, Kolkata, India.

TI  - Regional biosolids recycling with negative carbon power oxidation
AB  - Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) generate residue that can be mechanically dewatered to a total solids content of 20-25% solids. The residue is referred to as raw sludge, if it is not stabilized, or as Class A or Class B biosolids, depending on the level of stabilization provided at the WWTP. Class B material is often driven 50-100 miles to a landfill disposal site or to agricultural sites for spreading (weather permitting). As regulations become more restrictive, limiting landfilling and land spreading, more Class B material is sent to centralized composting or drying facilities for further processing to a Class A pathogen free product that can generally be used freely as a soil amendment or low grade organic fertilizer. The use of Class A biosolids as a fertilizer recycles macro and micro-nutrients in the biosolids and can improve the soil tilth that is often depleted after several generations of synthetic fertilizer use (from natural gas). On-site or regional biosolids processing to Class A quality via thermal drying using waste heat recovered from a novel cogeneration system design are described in this paper. Past practices to further stabilize biosolids (or raw sludge) have included incineration, which results in a permanent destruction of the nutrient rich material in exchange for a little electricity and/or thermal energy (steam, hot oil/water, etc.) today. This practice yields an ash product, which has some limited beneficial uses. Sometimes, ash contains elevated heavy metal levels which limit its use and require it to be landfilled. In many jurisdictions, permitting of a sludge or biosolids incineration system is inordinately complex and difficult to accomplish. Public policy in the USA is driving several environmentally sustainable solutions for biosolids, including landfill diversion and processing to Class A for beneficial reuse. As with many other sustainable public policies (solar photovoltaic power and natural gas transportation fuels), private industry often offers lower cost solutions than the status quo. This paper describes the system developed by RealEnergy, LLC, in partnership with Andritz and Dresser Rand/A Siemens Business that incorporates the Power Oxidation technology to deliver a lower cost biosolids processing option to meet these public policy drivers.

AB  - The adaptation of the animals, either temperate or tropical climate, is mainly related to physiology and its adaptation to the environment. When subjected to different air temperature and air humidity from the usual, these animals found in heat stress difficulty reproduction and production. The endocrine system is one of those responsible for controlling the stress response, and rapid and appropriate growth is one of the elements of greatest economic importance toward meat production, and more producers want to improve, to accelerate the production rate and decreasing production costs. Thus, the aim of this review was to evaluate, through research papers found in the literature, the influence of heat stress on the hormones of growth and reproduction in ruminants. It was observed that even in studies that do not consider the productive performance of the animals, the influence of these parameters is significant in the ambience and the degree of adaptation of the same. However, more research should be conducted in order to evaluate the production of animals of different species under the conditions of different regions, as well as search for alternatives to achieve the best animal production levels, either by finding the best way of introducing exotic breeds, or the possibility of bringing more comfort to the animals in their various productive and reproductive stages.

VL  - 102
IS  - 1
SP  - 9-15
AB  - The spotted stemborer, Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), is one of the most important insect pests attacking maize and sorghum in Ethiopia. Recent studies have indicated that the pest is spreading to new locations where it was not reported before. In the current study, laboratory investigations were carried out to determine the combined effect of different levels of relative humidity and temperature regimes on the development and fecundity of C. partellus, as these physical factors are known to play an important role in the life cycle of insects and adaptability to local climate. Developmental time, longevity, potential fecundity and realized fecundity of C. partellus were measured under controlled conditions. Three temperature regimes (22 degrees C, 26 degrees C and 30 degrees C) and three relative humidity levels (40%, 60% and 80%) were tested. It was found that temperature, relative humidity (RH) and their interaction significantly affected the developmental time, adult longevity, potential fecundity and realized fecundity of the pest. Developmental time was inversely related to temperature. Mean duration of C. partellus life cycle was 70.2 days at 22 degrees C and 80% RH, whereas it took only 26.5 days to complete its life cycle at 30 degrees C and 40% RH. Male and female longevity were similar in most cases. The adult life span ranged between 6.9-11.1 days at 22 degrees C and 3.1-7.2 days at 30 degrees C for different levels of relative humidity. The most suitable conditions for C. partellus development and fecundity were 26-30 degrees C temperatures regimes and 60-80% RH levels.

VL  - 31

SP  - 3384-3390
AB  - The study of coupled relation between grasshopper and vegetation could help revealing the habitat selection and adaptability of the grasshopper and collaborative relationship within populations. The experiment was conducted in the Baidaban grassland which is located in upper reaches of Heihe of the north Qilian Mountain (38°48′0″-38°49′ 50″N, 99°37′15″-99°39′0″E), with the altitude of 2400-2800 m and annual temperature of 1. 8 °C. The annual precipitation of this region varies within a range of 270-350 mm, and the soil is mainly consisted of chestnut and chernozem soil. Xerophytic perennial grasses and mesohydriphytic bushes were the dominant native vegetation in this region. Variety of vegetation types lead to a rich biodiversity of grasshopper population by providing a heterogeneous habitat for the survival and reproduction of grasshopper. From June to August in 2009, 7 fixed observation plots (1hm2) along the elevation 50m were established. In each plot, 3-8 quadrates (20m×20m) were chosen according to typical location. In each quadrate, the pest-net (net diameter 30 cm) was used to seize grasshoppers by sweeping parallel 200 times, at the same time, vegetation community characteristics were investigated, including plant species richness, height, coverage and biomass. Thus the grasshopper species identification and quantitative statistics of grasshopper and plant variables were conducted in the laboratory. In this study, Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) were used to quantify the grasshopper population and analyze ecology relationship between grasshopper community spatial distribution pattern and vegetation community characteristic and domiant plant coverage. Besides, we analyzed the correlativity of grasshopper distibution number and dominant plant coverage. Results showed that a total of 1149 grasshoppers were collected, belonging to 3 families, 10 genera, 13 species. Oedaleus decoratus, Gomphocerus licenti and Chorthippus albonemus were the dominant species in this area. 13 species of grasshoppers were divided into six groups through DCA analysis. The number of grasshopper species, dominance, predatory behaviors and habitat choice of grasshopper are significantly different in those six groups. Meanwhile, no overlap was found within the same group in the hatch time, life form and tropic niche of grasshopper. The six grasshopper groups corresponded to different plant communities, and presented three kinds of correspondence relations, such as one-to-one correspondence relation between Chorthippus fallax and Stellera chamaejasme community; multiple-to-one correspondence of Oedaleus decorus, Myrmeleotettix palpalis and Filchnerella sunanensis with Artemisia dalailamae community; the rest of grasshopper community corresponded to multiple plant community types. There are three complex co-relationships between dominant plant coverage and grasshopper abundance, including extremely significant correlation, significant correlation and no correlation. Gramineae and Compositae plant have higher impact on the grasshopper distribution than other plants. Plant community affected grasshopper distribution pattern by providing food resource and proper habitat environment. The study of spatial distribution pattern and quantitative ecology relations between grasshoper and plant community and dominant plant, and the determination of the grasshoper species that most likely to have disaster in each plant community might be useful for predicting the grasshopper infestation and providing advices for grasshopper infestation control.

AB  - Non-native populations of Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg 1793) are established around the United Kingdom (UK), with two genetically different stocks originating from separate introductions to the UK and France. In this study, we use a coupled biophysical model to simulate Pacific oyster larval transport, in order to investigate the dispersal of the species from a known population near their northern limit on the west coast of the UK (in the Milford Haven Estuary). The model included a pelagic phase, simulating different swimming behaviours, and a settlement phase based on a hydrospatial substrate map. Following successful settlement elsewhere, subsequent releases simulated potential population spread over successive generations. Our results suggest that, should there be sufficiently warm sea temperatures to allow reproduction, dispersal away from Milford Haven Estuary would most be southeast ward towards the Bristol Channel; but dispersal north and west to Ireland is also possible, depending heavily on pelagic swimming behaviour. Seasonal modifications to circulation were less influential. Our study increases understanding of factors that contribute to oyster population spread, and suggests methods for improved management through numerical predictions. © 2017 The Author(s). and 2017 REABIC.

TI  - The early stress responses in fish larvae
VL  - 118
IS  - 4
SP  - 443-449
AB  - During the life cycle of fish the larval stages are the most interesting and variable. Teleost larvae undergo a daily increase in adaptability and many organs differentiate and become active. These processes are concerted and require an early neuro-immune-endocrine integration. In larvae communication among the nervous, endocrine and immune systems utilizes several known signal molecule families which could be different from those of the adult fish. The immune-neuroendocrine system was studied in several fish species, among which in particular the sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), that is a species of great commercial interest, very important in aquaculture and thus highly studied. Indeed the immune system of this species is the best known among marine teleosts. In this review the data on main signal molecules of stress carried out on larvae of fish are considered and discussed. For sea bass active roles in the early immunological responses of some well-known molecules involved in the stress, such as ACTH, nitric oxide, CRF, HSP-70 and cortisol have been proposed. These molecules and/or their receptors are biologically active mainly in the gut before complete differentiation of gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), probably acting in an autocrine/paracrine way. An intriguing idea emerges from all results of these researches; the molecules involved in stress responses, expressed in the adult cells of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, during the larval life of fish are present in several other localizations, where they perform probably the same role. It may be hypothesized that the functions performed by hypothalamic-pituitary system are particularly important for the survival of the larva and therefore they comprises several other localizations of body. Indeed the larval stages of fish are very crucial phases that include many physiological changes and several possible stress both internal and environmental. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Plateau wetland provides an ecological protection barrier for the safety of watershed. As appearance of global climate warming and climatic anomaly, to understand the physiological and biochemical response of aquatic plants in the plateau region to the climate change and the harms under the temperature stress is critical for maintaining the plateau ecosystem and dealing with the climate change. 4 dominant plant species of Scirpus tabernaemontani, Zizania caduciflora and Heleocharis liouana, Sparganium simplex with their original soils in the lakeside of Napahai, a typical wetland in plateau region of northwestern Yunnan were selected to study the impacts of regional climate condition variations on physiological and biochemical properties of those plants. Got with local climate conditions of Napahai in Shangrila those plants with their growing soils were removed as a soil-plant unit to Lashi Lake in Lijiang and Dianchi watershed in Kunming where the climate conditions are different. Comparing with original growing area, the variations of index of physiological and biochemical to indicate adversity stress, including MDA, Pro, SS and POD were analyzed under the impacts of climatic change. The results showed that even though wetland plant is azonal plant but affected significantly by the climate change and the response to the climate change was different from plants. Such widespread species as Scirpus tabernaemontani and Zizania caduciflora could well adapt to climate warming and grow better. With temperature rise, both of their biomass increased to 196% and 190% in Lashihai Lake and 487% and 408% in Dianchi watershed, respectively. But content of MDA, Pro,POD all fell from 16%, 27%, 14% in Lashi Lake to 31%, 52%, 48% in Dianchi watershed for Scirpus tabernaemontani, and 24%, 12%, 58% in Lashihai Lake to 24%, 25%, 73% in Dianchi watershed for Zizania caduciflora, respectively. In spite of the stress of climate change, Heleocharis liouana, another widespread species could resist the alterability through its own metabolic regulations, which reflected the strong climate adaptability of widespread species. By contrast, Sparganium simplex, a narrowly spread species sustained great damage for it was too sensitive to the climate change. With the temperature rise the biomass rising at beginning to 17% in Lashihai Lake, and then dropped to 20% in Dianchi watershed. MDA and Pro decreased at beginning to 0. 001387 µmol/g and 13. 386891 µg/g, and then increased to 0.002739 µmol/g and 18.172878 µg/g, respectively. For such a narrow distribution species, it would face the survival crisis along with the change of the climate conditions. That reflected the fragility of plateau wetland ecosystem and its importance under global warming. Thus, the potential ecological risk behind the maintaining of plateau wetland ecosystem was revealed. © 2014 Science Press. All rights reserved.

TI  - Transgenerational plasticity following a dual pathogen and stress challenge in fruit flies
VL  - 16
IS  - 1
AB  - Background: Phenotypic plasticity operates across generations, when the parental environment affects phenotypic expression in the offspring. Recent studies in invertebrates have reported transgenerational plasticity in phenotypic responses of offspring when the mothers had been previously exposed to either live or heat-killed pathogens. Understanding whether this plasticity is adaptive requires a factorial design in which both mothers and their offspring are subjected to either the pathogen challenge or a control, in experimentally matched and mismatched combinations. Most prior studies exploring the capacity for pathogen-mediated transgenerational plasticity have, however, failed to adopt such a design. Furthermore, it is currently poorly understood whether the magnitude or direction of pathogen-mediated transgenerational responses will be sensitive to environmental heterogeneity. Here, we explored the transgenerational consequences of a dual pathogen and stress challenge administered in the maternal generation in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Prospective mothers were assigned to a non-infectious pathogen treatment consisting of an injection with heat-killed bacteria or a procedural control, and a stress treatment consisting of sleep deprivation or control. Their daughters and sons were similarly assigned to the same pathogen treatment, prior to measurement of their reproductive success. Results: We observed transgenerational interactions involving pathogen treatments of mothers and their offspring, on the reproductive success of daughters but not sons. These interactions were unaffected by sleep deprivation. Conclusions: The direction of the transgenerational effects was not consistent with that predicted under a scenario of adaptive transgenerational plasticity. Instead, they were indicative of expectations based on terminal investment. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Marine organisms need to adapt in order to cope with the adverse effects of ocean acidification and warming. Transgenerational exposure to CO2 stress has been shown to enhance resilience to ocean acidification in offspring from a number of species. However, the molecular basis underlying such adaptive responses is currently unknown. Here, we compared the transcriptional profiles of two genetically distinct oyster breeding lines following transgenerational exposure to elevated CO2 in order to explore the molecular basis of acclimation or adaptation to ocean acidification in these organisms. The expression of key target genes associated with antioxidant defence, metabolism and the cytoskeleton was assessed in oysters exposed to elevated CO2 over three consecutive generations. This set of target genes was chosen specifically to test whether altered responsiveness of intracellular stress mechanisms contributes to the differential acclimation of oyster populations to climate stressors. Transgenerational exposure to elevated CO2 resulted in changes to both basal and inducible expression of those key target genes (e.g. ecSOD, catalase and peroxiredoxin 6), particularly in oysters derived from the disease-resistant, fast-growing B2 line. Exposure to CO2 stress over consecutive generations produced opposite and less evident effects on transcription in a second population that was derived from wild-type (nonselected) oysters. The analysis of key target genes revealed that the acute responses of oysters to CO2 stress appear to be affected by population-specific genetic and/or phenotypic traits and by the CO2 conditions to which their parents had been exposed. This supports the contention that the capacity for heritable change in response to ocean acidification varies between oyster breeding lines and is mediated by parental conditioning. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Sustainable agriculture is the only solution to both meet human needs and conserve natural resources to maintain and improve the environment. To achieve all this, however, requires greater research into cereal production the economic efficiency of this sector. The research over the period 2007-2009 was designed to establish the adaptability on various systems of soil mechanic works and different doses of fertilizer of maize hybrids by applying classical and conservative technologies, agricultural technologies less pollutant in the Big Island of Braila, agricultural technologies what can ameliorate physical, chemical and biological parameters of soil. The poly-factorial type 2x2x3 experiment used two hybrids of maize (PR36R10 and PR36R11), two tillage systems (traditional and conservative) and 3 doses of fertilizer (unfertilized, N50P0, N100P0); the experiment was done on a eutric gleiosol, soil characteristic of the analyzed ecosystem. By introducing averages obtained during the three study years in the analysis of production variance, statistical interpretation was concluded that the production fluctuations from year to year were high, and the combination of factors is significant. Following statistical interpretation of results, the evolution of the average productions, average quantity of grain maize obtained were shown to have a significant decreased in 2007, due to drought and high temperatures during pollination. This had led to the disruption of the grain formation process. From the analysis of the influence of the tillage system on production, significant increases between the PR36R10 hybrid and the control variant (0.48 - 0.68 t/ha,). Comparison of the classic system and the conservative system showed one influenced less the grain production, both for PR36R10 hybrid and the PR36R11 hybrid. Following the productions in terms of N dose application, in comparison to the dose of fertilization which took effect obviously on production, the system of mechanical work of the soil influenced insignificant production of grain maize obtained it was found that production increased by up to 1320 kg/ha in comparison with the control variant, without fertilization, liming on the basis of nitrogen have led to advancements in production. Variants treated with fertilizer 100 kg N active substance have had increase in higher production with 583 kg/ha, compared with variants treated with fertilizer - 50 kg active substance N.

TI  - Analysis of source and sink dynamics involved in oil and protein accumulation in sunflower achenes using a bi-linear model
VL  - 201
SP  - 200-209
AB  - Most recent mechanistic crop models are based on source-sink relationships. To build a conceptual framework for achene quality traits in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L), source-sink relationships were investigated in contrasting environments. Two experiments were performed under field conditions in 2011 and 2012. Oil, protein, hull (sink), leaves, receptacles and stems (source) were measured weekly under contrasting nitrogen (N : no fertilization; N+: 150 kg N per ha), plant density (3 and 4.5 plants per m(2)) and genotype (cv. Kerbel, cv. LG5451 HO and cv. Olledy) treatments. A bi-linear model was fitted to source and sink component dry weight (DW) dynamics per m(2). Nitrogen and plant density influenced rates and duration of all source and sink dynamics, while genotype had a significant influence on timing parameters. More significant factor interactions were found in 2011 than in 2012, probably because of other factors that occurred or interacted during grain filling (water stress and/or thermal stress). We constructed a robust source-sink framework for oil and protein accumulation in relation to remobilization processes. The observed "source" chronology was receptacles, stems and green leaves, and we confirmed the "sink" chronology of receptacles, hulls, protein and oil. Chronologies were influenced mostly by genotype. Such a framework is highly useful for dynamic modeling of sunflower. We also discuss the relevance and adaptability of the bi-linear model.

VL  - 23

SP  - 809-817
AB  - Hydrogels are three-dimensional polymeric networks with segments of hydrophilic groups. Stimuli-responsive hydrogels have played attractive role toward much research due to slight modification of environment by abrupt changes in swelling behavior. In this study, a series of pH-sensitive biocomposite hydrogels were acquired through solvent-free green approach by utilization of diethylene glycol (DEG), citric acid (CA), acrylic acid (AA) and hydroxyapatite (HA). Incorporation of hydroxyapatite (HA) prepared from waste eggshells with ACD resulted in the biocomposite hydrogel (ACD–HA). The synthesized biocomposite hydrogel was examined by various characterization techniques, viz., spectral (FTIR), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, thermal (TGA and DTG), morphological (SEM) and swelling equilibrium studies. In addition, HA was surface treated with two different silane-based coupling agents, namely 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (AMS) and vinyltriethoxysilane (VES) on the performance properties of biocomposite hydrogels. The results of the studies revealed that VES-treated ACD–HA had superior properties than AMS-treated ACD–HA and untreated ACD–HA on overall properties of biocomposite hydrogels. Hence, the decreasing order of swelling equilibrium behavior in various pH, viz., 4.0, 6.0, 7.4, 8.0, 10.0, has been listed as ACD–HA–VES > ACD–HA–AMS > ACD–HA > ACD. The observations indicated that hydrogels’ adaptability with pH-tuned properties may have greater potential in eco-friendly approaches such as metal ion removal, dye removal and agrochemical release. © 2014, Iran Polymer and Petrochemical Institute.

AB  - Penicillium citrimim was mutagenized by UV-irradiation and a high dye-decolorization mutant Z3 was obtained. Its optimal growth conditions and dye decolorizing ability were studied. According to the orthogonal experiments, carbon source was the key to the growth of the strain Z3, with temperature, nitrogen source, pH value having much less effect than carbon source and had the similar effect. The best growth condition of strain Z3 was that temperature was 30°C, pH was 7, carbon source was sucrose, and nitrogen source was sodium nitrate. The malachite green decolorization rate of strain Z3 is higher than that of strain Z0, increased by 18% in comparison with Z0. Stain Z3 keeps stable after 8 generations of reproduction, which displays perfect genetic stability. © 2011 IEEE.

VL  - 12

SP  - 480-497
AB  - Imidacloprid-induced hormesis in the form of stimulated reproduction has previously been reported in green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. Changes in gene expression accompanying this hormetic response have not been previously investigated. In this study, expression of stress response (Hsp60), dispersal (OSD, TOL and ANT), and developmental (FPPS I) genes were examined for two generations during imidacloprid-induced reproductive stimulation in M. persicae. Global DNA methylation was also measured to test the hypothesis that changes in gene expression are heritable. At hormetic concentrations, down-regulation of Hsp60was followed by up-regulation of this gene in the subsequent generation. Likewise, expression of dispersal-related genes and FPPS I varied with concentration, life stage, and generation. These results indicate that reproductive hormesis in M. persicae is accompanied by a complex transgenerational pattern of up- and down-regulation of genes that likely reflects trade-offs in gene expression and related physiological processes during the phenotypic dose-response. Moreover, DNA methylation in second generation M. persicae occurred at higher doses than in first-generation aphids, suggesting that heritable adaptability to low doses of the stressor might have occurred. © 2014 University of Massachusetts.

TI  - Microcosm experiments for evaluating natural bioremediation of contaminated ecosystems
VL  - 28
SP  - 7-12
AB  - Microorganisms play a key role not only in biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem energy flow but also in maintaining ecosystem environmental quality. In fact, natural microbial communities harbour an amazing physiological versatility and catabolic potential for the breakdown of an enormous number of organic molecules, including synthetic compounds, thanks to their great adaptability to different conditions. They are able to colonize contaminated sites and metabolize some recalcitrant xenobiotics, for example pesticides and pharmaceuticals. In this way, microbial communities represent an important key to understanding the impacts of environmental and anthropogenic factors on ecosystems. Pollution may influence soil and water quality and productivity, but little is known on the effects on microbial communities, and consequent impacts on its functioning. Miniaturized ecosystems (microcosms) provide the advantage of allowing researchers to investigate under controlled conditions the effects of selective pressures, such as xenobiotic occurrence, on natural microbial communities. In this work we report the results of several microcosm studies, using natural soil and water samples, in which the environmental fate of several pesticides and pharmaceuticals in soil and water ecosystems has been evaluated. The natural attenuation capability of autochthonous microbial communities versus chemical contamination was evaluated comparing microbiologically active microcosms treated with each chemical with others previously sterilized. The degradation experiments were conducted under different natural conditions (e.g. temperature, light, humidity, etc.), including the occurrence of more stressors (e.g. co-presence of excess of nutrients or of other contaminants) in order to evaluate the fate and the effects of the chemicals in different environmental scenarios. The disappearance time of 50 % of the parent compound applied (DT50) was assessed for each chemical and condition. The overall results show the key role of microorganisms in the degradation of all chemicals studied and encourage the use of the microcosm approach for assessing more realistic environmental exposure scenarios and establishing the casual relationship between degradation and the role of microbial communities in chemical disappearance from the environment.

VL  - 154

SP  - R123-R131
AB  - Obesity, defined as excessive accumulation of fat in adipose tissue, is a metabolic disorder resulting from behavioral, environmental and heritable causes. Obesity increases the risks of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, respiratory problems, osteoarthritis and cancer. Meanwhile, the negative impact of obesity on male reproduction is gradually recognized. According to the clinical investigations and animal experiments, obesity is correlated with reductions in sperm concentration and motility, increase in sperm DNA damage and changes in reproductive hormones. Several mechanisms can elucidate the effects of obesity on sperm functions and male subfertility, i.e., the excessive conversion of androgens into estrogens in redundant adipose tissue causes sexual hormone imbalance, subsequently resulting in hypogonadism. Secondly, adipokines produced by adipose tissue induce severe inflammation and oxidative stress in male reproductive tract, directly impairing testicular and epididymal tissues. Moreover, increased scrotal adiposity leads to increase gonadal heat, continuously hurting spermatogenesis. Therefore, obesity alters the systematic and regional environment crucial for spermatogenesis in testis and sperm maturation in epididymis, and finally results in poor sperm quality including decreased sperm motility, abnormal sperm morphology and acrosome reaction, changed membrane lipids and increased DNA damage. Furthermore, recent studies indicate that epigenetic changes may be a consequence of increased adiposity. A major effort to identify epigenetic determinants of obesity revealed that sperm DNA methylation and non-coding RNA modification are associated with BMI changes and proposed to inherit metabolic comorbidities across generations. This review will explain how obesity-related changes in males to influence sperm function and male fertility as well. © 2017 Society for Reproduction and Fertility.

AB  - This is Part II of two papers evaluating the feasibility of providing all energy for all purposes (electric power, transportation, and heating/cooling), everywhere in the world, from wind, water, and the sun (WWS). In Part I, we described the prominent renewable energy plans that have been proposed and discussed the characteristics of WWS energy systems, the global demand for and availability of WWS energy, quantities and areas required for WWS infrastructure, and supplies of critical materials. Here, we discuss methods of addressing the variability of WWS energy to ensure that power supply reliably matches demand (including interconnecting geographically dispersed resources, using hydroelectricity, using demand-response management, storing electric power on site, over-sizing peak generation capacity and producing hydrogen with the excess, storing electric power in vehicle batteries, and forecasting weather to project energy supplies), the economics of WWS generation and transmission, the economics of WWS use in transportation, and policy measures needed to enhance the viability of a WWS system. We find that the cost of energy in a 100% WWS will be similar to the cost today. We conclude that barriers to a 100% conversion to WWS power worldwide are primarily social and political, not technological or even economic. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Is the 'Lost World' Lost? High endemism of aphibians and reptiles on South American tepuís in a changing climate
SP  - 401-416
AB  - The Pantepuí region of the Guyana Shield of Northern South America harbors a unique biota. It is characterized by high local species endemism, especially applicable to its table mountain-like outcrops, the tepuís. For this region, also known as the 'Lost World', different hypotheses have been proposed to explain its Biogeography. We suggest that the amphibian and reptile communities' suit well as target group to study the hypotheses since these vertebrates are relatively well documented through comprehensive species lists and are less mobile than other terrestrial vertebrates. However, records for the majority of endemic amphibian and reptile species naturally numbered only a few. We hence used extant dimensions of the vegetation zones associated to amphibians and reptiles. By running maximum entropy-based Climate Envelope Distribution Models (CEDM), these were projected to climatic scenarios as suggested for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21,000 years BP). Our results promote the Cool Climate hypothesis for diversity and distribution of amphibians and reptile communities in the Pantepuí region, in which species' geographic ranges were displaced followed by speciation along with the climate change during glacial-interglacial Quaternary cycles. Moreover, we studied the impact of expected future anthropogenic global warming on these vegetation zones. Climate change scenarios used, consider demographic, politico-economic, social and technological futures at different degrees with either more or less environmentally conscious, regionalized solutions to economic, social and environmental sustainability. For the 'Lost World', our CEDM results demonstrated a strong impact of climate change to vegetation zones resulting in a considerable decrease during future anthropogenic global warming in terms of habitat suitability. For amphibians and reptiles this may mean habitat loss and decline or extinction. However, nothing is known about specific climatic niche breadths (which may be great due to survival under climatic conditions with considerable daily change) or the possibility to adapt over generations (which may be unlikely due to the rapid warming expected) of Pantepuí amphibians and reptiles.

TI  - Development and test of 4PZ-1 self-propelled wine grape harvester
VL  - 33
IS  - 1
SP  - 38-44
AB  - At present, the wine grape harvest in Xinjiang totally depends on labor, which seriously restricts the development of the wine grape industry, and therefore, its harvesting mechanization has become an inexorable tendency. In addition, the wine grapevines in Xinjiang need to be buried to resist the cold in winter, its tree style is multiple-trunk fan-shaped while the style of foreign wine grape tree is trunk-shaped primarily, and there are large differences in fruit distribution and vibration transmission attenuation between them. Thus, the foreign wine grape harvesting machine can't be directly applied to the harvest of wine grape in Xinjiang. To solve these problems, a self-propelled grape harvester was designed and manufactured. The harvester operates with one line at a time, and can complete many jobs such as separation, conveying, cleaning and collection of wine grape at one time. It is mainly composed of shaking separation mechanism, collecting and conveying mechanism and self-propelled hydraulic chassis, and all parts of the harvester are powered hydraulically. In order to get better harvesting effect, the way driving the end of the rib components in the shaking separation mechanism is used to achieve one kind of shaking effect with large amplitude and little disorder, which can overcome the issue that wine grapevines in Xinjiang have the fast vibration energy attenuation and low transfer efficiency. Combining the kinematic and dynamic analysis for the shaking separation mechanism's key components and preliminary experimental study of the shaking separation test apparatus on the wine grape harvesting, the optimal working combination parameters of the shaking separation were determined. When the collecting and conveying mechanism works, 2 rows of symmetrical guide-supported double hinge chains are driven to do rotary motion and take both sides of the hoppers to collect and convey the grape fruits to the bins. The hoppers on the double hinge chains are made of flexible material and tightly meshed with each other in order to avoid damage to the vines and fruit leakage respectively. The main structural parameters of the collecting and conveying mechanism were determined as follows: the length and width of the hopper bottom area were 1 200 and 800 mm respectively, and each receiving hopper's volume was 0.08 m3. The main function of the self-propelled hydraulic chassis is providing power for the harvester and adjusting the harvester's operating parameters. The driving four wheels and steering front-wheel are used in the self-propelled hydraulic chassis, and its four wheels utilize the folding lift mechanism; in this way, the harvester's flexibility and adaptability in the field are improved. Finally, the harvester's field performance was tested. The test results showed that when the terrain was flat and the grape sugar content reached 18%, the harvester achieved the best harvesting effect at the 2 km/h working speed. At this speed, the average productivity was 0.6 hm2/h, the fruit average recovery rate reached 93.8% and the fruit average broken rate was less than 9.3%. The average productivity and fruit average recovery rate of this harvester have approached the level of foreign wine grape harvester basically, but the fruit average broken rate is relatively high. This is because the fruit distribution of Xinjiang wine grape is scattered, which increases the odds that the vibration ribs touch the grapes. However, the harvester gives the relatively poor harvest stability and reliability, and displays the high impurity rate; and this test also finds that some viticulture agronomy is not conducive to the mechanized harvesting for wine grape. The later work is mainly to improve and optimize the whole harvester structure to enhance the harvester's performance and harvest quality. This research provides a reference for promoting the localization process of wine grape harvest machine in China. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

SP  - 603-665
AB  - Over 12.2 million hectares of turfgrass are managed in America (Table 1).These turfgrass areas contribute to our lives through a variety of functional, aesthetic, and recreational roles. Turfgrass provides soil stabilization, dust, and erosion control; clean, cool air; a recreational surface; and ornamentation to businesses, homes, and parks. Turfgrass management consists of all activities that influence the growth and maintenance of the grass. Proper management must consider and respond to biological conditions such as turf type, fertility, wear, pest problems, and environmental conditions such as light, rain, drought, shade, temperature fluctuations, snow, and ice. Weeds reduce the erosion control and cooling effects of turf, the visual aesthetics of parks and gardens, and the playability of golf courses and athletic fields. Because of their adaptability weeds quickly fill in open areas left by soil fertility or pH problems, insect or disease problems, shady or droughty areas, and newly seeded turf. Many turfgrass management strategies have been designed to maximize turf growth 604and minimize the influence of weedy species. But, despite prescription fertilizer, optimized mowing, adapted turf types, disease and insect control programs, and pre- and postemergence herbicide programs, weeds continue to be a problem in turfgrass. © 1995 by Marcel Dekker, Inc.

VL  - 45
SP  - 95-99
AB  - A new automatic white balance algorithm was proposed, which could calculate the color modification coefficient according to the lightness in HSL color space. The HSL color space of an image was analyzed in order to divide the lightness into several segments and pixels in each segment were classified into one group. All pixels near to gray axis in the same group were figured out, the color modification coefficient was calculated based on the average value of color components of all pixels, and then the colors of all pixels in this group were modified according to the color modification coefficient. Image data for standard color card in several kinds of color temperature were captured and analyzed respectively according to automatic white balance algorithms, which include HSL gray axis method, gray world method and perfect reflector method. Color error between calculated results of standard cards was analyzed. The result showed that HSL gray axis method has much better light environment adaptability and better color reproduction capability.

VL  - 74

SP  - 810-820
AB  - Wetlands cover approximately 6% of the Earth´s surface. They are frequently found at the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and are strongly dependent on the water cycle. For this reason, wetlands are extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Mangroves and floodplain ecosystems are some of the most important environments for the Amazonian population, as a source of proteins and income, and are thus the types of wetlands chosen for this review. Some of the main consequences that can be predicted from climate change for wetlands are modifications in hydrological regimes, which can cause intense droughts or inundations. A possible reduction in rainfall can cause a decrease of the areas of mangroves and floodplains, with a consequent decline in their species numbers. Conversely, an increase in rainfall would probably cause the substitution of plant species, which would not be able to survive under new conditions for a long period. An elevation in water temperature on the floodplains would cause an increase in frequency and duration of hypoxic or anoxic episodes, which might further lead to a reduction in growth rates or the reproductive success of many species. In mangroves, an increase in water temperature would influence the sea level, causing losses of these environments through coastal erosion processes. Therefore, climate change will likely cause the loss of, or reduction in, Amazonian wetlands and will challenge the adaptability of species, composition and distribution, which will probably have consequences for the human population that depend on them. © 2014, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of appropriate technology
VL  - 78
SP  - 345-358
AB  - Economist Dr. E.F. Schumacher posited the concept of "Intermediate Technology" in his 1973 book Small is Beautiful, catalyzing the explosion of the appropriate technology (AT) movement. But how does one gauge the "appropriateness" of a technology? Quantitative assessment of AT can benefit sustainable community development (SCD) practitioners by way of decision-support and risk mitigation. The following research constructs a generalizable metric for quantitative assessment of AT, and develops a systematic process for its deployment. Forty-nine independent, emergent indicators of appropriateness were identified from a literature meta-analysis. The most prevalent indicators were as follows: community input, affordability, autonomy, transferability, community control, scalability, local availability of raw materials, and adaptability. Using these, a quantitative assessment tool was developed, called the Appropriate Technology Assessment Tool (ATAT). ATAT employs multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods to rank AT alternatives. In this way, inputs are aggregated using a weightedsum method, giving the composite Appropriateness Index, (AI(i)). Using VBA coding, the author built ATAT via a simple form populated by the identified indicators. The form automates all necessary calculations, facilitating empirically rigorous quantitative assessment of AT by non-technical SCD workers. AT is only as appropriate as beneficiaries deem. A participatory research approach requires community stakeholders to rank preferred criteria for AT, and rate alternatives against the chosen criteria. This approach makes the tool customizable to local conditions. Using the Mini-Delphi Method, stakeholder opinions translate to ATAT inputs. A local case in the Westwood neighborhood of Denver, Colorado is examined to test ATAT efficacy and process viability. Prior to this research, University of Colorado graduate students partnered with local 501(c)3 Revision International to reduce winter heating costs in Westwood using a solar furnace that locals dubbed "EZ Heat". ATAT quantified the appropriateness of EZ Heat as AI(i) = 4.2. This score lends empirical support to the AT's a priori deterministic selection. ATAT is designed to be free and accessible via Internet, and the author is investigating the potential of a mobile application. SCD and other community development practitioners often work in remote areas, and a mobile ATAT application will make the tool more useful. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

SP  - 227-240
AB  - Introduction: Planning infrastructure investment has historically been done in each infrastructure sector in isolation. However, infrastructure sectors are becoming increasingly interdependent due to technological advancements, climate policy and increasing cross-sector demands. Infrastructure interdependencies introduce layers of complexity, uncertainty and risk to systems planning and design. Infrastructure is rapidly shifting from unconnected structures to interconnected networks. This shift has important implications for the resilience and sustainability of the system. Even small, temporary failures can have significant effects on economic productivity. In the long term, these risks intensify as systems become larger and increasingly interdependent. The combined effect of ageing infrastructure, growing demand (nearing capacity limits) from social and economic pressures, interconnectivity and complexity can weaken infrastructure resilience and sustainability (Francis and Bekera, 2014). Importantly, changing patterns of demand can influence different infrastructure sectors in similar ways, providing a further source of interdependence in the long term. For example, reducing household water use can alleviate pressures on fresh water supply while decreasing the energy used for domestic water heating. Moreover, one infrastructure sector can be a major component of demand for another sector, where the transport sector, for example, represents 34% of energy demand in the Britain, whilst electricity generation is responsible for 32% of all non-tidal water abstractions (Defra, 2009). Future demand for infrastructure services will also impact upon the environment creating interdependency between sectors. Investment in water treatment may lead to quality improvements in rivers and coastal areas, but could then be offset by thermal cooling water discharges from future electricity production. While large electric vehicle fleets have the potential to mitigate environmental and carbon emissions from transport, this is dependent upon a commitment to investment in low carbon power generation. National infrastructure consumes over half the energy supply in most advanced economies and is a major source of carbon emissions (IPCC, 2014). Therefore, carbon emissions reduction in one sector may be offset by increases in another sector. Meeting increasing environmental standards and broader sustainability objectives therefore requires investment decisions that account for sector interdependencies. Extensive research has been done on the failure of interdependent critical infrastructure to deliver essential goods and services over the immediate to short term with important consequences for security and resilience (Ouyang, 2014). This issue is addressed in Chapter 12 of this book. However, less is known about how strategic decision-making can influence sectoral interdependencies and the resulting long-term consequences. © Cambridge University Press 2016.

AB  - Amirta R, Nafitri SI, Wulandari R, Yuliansyah, Suwinarti W, Candra KP, Watanabe T. 2016. Comparative characterization of Macaranga species collected from secondary forests in East Kalimantan for biorefinery of unutilized fast growing wood. Biodiversitas 17: 116-123. Wood species for industrial forest plantation has been selected to produce construction wood materials, boards and papers, and unutilized fast growing wood as a source for biofuel production has been out of the scope for selection. Macaranga Thouars (Euphorbiaceae) is widely distributed in the tropics and importance of the genus has been recognized due to its high level of growth rate and adaptability to constitute forest ecosystem. However, potency of the genus as a source for bioethanol production has not been systematically studied. We herein first report differential properties of six Macaranga wood species collected in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, as a raw feedstock for enzymatic saccharification for bioethanol production. Among the wood species examined, the highest sugar yield 48.6% (weight of original wood basis), which corresponds to 315 mL ethanol/kg biomass, was obtained with 5.0% NaOH at 160ºC for M. hypoleuca. Significant differences in the sensitivity to alkaline concentration and temperature have been found among the species. A high sugar yield, 40.4% was obtained for M. winkleri with a low alkaline concentration, 3.5% NaOH at 150ºC, while M. motleyana gave the sugar yield 12.8% under the same condition. M. motleyana required a set of the conditions with higher NaOH concentration 5.0% and temperatures over 160ºC. The harsh condition with 5.0% NaOH at 170ºC promoted delignification of all the species but M. hypoleuca decreased the saccharification yield by raising the temperature from 160ºC to 170ºC, probably due to decomposition of carbohydrate cores. This temperature-dependent negative effect was not observed with 3.5% NaOH for M. hypoleuca. These results indicate that differences in the balance between disintegration effects and excess degradation of carbohydrates are different among the species and the variation should be taken into account on screening. Thus, we found a wide range of diversity in the susceptibility to alkaline pretreatment in the genus Macaranga and selected the wood species giving high productivity of fermentable sugars. © Biodiversitas, 2012.

TI  - An integrated Traverse Planner and Analysis tool for planetary exploration
AB  - Future planetary explorations will require surface traverses of unprecedented frequency, length, and duration. As a result, there is need for exploration support tools to maximize productivity, scientific return, and safety. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is currently developing such a system, called the Surface Exploration Traverse Analysis and Navigation Tool (SEXTANT). The goal of this system is twofold: to allow for realistic simulations of traverses in order to assist with hardware design, and to give astronauts an aid that will allow for more autonomy in traverse planning and re-planning. SEXTANT is a MATLAB-based tool that incorporates a lunar elevation model created from data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter instrument aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft. To assist in traverse planning, SEXTANT determines the most efficient path across a planetary surface for astronauts or transportation rovers between user-specified Activity Points. The path efficiency is derived from any number of metrics: the traverse distance, traverse time, or the explorer's energy consumption. The generated path, display of traverse obstacles, and selection of Activity Points are visualized in a 3D mapping interface. After a traverse has been planned, SEXTANT is capable of computing the most efficient path back home, or "walkback", from any point along the traverse - an important capability for emergency operations. SEXTANT also has the ability to determine shadowed and sunlit areas along a lunar traverse. This data is used to compute the thermal load on suited astronauts and the solar power generation capacity of rovers over the entire traverse. These both relate directly to the explorer's consumables, which place strict constraints on the traverse. This paper concludes by presenting three example traverses, detailing how SEXTANT can be used to plan and modify paths for both explorer types. © 2010 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

TI  - The inheritance of intrasexual dimorphism in female diving beetles (Coleoptera: Dytiscidae)
VL  - 29
IS  - 8
SP  - 505-509
AB  - Many species of Dytiscus diving beetles exhibit intrasexual dimorphism, e.g., the elytra is smooth in some females and grooved in others. However, the expression of the grooves and whether they are a product of heredity or the environment remain unknown. One Japanese species, Dytiscus sharpi sharpi Wehncke, 1875, also shows female dimorphism, with grooved and smooth morphs, while D. sharpi validus Rgimbart, 1899, only has a single morph (the grooved type). A hybrid of the two species should therefore provide a means of sorting out how the grooves are inherited. We found two independent wetlands of D. sharpi sharpi in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. One was a place where a high proportion of grooved females lived, and the others had high proportions of smooth females. After five to eight generations of beetles from two populations with different proportions of grooved females were reared under aquarium conditions constituting a common garden design, i.e., water temperature, water depth, and presence of a plant for oviposition, the differences remained. We mated smooth virgin females of D. sharpi sharpi with males of D. sharpi validus to obtain hybrid offspring. The elytral traits of the hybrid females produced only grooved forms. These results suggested that the female dimorphism is determined by genetics, and that the grooved morph was dominant over the smooth one, independent of environmental factors. In addition, the hybrid insects did not differ from the two subspecies insects in larval survivorship, pupation success, or sex ratio. They also showed neither morphological abnormality nor reduced survival. © 2012 Zoological Society of Japan.

TI  - Telenomus remus (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) parasitism on eggs of anticarsia gemmatalis (Lepidoptera: Eribidae) compared with its natural host spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)
VL  - 107
IS  - 4
SP  - 799-808
AB  - The capacity of Telenomus remus to parasitize eggs of Anticarsia gemmatalis, compared with its natural host, Spodoptera frugiperda, was evaluated under different temperatures. The parasitoid T. remus was reared at 25 +/- 1 degrees C for a single generation on both hosts. After reaching the adult stage, they were allowed to parasitize both hosts to study parasitoid biology and parasitism capacity at temperatures between 19 degrees C and 37 +/- 1 degrees C. Egg-to-adult developmental time was similar on both hosts. The number of A. gemmatalis eggs parasitized was lower than that of S. frugiperda eggs at all temperatures. Parental female longevity of parasitoids was greater on A. gemmatalis eggs. This indicated a smaller metabolic expense during parasitism, a common feature observed on nonpreferable hosts. In general, sex ratio was little affected by temperature or hosts. When parental T. remus were reared on A. gemmatalis before the experiment, base temperature (Tb) and the thermal constant (K) were 9.53 degrees C and 209.57 DD on eggs of A. gemmatalis and 9.68 degrees C and 197.79 DD on eggs of S. frugiperda, respectively. When parental T. remus were reared on S. frugiperda eggs, Tb and K were 10.12 degrees C and 188.46 DD and 9.69 degrees C and 190.24 DD for the evaluated host eggs of A. gemmatalis and S. frugiperda, respectively. Therefore, T. remus develops in eggs of A. gemmatalis. This can be beneficial for its use in field crops where outbreaks of both Spodoptera spp. and A. gemmatalis occur. However, A. gemmatalis is a less favorable host for the parasitoid development.

VL  - 111

SP  - E4323-E4331
AB  - Germ cells are maintained in a pristine non-aging state as they proliferate over generations. Here, we show that a novel function of the Caenorhabditis elegans RNA interference proteins RNAi spreading defective (RSD)-2 and RSD-6 is to promote germ cell immortality at high temperature. rsd mutants cultured at high temperatures became progressively sterile and displayed loss of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that target spermatogenesis genes, simple repeats, and transposons. Desilencing of spermatogenesis genes occurred in late-generation rsd mutants, although defective spermatogenesis was insufficient to explain the majority of sterility. Increased expression of repetitive loci occurred in both germ and somatic cells of late-generation rsd mutant adults, suggesting that desilencing of many heterochromatic segments of the genome contributes to sterility. Nuclear RNAi defective (NRDE)-2 promotes nuclear silencing in response to exogenous double-stranded RNA, and our data imply that RSD-2, RSD-6, and NRDE-2 function in a common transgenerational nuclear silencing pathway that responds to endogenous siRNAs. We propose that RSD-2 and RSD-6 promote germ cell immortality at stressful temperatures by maintaining transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of endogenous siRNA populations that promote genome silencing.

TI  - Fundamental study on extracting vanadium from vanadium-bearing titanomagnetite
VL  - 284
SP  - 1170-1173
AB  - A new, high efficient comprehensive utilization technology with non-pollution, low energy consumption, and strong feedstock adaptability is investigated with the view to developing an efficient smelting process of vanadium-bearing titanomagnetite by non-BF route. It includes three major steps in this process: selective chlorination of the concentrates for extraction vanadium using industrial chloride wastes, direct reduction for producing DRI at medium temperature, and separation of hot metal from slag at elevated temperature. In this paper, it focuses on the extraction of vanadium from vanadium-bearing titanomagnetite by selective chlorination. The mechanisms of selective chlorination for extracting vanadium is discussed from the view of thermodynamics analyses and it is found that the reasonable temperature is over the temperature range of 900K∼1300K if chlorine potential (logp Cl2) and oxygen potential (logpO2) are controlled at a certain region (hatched region A). Furthermore, some preliminary experimental are conducted and the results show that it is possible to extract vanadium from vanadium-bearing titanomagnetite by selective chlorination and extraction ratio can reach up to 30% under 1100K after 2 hours calcination. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.

TI  - Foraging and metabolic consequences of semi-anadromy for an endangered estuarine fish
VL  - 12
IS  - 3
AB  - Diadromy affords fish access to productive ecosystems, increasing growth and ultimately fitness, but it is unclear whether these advantages persist for species migrating within highly altered habitat. Here, we compared the foraging success of wild Delta Smelt-an endangered, zooplanktivorous, annual, semi-anadromous fish that is endemic to the highly altered San Francisco Estuary (SFE)-collected from freshwater (<0.55 psu) and brackish habitat (≥0.55 psu). Stomach fullness, averaged across three generations of wild Delta Smelt sampled from juvenile through adult life stages (n = 1,318), was 1.5-fold higher in brackish than in freshwater habitat. However, salinity and season interacted, with higher fullness (1.7-fold) in freshwater than in brackish habitat in summer, but far higher fullness in brackish than freshwater habitat during fall/winter and winter/spring (1.8 and 2.0-fold, respectively). To examine potential causes of this interaction we compared mesozooplankton abundance, collected concurrently with the Delta Smelt, in freshwater and brackish habitat during summer and fall/winter, and the metabolic rate of sub-adult Delta Smelt acclimated to salinities of 0.4, 2.0, and 12.0 psu in a laboratory experiment. A seasonal peak in mesozooplankton density coincided with the summer peak in Delta Smelt foraging success in freshwater, and a pronounced decline in freshwater mesozooplankton abundance in the fall coincided with declining stomach fullness, which persisted for the remainder of the year (fall, winter and spring). In brackish habitat, greater foraging 'efficiency' (prey items in stomachs/mesozooplankton abundance) led to more prey items per fish and generally higher stomach fullness (i.e., a higher proportion of mesozooplankton detected in concurrent trawls were eaten by fish in brackish habitat). Delta Smelt exhibited no difference in metabolic rate across the three salinities, indicating that metabolic responses to salinity are unlikely to have caused the stomach fullness results. Adult migration and freshwater spawning therefore places young fish in a position to exploit higher densities of prey in freshwater in the late spring/summer, and subsequent movement downstream provides older fish more accessible prey in brackish habitat. Thus, despite endemism to a highly-altered estuary, semi-anadromy provided substantial foraging benefits to Delta Smelt, consistent with other temperate migratory fish. © 2017 Hammock et al.

AB  - In order to figure out interspecific associations among dominant species in naturally colonized plant communities on coal gob piles, the interspecific associations among 15 dominant species in naturally colonized plant communities on coal gob piles of Datong mining area in Shanxi, China were studied by using χ2-test, Pearson correlation coefficients and Spearman rank correlation coefficients in this study. The results showed that the interspecific associations of most species-pairs among 15 dominant species were not significant, which illustrated that the naturally colonized plant communities on the coal gob piles of Datong mining area had simple community structures and were still at the early or middle stage of succession. The dominant species pairs of Agropyron desertorum or Elymus dahuricus and Rosa xanthina, R. xanthina or Clematis fruticosa and Ulmus pumila showed extremely significant or significant positive correlation; these species are species of zonal distribution with strong ecological adaptability to drought, cold weather and poor soil fertility, which could be mixedly planted as the pioneer species for local coal gob piles revegetation. Based on Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients, the 15 dominant species were divided into 3 ecological species groups. Soil moisture was the key factor causing the differentiation of the ecological species groups. © 2015, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology. All rights reserved.

TI  - Watershed restoration using native species: Pomar stream, Eldorado, Misiones, Argentina
SP  - 29-49
AB  - Many forest restoration programs emphasize the use of native species. Native species provide ecological advantages, including contributions to the conservation of biodiversity and the protection and expansion of the genetic diversity of the vegetation used and of associated fauna. Technical and economic advantages include potential sources of propagules and ease of acclimation to local ecological conditions. Additionally, the species used to restore degraded areas should have the ability to improve soils by increasing organic matter and nutrient content, and by encouraging colonization by beneficial microorganisms. It is also expected that the selected species will improve light and temperature conditions at ground level, and provide shelter and food for seed dispersing fauna, in order to accelerate the process of restoration. The performance of eleven native tree species was analyzed in the Pomar Stream (Arroyo Pomar), Eldorado watershed, Misiones, Argentina, in order to identify native species that are well suited to restoring forests for watershed protection, with growth that accelerates understory development for rapid soil cover. Species were selected based on prior analysis of local flora of gallery forests in the watershed. Potential interest to local farmers was also considered in species selection. Fruit-bearing species were also included in order to favor regional fauna. Species were ranked according to base diameter, total height, survival and crown development. At 2.5 years of age, the best performing species were: Enterolobium contortisiliquum (Timbó), Cordia trichotoma (Peteribí), Peltophorum dubium (Cañafístola), Bastardiopsis densiflora (Loro blanco), Cedrela fissilis (Cedro) and Tabebuia heptaphylla (Lapacho negro), followed by Parapiptadenia rigida (Anchico colorado) and Anadenanthera macrocarpa (Cebil or Curupay). Under the conditions of this study, fruit-bearing trees did not perform adequately. The study area is undergoing restoration processes due to the adaptability of the species selected. These species have accelerated plant succession, with increased biodiversity from the inclusion of new understory species. Urban and peri-urban areas of Misiones suffer from loss of forest cover that formerly provided recreational services and ecosystem services such as watershed protection. This study has provided baseline information for restoration of gallery forest using native tree species in a peri-urban watershed in Misiones Province. Future research should evaluate alternative plantation models, new species, and other arrangements and groupings in order to better elucidate opportunities and techniques of watershed restoration. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

TI  - Spatial sampling of multi-environment trials data for station layout of maize variety
SP  - 403-408
AB  - Classification methodology is widely used by plant breeders to group environments on the results of regional evaluation trials to assist selection among genotypes. To be effective, Multi-environment trial (MET) is a key point for breeders to test productivity and adaptability of crop varieties. With the development of science and technology in breeding, for METs at any stage of a breeding program, the breeder is dealing with a finite sample of environments that sample a relatively small subset of potential geographical and crop management conditions in a limited number of years. The general term 'enviro typing', used as a complement to the more familiar terms genotyping and phenotyping, is classifying the environments (location-year-management combinations) within a MET to assess how they represent target population of environments. However, the planting environment is complex and varied. Therefore, on one hand, the challenges associated with conducting METs in a finite number of years to predict genotype-trait performance in the target population-environment are crucial. On the other hand, it is also very important to ensure the accuracy of MET and decrease the loss of seed promotion to have a good understanding of the type of the planting environment and make reasonable decision to set the station of METs. In the paper, we mainly study on a new spatial sampling method of multi-environment trial layout and take maize in Jilin province in China for example. According to characteristics of METs, the algorithm combined with spatially stratified sampling and spatial balanced random sampling, which set a reasonable scheme of spatial distribution of MET station for maize. The main steps are as follows: Firstly, we build an index system for the classification of maize environment with sufficiently detailed data such as weather, soil, DEM, road network, cultivated area, actively accumulated temperature, precipitation, the sunshine duration during the whole growing period and gradient. Secondly, we develop methods for identifying the optimal numbers of classes for the planting environment and use spatially stratified sampling model to calculate the minimum number of stations to meet the requirements. Finally, the method was applied to the spatial distribution of MET station for maize in Jilin province, and compute the optimal number of clusters for planting environment and METs stations number, which are 5 and 25, respectively. The result is roughly consistent with the existing MET station for maize with the sample precision of 94.5%, and have a certain reference significance for the layout of MET stations for maize in Jilin province. © 2017 IEEE.

TI  - Royal decree: Gene expression in trans-generationally immune primed bumblebee workers mimics a primary immune response
VL  - 11
IS  - 7
AB  - Invertebrates lack the cellular and physiological machinery of the adaptive immune system, but show specificity in their immune response and immune priming. Functionally, immune priming is comparable to immune memory in vertebrates. Individuals that have survived exposure to a given parasite are better protected against subsequent exposures. Protection may be cross-reactive, but demonstrations of persistent and specific protection in invertebrates are increasing. This immune priming can cross generations ("trans-generational" immune priming), preparing offspring for the prevailing parasite environment. While these phenomena gain increasing support, the mechanistic foundations underlying such immune priming, both within and across generations, remain largely unknown. Using a transcriptomic approach, we show that exposing bumblebee queens with an injection of heat-killed bacteria, known to induce trans-generational immune priming, alters daughter (worker) gene expression. Daughters, even when unexposed themselves, constitutively express a core set of the genes induced upon direct bacterial exposure, including high expression of antimicrobial peptides, a beta-glucan receptor protein implicated in bacterial recognition and the induction of the toll signaling pathway, and slit-3 which is important in honeybee immunity. Maternal exposure results in a distinct upregulation of their daughters' immune system, with a signature overlapping with the induced individual response to a direct exposure. This will mediate mother-offspring protection, but also associated costs related to reconfiguration of constitutive immune expression. Moreover, identification of conserved immune pathways in memory-like responses has important implications for our understanding of the innate immune system, including the innate components in vertebrates, which share many of these pathways. © 2016, Public Library of Science.

TI  - Valorisation of rice husks using a TORBED (R) combustion process
VL  - 159
SP  - 247-255
AB  - World production of rice exceeds 750 million tonnes per year of which a fifth is removed in the form of rice husk during the milling process. The use of rice husks as a source of sustainable and renewable energy is often hindered by lack of capital and a poor understanding of rice husk combustion characteristics. This results in the selection of poor quality technology which generates significant quantities of harmful crystalline Silica waste. Despite previous work in the area, detailed characterisation of the combustion of rice husk ash in a TORBED reactor across a wide temperature range has not yet been attempted and little effort has been directed towards assessing the economic viability of generating quality rice husk ashes. The use of a TORBED reactor enables low residual carbon after combustion without the generation of harmful crystalline material. Rice husk was combusted in a 400 mm reactor at temperatures between 700 and 950 degrees C. In the subsequent characterisation studies the resulting materials were shown to be fully amorphous high purity silica (>95%) and were readily digested in a series of alkaline digestion experiments. Complete silica conversion was only possible using uneconomic Na2O/SiO2 ratios and further optimisation of the combustion process to generate higher surface area material is necessary to increase the digestion rates further. Provisional economic analysis suggests that sales of the by-product enhance the returns from rice husk based power generation. TORBED reactors enable the combustion of rice husk with considerable operating flexibility and they generate products that could be used to displace resource intensive products and processes thus, added value from the by-products can be obtained by using TORBED reactor technology.

VL  - 17

SP  - 2075-2085
AB  - Non-indigenous ascidians are of particular concern to aquaculture industry and, paradoxically, the activities associated with it represent an important way to translocate these species worldwide. In 2012 a non-indigenous ascidian was found covering the oyster crops in the Ebro Delta (Western Mediterranean). We have identified the ascidian genetically and morphologically as Didemnum vexillum Kott, 2002. This finding indicates that the species is currently expanding its distribution in the Mediterranean Sea, as it has recently been found in the eastern basin (Venice, Adriatic Sea). Introduced populations of D. vexillum are found in temperate and cold waters worldwide, and a successful establishment in the Mediterranean implies a remarkable capacity of adaptability to warm, subtropical conditions. We assessed the life cycle (growth and reproduction) of the ascidian at the studied site. The species has a marked seasonal cycle, with regression in the warmest months and reappearance during winter. In spring D. vexillum reaches its maximum abundance, followed by a peak in reproduction just before regression. This cycle is reversed with respect to the one observed in colder waters, highlighting a plastic biological cycle of this invader and an hitherto unknown ability to establish itself in warm waters. We also analysed the genetic structure of the population of the Ebro Delta and the one established in the Lagoon of Venice using COI sequence data. The low genetic diversity in our samples (three haplotypes) was consistent with what is observed in the introduced populations worldwide. It is likely that the ascidian was introduced with oyster stock from bivalve cultures in the Atlantic French coasts, where the same three haplotypes have been reported. The high boating activity in the Ebro Delta makes further human-mediated transport of the species highly likely, and nearby fishing grounds can be severely affected if invaded. It is urgent to implement measures to prevent the continuous expansion of this ascidian pest in the Mediterranean. © 2015, The Author(s).

TI  - Effects of nutrient supply and sowing time on the yield and pathological traits of winter oilseed rape
VL  - 61

SP  - 195-205
AB  - The fertilizer response of oilseed rape (Brassica napus var. oleifera f. biennis L.) was investigated on the chernozem soil in Eastern Hungary in a three-year experiment with two sowing times. The results proved that oilseed rape had high fertilizer (N+PK) demand. In the experiments, N = 210 kg ha-1 +PK proved to be the optimal fertilizer dose. The yield-increasing effect of fertilization was 800 to 1300 kg ha-1</ sup>, depending on the year. The maximum yield (5000 kg ha-1</ sup>) was obtained in the year with least infection. The excellent natural nutrient-providing ability of chernozem soil was confirmed by the high yield level (3000-4200 kg ha-1) of the control treatment (N = 0 kg ha-1 +PK). The results showed that the specific fertilizer utilization efficiency of oilseed rape decreased if the dose of N+PK fertilizer was increased (being 19-27 kg/1 kg NPK in the control treatment and 11-12 kg/1 kg NPK in the N = 210 kg ha-1 +PK treatment). On the other hand, fertilization improved the water utilization from 4-8 kg/1 mm precipitation + irrigation water to 11-14 kg/1 mm precipitation + irrigation water. The results of these studies confirmed that hybrid rape had excellent adaptability to the sowing time. The results of Pearson's correlation analysis showed a strong correlation (0.6*-0.9**) between the spring precipitation and temperature and the most important diseases (Sclerotinia, Alternaria, Peronospora, Phoma) attacking oilseed rape.

TI  - Florovsky at the crossroads: Imagining Byzantine Renaissance from Morningside Heights
VL  - 13
IS  - 1
SP  - 151-171
AB  - Georges Florovsky, an influential theologian, came to New York City in 1948 to be dean of the Russian St Vladimir Theological Seminary. At Morningside Heights, Florovsky taught about what went wrong in Russia in 1917 and what needed to be done about it. His ideas prefigure the critique of European Enlightenment and its Orientalism formulated by Edward Said. Florovsky argued that Russia, imitating Western Europe, gave up its own Hellenic heritage of the Church Fathers, and replaced it with the western style of the Renaissance of ancient Hellenic philosophy. His remedy for this condition was 'the return to the fathers', establishing a direct philosophical connection with Russia's Hellenic heritage, thus bypassing the West. These ideas of Hellenic patristic revival also run into problems at Morningside Heights, in the World Council of Churches and with the powerful theological figures at Union Theological Seminary. Florovsky misread the changing political situation in the late 1950s. American theology and politics were becoming influenced by Reinhold Niebuhr, who was not interested in the nuances of Church History. The new American priorities were the homogenization of ethnic churches into a union. Florovsky's ideas about the Russian religious revival, once popular at the height of the Cold War now became outdated. Thus, Florovsky was removed from the deanship of St Vladimir Theological Seminary in 1955 and a more Americanized generation took over the leadership, while his ideas found fertile soil in more nationalistic circles. © 2014 'Uchitel' Publishing House.

TI  - An assessment of Pinus contorta seed production in British Columbia: Geographic variation and dynamically-downscaled climate correlates from the Canadian Regional Climate Model
VL  - 236
SP  - 194-210
AB  - The ecological and economic importance of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Louden) in British Columbia (BC) has heightened interest in the adaptability and effective management of the species, especially as climate changes. The relationship between climate and the seed production of natural populations is a key management issue that has yet to be assessed. The purpose of this study is to determine if variation in P. contorta seed yield is related to the climate of BC. Regional differences in the seed production of lodgepole pine were examined using 1924 archived seedlot collections across 18 different natural stand seed planning zones (SPZs) in BC. The relationship between climate variation and the seed production of P. contorta was then evaluated using dynamically downscaled output from the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM). Seed production is relatively consistent across SPZs spanning a wide range of climate regimes, with the exception of Nass Skeena Transition (NST) where seed yield is an order of magnitude higher than elsewhere. Significant temporal correlations between overall trends in seed production and both temperature and precipitation were found using the CRCM output. However, only three of the 18 SPZs showed a significant overall trend in mean annual seed yield based on cone collections made between 1963 and 2013, suggesting that the reproductive capacity of natural populations is well adapted to decadal-scale climate change. Tolerance to significant variation in climate likely plays an important role in explaining the ability of this species to thrive well outside its natural range. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Studies on the properties and abilities of Salix in the light of its practical application offer the kind of scientific adventure that is particularly exciting. Willows appeared on Earth long before the first human beings and yet they continue to amaze us in many respects. We do not know the exact number of Salix species but we do know that there are enormous differences between them. Some of these differences concern their morphology and the conditions and/or requirements they need for growth. Others relate to the formation of secondary metabolites and wood structure. Salix species also differ in how they react to toxic elements or compounds and in their mechanisms for survival. The very wide range of applications of Salix, from valuable biomass, through wood constructional materials, medicine, phytoremediation to apiculture is surprising. Since wood is a complex chemical medium with components fixed by chemical bonds, physicochemical interactions and simple mixtures, structural differences as well as the presence of secondary metabolites is of prime concern when considering its practical application. Differences in its structure significantly influence - for example - the potential of willow as an energy source (heating, electrical energy and biofuels), as constructional material for wood panels and an important component in particle board production or in the preparation of paper originated packaging materials. The ratio of lignin and cellulose is a crucial factor in the paper industry. The presence and concentration level of secondary (non-structural) substances depends strongly on such factors as: genotype, soil, water content, age, tissue and many other criteria. Growth conditions and environmental pollution may affect the value of the degree of polymerization of cellulose; this also works in the opposite direction - different species of Salix vary in their adaptability to a range of climate conditions and soils (including toxic elements and post-industrial compounds), which makes them particularly valuable in the phytoremediation of polluted areas. It is difficult to overestimate the scientific importance of this quality. Salix species possess mechanisms that are able to transport toxicants to particular tissues and accumulate them safely and are therefore able to adapt to conditions that are lethal for other plants. The significant and rapid development of new concepts in the quest to resolve the problem of world hunger has led to the new and interesting idea of adopting processed willow biomass (grown on marginal farmland of low or non-agronomic value) for use as a valuable component of feeds and possibly food. This and a number of other topics that are of interest to us will be discussed in the following Chapter. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

VL  - 52

AB  - Objective: In order to understand the potential control capacity of Scymnus (Pullus) posticalis against Pseudoregma bambusicola, the optimum predator density, the maximum predatory amount, interference coefficient, instantaneous attack rate and treating time of S. (P.) posticalis fed on Pseudoregma bambusicola were studied. By measuring the life table of S. (P.) posticalis, I investigated the population growth trend of S. (P.) posticalis after feeding with P. bambusicola, to provide a scientific basis for utilizing S. (P.) posticalis to control P. bambusicola. Method: Under laboratory conditions (temperature (23±1)℃, relative humidity (70%-73%), feeding with fixed time and fixed quantity in plastic cases was conducted to observe and measure the predation of S. (P.) posticalis on P. bambusicola, and to test S. (P.) posticalis's interference effect of its own density. With the application of Data Processing System, I used methods of insect ecology, such as the model of Holling-II, the new model of Holling-III functional response developed by Wang Shize, and statistic model of functional response of predator to prey developed by Jin Kaizheng, for matching. Furthermore, I analyzed parameters of the optimum predator density, the maximum predatory amount, inference factor, instantaneous attack rate and treating time of P. bambusicola being preyed by S. (P.) posticalis, for studying the regulating effect of S. (P.) posticalis on P. bambusicola. I also used the rearing method of setting veil screen in the forest to measure the life table of experimented S. (P.) posticalis, in order to study S. (P.) posticalis's quantitative characteristic of inner increase capacity. Result: Under the controlled conditions, the predatory function responses showed that the average predation was able to amount 75 max per day for the 3rd instar S. (P.) posticalis on P. bambusicola, and 81 max per day for adult S. (P.) posticalis, both the 3rd instar and adult S. (P.) posticalis were strong predators of P. bambusicola. The interference effect test on S. (P.) posticalis's density showed that the pest control capacity of S. (P.) posticalis could reach the maximum when the release ratio was 1∶38.8; and the parametric measure result of life table showed that the survival rate of indoor rearing female imagoes was able to reach 63%, and after a generation, the population increased by 85.3638 times. Meanwhile, within the test temperature range, when the reproductive rate (λ) was larger than 1, the population of lab reared S. (P.) posticalis increased in a geometric ratio. By comparing the parameters on life tables, and analyzing the models of functional response, it was shown that S. (P.) posticalis was a strong predator of P. bambusicola, and it had strong reproductive ability, and S. (P.) posticalis had strong pest control capacity against the population of P. bambusicola. Conclusion: This study indicated that the population of S. (P.) posticalis fed with P. bambusicola grew exponentially, and it had a great potential of preventing and controlling P. bambusicola. © 2016, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

AB  - In recent years, infectious disease caused by Streptococcus agalactiae has increased in aquaculture, threatening the healthy development of tilapia and resulting in substantial economic losses. Cultivating disease-resistant tilapia by transgenic technology is one strategy that has been developed to address this issue. Here, we used a transposon system to investigate gene expression and tissue lytic activity in transgenic zebrafish expressing the tilapia lysozyme. The transpose vector contained the Tgf2 transposon skeleton, tilapia heat shock protein 70 promoter (Hsp70) and two target genes (tilapia C-type lysozyme 3 [lysozyme-C3] and green fluorescent protein [GFP]). The transgenic zebrafish F0 generation was obtained by microinjecting the donor vector and transposase mRNA into fertilized zebrafish eggs. There was 45% green fluorescence in the zebrafish F0 generation, which was spread over the entire body based on microscope observation. The F0 generation was reared to sexual maturity, at which point individuals were mated with wild-type zebrafish to produce the F1 generation. Tilapia lysozyme-C3 expression was detected in the liver of F1 generation by RT-PCR and western blotting, but was not detected in the skin, intestine, or muscle. Significantly higher liver bacteriolysis activity was detected in transgenic zebrafish compared with wild-type zebrafish. Therefore, transgenic zebrafish may have an increased potential for bacterial resistance. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Ziprasidone is a second-generation antipsychotic approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The purpose of this review is to assess the overall safety profile of ziprasidone, including its risk for prolonging the electrocardiogram (ECG) QT interval. Areas covered: This paper is a review of product labeling and English language reports located through PubMed and information available on regulatory agency websites, with a focus on the safety and tolerability of ziprasidone. Expert opinion: Although ziprasidone can prolong the ECG QT interval, this has not resulted in increases in sudden death or cardiac sudden death as noted in a large, simple trial and supported by almost a decade of real-world use in the US. Ziprasidone's principal advantage over some other second-generation antipsychotics has been its overall favorable weight and metabolic profile. Similar to most second-generation antipsychotics, ziprasidone has a lower propensity for extrapyramidal side effects and hyperprolactinemia compared to first-generation antipsychotics. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.

TI  - Effectiveness and Issues of Automotive Electric Power Generating System Using Solar Modules
AB  - Solar and other green energy technologies are attracting attention as a means of helping to address global warming caused by CO2 and other emission gases. Countries, factories, and individual homes around the world have already introduced photovoltaic energy power sources, a trend that is likely to increase in the future. Electric vehicles powered from photovoltaic energy systems can help decrease the CO2 emmissions caused by vehicles. Unlike vehicles used for solar car racing, it is not easy to equip conventional vehicles with solar modules because the available area for module installation is very small to maintain cabin space, and the body lines of conventional vehicles are also usually slightly rounded. These factors decrease the performance of photovoltaic energy systems and prevent sufficient electric power generation. This research aimed to estimate the effectiveness of a solar module power generating system equipped on a conventional car, the Toyota Prius PHV. Sixteen modules were set on the hood, roof, hatchback, and sides of the car. The energy from each module was controlled by maximum power point tracking (MPPT) unit, a system used to reduce the energy loss caused by differences in solar radiation among the modules. Electric power generation data over the course of 100 days from July 1 to January 30 in 2014 found that the modules generated an average of 2.0 kWh/day. This is equivalent to a driving distance of 9.8 km. At the same time, this research also identified various problems related to increasing the electric power obtained from photovoltaic modules.

VL  - 428
SP  - 24-31
AB  - Chondrosia reniformis is a common marine demosponge that shows striking tissue plasticity and unusual body deformability. This sponge can develop long and slender outgrowths extending from the parental body. According to some authors, this phenomenon, called "creeping", can be related to asexual reproduction, atypical mechanisms of "localized" locomotion or passive response to environmental stress. Here we address this phenomenon by means of an interdisciplinary approach consisting of field survey, experimental field studies and experimental laboratory studies. During field survey and field experimental survey we observed that the instability of substratum is an important factor that trigs the beginning of creeping. The sponge size does not seem to be directly involved in the occurrence of the phenomenon. Specimens of Bergeggi (Ligurian Sea, northern Italy) show a high correlation between the creeping phenomenon and the sea temperature: this seems to support the hypothesis that the phenomenon is related to asexual reproduction, which is in its turn seasonally regulated by environmental temperature. In addition, experimental laboratory studies performed in different mechanical conditions on isolated samples of both ectosome and choanosome showed that temperature affects mesohyl mechanical properties: the lower is the temperature the stiffer is the mesohyl. The different physiological states recorded by the laboratory experiments are expressions of the mechanical adaptability of the collagenous mesohyl of C. reniformis and suggest that stiffness variability is under cellular control. On the basis of present results we can infer that C. reniformis can exert some control on the creeping phenomenon and that the primary factors implied in inducing creeping phenomena are the instability of substratum and the temperature. Interestingly the capability to modulate the mechanical properties of the collagenous matrix is an uncommon feature that C reniformis shares with the mutable collagenous tissue (MCT) of Echinoderms. This close analogy, which is supported by morphological and physiological evidence, is an intriguing point that opens a wide range of evolutionary and functional questions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Reproductive biology of the deep brooding coral Seriatopora hystrix: Implications for shallow reef recovery
VL  - 12
IS  - 5
AB  - Mesophotic coral ecosystems (MCEs, between 30 and 150 m depth) are hypothesized to contribute to the recovery of degraded shallow reefs through sexually produced larvae (referred to as Deep Reef Refuge Hypothesis). In Okinawa, Japan, the brooder coral Seriatopora hystrix was reported to be locally extinct in a shallow reef while it was found abundant at a MCE nearby. In this context, S. hystrix represents a key model to test the Deep Reef Refuge Hypothesis and to understand the potential contribution of mesophotic corals to shallow coral reef recovery. However, the reproductive biology of mesophotic S. hystrix and its potential to recolonize shallow reefs is currently unknown. This study reports for the first time, different temporal scales of reproductive periodicity and larval settlement of S. hystrix from an upper mesophotic reef (40 m depth) in Okinawa. We examined reproductive seasonality, lunar, and circadian periodicity (based on polyp dissection, histology, and ex situ planula release observations) and larval settlement rates in the laboratory. Mesophotic S. hystrix reproduced mainly in July and early August, with a small number of planulae being released at the end of May, June and August. Compared to shallow colonies in the same region, mesophotic S. hystrix has a 4-month shorter reproductive season, similar circadian periodicity, and smaller planula size. In addition, most of the planulae settled rapidly, limiting larval dispersal potential. The shorter reproductive season and smaller planula size may result from limited energy available for reproduction at deeper depths, while the similar circadian periodicity suggests that this reproductive aspect is not affected by environmental conditions differing with depth. Overall, contribution of mesophotic S. hystrix to shallow reef rapid recovery appears limited, although they may recruit to shallow reefs through a multi-step process over a few generations or through random extreme mixing such as typhoons. © 2017 Prasetia et al.

TI  - Transgenerational plasticity as an important mechanism affecting response of clonal species to changing climate
VL  - 7
IS  - 14
SP  - 5236-5247
AB  - In spite of the increasing number of studies on the importance of transgenerational plasticity for species response to novel environments, its effects on species ability to respond to climate change are still largely unexplored. We study the importance of transgenerational plasticity for response of a clonal species Festuca rubra. Individuals from four natural populations representing two levels of temperature and two levels of precipitation were cultivated in four growth chambers that simulate the temperature and precipitation of origin of the populations (maternal phase). Each population was represented in each growth chamber. After 6 months, single young ramets of these plants were reshuffled among the growth chambers and let to grow for additional 2 months (offspring phase). The results show that transgenerational effects (i.e., maternal phase conditions) significantly modify species response to novel climates, and the direction and intensity of the response depend on the climate of origin of the plants. For traits related to recourse acquisition, the conditions of maternal phase, either alone or in interaction mainly with climate of origin, had stronger effect than the conditions of cultivation. Overall, the maternal climate interacted more intensively with the climate of origin than with the offspring climate. The direction of the effect of the maternal climate was of different directions and intensities depending on plant origin and trait studied. The data demonstrated strong significant effects of conditions during maternal phase on species response to novel climates. These transgenerational affects were, however, not adaptive. Still, transgenerational plasticity may be an important driver of species response to novel conditions across clonal generations. These effects thus need to be carefully considered in future studies exploring species response to novel climates. This will also have strong effects on species performance under increasingly variable climates expected to occur with the climate change. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Evaluation of an acoustic telemetry transmitter designed to identify predation events
VL  - 8
IS  - 9
SP  - 1063-1071
AB  - The field of acoustic telemetry has evolved rapidly and now permits the remote sensing of animal behaviour, movement, physiology and survival in environments, and species not previously possible. However, an inability to detect when a telemetered animal is consumed by a predator can complicate accurate interpretation of the telemetry data. In this paper, we describe the efforts taken to test the two generations of a novel prototype acoustic telemetry transmitter designed specifically to detect predation. Testing involved either staged predation events where tagged prey (Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and Yellow Perch Perca flavescens) were fed to captive Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, or false-positive testing where prey fish were tagged and held without the risk of predation. Metrics of interest were (i) the rate of correctly identifying the predation events, (ii) signal lag (i.e. the time required to detect a predation event), (iii) tag retention time in the predator's gut, and (iv) the rate of false-positive triggering in both live and dead prey fishes. Staged predation events were successfully identified in 61/65 and 52/55 trials for generation 1 and 2 tags, respectively. Signal lag time was reduced in generation 1 tags (generally between 1 and 9 h) relative to generation 2 (3–29 h); although signal lag was highly variable. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) indicated strong evidence that signal lag and tag retention were both negatively correlated with water temperature, but were not affected by prey species and only slightly by individual predator traits. There was preliminary evidence that prey size may be an important determinant of both signal lag and tag retention. False-positives in live fish were absent after 120 days for generation 1 tags (n = 31), however, the false-positive rates were significantly higher (10/44) after only 66 days for generation 2 tags. False-positives in dead fish showed that 20% of the generation 2 predation tags would falsely trigger 2–3 days post-mortem. Testing of the novel predation tags was encouraging, however, further testing is recommended. Predation tags will be an important contribution to the field of acoustic telemetry, thus, permitting the improved data interpretation and less-subjective estimates of predation rates in biotelemetry studies. © 2017 The Authors.

TI  - Review on soil carbon sequestration potential in grassland ecosystems
VL  - 35
IS  - 12
SP  - 3908-3918
AB  - Global climate change has aroused wide concern from the international community, and national or regional GHG (greenhouse gas) emission has become a focus of the intergovernmental diplomatic dispute and mediation. The stability, release or increment of the soil carbon stock is closely related to the change of the atmospheric carbon stock. Even a minor change in soil organic carbon (SOC) storage may result in a significant change in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Whether the soil carbon stock can increase becomes an essential theoretical basis for terrestrial ecosystems to absorb atmospheric CO2, and serve as carbon sink. Therefore, increasing soil carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems has become an important strategy for controlling the rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration. As one of the world's most widespread terrestrial ecosystems, covering over 15% of the world's land surface, grassland ecosystems account for over 10% of the total carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems, with nearly 90% of the carbon storing in top soil. Besides, grassland soil organic carbon could be strongly influenced by management practices. During the past decades, owing to the climate change, overgrazing and other unreasonable management practices, the grasslands in the world had been seriously degraded and the soil organic carbon had significantly decreased. However, improved management practices such as enclosure and recovery of degraded grassland and conversion of cropland to abandoned fields, may reverse the loss of soil organic carbon, and even help to sequestrate carbon in the atmosphere. Therefore, under the background of climate change, the function and potential of soil organic carbon sequestration in grassland ecosystems has become a key issue. In this essay, the recent research on soil carbon sequestration potential was reviewed, including quantitative methods for estimating soil carbon sequestration potential on both regional and sample scales, dominant affecting factors and management practices of carbon sequestration, and future research direction was also proposed lastly. Research on quantitative estimation of soil carbon sequestration in grassland ecosystems had been well developed in recent years, from simple statistics on sample scale to mechanism modeling coupled with GIS and RS on regional scale. IPCC also issued guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories so as to provide a relatively uniform method for national carbon sequestration estimation, which contained three tiers on estimation of soil organic carbon storage in grassland: Tier1, Tier2, and Tier3. Among all the quantitative methods, mechanism modeling of soil carbon cycle became a major method to assess the carbon sequestration of terrestrial ecosystems and the reduction of greenhouse gas emission in the world. The dominant factors affecting soil organic carbon sequestration included natural factors (temperature, precipitation and CO2 concentration etc.) and human factors (reclamation, grazing, fire, enclosure, fertilization, irrigation and reseeding etc.), which held complicated influences on carbon sequestration with various time and intensity of management practices. There also existed many problems needed to be solved in the future, such as the methodology and adaptability of models and the uncertainty of estimation on regional scale. The potential and mechanism of carbon sequestration, and the relationship between carbon sequestration and environmental effects would be the key scientific problems. © 2015, Ecological Society of China.

TI  - Life's work in the city without ground: Cross-border family politics between Shenzhen and Hong Kong
VL  - 46
SP  - 1
AB  - How do we evaluate our life's work, the reflexive understanding of our role in the reproduction of society, in the city without ground? How is space produced between two metropolises constituted of air-conditioned passageways, concourses and tunnels that aim to disorientate the traveller with capital? To involve the reader in these questions, this sensory ethnography takes the reader on a journey across a series of reconstructed sites, from a study-centre classroom with a view of the border fence to immigration control points separating Hong Kong from Shenzhen and barricades erected by protesters on the occupied streets of Hong Kong Island. At each of these sites, the reader joins the author in interpreting multiple examples of the cross-border family's strategies for dealing productively with the friction produced by territorial, economic and embodied borders. Over the dissertation's course, these draw a "counter-topography" (Katz 2001) that highlights the productive and violent frictions created by individual and collective interventions in existing systems of assigning citizenship through genealogical inheritance. The aim of this dissertation is to bring the family back into scholarly studies of borders and global inequality - not as a tool for defining binary gendered systems of inheritance, but as a flexible pragmatic regime in which we learn to become tolerant of difference and work strategically together. It argues that families are a critical factor in the reproduction of borders. Family, state and enterprise regimes learn from and depend on each other. Over our lifetimes, these regimes use inherited logics of gender and sexual reproduction to shape our life's work. This dissertation argues that members of cross-border families are experts in strategically engaging with inequality. Because of this, they can offer scholars and policymakers strategic advice on how their policies are pragmatically used as tools for individual and family development. The dissertation develops its conclusions by addressing three interrelated questions: How is the Hong Kong-Shenzhen border reproduced in the lives of its practitioners, what does this mean for how borders address global inequality, and what is the role of space in the performance of cross-border family politics? It addresses these questions by observing the tension between the dreams of individuals and the inherited possibilities assigned to them by immigration departments and family wealth through property ownership. Border control, the city, family or the workplace do not constitute a singular experience, but are instead constructed uniquely for each traveller based on internal and external inheritances. Within each experience of border crossing, this dissertation finds a tension of authenticity, resolved through emotional labour - the presentation of an outward expression of feeling contrary to a deeply held personal feeling (Hochschild 1983). The intimate event of family formation - the act of love - is what those who justify inherited borders of gender, nationality and property ownership propose liberates its participants through rewarding emotional labour. However, this simultaneously entails the next generation in the very genealogical structures they propose such events evade (Povinelli 2006). These emotional frictions hold this system of inequality together while producing valuable heat for participants that justify their complicity in the reproduction of borders. Families and other intimate relations, act topologically, twisting, turning and folding through topographical spatial structures to simultaneously support and extract value from them. Feelings matter. It is through our learnt structures of feeling that we consciously and subconsciously respond to and develop new spaces through encounters with difference. This study finds that our current order is critically dependent on the transmutation of emotional "tolerances" for the genealogical "order of things" across generations (Brown 2006). Borders and mobility, this dissertation proposes, are not universally evil; rather, they are co-constructed as integral "genres" of ideas based on historical experience that produce a multiplicity of violence and sovereignty. If we take the time to listen to those who love across distance, they can draw guides for us to make the best use of the friction produced by the discursive, material and economic interdependence of families, states and enterprises.

AB  - Energy crops are expected to greatly develop in a very short-term bringing to significant social and environmental benefits. Nevertheless, a significant number of studies report from very positive to negative environmental implications from growing and processing energy crops, thus great uncertainty still remains on this argument. The present study focused on the cradle-to-grave impact assessments of alternative scenarios including annual and perennial energy crops for electricity/heat or first and second generation transport fuels, giving special emphasis to agricultural practices which are frequently surprisingly neglected in Life Cycle Assessment studies despite a not secondary relevance on final outcomes. The results show that cradle-to-farm gate impacts, i.e. including the upstream processes, may account for up to 95% of total impacts, with dominant effects on marine water ecotoxicity. Therefore, by increasing the sustainability of crop management through minimizing agronomic inputs, or with a complementary use of crop resides, can be expected to significantly improve the overall sustainability of bioenergy chains, as well as the competitiveness against fossil counterparts. Once again, perennial crops resulted in substantially higher environmental benefits than annual crops. It is shown that significant amount of emitted CO2 can be avoided through converting arable lands into perennial grasslands. Besides, due to lack of certain data, soil carbon storage was not included in the calculations, while N2O emission was considered as omitted variable bias (1% of N-fertilization). Therefore, especially for perennial grasses, CO2 savings were reasonably higher that those estimated in the present study. For first generation biodiesel, sunflower showed a lower energy-based impacts than rapeseed, while wheat should be preferred over maize for first generation bioethanol given its lower land-based impacts. For second generation biofuels and thermo-chemical energy, switchgrass provided the highest environmental benefits. With regard to bioenergy systems, first generation biodiesel was less impacting than first generation bioethanol; bioelectricity was less impacting than first generation biofuels and second generation bioethanol by thermo-chemical hydrolysis, but highly impacting than Biomass-to-Liquid biodiesel and second generation bioethanol through enzymatic hydrolysis.

VL  - 2

SP  - 103-110
AB  - The response of quantitative traits in translocated populations has not been well explored. Evolutionary shifts in quantitative traits, such as life history characteristics, are of particular interest because of their obvious association with fitness. In a recent survey, Stockwell (1995) examined life history variation of four populations of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) that were derived from a common ancestral population 55-58 years earlier. Three life history traits differed considerably among the four sites and appeared to be correlated with local environmental conditions. To test whether these differences were due to plasticity or rapid evolution, fish from the four sites were maintained under common-garden conditions for two generations. After two generations a genetic basis was inferred for two of the three traits (size at maturity and fat content), but not for the third trait (offspring size). Thus, rapid evolution had occurred for two life history traits in these recently established populations. This case of rapid life history evolution may be due to genetic drift and/or natural selection. These data suggest that translocations may lead to rapid evolutionary responses of targeted taxa. Rapid evolutionary responses are of special concern for 'refuge' populations that are maintained as a hedge against extinction.

AB  - The relationships of generation time to both adult body mass and temperature are critical to our understanding of numerous aspects of zooplankton behavior, ecology and evolution, yet these relationships remain poorly understood. Here, I use a meta-analysis to define the relationship of generation time to body mass and temperature for both marine and freshwater zooplankton species (rotifers, copepods and cladocera), for temperatures from 5-20 degrees C. I also define a relationship for the constituent parts of generation time (embryonic and postembryonic development time) as a function of egg and body mass for zooplankton across this temperature range. These relationships provide powerful tools for evaluating differences in generation time between individual zooplankton species.

TI  - Adaptive Evolution of the Venom-Targeted vWF Protein in Opossums that Eat Pitvipers
VL  - 6
IS  - 6
AB  - The rapid evolution of venom toxin genes is often explained as the result of a biochemical arms race between venomous animals and their prey. However, it is not clear that an arms race analogy is appropriate in this context because there is no published evidence for rapid evolution in genes that might confer toxin resistance among routinely envenomed species. Here we report such evidence from an unusual predator-prey relationship between opossums (Marsupialia: Didelphidae) and pitvipers (Serpentes: Crotalinae). In particular, we found high ratios of replacement to silent substitutions in the gene encoding von Willebrand Factor (vWF), a venom-targeted hemostatic blood protein, in a clade of opossums known to eat pitvipers and to be resistant to their hemorrhagic venom. Observed amino-acid substitutions in venom-resistant opossums include changes in net charge and hydrophobicity that are hypothesized to weaken the bond between vWF and one of its toxic snake-venom ligands, the C-type lectin-like protein botrocetin. Our results provide the first example of rapid adaptive evolution in any venom-targeted molecule, and they support the notion that an evolutionary arms race might be driving the rapid evolution of snake venoms. However, in the arms race implied by our results, venomous snakes are prey, and their venom has a correspondingly defensive function in addition to its usual trophic role.

VL  - 25

SP  - 527-536
AB  - P>1. As organisms expand their range towards northern latitudes they will encounter selective factors like harsh winter conditions. The ability to cope with and adapt to harsh winters may depend on the variability and evolutionary potential of relevant traits. 2. One adaptation in insects is winter diapause. It is characterized by changes in physiology, behaviour or in both. Physiological changes include lowered metabolic rate that enhances survival by saving limited energy reserves during overwintering. Active behavioural changes like burrowing into the soil allow individuals to escape harsh conditions. 3. We examined variation in overwintering body mass, resting metabolic rate (CO(2) production) and diapause behaviour (burrowing into the soil), and their effects on overwintering success in the adult Colorado potato beetles (Leptinotarsa decemlineata). We conducted a full-sib/half-sib rearing experiment to estimate the evolutionary potential (heritability) of these traits. 4. High overwintering body mass and low metabolic rate were phenotypically associated with high diapause propensity (i.e. burrowing), which was linked to high overwintering survival. We found that once beetles had entered the soil, only large body mass of males was associated with high overwintering survival. However, the heritability estimates in all traits examined were low. 5. Our results show that winter conditions impose selection on diapause behaviour, which was linked to lower metabolic rate and larger body mass. If range expansion to higher latitudes requires adaptive genetic changes in diapause behaviour, metabolism, or body mass, the insufficient genetic variation in these traits suggest that the Colorado potato beetle's future potential to respond to selection due to harsher winters could be limited and thus, its range expansion could be hindered. Both physiological and behavioural adaptations are important to consider when assessing range expansion potential.

TI  - Moving south: effects of water temperatures on the larval development of invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) in cool-temperate Australia
VL  - 6
IS  - 19
SP  - 6993-7003
AB  - The distributional limits of many ectothermic species are set by thermal tolerances of early-developmental stages in the life history; embryos and larvae often are less able to buffer environmental variation than are conspecific adults. In pond-breeding amphibians, for example, cold water may constrain viability of eggs and larvae, even if adults can find suitable thermal conditions in terrestrial niches. Invasive species provide robust model systems for exploring these questions, because we can quantify thermal challenges at the expanding range edge (from field surveys) and larval responses to thermal conditions (in the laboratory). Our studies on invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) at the southern (cool-climate) edge of their expanding range in Australia show that available ponds often average around 20 degrees C during the breeding period, 10 degrees C lower than in many areas of the toads' native range, or in the Australian tropics. Our laboratory experiments showed that cane toad eggs and larvae cannot develop successfully at 16 degrees C, but hatching success and larval survival rates were higher at 20 degrees C than in warmer conditions. Lower temperatures slowed growth rates, increasing the duration of tadpole life, but also increased metamorph body mass. Water temperature also influenced metamorph body shape (high temperatures reduced relative limb length, head width, and body mass) and locomotor performance (increased speed from intermediate temperatures, longer hops from high temperatures). In combination with previous studies, our data suggest that lower water temperatures may enhance rather than reduce recruitment of cane toads, at least in areas where pond temperatures reach or exceed 20 degrees C. That condition is fulfilled over a wide area of southern Australia, suggesting that the continuing expansion of this invasive species is unlikely to be curtailed by the impacts of relatively low water temperatures on the viability of early life-history stages.

AB  - As global obesity rates continue to rise, it is important to understand the origin, role and range of human variation of body mass index (BMI) in assessing health and healthcare. A growing body of evidence suggests that BMI is a poor indicator of health across populations, and that there may be a metabolically healthy obese phenotype. Here, we review the reasons why BMI is an inadequate tool for assessing cardiometabolic health. We then suggest that cold climate adaptations may also render BMI an uninformative metric. Underlying evolutionary and environmental drivers may allow for heat conserving larger body sizes without necessarily increasing metabolic health risks. However, there may also be a potential mismatch between modern obesogenic environments and adaptations to cold climates, highlighting the need to further investigate the potential for metabolically healthy obese phenotypes among circumpolar and other populations as well as the broader meaning for metabolic health. Lay Summary Global obesity rates are on the rise; however, body mass index (BMI) is a poor indicator of metabolic health. Here, we propose that cold climate populations may exhibit high BMIs, but relatively healthy metabolic profiles (metabolically healthy obesity) due to environmental and evolutionary pressures associated with inhabiting a cold climate.

TI  - SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS: ECO-EVOLUTIONARYDYNAMICS IN COLD BLOOD
VL  - 105
IS  - 3
SP  - 441-450
AB  - Eco-evolutionary dynamics occur when ecological change influences evolutionary change (eco-to-evo) and when evolutionary change influences ecological change (evo-to-eco), both on contemporary time scales. Fishes, amphibians, and reptiles have played important roles as study animals in the empirical study and exploration of these dynamics. We suggest that this primacy stems in part from the sweet-spot that many species of fishes, amphibians, and reptiles occupy on the continuum from experimental convenience to ecological importance, as well as on the particular organismal properties that they share, including indeterminate growth and ectothermy. Yet our overall understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics remains very limited. In the hope of reducing this information gap, the present symposium proceedings include 12 contributions that speak directly to three critical topics in eco-evolutionary dynamics: the role of human influences, constraints and alternatives, and the context dependence of eco-evolutionary dynamics in nature.

TI  - Repeatability of energy metabolism and resistance to dehydration in the invasive slug Limax maximus
VL  - 131
IS  - 1
SP  - 11-18
AB  - Standard metabolic rate (SMR) and resistance to body dehydration (BD) are important physiological traits that have an effect on water balance and the amount of energy available for activity and production, and thus could contribute to variation in life history traits expressed across a range of environments. Few studies have tested whether SMR and BD show consistent between-individual variation in molluscs. Significant repeatability of SMR and BD indicates that the traits might be heritable and therefore a possible target for natural selection, so describing the repeatability of SMR and BD is important in studies of phenotypic variability. Here, we studied energy metabolism (body mass-corrected SMR) and the change in the scaling relationship of SMR and body mass in response to time between measurements in the giant garden slug Limax maximus. Limax maximus is one of the most invasive terrestrial molluscs, with a wide geographical distribution, and is considered an important pest of horticultural and agricultural crops. Our results show that L. maximus follows the expected relationship of increasing SMR with increasing mass, but the scaling exponent varies through time and is different from that described for other gastropods. We also found significant inter-individual variation in VCO2 Mean, VCO2 Min, VCO2 Max, and BD (t=0.25, 0.29, 0.24, 0.22, p<0.05, respectively), and significant repeatability of body mass (t=0.90). To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of the repeatability of body mass-corrected SMR and BD in terrestrial slugs. Our results suggest that energy metabolism and water balance could potentially respond to selection.

TI  - Demographic responses underlying eco-evolutionary dynamics as revealed with inverse modelling
VL  - 88
IS  - 5
SP  - 768-779
AB  - Changes in population dynamics due to interacting evolutionary and ecological processes are the direct result of responses in vital rates, that is stage-specific growth, survival and fecundity. Quantifying through which vital rates population fitness is affected, instead of focusing on population trends only, can give a more mechanistic understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics. The aim of this study was to estimate the underlying demographic rates of aphid (Myzus persicae) populations. We analysed unpublished stage-structure population dynamics data of a field experiment with caged and uncaged populations in which rapid evolutionary dynamics were observed, as well as unpublished results from an individual life table experiment performed in a glasshouse. Using data on changes in population abundance and stage distributions over time, we estimated transition matrices with inverse modelling techniques, in a Bayesian framework. The model used to fit across all experimental treatments included density as well as clone-specific caging effects. We additionally used individual life table data to inform the model on survival, growth and reproduction. Results suggest that clones varied considerably in vital rates, and imply trade-offs between reproduction and survival. Responses to densities also varied between clones. Negative density dependence was found in growth and reproduction, and the presence of predators and competitors further decreased these two vital rates, while survival estimates increased. Under uncaged conditions, population growth rates of the evolving populations were increased compared to the expectation based on the pure clones. Our inverse modelling approach revealed how much vital rates contributed to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. The decomposition analysis showed that variation in population growth rates in the evolving populations was to a large extent shaped by plant size. Yet, it also revealed an impact of evolutionary changes in clonal composition. Finally, we discuss that inverse modelling is a complex problem, as multiple combinations of individual rates can result in the same dynamics. We discuss assumptions and limitations, as well as opportunities, of this approach.

TI  - Acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1): Possible relationship of allelic variation to body size and human population adaptation to thermal stress - A theoretical perspective
VL  - 12
IS  - 5
SP  - 688-701
AB  - The acid phosphatase locus 1 (ACP1) codes for a low molecular weight phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase that has the important action of dephosphorylating tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and peptides and a second important role in modulating flavin cofactor levels and the activity of flavo-enzymes. These functions significantly influence cell division, differentiation, and growth. Two alleles (ACP1*A and ACP1*B) reach polymorphic frequencies at the ACP1 locus in all human populations, while the ACP1*C and ACP1*R alleles reach polymorphic frequencies in restricted geographical regions. The worldwide distribution of these alleles, and data from several clinical studies, strongly suggest that the ACP1 locus functions to modulate growth and that selection at this locus is a component of the selective processes influencing body mass and human population adaptation to thermal stress. The ACP1*A allele reaches highest frequencies at extreme latitudes and appears to be associated with maximizing body mass and adaptation to cold stress, whereas the ACP1*B allele reaches highest frequencies in tropical and subtropical environments and appears to be associated with minimizing body mass and adaptation to heat stress. The high frequency of the ACP1*C allele at northern latitudes, where ACP1*A allele frequencies are elevated, may be a mechanism for limiting fetal and maternal complications associated with fetal macrosomia and adult obesity in populations where protein and calorie intake are relatively high.

Specifically, we test the hypothesis that variation in limb proportions seen in Jomon, Yayoi, and Kumejima is a complex interaction of genetic adaptation; development and allometric constraints; selection, gene flow and genetic drift with changing cultural factors (i.e., nutrition) and climate.

TI  - Phenotypic plasticity, global change, and the speed of adaptive evolution
VL  - 35
SP  - 34-40
AB  - The role phenotypic plasticity might play in adaptation to the ongoing climate changes is unclear. Plasticity allows for the production of a diversity of intra-generational responses, whose inter-generational evolutionary consequences are difficult to predict. In this article, we review theory and empirical studies addressing this question in insects by considering three scenarios. The first scenario corresponds to adaptive plasticity that should lead to slow or no evolution. The second scenario is the case of non-adaptive phenotypic plasticity to new environmental conditions that should lead either to extinction or, on the contrary, to rapid evolutionary change. The third scenario deals with how plasticity alters the variance selection acts upon. These scenarios are then discussed by highlighting examples of empirical studies on insects. We conclude that more studies are needed to better understand the relationship between phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary processes in insects.

TI  - Effects of photoperiod and temperature on the body mass and the mass of reproductive organs in male Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii)
VL  - 74
IS  - 2
SP  - 135-139
AB  - Using a laboratory colony we demonstrated that the body mass (BM) and reproductive organ mass (ROM) of Brandt's voles vary in response to photoperiod and temperature. Male Brandt's voles from 25 days of age were housed under long (14L) or short (10L) photoperiod, which corresponds to seasonal changes in their natural environment. Under 10L, animals housed for the first 7 weeks at 10 degrees C were significantly lighter than those housed at 20 degrees C. This effect was not observed under 14L. However, a change from an initial 10L photoperiod to the 14L photoperiod for the following 9 weeks could compensate the effects of low temperature on BM. Changes in BM in response to photoperiod and/or temperature exposure appeared to be primarily as a result of the deposition or loss of fat-free dry mass and water. For Brandt's voles, ROM was regulated significantly by photoperiod but not by temperature. Taken together, the results suggest that BM and ROM for male Brandt's voles respond selectively to photoperiodic information and temperature. We propose that a compensatory relationship between photoperiod and temperature should be considered in animal physiology research.

TI  - Weapon allometry varies with latitude in the New Zealand giraffe weevil
VL  - 27
IS  - 12
SP  - 2864-2870
AB  - Animal body size commonly shows a relationship with latitude to the degree that this phenomenon is one of the few rules' discussed in evolutionary ecology: Bergmann's rule. Although exaggerated secondary sexual traits frequently exhibit interesting relationships with body size (allometries) and are expected to evolve rapidly in response to environmental variation, the way in which allometry might interact with latitude has not been addressed. We present data showing latitudinal variation in body size and weapon allometry for the New Zealand giraffe weevil (Lasiorhynchus barbicornis). Males display an extremely elongated rostrum used as a weapon during fights for access to females. Consistent with Bergmann's rule, mean body size increased with latitude. More interestingly, weapon allometry also varied with latitude, such that lower latitude populations exhibited steeper allometric slopes between weapon and body size. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document a latitudinal cline in weapon allometry and is therefore a novel contribution to the collective work on Bergmann's rule and secondary sexual trait variation.

These findings raise the question of how genetic diversity changes under strong selection pressures, which will be especially important under ongoing agriculture intensification and climate change.

TI  - Entropy Stress and Scaling of Vital Organs over Life Span Based on Allometric Laws
VL  - 14
IS  - 12
SP  - 2550-2577
AB  - Past theories on total lifetime energy expenditures and entropy generation in biological systems (BS) dealt with whole systems, but the recent literature suggests that the total metabolic rate of a BS, (q) over dot(body) (W) is a sum of product of specific metabolic rate (q) over dot(k,m) (W/kg of organ k) of each vital life organ, k {k = brain, heart, kidney and liver, or abbreviated as BHKL, and rest of the organ mass (R)} and mass of each organ k (m(k)). Using this hypothesis, Kleiber's law on metabolic rate of BS ((q) over dot(body)) for animals of different sizes was validated. In this work, a similar procedure is adopted in estimating total entropy generation rate of whole human body ((sigma) over dot(body), W/K) as a sum of product of specific entropy generation rate for each organ, (sigma) over dot(k,m) (W/{K kg of organ k(.)}) and the organ mass at any given age (t). Further integrating over life span for each organ (t(life)), the lifetime specific entropy generated by organ k, sigma(k,m,life) (J of organ k/ {K kg organ k}) is calculated. Then lifetime entropy generation of unit body mass, sigma(body,M,life) (J/{K kg body mass(.)}) is calculated as a sum of the corresponding values contributed by all vital organs to unit body mass and verified with previously published literature. The higher the sigma(k,m,life), the higher the entropy stress level (which is a measure of energy released by unit organ mass of k as heat) and the irreversibility within the organ, resulting in faster degradation of organ and the consequent health problems for the whole BS. In order to estimate (sigma) over dot(k) (W/K of organ k), data on energy release rate ((q) over dot) is needed over lifetime for each organ. While the Adequate Macronutrients Distribution Range (AMDR)/Adequate Intake (AI) publication can be used in estimating the energy intake of whole body vs. age for the human body, the energy expenditure data is not available at organ level. Hence the sigma(k,m,life) was computed using existing allometric laws developed for the metabolism of the organs, the relation between the m(k) of organ and body mass m(B), and the body mass growth data m(B)(t) over the lifetime. Based on the values of sigma(k,m, life), the organs were ranked from highest to lowest entropy generation and the heart is found to be the most entropy-stressed organ. The entropy stress levels of the other organs are then normalized to the entropy stress level (NESH) of the heart. The NESH values for organs are as follows: Heart: 1.0, Kidney: 0.92, Brain: 0.46, Liver: 0.41, Rest of BS: 0.027. If normalized to rest of body (R), NESR, heart: 37, Kidney: 34, Brain: 17, Liver: 15, Rest of BS: 1.0; so heart will fail first followed by kidney and other organs in order. Supporting data is provided.

VL  - 22

SP  - 2496-2504
AB  - Greater oxygen availability has been hypothesized to be important in allowing the evolution of larger invertebrates during the Earth's history, and across aquatic environments. We tested for evolutionary and developmental responses of adult body size of Drosophila melanogaster to hypoxia and hyperoxia. Individually reared flies were smaller in hypoxia, but hyperoxia had no effect. In each of three oxygen treatments (hypoxia, normoxia or hyperoxia) we reared three replicate lines of flies for seven generations, followed by four generations in normoxia. In hypoxia, responses were due primarily to developmental plasticity, as average body size fell in one generation and returned to control values after one to two generations of normoxia. In hyperoxia, flies evolved larger body sizes. Maximal fly mass was reached during the first generation of return from hyperoxia to normoxia. Our results suggest that higher oxygen levels could cause invertebrate species to evolve larger average sizes, rather than simply permitting evolution of giant species.

TI  - Sublethal Pyrethroid Insecticide Exposure Carries Positive Fitness Effects Over Generations in a Pest Insect
VL  - 9
AB  - Stress tolerance and adaptation to stress are known to facilitate species invasions. Many invasive species are also pests and insecticides are used to control them, which could shape their overall tolerance to stress. It is well-known that heavy insecticide usage leads to selection of resistant genotypes but less is known about potential effects of mild sublethal insecticide usage. We studied whether stressful, sublethal pyrethroid insecticide exposure has within-generational and/or maternal transgenerational effects on fitness-related traits in the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) and whether maternal insecticide exposure affects insecticide tolerance of offspring. Sublethal insecticide stress exposure had positive within-and transgenerational effects. Insecticide-stressed larvae had higher adult survival and higher adult body mass than those not exposed to stress. Furthermore, offspring whose mothers were exposed to insecticide stress had higher larval and pupal survival and were heavier as adults (only females) than those descending from control mothers. Maternal insecticide stress did not explain differences in lipid content of the offspring. To conclude, stressful insecticide exposure has positive transgenerational fitness effects in the offspring. Therefore, unsuccessful insecticide control of invasive pest species may lead to undesired side effects since survival and higher body mass are known to facilitate population growth and invasion success.

AB  - Climate change can drive evolution. This connection is clear both historically and in modern times. The three-lesson curriculum described below provides opportunities for students to make connections between climate change and evolution through various modes of inquiry and self-investigation. Students examine how genetic variation may either facilitate or limit the ability for species to survive changing climates through work with the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Students are asked to layer new understanding of the mechanisms of evolution onto their observations of genetic variation in fruit fly thermotolerance, and then synthesize this information to make predictions regarding the survival of species threatened by climate change.

VL  - 76

SP  - 846-852
AB  - Changes in global temperature and humidity as a result of climate change are producing rapid evolutionary changes in many animal species, including agricultural pests and disease vectors, leading to changes in allele frequencies of genes involved in thermotolerance and desiccation resistance. As some of these genes have pleiotropic effects on insecticide resistance, climate change is likely to affect insecticide resistance in the field. In this review, we discuss how the interactions between adaptation to climate change and resistance to insecticides can affect insecticide resistance in the field using examples in phytophagous and hematophagous pest insects, focusing on the effects of increased temperature and increased aridity. We then use detailed genetic and mechanistic studies in the model insect, Drosophila melanogaster, to explain the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. We suggest that tradeoffs or facilitation between adaptation to climate change and resistance to insecticides can alter insecticide resistance allele frequencies in the field. The dynamics of these interactions will need to be considered when managing agricultural pests and disease vectors in a changing climate. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

TI  - Scaling of Metabolic Scaling within Physical Limits
VL  - 2
IS  - 4
SP  - 425-450
AB  - Both the slope and elevation of scaling relationships between log metabolic rate and log body size vary taxonomically and in relation to physiological or developmental state, ecological lifestyle and environmental conditions. Here I discuss how the recently proposed metabolic-level boundaries hypothesis (MLBH) provides a useful conceptual framework for explaining and predicting much, but not all of this variation. This hypothesis is based on three major assumptions: (1) various processes related to body volume and surface area exert state-dependent effects on the scaling slope for metabolic rate in relation to body mass; (2) the elevation and slope of metabolic scaling relationships are linked; and (3) both intrinsic (anatomical, biochemical and physiological) and extrinsic (ecological) factors can affect metabolic scaling. According to the MLBH, the diversity of metabolic scaling relationships occurs within physical boundary limits related to body volume and surface area. Within these limits, specific metabolic scaling slopes can be predicted from the metabolic level (or scaling elevation) of a species or group of species. In essence, metabolic scaling itself scales with metabolic level, which is in turn contingent on various intrinsic and extrinsic conditions operating in physiological or evolutionary time. The MLBH represents a "meta-mechanism" or collection of multiple, specific mechanisms that have contingent, state-dependent effects. As such, the MLBH is Darwinian in approach (the theory of natural selection is also meta-mechanistic), in contrast to currently influential metabolic scaling theory that is Newtonian in approach (i.e., based on unitary deterministic laws). Furthermore, the MLBH can be viewed as part of a more general theory that includes other mechanisms that may also affect metabolic scaling.

TI  - Insights into cold tolerance in sable (Martes zibellina) from the adaptive evolution of lipid metabolism
VL  - 101
IS  - 6
SP  - 861-870
AB  - The sable (Martes zibellina) is widely distributed in the northern zone of Eurasia. M. zibellina survival requires a better ability to regulate its body temperature than southern-distributed marten species. The genetic basis underlying the adaptive fat mechanism in the sable is unclear. We screened candidate genes related to lipid metabolism and absorption and compared these with orthologous sequences from other carnivores. Our goal was to determine the molecular mechanism underlying the thinner fur layer and determine if the cold adaptation of sables is associated with evolutionary changes in these genes. We found that the PNLIP and ACSS2 genes have received positive selection and the GOT2 gene has undergone rapid evolution. We performed comparative transcriptome sequencing of the sable adipose tissue and found multiple genes with different expression levels. GO enrichment analysis on the differentially expressed genes showed that they were significantly enriched in GO entries, such as lipid metabolism, lipase activity, and glucose metabolism. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways and fatty acid metabolism pathways, indicating significant differences in the metabolic level of adipose tissue in winter and summer.

VL  - 2
IS  - 4
SP  - 239-242
AB  - Forecasts of species range shifts as a result of climate change are essential, because invasions by exotic species shape biodiversity and therefore ecosystem functions and services. Ecologists have focused on propagule pressure (for example, the number of individuals and invasion events), the characteristics of an invading species, and its new abiotic and biotic environment to predict the likelihood of range expansion and invasion. Here, we emphasize the role of photoperiodic response on the range expansion of species. Unlike temperature, the latitudinal gradient of seasonal changes in day length is a stable, abiotic environmental factor that does not change with local or global climate. Predicting range expansions across latitudes and the subsequent consequences for native communities requires a more comprehensive understanding of how species use day length to coordinate seasonal growth, reproduction, physiology and synchronization of life cycles with interacting individuals and species.

TI  - Transgenerational plasticity and the capacity to adapt to low salinity in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica
VL  - 288
IS  - 1951
AB  - Salinity conditions in oyster breeding grounds in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to drastically change due to increased precipitation from climate change and anthropogenic changes to local hydrology. We determined the capacity of the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, to adapt via standing genetic variation or acclimate through transgenerational plasticity (TGP). We outplanted oysters to either a low- or medium-salinity site in Louisiana for 2 years. We then crossed adult parents using a North Carolina II breeding design, and measured body size and survival of larvae 5 dpf raised under low or ambient salinity. We found that TGP is unlikely to significantly contribute to low-salinity tolerance since we did not observe increased growth or survival in offspring reared in low salinity when their parents were also acclimated at a low-salinity site. However, we detected genetic variation for body size, with an estimated heritability of 0.68 +/- 0.25 (95% CI). This suggests there is ample genetic variation for this trait to evolve, and that evolutionary adaptation is a possible mechanism through which oysters will persist with future declines in salinity. The results of this experiment provide valuable insights into successfully breeding low-salinity tolerance in this commercially important species.

TI  - Resolving the consequences of gradual phenotypic plasticity for populations in variable environments
VL  - 91
IS  - 4
AB  - Phenotypic adjustments following environmental change are ubiquitous, and trait changes arising through phenotypic plasticity often lag behind their environmental stimuli. Evolutionary biologists seeking to understand how adaptive plasticity can evolve have extensively studied this phenomenon. However, the ecological consequences of common features of plastic responses to environmental variability, including gradual phenotypic change (i.e., slower than the pace of environmental change), are underappreciated. We present a framework based on the unifying concept of phenotype x environment performance landscapes that encompasses gradual plasticity. Then, we experimentally investigate the environmental contexts where gradual plasticity is important, using freshwater phytoplankton populations exposed to thermal variation. Finally, based on our conceptual framework, we develop a mathematical model of gradual plasticity that explains population dynamics in variable environments better than common alternative models. Understanding and accounting for the ecological effects of plasticity in variable environments is critical to making vital predictions and advancing ecology.

TI  - The role of host seed size in mediating a latitudinal body size cline in an introduced bruchid beetle in Japan
VL  - 121
IS  - 8
SP  - 1231-1238
AB  - A wide variety of animals show latitudinal cline in body size, which can be caused not only by abiotic factors such as temperature but also by biotic ones such as diet quality. In seed feeding insects, adult body size is affected by seed size. Therefore, seed size may be an important factor to explain the latitudinal cline in body size if the seed size also shows a latitudinal cline. In the present study, we detected a latitudinal cline in body size of an alien bruchid, Acanthoscelides pallidipennis, which was introduced into Japan from North America with its host plant Amorpha fruticosa. In 13 out of 24 populations that we collected in Japan, A. fruticosa seeds were infested with A. pallidipennis. Both body size of A. pallidipennis and host seed weight increased with latitude in the infested populations, but not in the non-infested populations. There was a significant positive correlation between body size and seed weight in both field observation and laboratory experiment. In a common environmental condition, there was no significant difference in body size among three latitudinally different populations. Our results show that the latitudinal cline in adult body size of A. pallidipennis across a non-native range could be explained by the latitudinal cline in seed weight of A. fruticosa, but not by genetic differentiation among populations.

TI  - Geographic body size variation in the periodical cicadas Magicicada: implications for life cycle divergence and local adaptation
VL  - 28
IS  - 6
SP  - 1270-1277
AB  - Seven species in three species groups (Decim, Cassini and Decula) of periodical cicadas (Magicicada) occupy a wide latitudinal range in the eastern United States. To clarify how adult body size, a key trait affecting fitness, varies geographically with climate conditions and life cycle, we analysed the relationships of population mean head width to geographic variables (latitude, longitude, altitude), habitat annual mean temperature (AMT), life cycle and species differences. Within species, body size was larger in females than males and decreased with increasing latitude (and decreasing habitat AMT), following the converse Bergmann's rule. For the pair of recently diverged 13- and 17-year species in each group, 13-year cicadas were equal in size or slightly smaller on average than their 17-year counterparts despite their shorter developmental time. This fact suggests that, under the same climatic conditions, 17-year cicadas have lowered growth rates compared to their 13-years counterparts, allowing 13-year cicadas with faster growth rates to achieve body sizes equivalent to those of their 17-year counterparts at the same locations. However, in the Decim group, which includes two 13-year species, the more southerly, anciently diverged 13-year species (Magicicada tredecim) was characterized by a larger body size than the other, more northerly 13- and 17-year species, suggesting that local adaptation in warmer habitats may ultimately lead to evolution of larger body sizes. Our results demonstrate how geographic clines in body size may be maintained in sister species possessing different life cycles.

SP  - 183-188
AB  - This special issue of Evolutionary Applications comprises 15 papers that illustrate how evolutionary principles can inform the conservation and management of salmonid fishes. Several papers address the past evolutionary history of salmonids to gain insights into their likely plastic and genetic responses to future environmental change. The remaining papers consider potential evolutionary responses to climate warming, biological invasions, artificial propagation, habitat alteration, and harvesting. All of these papers consider how such influences might alter selective regimes, which should then favour plastic or genetic responses. Some of the papers then go on to document such responses, at least some of which are genetically based and adaptive. Despite the different approaches and target species, all of the papers argue for the importance of evolutionary considerations in the conservation and management of salmonids.

VL  - 51

SP  - 703-718
AB  - Genetic adaptation to temperature change can impact responses of populations and communities to global warming. Here we integrate previously published results on experimental evolution trials with follow-up experiments involving the water flea Daphnia as a model system. Our research shows (1) the capacity of natural populations of this species to genetically adapt to changes in temperature in a time span of months to years, (2) the context-dependence of these genetic changes, emphasizing the role of ecology and community composition on evolutionary responses to climatic change, and (3) the impact of micro-evolutionary changes on immigration success of preadapted genotypes. Our study involves (1) experimental evolution trials in the absence and presence of the community of competitors, predators, and parasites, (2) life-table and competition experiments to assess the fitness consequences of micro-evolution, and (3) competition experiments with putative immigrant genotypes. We use these observations as building blocks of an evolving metacommunity to understand biological responses to climatic change. This approach integrates both local and regional responses at both the population and community levels. Finally, we provide an outline of current gaps in knowledge and suggest fruitful avenues for future research.

VL  - 1469
IS  - 1
SP  - 38-51
AB  - Although there is considerable optimism surrounding adaptive evolutionary responses to global change, relatively little attention has been paid to maladaptation in this context. In this review, we consider how global change might lead populations to become maladapted. We further consider how populations can evolve to new optima, fail to evolve and therefore remain maladapted, or become further maladapted through trait-driven or eco-evo-driven mechanisms after being displaced from their fitness optima. Our goal is to stimulate thinking about evolution as a "double-edged sword" that comprises both adaptive and maladaptive responses, rather than as a "silver bullet" or a purely adaptive mechanism to combat global change. We conclude by discussing how a better appreciation of environmentally driven maladaptation and maladaptive responses might improve our current understanding of population responses to global change and our ability to forecast future responses.

TI  - Metabolic rates from Bluntnose minnow (Pimephales notatus) populations at lower latitudes are more sensitive to changes in temperature than populations at higher latitudes
VL  - 29
IS  - 2
SP  - 210-219
AB  - Predicting the potential effects of changes in climate on freshwater species requires an understanding of the relationships between physiological traits and environmental conditions among populations. While water temperature is a primary factor regulating metabolic rates in freshwater ectotherms, how metabolic rates vary across the species range is unclear. In addition, photoperiod has also been hypothesised to influence metabolic rates in freshwater taxa based on seasonal changes in activity rates. Using an experimental approach, we investigated whether variation in routine metabolic rate (RMR) and sensitivity of RMR to changes in temperature are correlated with local thermal regimes, photoperiods and body mass among ten populations across the geographic range of the Bluntnose minnow (Pimephales notatus), a North American freshwater fish species. Routine metabolic rate data were collected from populations acclimatised to three temperature treatments (9, 18 and 27 degrees C) and correlated with water temperature and photoperiod estimates at collection locations for each population. Routine metabolic rate was negatively correlated with minimum photoperiod at 9 degrees C, negatively correlated with weekly high temperature at 18 degrees C and positively correlated with weekly high temperature at 27 degrees C. Body mass was also a predictor of RMR at each temperature treatment. Thermal sensitivity of RMR was positively correlated with weekly high temperature, indicating that individuals from warmer low latitude populations experienced greater sensitivity of RMR to changes in temperature than individuals from cooler high latitude populations. These results indicate differential responses among populations to variation in temperature and suggest the importance of recognising this variation when characterising responses of freshwater taxa to increases in water temperature.

TI  - Climate Change and Eco-Evolutionary Dynamics in Food Webs
VL  - 47
SP  - 1-80
AB  - Past evolution determines the genetically determined available phenotypes in populations which affect ecological dynamics in communities, shaping in turn the selective pressures that further model phenotypes. Because an increase in temperature increases metabolic rates and encounter rates, climate change may have profound eco-evolutionary effects, possibly affecting the future persistence and functioning of food webs. We introduce a semi-spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) framework to study functional eco-evolutionary dynamics in food webs. Each species embedded in the web includes 13 genetically determined and multidimensionally variable traits (the G matrix), 4 of which are flexible physiological and behavioural (personality) traits that respond to temperature. An increase in temperature and stronger correlation among traits leads to stronger trophic cascades but higher stochasticity, with higher probability of extinction for some trophic levels. A combination of the abiotic (temperature) and biotic (predators' presence/absence) matrix of selective agents (the O matrix) generates differential selection for activation energies for metabolic rates and several instances of correlational selection (selection in one trait changes with the levels of another), suggesting how global warming might favour certain trait combinations. Our results and the future prospects of this IBM approach open new avenues for climate change research.

VL  - 30

SP  - 259-264
AB  - How will organisms deal with Climate change? Ectotherms such as reptiles and amphibians are especially at risk due to their metabolic ties to the environment and their general inability to migrate with changing climates over short time frames. We modeled the growth response of Three-toed Box Turtles (Terrapene carolina triunguis) to fluctuations in ambient temperature and precipitation. Then we extrapolated this model to climate conditions expected in 2100. We predict that there is less than 20% possibility of hatchling turtles growing during their first year. Reduced annual growth rates during later years may cause earlier termination of growth, smaller standard carapace lengths, and reduced fecundity. These responses are typical of those that stimulate an extinction vortex. These findings provide for a general understanding of how this species and other terrestrial reptiles may respond to climate change. Without reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we could face catastrophic declines in many ectotherms as temperature and rainfall patterns change.

TI  - Laid-back invaders: Cane toads (Rhinella marina) downregulate their stress responses as they colonize a harsh climate
VL  - 24
AB  - In response to encountering abiotic extremes, many organisms exhibit stress responses as measured by levels of corticosterone and heat-shock protein (e.g., HSP70) in the blood. Such responses can enhance organismal viability. How quickly can those responses shift if the organisms encounter novel challenges, as occurs with climate change, or a species' invasion into a new area? We found elevated levels of corticosterone and HSP70 in the blood of cane toads (Rhinella marina) that were desiccated, especially at low temperatures, a response that might jeopardize survival by increasing rates of water loss. Importantly, toads from the climatically equable native range in Brazil showed twofold higher levels of these stress hormones than did toads from the climatically harsh invaded range in Australia. Thus, the toads' invasion of abiotically extreme habitats has been accompanied by a substantial down-regulation of the acute stress response. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

SP  - 625-634
AB  - Hypoxic stress can alter conspecific phenotype and additionally alter phenotypes of the filial generation, for example, via maternal or epigenetic processes. Lasting effects can also be seen across development and generations even after stressors have been removed. This study utilized the model of rapidly developing, parthenogenetic Daphnia to examine the intraspecific variability of response of exposure of a parental generation to hypoxia (4 kPa) within a single clone line across development, across broods, and across generations. Body mass across development and reproductive output were monitored in the parental generation and the first three broods of the first filial generation (which were not directly exposed to hypoxia). O-2 consumption across a wide Po-2 range (normoxia to anoxia) was assessed to determine whether exposure of the parental generation to hypoxia conferred hypoxia tolerance on the offspring and whether this transgenerational, epigenetic phenomenon varied intraspecifically. Differences in mass occurred in both the parental generation (hypoxia-exposed smaller during brood 1 and brood 2 neonate production) and the filial generation (e. g., brood 1 and 2 neonates from hypoxic mothers were initially smaller than control neonates). However, differences in mass were not accompanied by changes in reproductive output (assessed by brood number and neonate size). At day 0, first filial generation brood 1 neonates from hypoxia-exposed mothers had a higher metabolic rate than control neonates. However, this effect, like that of body mass, dissipated with development within a brood but also with subsequent broods. An isometric scaling exponent for was repeatedly observed.

AB  - Competing hypotheses: (1) Large body size confers more efficient energy use (relative efficiency hypothesis) (2) Large body size requires more energy to be sustained, I disadvantage when food is limited (absolute energy demand hypothesis). Organism: Yellow dung flies, Scathophaga stercoraria (Diptera Scathophagidae), artificially selected for large and small body size in the laboratory for 24 generations to augment the available phenotypic body sizes. Methods: Larvae were reared under limited and unlimited food (dung) conditions, and the energy content of pupae was measured at the beginning and the end of the pupal stage in different. size-matched individuals Conclusions: Over the pupal period, lipids and glycogen decreased whereas sugar content increased. Net energy loss per unit body mass was higher at unlimited food contrary to expectation, males (the larger sex) lost less energy than females. Large selection line pupae showed the highest absolute and mass-specific energy loss during metamorphosis, indicating a correlated physiological response to body size selection because phenotypic body sizes do not differ between the lines at limited dung. We conclude that energetic costs due to greater absolute energy demand of larger individuals during the pupal phase outweigh the benefits due to greater metabolic efficiency.

AB  - Populations often face changes in environmental conditions in a relatively short timescale, which may lead to microevolution of traits to cope with these changing selective pressures. Here, we demonstrate microevolution of a physiological trait in a natural population of the water flea Daphnia magna. Levels of the stress protein Hsp60 showed genetic variation, indicating in situ evolutionary potential, and the levels increased through time. The observed microevolutionary increase did not fit the historically documented changes in fish predation pressure in this pond, but it paralleled an increase in the load of infective stages of epibionts through time. In line with this, the locally most abundant epibiont caused an induction of Hsp60. Because stress proteins show evolutionary potential and protect organisms against a wide array of environmental factors, microevolution of stress proteins in natural populations is likely to be common.

TI  - The ecological forecast horizon, and examples of its uses and determinants
VL  - 18
IS  - 7
SP  - 597-611
AB  - Forecasts of ecological dynamics in changing environments are increasingly important, and are available for a plethora of variables, such as species abundance and distribution, community structure and ecosystem processes. There is, however, a general absence of knowledge about how far into the future, or other dimensions (space, temperature, phylogenetic distance), useful ecological forecasts can be made, and about how features of ecological systems relate to these distances. The ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which useful forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental variation, demographic stochasticity and evolution), level of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), and organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial and phylogenetic forecast horizons. Insights from these case studies demonstrate that the ecological forecast horizon is a flexible and powerful tool for researching and communicating ecological predictability. It also has potential for motivating and guiding agenda setting for ecological forecasting research and development.

TI  - Climatic Gradients of Arms Race Coevolution
VL  - 177
IS  - 5
SP  - 562-573
AB  - In nature, spatiotemporally dynamic coevolutionary processes play major roles in the foundation and maintenance of biodiversity. Here, we examined the arms race coevolution involving a seed-eating weevil with a long snout and its camellia plant host with a thick fruit coat (pericarp) throughout the marked climatic gradient observed across the Japanese islands. Results demonstrated that female weevils, which bored holes through camellia pericarps to lay eggs into seeds, had evolved much longer snouts than males, especially in areas in which Japanese camellia pericarps were very thick. The thickness of the plant pericarp was heritable, and the camellia plant evolved a significantly thicker pericarp on islands with the weevil than on islands without it. Across populations with weevils, resource allocation to plant defense increased with increasing annual mean temperature or annual precipitation, thereby geographically differentiating the evolutionary and ecological interactions between the two species. Given that the coevolutionary relationship exhibited appreciable variation across a relatively small range of annual mean temperatures, ongoing global climatic change can dramatically alter the coevolutionary process, thereby changing the ecological interaction between these species.

TI  - Shrinking skinks: lizard body size declines in a long-term forest fragmentation experiment
VL  - 34
IS  - 6
SP  - 1395-1409
AB  - ContextIncreasing rates of habitat fragmentation globally underscore the importance of understanding the full spectrum of fragmentation's ecological consequences. Fragmentation alters the thermal environment of fragments, which may alter the body size of ectothermic organisms and in turn impact survival and reproduction.ObjectivesTo determine whether experimental habitat fragmentation alters body size in the heliothermic, ground-dwelling common garden skink (Lampropholis guichenoti).MethodsWe use body size data spanning 29years to experimentally test the prediction that lizards will experience morphological changes in forest fragments but not in non-fragmented controls.ResultsLizards were smaller in forest fragments relative to those in the non-fragmented controls after the fragmentation treatment was applied. For lizards within forest fragments, the greater the exposure to deforested areas, the greater the decline in body size. This pattern was strongest in the first 5 years following fragmentation and weakened or reversed over time as the pine plantation matrix surrounding the fragments matured. Using sampling site-scale temperature data for the most recent 5years of the experiment, we show that temperature predicts lizard body size. Our findings are consistent with predictions made under the temperature-size rule that ectotherms will be smaller in fragmented landscapes because of temperature increases at newly created edges.ConclusionsOur results raise new concerns about the effects of fragmentation on organisms in remnant patches and offer new research priorities, as more evidence is needed to determine the generality of body size declines in fragmented landscapes. Our results also highlight that body size declines, often attributed to climate change, may be amplified by habitat fragmentation, which has been global in its impact.

TI  - Pedal to the metal: Cities power evolutionary divergence by accelerating metabolic rate and locomotor performance
VL  - 14
IS  - 1
SP  - 36-52
AB  - Metabolic rates of ectotherms are expected to increase with global trends of climatic warming. But the potential for rapid, compensatory evolution of lower metabolic rate in response to rising temperatures is only starting to be explored. Here, we explored rapid evolution of metabolic rate and locomotor performance in acorn-dwelling ants (Temnothorax curvispinosus) in response to urban heat island effects. We reared ant colonies within a laboratory common garden (25 degrees C) to generate a laboratory-born cohort of workers and tested their acute plastic responses to temperature. Contrary to expectations, urban ants exhibited a higher metabolic rate compared with rural ants when tested at 25 degrees C, suggesting a potentially maladaptive evolutionary response to urbanization. Urban and rural ants had similar metabolic rates when tested at 38 degrees C, as a consequence of a diminished plastic response of the urban ants. Locomotor performance also evolved such that the running speed of urban ants was faster than rural ants under warmer test temperatures (32 degrees C and 42 degrees C) but slower under a cooler test temperature (22 degrees C). The resulting specialist-generalist trade-off and higher thermal optimum for locomotor performance might compensate for evolved increases in metabolic rate by allowing workers to more quickly scout and retrieve resources.

TI  - Adaptation, speciation and extinction in the Anthropocene
VL  - 285

AB  - Humans have dramatically altered the planet over the course of a century, from the acidity of our oceans to the fragmentation of our landscapes and the temperature of our climate. Species find themselves in novel environments, within communities assembled from never before encountered mixtures of invasives and natives. The speed with which the biotic and abiotic environment of species has changed has already altered the evolutionary trajectory of species, a trend that promises to escalate. In this article, I reflect upon this altered course of evolution. Human activities have reshaped selection pressures, favouring individuals that better survive in our built landscapes, that avoid our hunting and fishing, and that best tolerate the species that we have introduced. Human-altered selection pressures have also modified how organisms live and move through the landscape, and even the nature of reproduction and genome structure. Humans are also shaping selection pressures at the species level, and I discuss how species traits are affecting both extinction and speciation rates in the Anthropocene.

TI  - Predator declines and morphological changes in prey: evidence from coral reefs depleted of sharks
VL  - 586
SP  - 127-139
AB  - Evidence from the wild as to the ecological and evolutionary consequences of top predator depletions remains limited, especially in marine systems. Given the pace and extent of predator loss, an understanding of these processes is important. Two sets of adjacent coral reef systems off north-western Australia have similar biological, physical and environmental conditions, but one of the reef systems has been exposed to nearly exclusive commercial fishing of sharks. Across reefs where sharks have been depleted, prey fishes had significantly smaller caudal fins and eyes compared to the reefs with intact shark populations (up to 40 and 46% relative difference in standardized means). These patterns were consistent across 7 teleost prey species (N = 611 individuals) that vary in behavior, diet and trophic guild. We hypothesize that these morphological patterns were primarily driven by differences in shark predation. Morphological differences were not consistent with plausible alternative explanations (habitat complexity, temperature, light, current, food availability, prey targets, competition) as primary drivers. These results provide field evidence of morphological changes in prey potentially due to predator depletions consistent with ecological predictions; specifically, predator loss caused a reduction in the size of prey morphological traits associated with predator detection and evasion. While our analysis cannot differentiate between rapid evolutionary change versus morphological plasticity due to shark depletions, either possible outcome would indicate that predator removals may have profound effects on body shapes of prey communities. This is particularly significant in the case of sharks, given that the consequences of their widespread removal have been a topic of significant speculation, debate and concern.

TI  - Cyanobacteria facilitate parasite epidemics in Daphnia
VL  - 97
IS  - 12
SP  - 3422-3432
AB  - The seasonal dominance of cyanobacteria in the phytoplankton community of lake ecosystems can have severe implications for higher trophic levels. For herbivorous zooplankton such as Daphnia, cyanobacteria have poor nutritional value and some species can produce toxins affecting zooplankton survival and reproduction. Here we present another, hitherto largely unexplored aspect of cyanobacteria, namely that they can increase Daphnia susceptibility to parasites. In a 12-yr monthly time-series analysis of the Daphnia community in Greifensee (Switzerland), we observed that cyanobacteria density correlated significantly with the epidemics of a common gut parasite of Daphnia, Caullerya mesnili, regardless of what cyanobacteria species was present or whether it was colonial or filamentous. The temperature from the previous month also affected the occurrence of Caullerya epidemics, either directly or indirectly by the promotion of cyanobacterial growth. A laboratory experiment confirmed that cyanobacteria increase the susceptibility of Daphnia to Caullerya, and suggested a possible involvement of cyanotoxins or other chemical traits of cyanobacteria in this process. These findings expand our understanding of the consequences of toxic cyanobacterial blooms for lake ecosystems and might be relevant for epidemics experienced by other aquatic species.

TI  - Transcriptome profiling reveals mechanisms for the evolution of insect seasonality
VL  - 218
IS  - 22
SP  - 3611-3622
AB  - Rapid evolutionary change in seasonal timing can facilitate ecological speciation and resilience to climate warming. However, the molecular mechanisms behind shifts in animal seasonality are still unclear. Evolved differences in seasonality occur in the European corn borer moth (Ostrinia nubilalis), in which early summer emergence in E-strain adults and later summer emergence in Z-strain adults is explained by a shift in the length of the termination phase of larval diapause. Here, we sample from the developmental time course of diapause in both strains and use transcriptome sequencing to profile regulatory and amino acid changes associated with timing divergence. Within a previously defined quantitative trait locus (QTL), we nominate 48 candidate genes, including several in the insulin signaling and circadian rhythm pathways. Genome-wide transcriptional activity is negligible during the extended Z-strain termination, whereas shorter E-strain termination is characterized by a rapid burst of regulatory changes involved in resumption of the cell cycle, hormone production and stress response. Although gene expression during diapause termination in Ostrinia is similar to that found previously in flies, nominated genes for shifts in timing are species specific. Hence, across distant relatives the evolution of insect seasonality appears to involve unique genetic switches that direct organisms into distinct phases of the diapause pathway through wholesale restructuring of conserved gene regulatory networks.

TI  - City limits: Heat tolerance is influenced by body size and hydration state in an urban ant community
VL  - 10
IS  - 11
SP  - 4944-4955
AB  - Cities are rapidly expanding, and global warming is intensified in urban environments due to the urban heat island effect. Therefore, urban animals may be particularly susceptible to warming associated with ongoing climate change. We used a comparative and manipulative approach to test three related hypotheses about the determinants of heat tolerance or critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in urban ants-specifically, that (a) body size, (b) hydration status, and (c) chosen microenvironments influence CTmax. We further tested a fourth hypothesis that native species are particularly physiologically vulnerable in urban environments. We manipulated water access and determined CTmax for 11 species common to cities in California's Central Valley that exhibit nearly 300-fold variation in body size. There was a moderate phylogenetic signal influencing CTmax, and inter (but not intra) specific variation in body size influenced CTmax where larger species had higher CTmax. The sensitivity of ants' CTmax to water availability exhibited species-specific thresholds where short-term water limitation (8 hr) reduced CTmax and body water content in some species while longer-term water limitation (32 hr) was required to reduce these traits in other species. However, CTmax was not related to the temperatures chosen by ants during activity. Further, we found support for our fourth hypothesis because CTmax and estimates of thermal safety margin in native species were more sensitive to water availability relative to non-native species. In sum, we provide evidence of links between heat tolerance and water availability, which will become critically important in an increasingly warm, dry, and urbanized world that others have shown may be selecting for smaller (not larger) body size.
