VL  - 18

AB  - Results of an analytical study of the performance of geometrically perfect steel columns under fire conditions are presented. The analysis was based on the finite strip method and includes non-linear material characteristics as functions of temperature. Results obtained using different models of such functions are compared, demonstrating very significant variation in predicted behaviour. The influence of slenderness ratio was studied and shown to be a major factor controlling the failure temperature, whilst the effect of residual stress levels on column failure is little different from that at ambient temperature. Local buckling behaviour was also investigated. The results suggest that this mode of failure may be rather more critical for columns in fire than at ambient temperature. The effect of partial protection provided by blocking-in the column web was investigated. This shows that although there is relatively little improvement in failure temperature, significantly longer survival times are achieved using this form of construction. Although the study is not comprehensive, some useful indications are provided for future generation of practical design rules.

AB  - Berkeley Lab has been developing the Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model for several years. Given load curves for energy services requirements in a building microgrid (mu center dot grid), fuel costs and other economic inputs, and a menu of available technologies, the model finds the optimum equipment fleet and operating schedule. This capability is being applied using a Software as a Service (SaaS) model. The evolution of this approach is demonstrated by description of four past and present projects: (1) a public access web site focused on solar photovoltaic generation and battery viability for large non-residential customers; (2) a building CO2 emissions reduction operations problem for a university dining hall with potential investments considered; (3) a battery and rolling operating schedule problem for a large county jail; and (4) the direct control of the solar-assisted heating ventilation and air conditioning system of a university building by providing optimised daily schedules that are automatically implemented in the building's energy management and control system. Together these examples show that optimisation of building grid design and operation can be effectively achieved using SaaS.

TI  - Chemicals and microbes in bioaerosols from reaction tanks of six wastewater treatment plants: survival factors, generation sources, and mechanisms
VL  - 8
AB  - Sampling was conducted from biochemical reaction tanks of six municipal wastewater treatment plants in the Yangtze River and Zhujiang deltas and the Jing-Jin-Ji region to assess their morphology, level, and composition. Morphological observations suggested that particles were scattered amorphously with C, O, and Si as the major elements. Bioaerosols are composed of spatially varying levels of microorganisms and chemicals. As the sampling height increased, the level of the components in the bioaerosols decreased. Wastewater in the biochemical reaction tanks was identified as an important source of bioaerosols using SourceTracker analysis. The aerosolization of film drops produced by bursting of bubbles was the main reason for the generation of bioaerosols. Increasing the aeration rate of water may promote bioaerosol generation. Relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, and solar illumination influenced the survival of bioaerosols. Large particle sedimentation and wind diffusion significantly decreased the atmospheric aerosol concentration. When the sampling point height increased from 0.1 m to 3.0 m, the concentrations of the microorganisms and total suspended particles decreased by 23.71% and 38.74%, respectively. Considerable attention should be paid to the control of total suspended particles and microorganisms in bioaerosols.

TI  - Insect seasonality: circle map analysis of temperature-driven life cycles
VL  - 67
IS  - 3
SP  - 161-179
AB  - Maintaining an adaptive seasonality, with life cycle events occurring at appropriate times of year and in synchrony with cohorts and ephemeral resources, is a basic ecological requisite for many cold-blooded organisms. There are many mechanisms for synchronizing developmental milestones, such as egg laying (oviposition), egg hatching, cocoon opening, and the emergence of adults. These are often irreversible, specific to particular life stages, and include diapause, an altered physiological state which can be reversed by some synchronizing environmental cue (e.g. photoperiod). However, many successful organisms display none of these mechanisms for maintaining adaptive seasonality. In this paper, we briefly review the mathematical relationship between environmental temperatures and developmental timing and discuss the consequences of viewing these models as circle maps from the cycle of yearly oviposition dates and temperatures to oviposition dates for subsequent generations. Of particular interest biologically are life cycles which are timed to complete in exactly 1 year, or univoltine cycles. Univoltinism, associated with reproductive success for many temperate species, is related to stable fixed points of the developmental circle map. Univoltine fixed points are stable and robust in broad temperature bands, but lose stability suddenly to maladaptive cycles at the edges of these bands. Adaptive seasonality may therefore break down with little warning with constantly increasing or decreasing temperature change, as in scenarios for global warming. These ideas are illustrated and explored in the context of Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) occurring in the marginal thermal habitat of central Idaho's Rocky Mountains. Applications of these techniques have not been widely explored by the applied math community, but are likely to provide great insight into the response of biological systems to climate change.

TI  - Holistic Approach for the Optimization of Industrial Hybrid Energy Hubs with MILP
VL  - 48
SP  - 1375-1380
AB  - This work presents a holistic approach for the optimization of Energy Hubs with mixed integer linear programming for industrial applications. As a use case, a chipboard production plant is used, which produces different products depending on current orders. The use case includes units for power and steam generation, energy conversion, energy and material storages as well as continuous and batch production machines. Additionally, power is sold to the grid and energy in form of heat covers the demand of two district heating suppliers. To model and optimize such extensive industrial systems efficiently, a generic and modular modelling approach is proposed. The entire process is modelled based on five generic modules, which can be configured for specific tasks. To evaluate the viability of the proposed approach, three different scenarios within the industrial use case (without storage, with thermal energy storage, with material storage) were optimized. The results show, that this approach is well suited for scheduling and the assessment of process design improvements of existing industrial plants, due to its easily adaptable modular structure and the ability to use simple data-driven models.

TI  - Climate effect of an integrated wheat production and bioenergy system with Low Temperature Circulating Fluidized Bed gasifier
VL  - 160
SP  - 511-520
AB  - When removing biomass residues from the agriculture for bioenergy utilization, the nutrients and carbon stored within these "residual resources" are removed as-well. To mitigate these issues the energy industry must try to conserve and not destroy the nutrients. The paper analyses a novel integration between the agricultural system and the energy system through the Low Temperature Circulating Fluidized Bed (LT-CFB) gasifier from the perspective of wheat grain production and electricity generation using wheat straw, where the effects of removing the straw from the agricultural system are assessed along with the effects of recycling the nutrients and carbon back to the agricultural system. The methods used to assess the integration was Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with IPCC's 2013 100 year global warming potential (GWP) as impact assessment method. The boundary was set from cradle to gate with two different functional units, kg grain and kW h electricity produced in Zealand, Denmark. Two cases were used in the analysis: 1. nutrient balances are regulated by mineral fertilization and 2. the nutrient balances are regulated by yield. The analysis compare three scenarios of gasifier operation based on carbon conversion to two references, no straw removal and straw combustion. The results show that the climate effect of removing the straws are mitigated by the carbon soil sequestration with biochar, and electricity and district heat substitution. Maximum biochar production outperforms maximum heat and power generation for most substituted electricity and district heating scenarios. Irrespective of the substituted technologies, the carbon conversion needs to be 80-86% to fully mitigate the effects of removing the straws from the agricultural system. This concludes that compromising on energy efficiency for biochar production can be beneficial in terms of climate change effect of an integrated wheat production and bioenergy system.

AB  - The mite Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks) constitutes one of the main pest of grape crop at the Submedio Sao Francisco Valley. The objective of this work was to study the biology of the broad mite Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks), to determine its thermal requirements and its fertility life table in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) cv. Italy. Acclimatized chambers (BOD) were used, adjusted to the temperatures of 18, 22, 25, 28 and 32 degrees C, relative humidity of 65 +/- 10% and alternated light of 12h. Egg-adult period was 3.4 and 6.8 days for males and 3.5 and 7.4 days for females, respectively at 32 degrees C and 18 degrees C. At the temperatures of 18, 25 and 32 degrees C, each female deposited, respectively, 16.5, 44.3 and 13.3 eggs. The stages of egg, larva and pupa and egg-adult period presented, respectively, thermal thresholds of 11.23, 9.45, 12.19, and 9.71 degrees C and thermal constant of 28.51, 14.59, 8.33, and 62.73 degrees-day. The mean duration of one generation (T) was 25.6, 10.8 and 8.2 days, respectively, at the temperatures of 18, 25 and 32 degrees C. The net reproductive rate (R-0) at the temperature of 25 degrees C was the highest, corresponding to an increase of 30.12 times at each generation. The intrinsic rate of population increase (r(m)) was 0.10 (18 degrees C), 0.31 (25 degrees C) and 0.12 (32 degrees C) and the finite ratio of population increase (lambda) was 1.10 (18 degrees C), 1.36 (25 degrees C) and 1.13 (32 degrees C). According to the mean temperature values, P latus can have 95 and 99 generations/year, respectively, for the municipal districts of Petrolina, PE and Juazeiro, BA.

TI  - The Adaptability of Life on Earth and the Diversity of Planetary Habitats
VL  - 8
AB  - The evolutionary adaptability of life to extreme environments is astounding given that all life on Earth is based on the same fundamental biochemistry. The range of some physicochemical parameters on Earth exceeds the ability of life to adapt, but stays within the limits of life for other parameters. Certain environmental conditions such as low water availability in hyperarid deserts on Earth seem to be close to the limit of biological activity. A much wider range of environmental parameters is observed on planetary bodies within our Solar System such as Mars or Titan, and presumably even larger outside of our Solar System. Here we review the adaptability of life as we know it, especially regarding temperature, pressure, and water activity. We use then this knowledge to outline the range of possible habitable environments for alien planets and moons and distinguish between a variety of planetary environment types. Some of these types are present in our Solar System, others are hypothetical. Our schematic categorization of alien habitats is limited to life as we know it, particularly regarding to the use of solvent (water) and energy source (light and chemical compounds).

VL  - 99

AB  - Laboratory bioassays were conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of seven populations (strains) of the confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), to five commercially available diatomaceous earth (DE) formulations: Insecto, Protect-It, Protector, PyriSec, and SilicoSec. These DEs were applied on wheat, Tiiticum durum Desf., at two dose rates, 500 and 1000 ppm. The six beetle strains were obtained from Denmark, United Kingdom, Greece, Germany, Italy, and Portugal, whereas a seventh strain came from the Greek strain after laboratory selection with SilicoSec-treated wheat for six generations. Adults of the above-mentioned strains were exposed for 7 d to wheat treated with each DE formulation, and mortality was assessed after exposure. For all DE-dose combinations, significant differences were noted in mortality levels among strains. Generally, the strains from Denmark, United Kingdom, and Germany were the most susceptible to the DEs used, whereas the strain from Portugal was the least susceptible. No significant differences were noted in susceptibility level between the initial Greek strain and the laboratory-selected Greek strain, with the exception of Protector, where the selected strain was significantly more tolerant than the initial strain for both dose rates tested.

TI  - A new adaptive Boltzmann selection schedule SDS
SP  - 183-190
AB  - FDA (the Factorized Distribution Algorithm) is an evolutionary algorithm that combines mutation and recombination by using a distribution. The distribution is estimated from a set of selected points. It is then used to generate new points for the next generation. In general a distribution defined for n binary variables has 2(n) parameters. Therefore it is too expensive to compute. For additively decomposed discrete functions (ADFs) there exists an algorithm that factors the distribution into conditional and marginal distributions, each of which can be computed in polynomial time. Previously, we have shown a convergence theorem for FDA. But it is only valid using Boltzmann selection. Boltzmann selection was not used in practice because a good annealing schedule was lacking. Using a Taylor expansion of the average fitness of the Boltzmann distribution, we have developed an adaptive annealing schedule called SDS (standard deviation schedule) that is introduced in this work. The inverse temperature beta is changed inversely proportional to the standard deviation.

TI  - Effects of cryopreservation techniques on the preservation of ear skin - An alternative approach to conservation of jaguar, Panthera onca (Linnaeus, 1758)
VL  - 88
SP  - 15-22
AB  - Currently, it has been observed that a considerable segment of the jaguar population is declining mainly because of hunting, and destruction and fragmentation of habitat. Given this scenario, efforts of the scientific community have been concentrated on the development of conservation strategies, such as the formation and use of somatic sample banks. We aimed to assess the effects of cryopreservation techniques of the ear skin of jaguar [slow freezing (SF) or direct vitrification in cryovials (DVC) or solid-surface vitrification (SSV)] on the morphological analysis and cell ability during the culture. All cryopreserved fragments regardless of the technique used, showed a reduction in the dermis and total thickness of the skin. Although a collagen matrix similar to the control group (fresh) has been observed only for the fragments from SF and SSV groups, all cryopreserved techniques were able to maintain normal patterns of the fibroblasts. Moreover, DVC and SSV methods maintained the proliferative activity of the tissues even after warming. After the culture, SF and SSV techniques were efficient for the recovery of the somatic cells according to most of the evaluated parameters, especially with regard to the duration of culture and cell metabolic activity. In conclusion, SSV was found to be a more efficient technique for cryopreserving jaguar skin when compared to DVC and SF. These results are relevant for the formation of somatic resource banks of this species, directed at cryopreserving adequate samplings of different individuals and generations for future applications in regenerative medicine, and assisted reproductive technologies.

AB  - Effects of sex, mating status and temperature on flight activity of the Oriental tea tortrix, Homona magnanima, were evaluated by a computer-aided flight mill system. Adult moths reared through 22 to 25 generations were used to measure flight activity. Two to 8 day-old, females always flew more than males. It is likely that survival and flight duration of males were reduced due to exhaustion resulting from flight behavior. Mating status, whether mated or unmated, did not affect flight activity in either sex. Females showed high flight ability within the temperature range from 15 to 23 degrees C, and their flight activity and survival greatly decreased at temperatures over 25.5 degrees C.

TI  - Development of a New Baking Furnace Design Without Headwall to Increase Anode Production Capacity
SP  - 1257-1267
AB  - Anode baking furnaces are a key component of the manufacturing process of prebaked anodes used for aluminium production. Green anodes are loaded into pits before being submitted to high temperature in order to meet resistivity and chemical reactivity specifications. These pits are separated from each other by fluewalls and headwalls made of dense refractory material. In order to answer to the need for productivity increase and cost reduction, a new generation of design for baking furnace without headwalls has been developed. From the proof of concept and the first tests realized in Rio Tinto Aluminium Grande Baie plant (UGB) to the industrial prototype implemented at Bell Bay Aluminium (BBA), this paper presents the different phases undertaken to successfully develop and test this breakthrough technology. The adaptations made to the operation sequences and the specific tools used to operate the industrial prototype will be described as well as the performance achieved to date at the two sites. Finally, the paper concludes with a summary of the benefits of this technology depending on the scenario of implementation on greenfield or brownfield projects.

VL  - 23
IS  - 7
SP  - 1143-1158
AB  - Phenological shifts are widely reported for different species as a response to climate change. Still, the efficiency of this mechanism is questioned because of the accelerated rate of change and the different change patterns of various climate parameters that may cause mismatches. Here, using loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) as model species, we examined whether phenological shifts could be an effective adaptive strategy over the critical period that determines reproductive output in the Mediterranean region. We compared the rate of temperature and precipitation change over the recent past (1971-2015) and future periods (2016-2060) along the 45 main nesting sites of the Mediterranean population, during the incubation period. Next, utilizing predictions of an earlier nesting season, we evaluated whether the timing of incubation will impact offspring survival on the Mediterranean population. To further assess species vulnerability, we investigated any potential relationship between hatching success and climate parameters at the largest Mediterranean nesting rookery (Zakynthos, Greece). We found that phenological changes would allow species to capture a thermal window similar to one they experience nowadays during the incubation period. Still, phenological shifts might be less adequate to follow precipitation changes, which however, were found to have a limited impact upon hatching success. Global adaptation management strategies should be directed towards (a) acquisition of long-term high-resolution temperature and precipitation series at nesting sites, (b) developing early warning systems to prevent negative impacts upon reproductive outputs, and (c) directly applying cooling of the nests when first altered climate signs are detected.

TI  - Global liquefied natural gas expansion exceeds demand for coal-to-gas switching in paris compliant pathways
VL  - 17
IS  - 6
AB  - The shift from coal to natural gas in the power sector has led to significant reductions in carbon emissions. The shale revolution that led to this shift is now fueling a global expansion in liquefied natural gas (LNG) export infrastructure. In this work, we assess the viability of global LNG expansion to reduce global carbon emissions through coal-to-gas switching in the power sector under three temperature targets-Paris compliant 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C, and business-as-usual 3 degrees C. In the near to medium term (pre-2035), LNG-derived coal-to-gas substitution reduces global carbon emissions across all temperature targets as there is significantly more coal power generation than the LNG required to substitute it. However, we find that long-term planned LNG expansion is not compatible with the Paris climate targets of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C-here, the potential for emissions reductions from LNG through coal-to-gas switching is limited by the availability of coal-based generation. In a 3 degrees C scenario, high levels of coal-based generation through mid-century make LNG an attractive option to reduce emissions. Thus, expanding LNG infrastructure can be considered as insurance against the potential lack of global climate action to limit temperatures to 1.5 degrees C or 2 degrees C. In all scenarios analyzed, low upstream methane leakage and high coal-to-gas substitution are critical to realize near-term climate benefits. Large-scale availability of carbon capture technology could significantly extend the climate viability of LNG. Investors and governments should consider stranded risk assets associated with potentially shorter lifetimes of LNG infrastructure in a Paris-compatible world.

AB  - We studied the reproductive biology and adaptability of the alien freshwater crangonyctid amphipod Crangonyx floridanus, currently inhabiting a large portion of Japan, both in the field and under controlled laboratory conditions. In the Chikuma River population of this alien amphipod, egg-bearing individuals were found throughout the year. In terms of egg maturation cycle, egg development (during embryogenesis), and egg count per ovipositional cycle, these amphipods display a very efficient reproductive system. This study also established their adaptability to a wide range of water temperatures (primarily 4-20 degrees C, however in some cases, these individuals are able to survive at up to 30 degrees C). C. floridanus's strong capacity to adapt to broad and variable environmental conditions is certainly contributing to its high rate of population increase, and rapid dispersion throughout Japan.

TI  - Evolution of pathology techniques for evaluating energy-based tissue effects
VL  - 8584
AB  - The development of minimally invasive energy-based medical technologies continues to change the practice of medicine. The science behind their associated tissue effects has been better elucidated, in part due to improved histopathologic methods. These pathology techniques for evaluating thermal tissue changes evolved from gross observations to microscopic evaluations to viability staining. Further, these individual histopathology methods have been adapted specifically for high dose ablative versus low dose ablative versus non-ablative rejuvenation and hyperthermic versus cryothermic applications. A review of current pathology techniques should enhance their application to the continued development of medical devices.

TI  - Real-time appraisal of the spatially distributed heat related health risk and energy demand of cities
VL  - 9688
AB  - The Urban Heat Island (UHI) is an adverse environmental effect of urbanization that increases the energy demand of cities, impacts the human health, and intensifies and prolongs heatwave events. To facilitate the study of UHIs the Institute for Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing of the National Observatory of Athens (IAASARS/NOA) has developed an operational real-time system that exploits remote sensing image data from Meteosat Second Generation - Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG-SEVIRI) and generates high spatiotemporal land surface temperature (LST) and 2 m air temperature (TA) time series. These datasets form the basis for the generation of higher value products and services related to energy demand and heat-related health issues. These products are the heatwave hazard (HZ); the HUMIDEX (i.e. an index that describes the temperature felt by an individual exposed to heat and humidity); and the cooling degrees (CD; i.e. a measure that reflects the energy needed to cool a building). The spatiotemporal characteristics of HZ, HUMIDEX and CD are unique (1 km/5 min) and enable the appraisal of the spatially distributed heat related health risk and energy demand of cities. In this paper, the real time generation of the high spatiotemporal HZ, HUMIDEX and CD products is discussed. In addition, a case study corresponding to Athens' September 2015 heatwave is presented so as to demonstrate their capabilities. The overall aim of the system is to provide high quality data to several different end users, such as health responders, and energy suppliers. The urban thermal monitoring web service is available at http://snf-652558.vm.okeanos.grnet.gr/treasure/portal/info.html.

TI  - Phenotypic variance, plasticity and heritability estimates of critical thermal limits depend on methodological context
VL  - 23
IS  - 1
SP  - 133-140
AB  - Biologists have long been concerned with measuring thermal performance curves and limits because of their significance to fitness. Basic experimental design may have a marked effect on the outcome of such measurements, and this is true especially of the experimental rates of temperature change used during assessments of critical thermal limits to activity. To date, the focus of work has almost exclusively been on the effects of rate variation on mean values of the critical limits. If the rate of temperature change used in an experimental trial affects not only the trait mean but also its variance, estimates of heritable variation would also be profoundly affected. Moreover, if the outcomes of acclimation are likewise affected by methodological approach, assessment of beneficial acclimation and other hypotheses might also be compromised. In this article, we determined whether this is the case for critical thermal limits using a population of the model species Drosophila melanogaster and the invasive ant species Linepithema humile. We found that effects of the different rates of temperature change are variable among traits and species. However, in general, different rates of temperature change resulted in different phenotypic variances and different estimates of heritability, presuming that genetic variance remains constant. We also found that different rates resulted in different conclusions regarding the responses of the species to acclimation, especially in the case of L. humile. Although it seems premature to dismiss past generalities concerning interspecific and acclimation-related variation in critical thermal limits, we recommend that conditions during trials be appropriately selected, carefully reported and rigorously controlled.

VL  - 51

AB  - The paper reports a study focused on breeding new rapidly growing and heat-tolerant strains in a commercially important Asian bivalve, Sinonovacula constricta. To breed a new strain of S. constricta with fast growth and high temperature tolerance, complete diallel crosses were carried out using three different geographical culture populations from Zhejiang (Z), Fujian (F) and Guangdong (G) provinces, China. Larval and spat growth and the survival and heat tolerance of spats were compared in detail. The experimental serial growth traits extracted from larval and spat measurements (shell length and shell height) indicated that there was no difference between six hybrid crosses and parental crosses at the larval stage; while at the spat stage, some differences were observed. The hybrid crosses ZF (Z female x F male), ZG (Z female x G male) and FG (F female x G male) outperformed the parental groups in shell length at the end of intermediate culture, with lengths of 21.77 +/- 0.28 mm, 21.55 +/- 0.29 mm and 21.44 +/- 0.20 mm respectively. For spat survival rate, the hybrid cross ZF (Z female x F male) had a significantly larger value (88.89 +/- 4.16%) than all the other groups, and the hybrid cross ZG (Z female x G male) had a significantly larger rate than the cross GZ (G female x Z male) and parental crosses ZZ (Z female x Z male) and GG (G female x G male). The hybrid crosses ZF (Z female x F male), ZG (Z female x G male) and FG (F female x G male) exceeded the parental groups in heat tolerance, but there was no significant difference. The growth, survival and heat tolerance results showed that the crosses ZF, ZG and FG in this study were the best hybridization combinations for genetic improvement, which could have significant implications for the development of razor clam aquaculture. This work provides a theoretical basis for breeding new varieties (strains) that grow rapidly and are heat tolerant.

VL  - 107

SP  - 490-497
AB  - Populations of Diaptomus leptopus (Copepocia: Calanoida) and other calanoid copepods exhibit varying degrees of sexual size dimorphism. We examined whether intraspecific or interspecific variation in dimorphism could be explained by allometry, and we examined the relationship between adult size attained and development rate to determine, any relationship between the two. We compared the degree of sexual size dimorphism in D. leptopus and in other calanoid copepods inhabiting temporary and permanent habitats. Allometry did not explain variation in sexual size dimorphism within or among populations or among species. Permanence of habitat affected the degree of dimorphism: dimorphism was greater within and among species inhabiting temporary environments. Non-significant differences in development rate were found among populations and significant differences were found between sexes of D. leptopus when reared under identical laboratory conditions: males developed more rapidly than females but there was no general relationship between development rate and adult size. Potential adaptive hypotheses to explain the differences between populations inhabiting temporary and permanent habitats are discussed.

VL  - 43
IS  - 2
SP  - 221-228
AB  - In general, a thermoelectric converter exhibits low conversion efficiency due to the relatively small dimensionless figure of merit (zT less than or equal to 1) of currently available thermoelectric materials. This limits its application to specialised areas. Attempts to improve its economic viability have primarily focused on improving the conversion efficiency by increasing the figure of merit of thermoelectric materials, with only marginal success. A novel idea, which provides an alternative solution to overcome the low efficiency drawback, is to operate the thermoelectric converter in a combined heat and power generation mode (cogeneration). In this paper, a thermoelectric incorporated cogeneration system is proposed, and its key elements and advantages discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this review is to highlight the important role that dye and pigment colorants play in the areas of image generation, image storage, and image output with respect to digital still images. Colorants in the form of dyes and pigments play an integral part in the digital still imaging process, from the initial conversion of the original greyscale image into a full-colour RGB additive image, followed by electronic image storage, and finally to hard-copy output via non-impact printing technologies such as inkjet and thermal dye transfer. In addition, both dyes and pigments are also utilised for image generation in the fast-developing world of electronic paper display technologies. Dyes and pigments were the mainstay of many of the early analogue photographic processes in the areas of image capture and image reproduction, and this review sets out to show that, in the new age of digital imaging, this situation is still prevalent.

VL  - 100
IS  - 4
SP  - 374-381
AB  - One of the most important factors that determine the evolutionary trajectory of a suite of traits in a population is the structure of the genetic variance-covariance matrix (G). We studied the cyclically parthenogenetic aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, whose populations exhibit two types of reproductive lineages respectively specialized in sexuality (that is, cyclically parthenogenetic lineages) and in asexuality (that is, obligate parthenogenetic lineages). We compared the quantitative genetics of life histories in these two lineage types. Our results suggest that both, the elements and the whole structure of the resulting G matrices differ in the very short term, between lineage types. This would involve the evolution toward different evolutionary optima in the same population, depending on whether sexual or asexual lineages predominate. Since sexual and asexual lineages vary seasonally in their abundance, a fluctuating selective regime has been proposed for this species, which would contribute to the maintenance of the reproductive polymorphism that these populations exhibit.

VL  - 5
IS  - 8
SP  - 1661-1669
AB  - Cell alignment in muscle, nervous tissue, and cartilage is requisite for proper tissue function; however, cell sheeting techniques using the thermosensitive polymer poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAAm) can only produce anisotropic cell sheets with delicate and resource-intensive modifications. We hypothesized that electrospinning, a relatively simple and inexpensive technique to generate aligned polymer fibers, could be used to fabricate anisotropic PNIPAAm and poly(caprolactone) (PCL) blended surfaces that both support cell viability and permit cell sheet detachment via PNIPAAm dissolution. Aligned electrospun PNIPAAm/PCL fibers (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% PNIPAAm) were electrospun and characterized. Fibers ranged in diameter from 1-3 mu m, and all fibers had an orientation index greater than 0.65. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to confirm the relative content of PNIPAAm and PCL. For advancing water contact angle and mass loss studies, only high PNIPAAm-content fibers (75% and greater) exhibited, temperature-dependent properties like 100% PNIPAAm fibers, whereas 25% and 50% PNIPAAm fibers behaved similarly to PCL-only fibers. 3T3 fibroblasts seeded on all PNIPAAm/ PCL fibers had high cell viability and spreading except for the 100% PNIPAAm fibers. Cell sheet detachment by incubation with cold medium was successful only for 90% PNIPAAm fibers, which had a sufficient amount of PCL to allow cell attachment and spreading but not enough to prevent detachment upon PNIPAAm dissolution. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using anisotropic electrospun PNIPAAm/ PCL fibers to generate aligned cell sheets that can potentially better recapitulate anisotropic architecture to achieve proper tissue function.

VL  - 66

SP  - 223-233
AB  - There is an increasing interest in perennial grasses as a renewable source of bioenergy and feedstock for second-generation cellulosic biofuels. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and miscanthus (Miscanthusxgiganteus), belonging to the parennial grasses group, are the major lignocellulosic materials being studied today as sources for direct energy production, biofuels, bioremediation and other. They have the ability to grow at low cost on marginal land where they will not compete with the traditional food crops. Miscanthusxgiganteus possesses a number of advantages in comparison with the other potential energy crops such as are: high yields, low moisture content at harvest, high water and nitrogen use efficiencies, low need for annual agronomic inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides, high cellulose content, non-invasive character, low susceptibility to pests and diseases and broad adaptation to temperate growing environments. The main problems are low rate of survival during the first winter after the creation of plantation and the relatively high establishment costs. Miscanthusxgiganteus is grown primarily for heat and electricity generation but can also be used to produce transport fuels. Miscanthus biomass has a very good combustion quality due to its low water concentration as well as its low Cl, K, N, S and ash concentrations compared to other lignocellulose plants. It is expected that miscanthus will provide cheaper and more sustainable source of cellulose for production of bioethanol than annual crops such as corn. Miscanthus has great promise as a renewable energy source, but it can only be realised when the grass production has been optimised for large-scale commercial cultivation. However, further research is still needed to optimise agronomy of miscanthus, to develop the production chain and pre-treatment as well as to optimise energy conversation route to produce heat, electricity, and/or fuels from biomass, if miscanthus is to compete with fossil fuel use and be widely produced.

VL  - 41

SP  - 657-664
AB  - Microplitis manilae Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), a larval parasitoid, is a potential biological control agent of both Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) and Spodoptera litura (F.) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Aspects of the climatic requirements for development, including survival, longevity, and fecundity of M. manilae were studied at six constant temperature regimes (17, 20, 23, 26, 29, and 32 degrees C) in the laboratory. The results showed that developmental duration for egg, larva, pupa, and the entire immature stages shortened in response to temperature increasing from 17 to 32 degrees C. Survival rates of different developmental stages were higher at 20-29 degrees C than at other temperatures. Longevity of M. manilae adults shortened with increasing temperature. The maximum fecundity of M. manilae female equaled 261.0 eggs/female at 26 degrees C. Minimum threshold temperature and effective accumulated temperature for completing a generation of M. manilae were 11.04 degrees C and 205.98 degrees-days, respectively. Both intrinsic rate of increase (r) and finite rate of increase (lambda) of M. manilae did not differ between 26 and 29 degrees C, but those were significantly higher at 26 and 29 degrees C than at any other temperatures. The highest net reproduction rate (R-0) was observed at 26 degrees C, with the value of 97.77, but the lowest was 11.79 at 32 degrees C. These results suggest that the parasitoid is well adapted to temperate and subtropical climates, which implies a significant potential for using M. manilae to control S. exigua because most of areas occupied by these two pests belong to temperate and subtropical regions in southeastern Asia.

AB  - Water scarcity is the biggest survival challenge for the current generation, and atmospheric water condensation can be a solution. This paper presents the results of a numerical and experimental evaluation of a novel thermoelectric air duct dehumidifier system (TE-ADD) installed on a test chamber. The subject system, made of twenty-four thermoelectric modules along with heat sinks and fans, was used to produce freshwater by extracting moisture from ambient air. The performance of the system was evaluated as a function of the input power and the airflow rate. The results show that the water condensate production increases and the optimal value is achieved for an input power to the TE-ADD system of 6 A at 5 V. A further increase of the input power adversely affects the performance of the system. The condensate production also depends on the flow rate of the air. The optimal flow rate of air at an input current of 5 A and 6 A is 0.011 kg/s. Thus, this system solves two critical environmental issues, i.e., decrease of the thermal load and freshwater production, simultaneously.

VL  - 131
IS  - 2
SP  - 197-212
AB  - The susceptibility of populations of the summer fruit tortrix moth, Adoxophyes orana, from apple orchards in Kent, England, to chlorpyrifos was determined in 1992, 1994 and 1995, by topically dosing larvae feeding on leaves or adults adhered to pheromone trap sticky bases. LD50 values (range 6.3 to 23.2 ng chlorpyrifos per individual) for first or second generation males, second generation females or for first generation fourth instar larvae collected in the field were significantly greater (2-3 fold) for populations from orchards with a long history of treatment with broad-spectrum organophosphorus and other insecticides than for those from untreated orchards (range 1.6 to 8.1 ng chlorpyrifos per individual), though there was considerable variation between sites and years. Twelve replicated orchard experiments between 1993 and 1995 were used to examine a range of different strategies for insecticidal control. Applications of chlorpyrifos against overwintered larvae feeding in trusses in spring gave, at best, a 75% reduction in larval numbers, insufficient to prevent damage by the subsequent generation in summer. However, two applications of fenoxycarb (one immediately pre-and one immediately post-blossom of apple cv. Cox) completely prevented successful subsequent development of the pest, and a single (post-blossom) spray nearly so. The timing of application of chlorpyrifos against first generation larvae hatching from eggs in June was shown to be critical and currently used methods of spray-timing were unreliable. The effective persistence of chlorpyrifos was short (<7 days). Though good control could be achieved with a single spray, a better strategy was to apply a series of sprays at 7-day intervals to cover the egg hatch period. Sprays of Bacillus thuringiensis at the same timing intervals gave, maximally, an 80% reduction in larval numbers, but usually less: improved control was not achieved by applying a programme of sprays compared to a single spray, though a novel, more potent, formulation was significantly more active. Triazophos was also effective as an egg hatch spray. Sprays of chlorpyrifos or tebufenozide between late September and mid-October 1995 against second or third instar larvae migrating to overwintering sites before diapause, failed to reduce significantly the numbers of subsequent overwintering larvae or the numbers that emerged to feed on blossom trusses in spring.

TI  - Model-based evaluation of a chemical looping combustion plant for energy generation at a pre-commercial scale of 100 MWth
VL  - 76
SP  - 323-331
AB  - Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is an emerging combustion technology with an inherent separation of the greenhouse gas CO2. The feasibility of CLC has been proven in various small-scale units worldwide, but the large-scale realization of theoretical or small-scale units is still lacking due to many technical challenges. Most of the existing CLC installations use a configuration of two interacting fluidized bed reactors, and even though the fluidized bed technology is mature and well-established, a high level of uncertainty is included in the attempts to up-scale the reactor system involved in CLC. For progressive scale-up of the new technology, a preliminary design of a 100 MWth pre-commercial CLC unit for gaseous fuels is presented. A reactor-level model was used to predict the performance of such a system, and as a result, the operation of the system was characterized and valuable information of the parameters affecting the process was received. For cost-effective energy generation with efficient CO2 capture, the power plant-level integration of CLC must be conducted carefully, and different plant configurations need to be investigated to find the most optimal solution. Hence, the integration of the reactor system and steam turbine cycle for power production was studied resulting in a suggested plant layout including a CLC boiler system, a simple heat recovery setup, and an integrated steam cycle with a three pressure level steam turbine. A plant-level model was used to evaluate the viability of the plant, and without the purification and compression of CO2, the net cycle efficiency of 42.8% was obtained. It was also found that a drop of 2% points in the degree of fuel conversion decreases the net cycle efficiency by about 1% point. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Temperature shifts are a major challenge to animals; they drive adaptations in organisms and species, and affect all physiological functions in ectothermic organisms. Understanding the origin and mechanisms of these adaptations is critical for determining whether ectothermic organisms will be able to survive when faced with global climate change. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is thought to be an important metabolic player in this regard, since the capacity of the mitochondria to produce energy greatly varies according to temperature. However, organism survival and fitness depend not only on how much energy is produced, but, more precisely, on how oxidative phosphorylation is affected and which step of the process dictates thermal sensitivity. These questions need to be addressed from a new perspective involving a complex view of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and its related pathways. In this review, we examine the effect of temperature on the commonly measured pathways, but mainly focus on the potential impact of lesser-studied pathways and related steps, including the electron-transferring flavoprotein pathway, glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, choline dehydrogenase, proline dehydrogenase, and sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase. Our objective is to reveal new avenues of research that can address the impact of temperature on oxidative phosphorylation in all its complexity to better portray the limitations and the potential adaptations of aerobic metabolism.

TI  - Relaxed natural selection alone does not permit transposable element expansion within 4,000 generations in Escherichia coli
VL  - 139
IS  - 7
SP  - 895-902
AB  - Insertion sequences (ISs) are transposable genetic elements in bacterial genomes. IS elements are common among bacteria but are generally rare within free-living species, probably because of the negative fitness effects they have on their hosts. Conversely, ISs frequently proliferate in intracellular symbionts and pathogens that recently transitioned from a free-living lifestyle. IS elements can profoundly influence the genomic evolution of their bacterial hosts, although it is unknown why they often expand in intracellular bacteria. We designed a laboratory evolution experiment with Escherichia coli K-12 to test the hypotheses that IS elements often expand in intracellular bacteria because of relaxed natural selection due to (1) their generally small effective population sizes (N (e)) and thus enhanced genetic drift, and (2) their nutrient rich environment, which makes many biosynthetic genes unnecessary and thus selectively neutral territory for IS insertion. We propagated 12 populations under four experimental conditions: large N (e) versus small N (e), and nutrient rich medium versus minimal medium. We found that relaxed selection over 4,000 generations was not sufficient to permit IS element expansion in any experimental population, thus leading us to hypothesize that IS expansion in intracellular symbionts may often be spurred by enhanced transposition rates, possibly due to environmental stress, coupled with relaxed natural selection.

VL  - 22
IS  - 2
SP  - 305-310
AB  - Absolute density sampling was conducted to determine population densities of Hypera postica (Gyllenhal) eggs and larvae at two locations in central Oklahoma from 1971 to 1990. For each generation of the weevil, egg deposition began following the return of adults from summer estivation sites during October and November and continued until the following April. Although hatching began as early as December, the appearance of large numbers of larvae coincided with growth of the first alfalfa crop from February to May. Depending upon effects of weather conditions on egg development and survival, the time when larval numbers first exceeded the economic threshold ranged from late February to April. Multivariate discriminant analysis with five variables related to weevil egg numbers and temperature conditions was used in deriving a model for predicting by 15 February whether the economic threshold would be exceeded in late February, early March (1-15), late March (16-31), or April. When tested, >90% of the predictions of the model were correct. This model will provide valuable assistance to growers and consultants in determining when field scouting should be conducted to make decisions regarding sprays for alfalfa weevil control.

TI  - Low Enthalpy Heat Stirling Engine Based Electric Power Generation: A Research Design
SP  - 615-618
AB  - Power generation from renewable and sustainable sources is an important field of technology development owing to the increasing costs (both economically and environmentally) of fired generation. Most research associated with alternative forms of power generation have concentrated on relatively high efficiency systems, as this makes commercial realisation more readily achievable. A new research programme is taking a slightly different approach, where an inherently low efficiency power generation system based on low temperature differential Stirling engine technology is being considered. Here we describe the design of a low temperature differential Stirling engine for research into determining the commercial viability of utilising low enthalpy (or low grade) heat for electric power generation. While the design does not satisfy low cost economic requirements, through its ability to change important operational parameters such as compression ratio, piston phasing, and working gas movement dynamics, it is capable of identifying important features needed to optimise engine performance. The design utilises the Modified Beale Number and some preliminary, software modelling, to satisfy the specifications of having a 500W output with a temperature differential of only 40 K.

TI  - Application of tri-generation systems to the food retail industry
VL  - 48
IS  - 11
SP  - 2988-2995
AB  - The food industry, both food manufacturing and retailing has a need for heating and electrical power as well as refrigeration. Invariably, plant is installed, which consists of heating systems employing low pressure hot water, high pressure hot water or steam, vapour compression refrigeration systems and an electrical power supply derived from the National Grid. The overall utilisation. efficiency of these processes is low, because of the relatively low electricity generation efficiency in power stations and distribution losses in the grid. A way of increasing the energy utilisation efficiency of food manufacturing and retail facilities is through tri-generation. This paper considers tri-generation technology and the feasibility of its application to the food retail industry and examines the economics and environmental impacts of the technology compared to conventional systems. The results indicate that the economic viability of these systems is dependent on the relative cost of natural gas and grid electricity. The system investigated can provide payback periods of less than 4.0 years when the relative cost of gas to electricity is below 0.3. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Summer steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were reared as South Santiam Hatchery, Oregon, under different lighting conditions for about 2 months prior to release. Groups of about 40,000 steelhead were reared under constant lighting from mercury-vapor lights (''lighted'' fish) and compared with groups of fish that were covered with black plastic each night at dusk (''covered'' fish). These groups were also compared with groups of the same strain reared at Roaring River Hatchery, Oregon, which had no nighttime lighting around the ponds (''unlighted'' fish). At the time fish were released from their hatcheries, gill ATPase activity was significantly higher in the unlighted group at Roaring River Hatchery than in both groups at South Santiam Hatchery, where ATPase activity did not differ between lighted and covered groups. The lighted group was more silvery than covered or unlighted groups. The covered group was slightly smaller than the other two groups and showed decrease migration downstream. Timing of migration was similar in all three groups. Fish less than 17 cm were not recaptured in the migrant trap. The return of adults from the covered group was not significantly different from returns from the other two groups. Differences in fish physiology and behavior were associated with the lighting treatment, but whether or not low-level hatchery lighting benefits steelhead fitness remains ambiguous.

TI  - Wind Resource Assessment and Economic Viability of Conventional and Unconventional Small Wind Turbines: A Case Study of Maryland dagger
VL  - 13
IS  - 22
AB  - Annual mean wind speed distribution models for power generation based on regional wind resource maps are limited by spatial and temporal resolutions. These models, in general, do not consider the impact of local terrain and atmospheric circulations. In this study, long-term five-year wind data at three sites on the North, East, and West of the Baltimore metropolitan area, Maryland, USA are statistically analyzed. The Weibull probability density function was defined based on the observatory data. Despite seasonal and spatial variability in the wind resource, the annual mean wind speed for all sites is around 3 m/s, suggesting the region is not suitable for large-scale power generation. However, it does display a wind power capacity that might allow for non-grid connected small-scale wind turbine applications. Technical and economic performance evaluations of more than 150 conventional small-scale wind turbines showed that an annual capacity factor and electricity production of 11% and 1990 kWh, respectively, are achievable. It results in a payback period of 13 years. Government incentives can improve the economic feasibility and attractiveness of investments in small wind turbines. To reduce the payback period lower than 10 years, modern/unconventional wind harvesting technologies are found to be an appealing option in this region. Key contributions of this work are (1) highlighting the need for studying the urban physics rather than just the regional wind resource maps for wind development projects in the build-environment, (2) illustrating the implementation of this approach in a real case study of Maryland, and (3) utilizing techno-economic data to determine suitable wind harnessing solutions for the studied sites.

SP  - 90-+
AB  - In this work a numerical model, which simulates the buildings thermal response and evaluates the indoor environment comfort, in transient conditions, is used in the energy and thermal comfort management in a kindergarten school building in the South of Portugal in Winter conditions. After it's validation, this numerical model is applied in the evaluation of the building thermal behavior, using the indoor temperature field, and the occupants thermal comfort levels, using the PMV and PPD indexes. In the numerical model validation, experimental data and numerical values, for the indoor air temperature, are compared. In the experimental tests, for a typical Winter day, the outdoor and indoor environmental variables are measured. In the numerical simulation of the kindergarten school building, the 25 compartments, the 498 building main bodies and the 42 windows glasses, as well as all surrounding main buildings, are considered. The viability to build an indoor greenhouse, used to heat the cooled spaces, and the evolution of indoor thermal comfort level are analyzed.

AB  - Gyrodactylid population growth may depend on abiotic variables such as temperature. We tested the survival and reproductive rate of Gyrodactylus mexicanus, a parasite infecting fins of Girardinichthys multiradiatus, at 3 different water temperatures, 10-13, 19-22, and 24 C. The temporal sequence of birth and age at death of each parasite isolated from the hosts was recorded through at least 8 generations. Our results showed that the average number of offspring per parasite was 2.0 when averaged across all temperatures. However, the generation time was negatively correlated with temperature. The innate capacity for increase (r(m)) was positively correlated with water temperature: from 0.29 parasite/day at 13 C to 0.48 parasite/day at 24 C. These data confirm that water temperature has a direct influence on parasite population dynamics. The current study represents the first contribution to understanding the population ecology of the monogenean G. mexicanus in central Mexico.

VL  - 39
IS  - 3
SP  - 1389-1396
AB  - Wind power is widely expected to expand rapidly in Britain over the next decade. Large amounts of variable wind power on the system will increase market risks, with prices more volatile and load factors for conventional thermal plant lower and more uncertain. This extra market risk may discourage investment in generation capacity. Financial viability for thermal plant will be increasingly dependent on price spikes during periods of low wind. Increased price risk will also make investment in other forms of low-carbon generation (e.g. nuclear power) more challenging. A number of policies can reduce the extent to which generators are exposed to market risks and encourage investment. However, market risks play a fundamental role in shaping efficient investment and dispatch patterns in a liberalised market. Therefore, measures to improve price signals and market functioning (such as a stronger carbon price and developing more responsive demand) are desirable. However, the scale of the investment challenge and increased risk mean targeted measures to reduce (although not eliminate) risk exposure, such as capacity mechanisms and fixed price schemes, may have increasing merit. The challenge for policy is to strike the right balance between market and planned approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Calculation of the power loss coefficient of steam turbine as a part of the cogeneration plant
VL  - 59
SP  - 642-651
AB  - A cogeneration plant operates under very variable conditions within a reporting period (usually one year) and this frustrates the achievement of the high standards stipulated by the EU Directive from 2004. Taking into consideration these difficulties, one needs to start with the decomposition of the cogeneration plant in order to determine a virtual part of the plant that can meet the requirements of the Directive on the basis of conducted measurements and calculations. In this way, the plant can be partially qualified as eligible for economic and financial benefits. The focus of this paper is an analysis of the power loss coefficient of steam turbines for the generation of useful heat energy and electricity simultaneously. This applies to all cogeneration plants comprising extraction-condensing steam turbines and combined cycles (gas turbine and steam turbine) when heat is extracted prior to the bottoming cycle. The proposed procedure for calculation of power loss coefficient is easily applicable in industrial practice. The viability of the proposed method is demonstrated in the case of calculations for a 10 MWe (combined cycle gas turbine) plant. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Levelized costs of electricity and direct-use heat from Enhanced Geothermal Systems
VL  - 6
IS  - 1
AB  - GEOPHIRES (GEOthermal energy for the Production of Heat and Electricity ("IR") Economically Simulated) is a software tool that combines reservoir, wellbore, and power plant models with capital and operating cost correlations and financial levelized cost models to assess the technical and economic performance of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS). It is an upgrade and expansion of the "MIT-EGS" program used in the 2006 "Future of Geothermal Energy" study. GEOPHIRES includes updated cost correlations for well drilling and completion, resource exploration, and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and flash power plants. It also has new power plant efficiency correlations based on AspenPlus and MATLAB simulations. The structure of GEOPHIRES enables feasibility studies of using geothermal resources not only for electricity generation but also for direct-use heating, and combined heat and power (CHP) applications. Full documentation on GEOPHIRES is provided in the supplementary material. Using GEOPHIRES, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and the levelized cost of heat (LCOH) have been estimated for 3 cases of resource grade (low-, medium-, and high-grade resource corresponding to a geothermal gradient of 30, 50, and 70 degrees C/km) in combination with 3 levels of technological maturity (today's, mid-term, and commercially mature technology corresponding to a productivity of 30, 50, and 70 kg/s per production well and thermal drawdown rate of 2%, 1.5%, and 1%). The results for the LCOE range from 4.6 to 57 (c) over bar /kWh(e) and for the LCOH from 3.5 to 14 $/MMBTU (1.2 to 4.8 (c) over bar /kWh(th)). The results for the base-case scenario (medium-grade resource and mid-term technology) are 11 (c) over bar /kWh(e) and 5 $/MMBTU (1.7 (c) over bar /kWh(th)), respectively. To account for parameter uncertainty, a sensitivity analysis has been included. The results for the LCOE and LCOH have been compared with values found in literature for EGS as well as other energy technologies. The key findings suggest that given today's technology maturity, electricity and direct-use heat from EGS are not economically competitive under current market conditions with other energy technologies. However, with moderate technological improvements, electricity from EGS is predicted to become cost-effective with respect to other renewable and non-renewable energy sources for medium-and high-grade geothermal resources. Direct-use heat from EGS is calculated to become cost-effective even for low-grade resources. This emphasizes that EGS for direct-use heat may not be neglected in future EGS development.

VL  - 14

AB  - The present study dealt with the generation of freshwater through the direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) technique, powered by an evacuated tube solar collector (ETSC). The major objective of the present work was to determine the optimum conditions of fluid flow rate and temperature for maximum freshwater productivity across both the feed and permeate sides of the membrane module. A flat hydrophobic membrane composed of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) coated with Teflon was utilized for the DCMD process. The rate of freshwater production was examined with the variation in the feed/permeate flow rates (from 3 to 7 LPM) and feed temperature (from 45 degrees C to 75 degrees C) for a constant permeate-side temperature of 30 degrees C. The experimental results indicated that a maximum freshwater productivity of 45.18 kg/m(2)h was achievable from the proposed system during its operation with a high solar heated inlet feed temperature of 75 degrees C and mass flow rates of 7 LPM across both sides of the membrane. Further, a detailed assessment of the performance parameters indicated that the present solar-powered DCMD system exhibited a maximum evaporative efficiency of about 80% and temperature polarization coefficient (TPC) of 0.62 respectively.

VL  - 118
SP  - 79-85
AB  - We demonstrate the viability of using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for facial recognition of meteorological phenomena in satellite imagery. Transfer learning was used to fine tune the widely used VGG-16 network architecture and allow the network to successfully detect (94% accuracy) the presence of transverse cirrus bands (TCBs) in NASA MODIS and VIIRS satellite browse imagery. The CNN exhibited better performance compared to a random forest classifier (84% accuracy) and was further validated by applying it to NASA satellite browse imagery in order to create a multi-year (2013-2015) global heat map of TCB occurrence. The annual heat map shows spatial patterns that are consistent with known mechanisms for the generation of TCBs, providing confidence in the CNN classifications. Our study shows that CNNs are well suited for meteorological phenomena detection due to their generalization capabilities and strong performance. An immediate application of our work intends to enable phenomena-based search of big satellite imagery databases. With additional modifications, the CNN could be utilized for other applications such as providing situational awareness to operational forecasters or developing phenomena specific climatologies.

TI  - Multifunctional graphene micro-islands: Rapid, low-temperature plasma-enabled synthesis and facile integration for bioengineering genosensing applications
VL  - 89
SP  - 437-443
AB  - Here, we present a rapid, low-temperature (200 degrees C) plasma -enabled synthesis of graphene micro-islands (GMs). Morphological analyses of GMs by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) feature a uniform and open-networked array of aggregated graphene sheets. Structural and surface chemical characterizations by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) support the presence of thin graphitic edges and reactive oxygen functional groups. We demonstrate that these inherent properties of GMs enable its multifunctional capabilities as a bioactive interface. GMs exhibit a biocompatibility of 80% cell viability with primary fibroblast lung cells after 5 days. Further, GMs were assembled into an impedimetric genosensor, and its performance was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A dynamic sensing range of 1 pM to 1 nM is reported, and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 2.03 x 10(-13) M is deduced, with selectivity to single-RNA-base mismatched sequences. The versatile nature of GMs may be explored to enable multi-faceted bioactive platforms for next-generation personalized healthcare technologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sulfur Dioxide Capture by Heterogeneous Oxidation on Hydroxylated Manganese Dioxide
VL  - 50
IS  - 11
SP  - 5809-5816
AB  - Here we demonstrate that sulfur dioxide (SO2) is efficiently captured via heterogeneous oxidation into sulfate on the surface of hydroxylated manganese dioxide (MnO2). Lab-scale activity tests in a fluidized bed reactor showed that the removal efficiency for a simulated flue gas containing 5000 mg.Nm(-3) SO2 could reach nearly 100% with a GHSV (gas hourly space velocity) of 10000 h(-1). The mechanism was investigated using a combination of experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations. It was found that formation of surface bound sulfate proceeds via association of SO2 with terminal hydroxyls. Both H2O and O-2 are essential for the generation of reactive terminal hydroxyls, and the indirect role of O-2 in heterogeneous SO2 oxidation at low temperature was also revealed. We propose that the high reactivity of terminal hydroxyls is attributed to the proper surface configuration of MnO2 to adsorb water with degenerate energies for associative and dissociative states, and maintain rapid proton dynamics. Viability analyses suggest that the desulfurization method that is based on such a direct oxidation reaction at the gas/solid interface represents a promising approach for SO2 capture.

TI  - Viability of dynamic cooling control in a data center environment
VL  - 128
IS  - 2
SP  - 137-144
AB  - Data center thermal management challenges have been steadily increasing over the past few years due to rack level power density increases resulting from system level compaction. These challenges have been compounded by antiquated environmental control strategies designed for low power density installations and for the worst-case heat dissipation rates in the computer systems. Current data center environmental control strategies are not energy efficient when applied to the highly dynamic, high power density data centers of the future. Current techniques control the computer room air conditioning units (CRACs) based oil the return air temperature of the air-typically set near 20 degrees C. Blowers within the CRACs are normally operated at maximum flow rate throughout the operation of the data center unless they are equipped with nonstandard variable frequency drives. At this setting the blowers typically provide significantly more airflow than is required by the equipment racks to prevent recirculation and the subsequent formation of hot spots. This strategy tends to be overly conservative and inefficient. As an example air entering a given system housed in a rack undergoes a temperature rise of 15 degrees C due to the heat added by the system. The return air control strategy strives to keep the entire room at a fixed temperature. Therefore in a typical data center the CRAC supply temperature, and hence the air entering the racks, is 13 - 15 degrees C and the CRAC return is 20-22 degrees C. At these settings the CRACs can consume almost as much energy as the computer equipment the), are cooling [Friedrich, R., Patel, C.D., 2002, "Towards Planetary Scale Computing - Technical Challenges for Next Generation Internet Computing," THERMES 2002, Santa Fe, NM; The Uptime Institute, "Heat Density Trends in Data Processing, Computer Systems and Telecommunications Equipment, " White Paper issued by The Uptime Institute, 2000.]. Experiments conducted by the authors using these CRAC settings show that nearly 0.7 W is consumed by the environmental control system for every I W of heat dissipated by the computer equipment in the authors' experimental facility indicating that the energy efficiency of standard data center environmental control systems is poor. This study examines several opportunities for improving thermal management and energy performance of data centers with automatic control. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate how simple, modular control strategies can be implemented. Furthermore, experimental data is presented that show it is possible to improve the energy performance of a data center by up to 70% over current standards while maintaining proper thermal management conditions.

TI  - Combined use of biogas from sanitary landfill and wastewater treatment plants for distributed energy generation in Brazil
VL  - 136
SP  - 376-388
AB  - Biogas is a fuel which has a high potential energy and it is produced from the anaerobic degradation of organic material. It can be used for many applications such as heat and electrical generation and fueling vehicles. Given that anaerobic reactors and landfills are the main forms for treating domestic solid waste in Brazil, this current article presents a five scenario analysis on the energy potential and economic viability of the combined use of biogas produced in these structures for generating electricity in the city of Itajuba, Brazil. From the energy point of view, the best case scenario is the combined use of biogas from sanitary landfill and sewage treatment station. This scenario resulted in an installed power of 685 kW, with an annual energy production capable of supplying approximately 10% of the city's energy. Concerning the economic aspect, the best option is the use of biogas from sanitary landfill in an isolated manner, due to the shorter distance of the transport of the gas, in comparison with other scenarios. The results demonstrate the potential and possibility of economic viability for the use of biogas in urban structures for these microregions in Brazil, indicating that the development of biogas use in small cities can be accomplished within the resolutions of distributed microgeneration. Such potential tends to increase as basic sanitation grows throughout the country.

TI  - Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition of SiO2 Using Space-Divided Plasma System
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
SP  - 872-877
AB  - Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) process with self-limiting reaction on the substrate provides a very uniform and conformal thin film with high quality. In this regards, current industrial requirements of silicon oxide are as follow. Silicon oxide film is used as gate sealing and gate spacer oxide, gapfill oxide in memory and logic devices. It is also used for double and quadruple spacer in self-aligned patterning technology. Therefore, recent ALD of SiO2 requires very low temperature process, good step-coverage (thickness uniformity of SiO2 film in pattern) and excellent film density with high purity (low wet-etch rate) in device pattern. In order to meet these requirements, a new scheme called Space-Divided Plasma Atomic Layer Deposition (SDPALD) of silicon oxide was developed. A high-quality film deposition at low temperature was established in this process, high growth rate ensured accomplishing a high productivity. This study shows step coverage more than 95% at aspect ratio of 60:1, wet etch rate 0.48 A/sec at 400 degrees C (100:1 HF). There is no sub-layer damage by plasma process. Also, pure SiO2 as well as doped SiO2 can be made by additiional gas. Doping concentration can be controlled by treatment time and process temperature. Currently, doped SiO2 can be developed for next generation device in memory technology. Therefore, we believe that SDPALD SiO2 system is the solution of next generation semiconductor.

TI  - Thermal behaviour of crustaceans
VL  - 81
IS  - 2
SP  - 237-258
AB  - Specific thermoreceptors or putative multimodal thermoreceptors are not known in Crustacea. However, behavioural studies on thermal avoidance and preference and on the effects of temperature on motor activity indicate that the thermosensitivity of crustaceans may be in the range 0.2-2 degrees C. Work on planktonic crustaceans suggests that they respond particularly to changes in temperature by klinokinesis and orthokinesis. The thermal behaviour of crustaceans is modified by thermal acclimation among other factors. The acclimation of the critical maximum temperature is an example of resistance acclimation, while the acclimation of preference behaviour may be classified as capacity acclimation of some other function. In crustaceans,, the use of the concepts stenothermy and eurythermy at the species level is questionable, and it is not possible to divide crustacean species into thermal guilds as suggested for fishes. Thermal preference behaviour contributes to fitness in different ways in different species, often by maximising the aerobic metabolic scope for activity. In crustaceans the peripheral nervous system seems to have retained the capacity for thermosensitivity and thermal acclimation independently of the central nervous system control of behaviour.

TI  - A two-stage stochastic MILP model for generation and transmission expansion planning with high shares of renewables
AB  - This paper is concerned with the generation and transmission expansion planning of large-scale energy systems with high penetration of renewable energy sources. Since expansion plans are usually provided for a long-term planning horizon, the system conditions are generally uncertain at the time the expansion plans are decided. In this work, we focus on the uncertainty of thermal power plants production costs, because of the important role they play in the generation and transmission expansion planning by affecting the merit order of thermal plants and the economic viability of renewable generation. To deal with this long-term uncertainty, we consider different scenarios and we define capacity expansion decisions using a two-stage stochastic programming model that aims at minimizing the sum of investment, decommissioning and fixed costs and the expected value of operational costs. To be computationally tractable most of the existing expansion planning models employ a low level of temporal and technical detail. However, this approach is no more an appropriate approximation for power systems analysis, since it does not allow to accurately study all the challenges related to integrating high shares of intermittent energy sources, underestimating the need for flexible resources and the expected costs. To provide more accurate expansion plans for power systems with large penetration of renewables, in our analysis, we consider a high level of temporal detail and we include unit commitment constraints on a plant-by-plant level into the expansion planning framework. To maintain the problem computationally tractable, we use representative days and we implement a multi-cut Benders decomposition algorithm, decomposing the original problem both by year and by scenario. Results obtained with our methodology in the Italian energy system under a 21-year planning horizon show how the proposed model can offer professional guidance and support in strategic decisions to the different actors involved in electricity transmission and generation.

TI  - Comparison of weather station and climate reanalysis data for modelling temperature-related mortality
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - Epidemiological analyses of health risks associated with non-optimal temperature are traditionally based on ground observations from weather stations that offer limited spatial and temporal coverage. Climate reanalysis represents an alternative option that provide complete spatio-temporal exposure coverage, and yet are to be systematically explored for their suitability in assessing temperature-related health risks at a global scale. Here we provide the first comprehensive analysis over multiple regions to assess the suitability of the most recent generation of reanalysis datasets for health impact assessments and evaluate their comparative performance against traditional station-based data. Our findings show that reanalysis temperature from the last ERA5 products generally compare well to station observations, with similar non-optimal temperature-related risk estimates. However, the analysis offers some indication of lower performance in tropical regions, with a likely underestimation of heat-related excess mortality. Reanalysis data represent a valid alternative source of exposure variables in epidemiological analyses of temperature-related risk.

TI  - Performance prediction and techno-economic analysis of solar dish/stirling system for electricity generation
VL  - 164
AB  - In this study, a new commercial Solar Dish/Stirling (SDS) system with a rated power of 25 kW is experimentally established and thermodynamically modeled. A mathematical model implemented in MATLAB software is developed to simulate the proposed SDS system operation in order to analyze its performance, under conditions of Tianjin, China. An analysis of the daily, monthly, and annual performances of the investigated SDS system is performed. In addition, a techno-economic viability for assessing the electricity cost and life cycle cost of the SDS system is also performed. The results indicated that the proposed SDS system produces 28.748 MWh annually, with a yearly net overall efficiency of 19.55%, and achieves maximum energy of 3.8 MWh with a monthly average efficiency of 22.75% in June. From the energy cost analysis, the levelized energy cost of the SDS system is estimated to be 1.719 CNY/kWh similar to (0.2565 $/kWh). In conclusion, the present study identifies the actual commercial and economic situation of the Dish Stirling technology in China, taking into account the China's feed-in tariff of CSP systems (1.2 CNY/kWh), and it also provides a new theoretical guidance for predicting the annual performance and evaluating the economic situation of the SDS systems.

VL  - 107

SP  - 373-383
AB  - Pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) have been used to study movements, habitat use, and postrelease survival of large pelagic vertebrates, but the size of these tags has historically precluded their use on smaller coastal species. To evaluate a new generation of smaller PSATs for the study of postrelease survival and habitat use of coastal species, we attached Microwave Telemetry, Inc., X-tags to ten striped bass (Morone saxatilis) 94-112 cm total length (TL) caught on J hooks and circle hooks during the winter recreational fishery in Virginia. Tags collected temperature and depth information every five minutes and detached from the fish after 30 days. Nine of the ten tags released on schedule and eight transmitted 30% to 96% (mean 78.6%) of the archived data. Three tags were physically recovered during or after the transmission period, allowing retrieval of all archived data. All eight striped bass whose tags transmitted data survived for 30 days after release, including two fish that were hooked deeply with J hooks. The eight fish spent more than 90% of their time at depths less than 10 m and in temperatures of 6-9 C, demonstrated no significant diel differences in depth or temperature utilization (P>0.05), and exhibited weak periodicities in vertical movements consistent with daily and tidal cycles.

TI  - Effect of transient concentrated solar flux profile on the absorber surface for direct steam generation in the parabolic trough solar collector
VL  - 186
SP  - 226-249
AB  - The parabolic trough solar collector with Direct Steam Generation (DSG) has the potential to bring down the electricity cost. The viability of DSG technology is proved using various experimental demonstrations (e.g., DISS test facility) and running commercial-scale power plants (Thai Solar One). However, the DSG technology is in the nascent stage and needs improvement in the solar collector's components and control mechanism. The thermo-hydrodynamic instability induced in the absorber tube due to the nonuniform concentrated solar flux and flow boiling. This study investigates the effects of transient solar flux profiles on the thermal-hydraulics of flow boiling in the DSG process using CFD software ANSYS Fluent. The Eulerian two-fluid model is developed using conservation equations, turbulence model, and phase change model. The concentrated solar flux profiles are considered corresponding to various times of the day from 12:00 h (solar noon) to 17:00 h at an interval of 1 h. The three dimensional (3-D) numerical investigations are performed for DNI of 750 W/m2 and 1000 W/m2; operating pressures 60 bar and 100 bar; mass flow rates 0.4 kg/s and 0.6 kg/s. The flow regimes under the considered boundary conditions are observed as stratified flow. The vapor volume fractions at the absorber outlet exist between 0.30 and 0.45 for DNI of 750 W/m2 and 0.35 to 0.50 for DNI of 1000 W/m2. The absorber surface temperature has been calculated for operation at various times of the day, and it stands between 550 K and 656 K. Further, the circumferential temperature distributions and temperature contours have been plotted for various operating conditions. The adopted multiphase model shows very good performance and is useful for designing and optimizing solar collectors for DSG.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Influence of anvil shape of surface crack generation in large hot forging process
VL  - 81
SP  - 480-485
AB  - In hot free forging process of large products, surface cracks occur occasionally. When these cracks occur, they must be removed by hot scarfing process after stopping forging process temporarily. Final products have no cracks on those surfaces after applying the hot scarfing process. Hot scarfing process, however, cuts into productivity due to additional time consuming. Since surface cracks are regarded as significant defects, suppression of the surface crack generation is important issue. A lot of research has been studied about mechanism and criteria of forging crack generation [1]similar to[8]. In hot forging process, however, there are a few researches [9]similar to[14]. Then the mechanism and criteria of crack generation during the hot forging process are not clear at this moment. There are various factors for crack generation, such as reduction ratio, forging temperature, anvil shape, ingot surface integrity and so on. The goal of this research is to clarify the mechanism of crack generation in actual forging processes. The derived mechanism is applied to design anvil shapes by using numerical forging simulation.

AB  - Alternating current electroluminescent (AC-EL) device can be considered as a potential candidate for next generation of multifunctional light-emitting sources. In this work, we present a new design of AC-EL device with inclusion of a silver oxide humidity-sensing layer instead of an insulating buffer layer for humidity detection. The ZnS:Cu, Cl and ZnS:Ag+(Zn,Cd)S:Ag phosphors were used as an emissive layer prepared by screen printing method. The silver oxide (AgO/Ag2O) nanoparticles synthesized via a green method were employed as a humidity sensing layer. The developed AC-EL devices exhibited high response, good productivity, high stability, high repeatability and linear relationship with humidity in range of 10%-90% RH as well as no significant effects with several VOCs/gases such as NH3, CO2, acetone, methanol, toluene and propan at room temperature. The effects of parameters such as excitation frequency, applied voltage, and waveforms on the luminance intensity are discussed. The development of the present AC-EL device offers a simplified architecture to enable sensing functions of the AC-EL device via monitoring of light emission changing.

TI  - Environmental-economic optimization for implementation of parabolic collectors in the industrial process heat generation: Case study of Mexico
VL  - 242
AB  - This paper proposes an economic and environmental analysis for the design of solar heat systems and their incorporation in the industrial sector. A novel computational methodology is implemented to help the sustainable integration of parabolic trough collectors photothermal technology into the low and medium enthalpy industrial activities. A multivariate artificial neural network that involves environmental, operational, and economic aspects was used to transfer the phenomenon under study into a simple and fast computing multi-output mathematical model. The optimal trade-off between environmental benefits and investment viability of the hybrid solar plant's design is obtained by a multiobjective optimization process. The objective functions consider the maximization in CO2 mitigation and net present value, and the minimization of the total life-cycle cost. The final optimal result is selected by using the TOPSIS decision-making method. Besides, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to report the system performance with respect to back-up boiler fuel type, climate region, the volume of the storage tank, and solar field area. The work contemplates the case study of a solar thermal plant based on parabolic collectors integrated into a pre-existing industrial process in Mexico. The study considered four of the most common climatic regions and the most representative heating fossil fuels in the national industrial sector. Based on the results, the best profitability and CO2 mitigation are achieved in warm climate regions. Moreover, diesel was identified as the most profitable back-up fuel scenario and natural gas as the least viable. Analysis of the energy contribution describes that implementation of parabolic trough collectors in the presented industrial process covers just over 40%-80% of the energy required, depending on the climate region. The presented methodology constitutes a rapid and low-cost computational tool which facilitates decision making for the implementation of solar heat industrial process systems. Moreover, it can be applied to other industrial processes with several photothermal technologies for clean heat generation. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 148
SP  - 568-577
AB  - In a traditional solar aided power generation (SAPG) plant, problematic two-phase flow may be present in the solar collector tubes which can lead to burst pipes. Within the SAPG plant, it is proposed that a flash tank be applied. By using a flash tank and mandating its inlet pressure by controlling the booster pump, the preheating and overheating collectors can each be ensured to have single-phase flow. To assess the economic and performance criteria of adding a flash tank, a simulation model using is developed and using a unified matrix equation technique. This method is used to assess the effect of the flash tank on a case study 300 MW SAPG plant. Two modes of SAPG operation are considered. In the 'single-generation mode' only steam is introduced to the fossil-fuelled plant. In the 'co-generation mode' both steam, from the overheating collector, and water, from the flash tank, are introduced to the fossil-fuelled plant. The 'co-generation mode' is found by the authors to be the marginally better performing mode. By applying a flash tank in the SAPG system, the problem of unstable two-phase flow in solar collector tubes can be effectively overcome thereby improving the viability of implementation of retrofitted solar aided power generation to fossil-fuelled plants.

AB  - Biogas is a multifunctional energy carrier currently used for co-generation or compressed biomethane as vehicle fuel. Gas-to-liquid (GTL) technology enables conversion of biogas into other energy carriers with higher energy density, facilitating fuel distribution. The energy efficiency and global warming potential (GWP) for conversion of biogas to compressed biogas (CBG), liquefied biogas (LBG), Fischer-Tropsch diesel (FTD), methanol and dimethyl ether (DME) were studied in a life cycle perspective covering the technical system from raw biogas to use in city buses.

AB  - Whether species that have persisted throughout historic climatic upheavals will survive contemporary climate change will depend on their ecological and physiological traits, their evolutionary potential, and potentially upon the resources that humans commit to prevent their extinction. For those species where temperatures influence sex determination, rapid global warming poses a unique risk of skewed sex ratios and demographic collapse. Here we review the specific mechanisms by which reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) may be imperilled at current rates of warming, and discuss the evidence for and against adaptation via behavioural or physiological means. We propose a scheme for ranking reptiles with TSD according to their vulnerability to rapid global warming, but note that critical data on the lability of the sex determining mechanism and on the heritability of behavioural and threshold traits are unavailable for most species. Nevertheless, we recommend a precautionary approach to management of reptiles identified as being at relatively high risk. In such cases, management should aim to neutralise directional sex ratio biases (e.g. by manipulating incubation temperatures or assisted migration) and promote adaptive processes, possibly by genetic supplementation of populations. These practices should aid species' persistence and buy time for research directed at more accurate prediction of species' vulnerability. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

TI  - Assessment of Human Lung Macrophages After Exposure to Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Part I. Cytotoxicity
VL  - 3
IS  - 1
SP  - 88-93
AB  - Due to the widespread production and use of carbon nanotubes in almost every area of science (i.e., drug delivery, biosensors, fuel cells and thermal management systems), they are receiving considerable attention for their novel mechanical, electrical and chemical properties. At this time of high exposure potential, it is critical to ascertain the biological impact of these materials on likely target organs, tissues and cells, such as those of the lung. The aim of this study was to evaluate the degree of cytotoxicity to human lung macrophage (U937) cells after exposure to unpurified or acid-purified multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Cells were incubated with multi-walled carbon nanotubes and assessed for cytotoxicity, generation of reactive oxygen species, morphological changes and uptake. The results demonstrate that multi-walled carbon nanotubes can accumulate in human lung macrophage cells to different degrees based on their surface chemistry. MWNT-COOH reduces cell viability in a dose-dependent manner under these experimental conditions (5-50 mu g/ml, 2-24 h). However, images of individual cells demonstrate morphological changes at low concentrations. Therefore, before nanomaterials are fully accepted and integrated into biological systems, they will continue to undergo further scrutiny at various stages of their processing (i.e., before and after purification) and with models ranging from simple to complex (i.e., cells vs. whole animals) to gain a better understanding between their physicochemical properties and bio-effects.

TI  - Fnergy Yield and Fifficiency Assessment of Photovoltaic Grid -Tied System: Outdoor Approach
SP  - 649-653
AB  - the present paper investigates the effect of environmental change especially solar irradiation and temperature on the productivity of silicon photovoltaic panels. Grid connected systems are commonly the most used application of PV technologies for power generation utility sector and building integration. The performance and reliability of these systems are very interesting indices for design improvement and research development. Several studies in different locations have investigated and reported the importance of PV performance monitoring to qualify various technologies operating worldwide. These information are very useful for energy policy makers and projects development. The research reported in this article, highlights the performance analysis of 2.04 kWp poly-crystalline grid-tied system installed on the roof of laboratory building inside the faculty of science using an implemented monitoring system based on PC-duino hardware. The annual specific yield, system efficiency and energy density were found for instance to be 1874 kWh/kWp/year, 16.32 % and 284.98 kWh/m-respectively. Other performance indicators are discussed profoundly in this paper. Findings from this work provide useful information for research applications and projects development of small-scale grid connected photovoltaic systems in Morocco and near regions.

TI  - Differences in spawning time of captive Atlantic cod from four regions of Norway, kept under identical conditions
VL  - 63
IS  - 2
SP  - 216-223
AB  - Several hundred Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) were collected from selected spawning grounds along the Norwegian coast in March 2002. Four areas or regions that represent a wide range of environmental conditions were chosen for our breeding experiments: Porsangerfjord, Tystjord, Helgeland, and Oygarden. Cod were transported to Oygarden near Bergen, individually tagged, and kept in sea cages. In both 2003 and 2004, a total of 40 family groups (adult pairs) representing the four regions were monitored for their spawning performance in separate tanks. During the spawning period, the quantity and diameter of eggs were recorded. During 2003, the time of peak spawning differed among groups. It was evident that the broodstock from the Oygarden region spawned about one month earlier than the broodstock collected from the Helgeland region. This also occurred in 2004, two years after the cod were collected, suggesting that the difference has a genetic component. Differences in life history parameters between cod populations, such as spawning cycles as described here, could be adaptive and under genetic control. This must be taken into consideration when assessing precautionary means of overcoming the problem with escapees from future cod mariculture.

TI  - Generation Separation in Simple Structured Life Cycles: Models and 48 Years of Field Data on a Tea Tortrix Moth
VL  - 179
IS  - 1
SP  - 95-109
AB  - Population cycles have fascinated ecologists since the early nineteenth century, and the dynamics of insect populations have been central to understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic biological processes responsible for these cycles. We analyzed an extraordinary long-term data set (every 5 days for 48 years) of a tea tortrix moth (Adoxophyes honmai) that exhibits two dominant cycles: an annual cycle with a conspicuous pattern of four or five single-generation cycles superimposed on it. General theory offers several candidate mechanisms for generation cycles. To evaluate these, we construct and parameterize a series of temperature-dependent, stage-structured models that include intraspecific competition, parasitism, mate-finding Allee effects, and adult senescence, all in the context of a seasonal environment. By comparing the observed dynamics with predictions from the models, we find that even weak larval competition in the presence of seasonal temperature forcing predicts the two cycles accurately. None of the other mechanisms predicts the dynamics. Detailed dissection of the results shows that a short reproductive life span and differential winter mortality among stages are the additional life-cycle characteristics that permit the sustained cycles. Our general modeling approach is applicable to a wide range of organisms with temperature-dependent life histories and is likely to prove particularly useful in temperate systems where insect pest outbreaks are both density and temperature dependent.

TI  - Dispatch optimization of thermal power unit flexibility transformation under the deep peak shaving demand based on invasive weed optimization
VL  - 315
AB  - The rapid development of new energy represented by wind power and photovoltaic power generation necessitates higher requirements for the flexibility of traditional thermal power generation units. The role of thermal power units will change from conventional main power to auxiliary power, not only because of the need for the survival and development of thermal power enterprises, but also because of the inevitable requirement for promoting the revolution of power energy production and consumption in China. The economy of thermal power unit flexibility transformation is an important constraint factor for decision-making in thermal power unit transformation. How to consider the economic factor of the thermal power unit transformation is a key problem for decision-making. In this paper, a nonlinear programming model is proposed to solve the problem. By introducing greedy strategy and improved reproduction strategy, an improved invasive weed optimization (IWO) algorithm is also proposed to solve the problem. Finally, a case study with three different scenario assumptions was conducted according to the most used transformation schemes of thermal power units in China, and the results were derived by using the proposed model and the improved IWO method. The comparative analysis of the results showed that the more the thermal power units participated in deep peak shaving, the greater the risk of the flexibility transformation of the thermal power units. In addition, under the condition of the same proportion of peak shaving, the risk of transformation without oil peak shaving was lower than that of oil peak shaving. Thus, the improved IWO algorithm can provide a stable and satisfactory solution. The research in this paper can provide a more scientific basis for decision-making on the flexibility transformation of the thermal power unit and can provide a reference for the selection of the flexibility transformation scheme of the thermal power unit.

TI  - Pattern and scale in latitude-production relationships for freshwater fishes
VL  - 8
IS  - 1
AB  - Empirically understanding spatial variation in secondary production rates is central to ecology. Yet for most taxa, such patterns are rarely examined, especially at different levels of ecological organization (e.g., species-vs. community-level patterns). We compiled data on biomass, production, and P/B rates of freshwater fish communities and species across latitudes and contrast patterns observed at the community level with those observed for species. At the community level, and at two distinct spatial scales (global vs. continental-North American), negative or neutral relationships were apparent between biomass, production, and P/B with latitude; however, there was substantial scatter in these data. Yet at the species level in North America, production was often closely linked to latitude, but in the opposite direction: Many species showed improved production with latitude. Latitudinal increases in species-level production rates were strongest for cool-and cold-water species, and species rarely showed the opposite trend. Species-level increases in production with latitude strengthened when production rates were normalized by the thermal opportunity for production, suggesting potential adaptations of individuals and populations to shorter growing seasons (i.e., "countergradient" production) at high latitudes. At the global scale, there were apparent unimodal relationships between community fish production measures and species richness; however, these patterns became linearized or non-significant at the continental scale. Decreased interspecific competition at northern latitudes combined with genetic adaptations (e.g., countergradient growth) could explain a tendency for increased species production in northern populations, while total community production remains reduced. Latitude has contrasting effects on fish production at different spatial scales and levels of biological organization. Thus while freshwater fish communities are somewhat more productive and diverse at lower latitudes, species production in northern populations is often surprisingly high.

TI  - Baseload wind energy: modeling the competition between gas turbines and compressed air energy storage for supplemental generation
VL  - 35
IS  - 3
SP  - 1474-1492
AB  - The economic viability of producing baseload wind energy was explored using a cost-optimization model to simulate two competing systems: wind energy supplemented by simple- and combined cycle natural gas turbines ("wind+ gas"), and wind energy supplemented by compressed air energy storage ("wind+CAES"). Pure combined cycle natural gas turbines ("gas") were used as a proxy for conventional baseload generation. Long-distance electric transmission was integral to the analysis. Given the future uncertainty in both natural gas price and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions price, we introduced an effective fuel price, P-NGeff, being the sum of the real natural gas price and the GHG price. Under the assumption of P-NGeff = $5/GJ (lower heating value), 650 W/m(2) wind resource, 750 km transmission line, and a fixed 90% capacity factor, wind + CAES was the most expensive system at phi 6.0/kWh, and did not break even with the next most expensive wind + gas system until P-NGeff = $9.0/GJ. However, under real market conditions, the system with the least dispatch cost (short-run marginal cost) is dispatched first, attaining the highest capacity factor and diminishing the capacity factors of competitors, raising their total cost. We estimate that the wind + CAES system, with a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rate that is one-fourth of that for natural gas combined cycle plants and about one-tenth of that for pulverized coal plants, has the lowest dispatch cost of the alternatives considered (lower even than for coal power plants) above a GHG emissions price of $35/tC(equiv), with good prospects for realizing a higher capacity factor and a lower total cost of energy than all the competing technologies over a wide range of effective fuel costs. This ability to compete in economic dispatch greatly boosts the market penetration potential of wind energy and suggests a substantial growth opportunity for natural gas in providing baseload power via wind + CAES, even at high natural gas prices.

TI  - Opportunities and impediments to the expansion of forest bioenergy in Australia
VL  - 30
IS  - 12
SP  - 1021-1024
AB  - There are significant opportunities for expansion of a forest bioenergy industry in Australia based on distributed electricity generation and production of liquid fuels (ethanol and bio-oil). If the large amounts of forest residues already available annually could be utilized, this would deliver useful greenhouse benefits, assist regeneration of new forests that have increased environmental values, and benefit silvicultural management. Creation of new forests in low rainfall environments for both environmental and commercial reasons will also provide residues in the future that could be used for energy production, thus enhancing overall viability of such ventures. Currently, there are several serious impediments to realising the potential. These include: center dot Large reserves of accessible coal, and low cost of electricity generated in coal-fired power plants. center dot Uncertain greenhouse and renewable energy policy (specifically that relating to implementation of the Mandated Renewable Energy Target (MRET)). center dot Lack of proven efficient small-scale technology to enable distributed electricity generation that would reduce transportation costs for delivery of biofuels. center dot Controversy over the sustainable use of native forest residues for renewable energy generation. center dot Lack of markets for environmental credits (carbon, salinity, biodiversity). center dot Lack of efficient processes for producing ethanol from wood, inadequate commercial products from lignin, and the need for further development before diesel engines can be run on bio-oil for stationary power generation and transport. In Australia, apart from the use of firewood for domestic heating, forest bioenergy has developed only to a very limited extent, despite the existence of significant opportunities. A major impediment to expansion is lack of public acceptance and support, especially for the use of native forest residues which are the main available biomass source. A concerted effort at several levels is needed to address this issue. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Thermal Barrier Coatings Based on ZrO(2)Solid Solutions
VL  - 59

SP  - 179-200
AB  - The standard material of the ceramic layer in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs)-a solid solution of ZrO(2)stabilized with (6-8 wt.%) Y2O3(YSZ)-approaches the temperature limit of its application (<1200 degrees C) because the ZrO(2)t ' phase sinters and undergoes t '-ZrO2 -> T-ZrO2+ F-ZrO(2)phase transformations to form M-ZrO(2)at elevated temperatures. Ceramic materials for a new generation of TBCs need to be developed to increase the operating temperature (up to 1600 degrees C), efficiency, and productivity of gas-turbine engines. The overview paper analyzes research efforts focusing on the development of TBCs using solid solutions of ZrO(2)with rare-earth metal and titanium oxides. When Y(2)O(3)in YSZ is partially substituted by CeO2, TiO2, La2O3, Sc2O3, Gd2O3, Nd2O3, Yb2O3, Er2O3, and Ta2O5, ceramics with high phase stability (ZrO(2)t ' phase being retained in the coating) up to 1500 degrees C, lower thermal conductivity, and required fracture toughness and sintering resistance but shorter thermal fatigue life than that of standard YSZ are produced. The concepts of greater tetragonality of the ZrO(2)t ' phase (ceramics in the ZrO2-CeO2-TiO(2)system) and a 'multicomponent defective cluster' (ceramics in the ZrO2-Y2O3-Nd2O3(Gd2O3, Sm2O3)-Yb2O3(Sc2O3) system) explain how the operating temperature of the TBC ceramic layer increases to 1350 degrees C and 1600 degrees C, respectively. The thermal conductivity of TBC ceramics in the binary ZrO2-CeO2, ZrO2-Er2O3, ZrO2-Sm2O3, ZrO2-Nd2O3, ZrO2-Gd2O3, ZrO2-Dy2O3, and ZrO2-Yb(2)O(3)systems is lower than that of YSZ. Ceramics with high phase stability and low thermal conductivity have been produced in the ternary ZrO2-Sc2O3-Gd2O3, ZrO2-CeO2-Gd2O3, ZrO2-YbO1.5-TaO2.5, and ZrO2-Yb2O3-TiO(2)systems. An integrated approach is needed to choose the composition of the ceramic layer based on the ZrO(2)solid solution, select the coating technique, and improve the coating architecture to design effective TBCs with balanced properties.

TI  - Hybrid FePt/SiO2/Au nanoparticles as a theranostic tool: in vitro photo-thermal treatment and MRI imaging
VL  - 10
IS  - 3
SP  - 1308-1321
AB  - We have produced an innovative, theranostic material based on FePt/SiO2/Au hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) for both, photo-thermal therapy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Furthermore, a new synthesis approach, i.e., Au double seeding, for the preparation of Au nanoshells around the FePt/SiO2 cores, is proposed. The photo-thermal and the MRI response were first demonstrated on an aqueous suspension of hybrid FePt/SiO2/Au NPs. The cytotoxicity together with the internalization mechanism and the intracellular fate of the hybrid NPs were evaluated in vitro on a normal (NPU) and a half-differentiated cancerous cell line (RT4). The control samples as well as the normal cell line incubated with the NPs showed no significant temperature increase during the in vitro photo-thermal treatment (Delta T < 0.8 degrees C) and thus the cell viability remained high (similar to 90%). In contrast, due to the high NP uptake by the cancerous RT4 cell line, significant heating of the sample was observed (Delta T = 4 degrees C) and, consequently, after laser irradiation the cell viability dropped significantly to similar to 60%. These results further confirm that the hybrid FePt/SiO2/Au NPs developed in the scope of this work were not only efficient but also highly selective photo-thermal agents. Furthermore, the improvement in the contrast and the easier distinction between the healthy and the cancerous tissues were clearly demonstrated with in vitro MRI experiments, proving that hybrid NPs have an excellent potential to be used as contrast agents.

TI  - The role of natural gas and its infrastructure in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, improving regional air quality, and renewable resource integration
VL  - 64
SP  - 62-92
AB  - The pursuit of future energy systems that can meet electricity demands while supporting the attainment of societal environment goals, including mitigating climate change and reducing pollution in the air, has led to questions regarding the viability of continued use of natural gas. Natural gas use, particularly for electricity generation, has increased in recent years due to enhanced resource availability from non-traditional reserves and pressure to reduce greenhouse gasses (GHG) from higher-emitting sources, including coal generation. While lower than coal emissions, current natural gas power generation strategies primarily utilize combustion with higher emissions of GHG and criteria pollutants than other low-carbon generation options, including renewable resources. Furthermore, emissions from life cycle stages of natural gas production and distribution can have additional detrimental GHG and air quality (AQ) impacts. On the other hand, natural gas power generation can play an important role in supporting renewable resource integration by (1) providing essential load balancing services, and (2) supporting the use of gaseous renewable fuels through the existing infrastructure of the natural gas system. Additionally, advanced technologies and strategies including fuel cells and combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) systems can facilitate natural gas generation with low emissions and high efficiencies. Thus, the role of natural gas generation in the context of GHG mitigation and AQ improvement is complex and multi-faceted, requiring consideration of more than simple quantification of total or net emissions. If appropriately constructed and managed, natural gas generation could support and advance sustainable and renewable energy. In this paper, a review of the literature regarding emissions from natural gas with a focus on power generation is conducted and discussed in the context of GHG and AQ impacts. In addition, a pathway forward is proposed for natural gas generation and infrastructure to maximize environmental benefits and support renewable resources in the attainment of emission reductions.

VL  - 14
IS  - 7
AB  - Animal by-products (ABP) can be valorized via anaerobic digestion (AD) for biogas energy generation. The digestate issued from AD process is usually used to fertilize farming land for agricultural activities, which may cause potential sanitary risk to the environment. The European Union (EU) requires that certain ABP be thermally pasteurized in order to minimize this sanitary risk. This process is called hygienization, which can be replaced by alternative nonthermal technologies like pulsed electric field (PEF). In the present study, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 were used as indicator bacteria. Their resistance to thermal pasteurization and PEF treatment were characterized. Results show that Ent. faecalis and E. coli are reduced by 5 log10 in less than 1 min during thermal pasteurization at 70 degrees C. The critical electric field strength was estimated at 18 kV center dot cm(-1) for Ent. faecalis and 1 kV center dot cm(-1) for E. coli. "G+" bacteria Ent. faecalis are generally more resistant than "G-" bacteria E. coli. AD process also plays an important role in pathogens inactivation, whose performance depends on the microorganisms considered, digestion temperature, residence time, and type of feedstock. Thermophilic digestion is usually more efficient in pathogens removal than mesophilic digestion.

TI  - Economic and teciinical viability of cogeneration for Dublin City University
SP  - 63-69
AB  - Combined heat and power (CBP) is a master term for onsite power generation technologies that simultaneously produce electrical or mechanical energy and useful energy. Cogeneration is now achieving a great level of acceptance due to increased reliability and overall cost efficiency. CBP technologies have the potential to reduce the energy consumption thus decreasing energy bills, as well as pollution. It is the performance of CHP plants, which determine the amount of energy saved, using these technologies. This paper outlines a specific method for assessing the feasibility of installing a reciprocating engine based on a combined heat and power system in the Dublin City University. It describes the basic models that are typically used by CB? industry for feasibility studies. The basis of this method relies on a specific calculation, which encompasses a twelve months result on electricity load profile, gas and electricity bills and operating times for the existing boiler plant.

TI  - Use of Non-Conductive Film (NCF) with Nano-sized Filler Particles for Solder Interconnect
SP  - 923-928
AB  - As three-dimensional Through-Silicon Via (3DTSV) packaging is emerging in the semiconductor market to integrate multiple functions in a system for further miniaturization, thermal compression bonding (TCB), which stacks multiple bare chips on top of each other with Cu pillar bumps with solder cap, has become an indispensable new packaging technology. The novel non-conductive film (NCF) described in this paper is an epoxy-type thermosetting material in film form, with lower density of Nano-sized silica filler particles (average particle size is 100 Nano meters). Advantages of this NCF material with Nano-sized fillers include: transparency of the NCF material so that the TCB bonder's image recognition system can easily identify fiducial marks on the chip; ability of the Nano-filler to flow out with the NCF resin during thermal compression bonding, to mitigate filler entrapment between solder joints, which is critical to ensure reliable solder connections; compatibility with fine pitch applications with extremely narrow chip-to-chip and chip-to-substrate gaps to form void-free underfill. Instead of the previous processes of die attach, fluxing, traditional oven mass re flow, flux cleaning, and capillary underfill (CUF), the current process involves the use of NCF & TCB. The NCF is applied on a wafer in a film form by lamination, and then a wafer is diced with the pre laminated NCF in pieces. Then they are joined by TCB, with typical parameters of 250 C for 10 seconds with 80N (solder cap on 15pm diameter Cu pillar, 40pm pitch, 1000 bumps). NCF heated by TCB is quickly liquidized to lower its viscosity after a few seconds. Other advantages of NCF is that it has a fluxing function included in the material, which eliminates the need for separate flux apply and flux clean steps, which simplifies process and costs. Also, NCF can control extrusion along the package's edge line since NCF is a half-cured B-stage material which has some mechanical rigidity during handling and lamination. Thus NCF Thermal Compression Flip Chip Bonding method is the vital solution to ensure good reliability with mass productivity for next generation's packaging. The characterization of NCF material and the importance of controlling viscosity and elastic modulus during thermal-compression will be analyzed and discussed in this paper. Process and reliability data on test vehicles will be shown.

TI  - Modeling of sorption enhanced steam methane reforming in an adiabatic fixed bed reactor
VL  - 84
SP  - 1-11
AB  - Sorption enhanced methane reforming (SER), employing a CaO-based solid as a high temperature CO2 sorbent, is generally considered to be a promising route for H-2 production. In this paper we present a dynamic pseudo-homogeneous model to describe the operation of a packed bedreactor in which the SER reaction is carried out under adiabatic conditions. This reactor can be implemented according to several process schemes, including a novel Ca/Cu looping process for hydrogen generation with inherent CO2 capture. The proposed SER model is based on the well-established principles of gassolid contact and heat transfer in fixed-bedreactors and on the kinetic expressions published in the literature that describe the main reactions involved in the process. The resulting model describes the transient performance of the SER reaction and confirms the theoretical viability of this critical reaction stage in a large scale H-2 production facility. It is demonstrated that the SER process can yield a CH4 conversion and H-2 purity of up to 85% and 95%, respectively, under operating conditions of 923 K, 3.5 MPa, a steam/carbon ratio of 5 and a space velocity of 3.5 kg/m(2) s.

TI  - NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF THE WATER LEVEL CHANGE ON THE OVERTOPPING WAVE POWER GENERATOR
SP  - 1127-1133
AB  - In Japan, the energy source for power generation depends mostly on foreign countries. Therefore, it is necessary to secure stable energy resources in our country. Wave energy has a very large amount of energy (Masuda 2008, Hiromichi et al. 2016, Tanaka et al., 2016). In this research, thermal fluid analysis software was used to numerical calculations to reproduce the hydraulic characteristics, the breaking wave and the overtopping wave. For wave power generation, there is an advantage that resources that are semi-permanent waves can be used. The structure of the overtopping wave power generator was mainly wall type and no-wall type under wave run-up slope area. At first this research, we summarize the types and characteristics of power generation methods using ocean energy. At second we focused on the extraction of unused wave energy and the overtopping wave power generation which can be effectively utilized. Numerical analysis of regulated waves was carried out to reproduce the hydraulic characteristics such as the behavior of the run-up, the catchment and the breaking wave and the transverse wave in the local quantity by using the thermo-fluid analysis software. Then the results of the breaking wave, the transient phenomenon for various wave conditions reproduction, and overflow wave flow rate were calculated. The overtopping flow rate and water storage rate were very important factors in such systems. Numerical calculation of regular waves on the influence of shape difference on overtopping flow rate and water storage rate were carried out. At third, to simulate actual sea conditions irregular waves were made for calculation. These results were compared with calculations of regular waves. At final, numerical calculation using regular waves and irregular waves showed that the influence of the difference in the shape of the structure on the maximum water overtopping storage rate. It was necessary to devise a structure that can be efficiently overtopped by irregular waves.

TI  - Effects of climate change on Europe-wide winter wheat and sunflower productivity
VL  - 7
IS  - 3
SP  - 225-241
AB  - Spatially explicit crop models were developed from mechanistic principles to investigate the regional impacts of climate change. The approach highlights the spatial variability of crop responses to altered environmental conditions. The mechanistic nature of the models allows some confidence to be placed in the results that are produced under climate change scenarios. Two crop models have been constructed and applied across a large European region: EuroWheat (winter wheat) and EuroSunfl (sunflower). Model results were compared with observed phenology and yield across a variety of scales and found to capture the current spatial variability in wheat and sunflower productivity. Climate change scenarios from both equilibrium and transient general circulation model experiments were applied to each crop model. Wheat yields are predicted to increase throughout Europe for all climate change scenarios. Conversely, water-limited sunflower yields decrease in most regions and scenarios. More positive effects are predicted for winter wheat than sunflower due to a lower sensitivity to increased temperature and a higher sensitivity to elevated concentrations of CO2. The lowest yield increases for wheat and the largest yield decreases for sunflower are found in western Europe, whilst the most positive responses for both crops occur in central and eastern Europe. Predictions for southern Europe are highly sensitive both within the region and between the scenarios. The old generation of equilibrium climate change scenarios gives the worst predictions (lowest yield increases or highest yield decreases). More beneficial responses are observed for the new generation of transient scenarios for both wheat and sunflower. Area averaged results for Europe, based on the United Kingdom Meterorological Office transient experiment (UKTR), indicate a rate of increase in winter wheat yields of 0.2 t ha(-1) decade(-1) up to the 2020s and 0.36 t ha(-1) decade(-1) beyond. Smaller changes are predicted for sunflower: a rate of decrease of 0.05 t ha(-1) decade(-1) up to the 2020s followed by an increase of 0.05 t ha(-1) decade(-1).

VL  - 14

SP  - 7936-7948
AB  - With the advancement of civilization, water purification, as well as management and disposal of ever-increasing municipal solid waste (MSW), and e-waste, have become global concerns. To address these issues in a sustainable way, a 3D solar evaporator has been proposed in this paper by repurposing recycled paper from MSW in the form of egg trays and waste dry toner (e-waste) using a facile fabrication method. The unique 3D porous structure, fibrous surface, superior water absorbing capability as well as low thermal conductivity of wastepaper-derived egg trays make them an excellent candidate for an efficient solar evaporator, while the waste toner powder coating significantly enhances the optical absorbance capacity. Under 1 sun illumination, the proposed solar evaporator demonstrates an excellent evaporation rate and efficiency of 1.3 kg/m(2) h and 78.5%, respectively. Moreover, the competitive advantage of the 3D structure in collecting solar irradiance at various light incident angles in comparison to a 2D structure, excellent cycle stability, low processing temperature, and the use of low-cost waste materials enable its use for large-scale water purification systems.

TI  - Density-dependent responses in some common lumbricid species
VL  - 61
SP  - 1-8
AB  - It is generally accepted that populations of most species experience some level of density dependence: however, this has rarely been shown for soil-dwelling invertebrate species, in particular for earthworms. Experimental data, mostly obtained at high laboratory densities, suggest intense intraspecific competition for resources and/or living space and density-dependent dynamics in earthworm populations, irrespective of their ecological group affiliation. In the present study performed in large field microcosms, I investigated whether density-dependent responses occur within the earthworm density gradients more realistic for the natural sites. Five lumbricid species from epigeic (Dendrobaena octaedra, Lumbricus rubellus), endogeic (Allolobophora chlorotica, Aporrectodea caliginosa) and anecic (Lumbricus terrestris) ecological groups were tested. Soil systems populated with earthworm monocultures in large (20-L) microcosms were exposed in a beech-oak forest for 4.5 months; each species was represented by two (L. terrestris) or three treatments forming gradients of increasing density. In two endogeic species, manifold and generally similar density-dependent responses (a retardation of growth, maturation and reproduction rates, but higher mortality rates with density increase) were revealed, likely explained by spatial competition rather than by direct food competition. In each of epigeic species density-dependent responses were less variable and more species-specific. In contrast to endogeics, direct food competition was presumably a more important cause of density-dependence. In L. terrestris no significant density-dependent responses in adult earthworms were revealed; however, they need to be further investigated in relation to the age and territorial behaviour of individual earthworms. Importantly, in any earthworm species the density variations in the reproducing generation had significant consequences for the advancing generation, affecting either the numbers or/and the size (individual weight) of the cocoons produced. It is suggested that an underestimation of density dependent processes may cause inaccurate estimates of the activities of local lumbricid populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - Pollen supply promotes, but high temperatures demote, predatory mite abundance in avocado orchards
VL  - 164
SP  - 155-161
AB  - A biological control strategy aimed at enhancing the performance in the field of two predatory mites that are natural enemies of an invasive pest of avocado orchards was applied during two consecutive years. Unexpected poor pest control led us to analyse additional factors involved in the dynamics of the community such as summer environmental conditions, which were very hot and dry. Non-linear regressions considering biotic and abiotic effects suggested that high temperatures during the second half of the summer were central to predator/prey population dynamics. Harsh environmental conditions were therefore a direct cause of biological control disruption. We believe that, in the future, the success of biological control strategies will be limited by the natural enemy's capacity to respond adaptatively to rapid climate changes, and that research aimed at evaluating the evolutionary potential of natural enemies to rapid climate change should be the focus of future investigations.

TI  - Can Trichogramma atopovirilia Oatman & Platner replaces Trichogramma galloi Zucchi for Diatraea saccharalis (Fabricius) control?
VL  - 79
IS  - 3
AB  - Studies on aggressiveness of parasitoids, as assessed by their parasitism against pests, used in biological-control programs are highly important to select the most suitable species and/or strain to control insect pests. The present study investigated whether the egg parasitoid Trichogramma galloi Zucchi, an efficient control agent for sugarcane borer Diatraea saccharalis (Fabricius) in Brazil, could be replaced by Trichogramma atopovirilia Oatman & Platner, a parasitoid easier to mass-produce, since it has been found parasitizing D. saccharalis eggs in the warmest region of Brazil and Argentina. Three strains of the genus Trichogramma were compared: T. atopovirilia (ATP strain) reared on a factitious host Anagasta kuehniella (Zeller); T. atopovirilia isoline ATP-I, reared on D. saccharalis eggs for six generations; and T. galloi, reared on A. kuehniella eggs. We measured parasitism of each strain for 72 h and for the entire life span, parasitism rate per cluster of D. saccharalis eggs, number of parasitoids emerged (parasitism viability), and parasitoid life span. The results confirmed that T. galloi is the best species for D. saccharalis control, showing higher control potential, since parasitism and emergence rate were higher for this species. Although T. atopovirilia ATP-I performed reliably in all parameters, T. galloi exceeded and was the most indicated for mass-rearing in control programs for sugarcane borer.

TI  - Liquid and solids separation for target resource recovery from thermal hydrolyzed sludge
VL  - 171
AB  - This study proposed an integrated process for biogas generation and biochar production from thermal hydrolysis pretreated sludge (THP sludge). In this study, the liquid and solids fractions of THP sludge were separately processed for the first time. The liquid fraction of THP sludge (THP-L) reached the biodegradability (262.6 +/- 5.1 mL CH4/g tCOD(feed)) on the 15th day during anaerobic treatment, while the solids fraction of THP sludge (THP-S) only contributed 31.0% to the total methane production and required more than 30 days digestion time. We investigated the feasibility to convert THP-S into biochar to realize the higher value of the solids fraction. The results prove the produced biochar can be used as slow-release fertilizer. Preliminary energy analysis was performed to evaluate the energy efficiency of the integrated approach, namely, methane generation from THP-L coupled with biochar production from THP-S. The process realized energy surplus of 0.81 MWh/tonne dry sludge. In addition, THP-L digested sludge showed better dewaterability, lower yield stress and reduced viscosity during digestion. The proposed new sludge treatment process therefore has lower operating cost and higher value returns. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Complex responses of global insect pests to climate warming
VL  - 18
IS  - 3
SP  - 141-149
AB  - Although it is well known that insects are sensitive to temperature, how they will be affected by ongoing global warming remains uncertain because these responses are multifaceted and ecologically complex. We reviewed the effects of climate warming on 31 globally important phytophagous (plant-eating) insect pests to determine whether general trends in their responses to warming were detectable. We included four response categories (range expansion, life history, population dynamics, and trophic interactions) in this assessment. For the majority of these species, we identified at least one response to warming that affects the severity of the threat they pose as pests. Among these insect species, 41% showed responses expected to lead to increased pest damage, whereas only 4% exhibited responses consistent with reduced effects; notably, most of these species (55%) demonstrated mixed responses. This means that the severity of a given insect pest may both increase and decrease with ongoing climate warming. Overall, our analysis indicated that anticipating the effects of climate warming on phytophagous insect pests is far from straightforward. Rather, efforts to mitigate the undesirable effects of warming on insect pests must include a better understanding of how individual species will respond, and the complex ecological mechanisms underlying their responses.

TI  - Thermodynamic and Economic Analysis of a High Temperature Cascade Heat Pump System for Steam Generation
VL  - 10
IS  - 9
AB  - A high temperature cascade heat pump (HTCHP) system using low-grade heat from waste water to generate steam for industrial processes is studied from the thermodynamic and economic view. The effects of intermediate temperature, heat source temperature, heat sink temperature, working fluids, and the pinch point temperature difference at the evaporator, condenser, and intermediate heat exchanger on the thermodynamic performance and cost-effectiveness of the HTCHP system are investigated. The PBP varying with the gas price and electricity price is evaluated as well. The results show that optimal intermediate temperatures exist under different operational conditions, not only for the COP, but also for the PBP. A high heat source temperature and low heat sink temperature are conducive to increasing the COP and shortening the PBP. Working fluid pair R1234Ze(E)-R1233zd(Z) shows a promising application in the HTCHP system for its relatively high COP, short PBP, and low GWP. A lower pinch point temperature difference will cause a higher COP and shorter PBP, but a higher SEC. The energy price has a great effect on the economic viability of the system. When the price ratio is lower than 1.81, the PBP is lower than 4.6 years.

TI  - Non-toxic jatropha plants as a potential multipurpose multi-use oilseed crop
VL  - 42
SP  - 397-401
AB  - Jatropha curcas has been intensively investigated recently as a biodiesel feedstock producer because of its adaptability to adverse soil and climatic conditions. It has been seen that increasing value from by-products of oil production is important for the viability of the crop for the farmers. The seed kernel meal left after oil extraction is potentially of high market value as an animal feed ingredient. Every kilogram of oil produced from jatropha seeds generates about 0.75 kg of high quality seed kernel meal. It has a high protein content (65% on a dry matter basis) with a favourable amino acid composition, but is toxic because of the presence of compounds called phorbol esters. We introduce a non-toxic jatropha variety where phorbol esters are absent in the seeds and hence, the kernel meal can be included in animal feeds after conventional heat treatment similar to that done for soybean meal. Preliminary observations in a field trial indicates that there are non-toxic jatropha provenances that are similar to or better than the conventional toxic jatropha varieties in seed yield per plant and seed oil content. Non-toxic jatropha has potential as a viable bio-oil crop if high quality seeds are used for developing the plantation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 2
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-18
AB  - Recent advances in molecular interrogation techniques now allow unprecedented genomic inference about the role of adaptive genetic divergence in wild populations. We used high-throughput genotyping to screen a genome-wide panel of 276 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the economically and culturally important salmonid Oncorhynchus mykiss. Samples included 805 individuals from 11 anadromous and resident populations from the northwestern United States and British Columbia, and represented two major lineages including paired populations of each life history within single drainages of each lineage. Overall patterns of variation affirmed clear distinctions between lineages and in most instances, isolation by distance within them. Evidence for divergent selection at eight candidate loci included significant landscape correlations, particularly with temperature. High diversity of two nonsynonymous mutations within the peptide-binding region of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (DAB) gene provided signatures of balancing selection. Weak signals for potential selection between sympatric resident and anadromous populations were revealed from genome scans and allele frequency comparisons. Our results suggest an important adaptive role for immune-related functions and present a large genomic resource for future studies

TI  - Differences in spawning date between populations of common frog reveal local adaptation
VL  - 107
IS  - 18
SP  - 8292-8297
AB  - Phenotypic differences between populations often correlate with climate variables, resulting from a combination of environment-induced plasticity and local adaptation. Species comprising populations that are genetically adapted to local climatic conditions should be more vulnerable to climate change than those comprising phenotypically plastic populations. Assessment of local adaptation generally requires logistically challenging experiments. Here, using a unique approach and a large dataset (> 50,000 observations from across Britain), we compare the covariation in temperature and first spawning dates of the common frog ( Rana temporaria) across space with that across time. We show that although all populations exhibit a plastic response to temperature, spawning earlier in warmer years, between-population differences in first spawning dates are dominated by local adaptation. Given climate change projections for Britain in 2050-2070, we project that for populations to remain as locally adapted as contemporary populations will require first spawning date to advance by similar to 21-39 days but that plasticity alone will only enable an advance of similar to 5-9 days. Populations may thus face a microevolutionary and gene flow challenge to advance first spawning date by a further similar to 16-30 days over the next 50 years.

Beside roles played by these pathogens, microbial infections in C. gigas may derive from the contribution of a larger number of microorganisms than previously thought, according to an emerging view supporting the polymicrobial nature of bivalve diseases. In this study, the microbial communities associated with a large number of C. gigas samples collected during recurrent mortality episodes at different European sites were investigated by real-time PCR and 16SrRNA gene-based microbial profiling. A new target enrichment next-generation sequencing protocol for selective capturing of 884 phylogenetic and virulence markers of the potential microbial pathogenic community in oyster tissue was developed allowing high taxonomic resolution analysis of the bivalve pathobiota. Comparative analysis of contrasting C. gigas samples conducted using these methods revealed that oyster experiencing mortality outbreaks displayed signs of microbiota disruption associated with the presence of previously undetected potential pathogenic microbial species mostly belonging to genus Vibrio and Arcobacter. The role of these species and their consortia should be targeted by future studies aiming to shed light on mechanisms underlying polymicrobial infections in C. gigas.

TI  - The In-Vitro Activity of a Cold Atmospheric Plasma Device Utilizing Ambient Air against Bacteria and Biofilms Associated with Periodontal or Peri-Implant Diseases
VL  - 11
IS  - 6
AB  - Due to its antimicrobial and healing-promoting effects, the application of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) appears to be a promising modality in various fields of general medicine and dentistry. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of a handheld device utilizing ambient air for plasma generation. Suspensions of 11 oral bacteria (among them Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Parvimonas micra, Streptococcus gordonii, and Tannerella forsythia) were exposed to CAP for 10, 30, 60, and 120 s. Before and after treatment, colony forming unit (CFU) counts were determined. Then, 12-species biofilms were cultured on dentin and titanium specimens, and CAP was applied for 30, 60, and 120 s before quantifying CFU counts, biofilm mass, and metabolic activity. A reduction of >= 3 log(10) CFU, was found for ten out of the eleven tested species at 30 s (except for T. forsythia) and for all species at 60 s. For biofilm grown on dentin and titanium specimens, the log(10) reductions were 2.43 log(10) CFU/specimen and by about 4 log(10) CFU/specimen after 120 s of CAP. The CAP application did not reduce the biomass significantly, the metabolic activity of the biofilms on dentin and titanium decreased by 98% and 95% after 120 s of CAP. An application of 120 s of CAP had no cytotoxic effect on gingival fibroblasts and significantly increased the adhesion of gingival fibroblasts to the titanium surface. These results are promising and underline the potential of CAP for implementation in periodontal and peri-implantitis therapy.

VL  - 79
SP  - 415-430
AB  - Due to the increasing future energy demands and global warming, the renewable alternative energy sources and the efficient power systems have been getting importance over the last few decades. Among the renewable energy technologies, the solar energy coupling with fuel cell technology will be the promising possibilities for the future green energy solutions. Fuel cell cogeneration is an auspicious technology that can potentially reduce the energy consumption and environmental impact associated with serving building electrical and thermal demands. In this study, performance assessment of a co-generation system is presented to deliver electrical and thermal energy using the solar energy and the reversible solid oxide fuel cell. A mathematical model of the co-generation system is developed. To illustrate the performance, the system is considered in three operation modes: a solar-solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mode, which is low solar radiation time when the solar photovoltaic (PV) and SOFC are used for electric and heat load supply; a solar-solid oxide steam electrolyzer (SOSE) mode, which is high solar radiation time when PV is used for power supply to the electrical load and to the steam electrolyzer to generate hydrogen (H-2); and a SOFC mode, which is the power and heat generation mode of reversible SOFC using the storage H-2 at night time. Also the effects of solar radiation on the system performances and the effects of temperature on RSOFC are analyzed. In this study, 100 kW electric loads are considered and analyzed for the power and heat generation in those three modes to evaluate the performances of the system. This study is also revealed the combined heat and power (CHP) efficiency of the system. The overall system efficiency achieved for the solar-SOFC mode is 23%, for the solar-SOSE mode is 20% and for the SOFC mode is 83.6%. Besides, the Only electricity generation efficiency for the solar-SOFC mode is 15%, for the solar-SOSE mode is 14% and for the SOFC mode is 44.28%. An economic analysis is presented based on the annual electricity generation from the system and the system has shown the good economic viability in this study with a unit cost of energy (COB) about 0.068 $/kW h.

TI  - OEM's Approach on Design and Evaluation of Plastic Clamps
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
SP  - 141-149
AB  - The automotive industry, known for its competitiveness & innovations globally, researches for continuous improvement of part performances along with reduction of cost & weight. These are amongst the top priority goals across all OEMs. In the long list of automobile parts, pipe clamps have paved their way of design through generations from being of metal to plastic that has expanded its scope of application & performance. In an automobile, plastic clamps are widely used to hold single or multiple water, fuel or brake pipes of various diameters to vehicle body at various locations such as underbody (prone to stone chipping) or engine room (prone to high temperatures), etc. Plastic clamps are preferred over metallic clamps for their cost, weight, performance & productivity. Primarily, in all application areas, a clamp must be able to hold the pipes with consistent & sufficient performance that is quantified through parameters such as thrust force and pipe removal force. Hence, selection of ideal material becomes an important factor. As an example, clamps at underbody application are highly prone to stone chipping, so the impact resistance specification of material becomes an important factor for the durability performance. On the other hand, the design aspect becomes significant in cases such as increasing safety protection of pipes from surrounding parts during crash event, dampening the vibration transfer from pipe to vehicle body for better NVH performance. This paper focuses on articulating perspectives of OEM's designers on available knowledge about plastic clamps based on their experiences and propose a novel approach for design & evaluation of plastic clamps.

AB  - Air purification can effectively capture particulate matter and reduce the health risk from indoor air pollution. However, it remains a challenge to fabricate filtration materials with high filtration efficiency, low filtration resistance, and large dust holding capacity at the same time. Herein, we report Needle-punched Electret Air Filters (NEAFs) not only exhibiting the abovementioned performance, but also owning superior charge and filtration stability. By employing corona charging and MgSt charge enhancing additives, NEAFs exhibited high filtration efficiency (99.2%) and ultralow filtration resistance (13.93 Pa). Importantly, NEAFs only had 0.6% decline in filtration efficiency after heat treatment, which was much better than commercial meltblown materials. In addition, the needle-punching technique generated a unique 3D fluffy structure, resulting in a large dust holding capacity of 23.6 g m(-2). Our design of NEAFs may provide new guidelines for next-generation high-performance air filtration materials.

AB  - The biology and temperature-dependent development of Laricobius kangdingensis Zilahi-Balogh and Jelinek (Coleoptera: Derodontidae), a newly described predator of hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae Annand (Hemiptera: Adelgidae) were investigated and compared with a related HWA predator, L. nigrinus Fender, that has already been released. As with other Laricobius species, there are four larval instars. The female to male sex ratio was 1:1.1. Mean lifetime fecundity per female was 196.4 eggs and 97.9 eggs for the parental generation (P-1) and first filial generation (F-1), respectively. Developmental rates at 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18A degrees C were studied between fall 2002 and spring 2004 and used to determine low temperature development thresholds for the egg (2.8A degrees C), and larval (1.6A degrees C) stages. The egg and larval thresholds are lower than those observed for L. nigrinus. Laricobius kangdingensis individuals completed development only at 12 and 15A degrees C; however, the adults did not emerge from aestivation after pupation. Our results suggest that L. kangdingensis may be a promising addition to the complex of predators currently being reared for control of HWA. Laricobius kangdingensis is long-lived, exhibits high fecundity, and can complete development on North American HWA. However, further studies will be necessary to secure its clearance for release, and the source of high mortality in the laboratory must be identified in order to improve its survival for mass-rearing.

VL  - 27
IS  - 1
SP  - 128-145
AB  - Organisms typically show evidence of adaptation to features within their local environment. However, many species undergo long-distance dispersal or migration across larger geographic regions that consist of highly heterogeneous habitats. Therefore, selection may influence adaptive genetic variation associated with landscape features at residing sites and along migration routes in migratory species. We tested for genomic adaptation to landscape features at natal spawning sites and along migration paths to the ocean of anadromous steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Columbia River Basin. Results from multivariate ordination, gene-environment association and outlier analyses using 24,526 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) provided evidence that adaptive allele frequencies were more commonly associated with landscape features along migration paths than features at natal sites (91.8% vs. 8.2% of adaptive loci, respectively). Among the 45 landscape variables tested, migration distance to the ocean and mean annual precipitation along migration paths were significantly associated with adaptive genetic variation in three distinct genetic groups. Additionally, variables such as minimum migration water temperature and mean migration slope were significant only in inland stocks of steelhead that migrate up to 1,200km farther than those near the coast, indicating regional differences in migratory selective pressures. This study provides novel approaches for investigating migratory corridors and some of the first evidence that environment along migration paths can lead to substantial divergent selection. Consequently, our approach to understand genetic adaptation to migration conditions can be applied to other migratory species when migration or dispersal paths are generally known.

TI  - Copy number variants outperform SNPs to reveal genotype-temperature association in a marine species
VL  - 29
IS  - 24
SP  - 4765-4782
AB  - Copy number variants (CNVs) are a major component of genotypic and phenotypic variation in genomes. To date, our knowledge of genotypic variation and evolution has largely been acquired by means of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) analyses. Until recently, the adaptive role of structural variants (SVs) and particularly that of CNVs has been overlooked in wild populations, partly due to their challenging identification. Here, we document the usefulness of Rapture, a derived reduced-representation shotgun sequencing approach, to detect and investigate copy number variants (CNVs) alongside SNPs in American lobster (Homarus americanus) populations. We conducted a comparative study to examine the potential role of SNPs and CNVs in local adaptation by sequencing 1,141 lobsters from 21 sampling sites within the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence, which experiences the highest yearly thermal variance of the Canadian marine coastal waters. Our results demonstrated that CNVs account for higher genetic differentiation than SNP markers. Contrary to SNPs, for which no significant genetic-environment association was found, 48 CNV candidates were significantly associated with the annual variance of sea surface temperature, leading to the genetic clustering of sampling locations despite their geographic separation. Altogether, we provide a strong empirical case that CNVs putatively contribute to local adaptation in marine species and unveil stronger spatial signal of population structure than SNPs. Our study provides the means to study CNVs in nonmodel species and highlights the importance of considering structural variants alongside SNPs to enhance our understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes shaping adaptive population structure.

VL  - 67

AB  - This study discusses an approach to measuring and improving the economic and ecological efficiency of Kyoto Mechanism projects. The approach consists of Global Warming Eco-Efficiency (GWEE), Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) & joint Implementation (JI) Environmental-Efficiency (EE) and CDM & JI Economic-Productivity (EP). The GWEE indicator is based on the ratio of the value added of a system to its global warming influence in order to measure the eco-efficiency of a product in terms of the global warming issue. In addition, CDM & JI EE and CDM & JI EP are proposed to measure the environmental and economic performances of CDM and JI projects, respectively. While EE is defined as the ratio of the Certified Emission Reductions (CER) obtained from a CDM project or Emission Reduction Unit (ERU) from a JI project to total global warming influence relevant to the CDM or JI implemented, EP is defined as the ratio of the total of CER profit (and ERU profit) and the sales revenue to the costs of the CDM (and JI) implemented, Then, the feasibility of these indicators is examined through a case study for the power generations in the field of alternative energy.

TI  - Experimental Examination of Intraspecific Density-Dependent Competition during the Breeding Period in Monarch Butterflies (Danaus plexippus)
VL  - 7
IS  - 9
AB  - A central goal of population ecology is to identify the factors that regulate population growth. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in eastern North America re-colonize the breeding range over several generations that result in population densities that vary across space and time during the breeding season. We used laboratory experiments to measure the strength of density-dependent intraspecific competition on egg laying rate and larval survival and then applied our results to density estimates of wild monarch populations to model the strength of density dependence during the breeding season. Egg laying rates did not change with density but larvae at high densities were smaller, had lower survival, and weighed less as adults compared to lower densities. Using mean larval densities from field surveys resulted in conservative estimates of density-dependent population reduction that varied between breeding regions and different phases of the breeding season. Our results suggest the highest levels of population reduction due to density-dependent intraspecific competition occur early in the breeding season in the southern portion of the breeding range. However, we also found that the strength of density dependence could be almost five times higher depending on how many life-stages were used as part of field estimates. Our study is the first to link experimental results of a density-dependent reduction in vital rates to observed monarch densities in the wild and show that the effects of density dependent competition in monarchs varies across space and time, providing valuable information for developing robust, year-round population models in this migratory organism.

TI  - The resilience of Australian wind energy to climate change
VL  - 13
IS  - 2
AB  - The Paris Agreement limits global average temperature rise to 2 degrees C and commits to pursuing efforts in limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. This will require rapid reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases and the eventual decarbonisation of the global economy. Wind energy is an established technology to help achieve emissions reductions, with a cumulative global installed capacity of similar to 486 GW (2016). Focusing on Australia, we assess the future economic viability of wind energy using a 12-member ensemble of high-resolution regional climate simulations forced by Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) output. We examine both near future (around 2030) and far future (around 2070) changes. Extractable wind power changes vary across the continent, though the most spatially coherent change is a small but significant decrease across southern regions. The cost of future wind energy generation, measured via the Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE), increases negligibly in the future in regions with significant existing installed capacity. Technological developments in wind energy generation more than compensate for projected small reductions in wind, decreasing the LCOE by around 30%. These developments ensure viability for existing wind farms, and enhance the economic viability of proposed wind farms in Western Australian and Tasmania. Wind energy is therefore a resilient source of electricity over most of Australia and technological innovation entering the market will open new regions for energy production in the future.

TI  - Long-distance gene flow and adaptation of forest trees to rapid climate change
VL  - 15
IS  - 4
SP  - 378-392
AB  - Forest trees are the dominant species in many parts of the world and predicting how they might respond to climate change is a vital global concern. Trees are capable of long-distance gene flow, which can promote adaptive evolution in novel environments by increasing genetic variation for fitness. It is unclear, however, if this can compensate for maladaptive effects of gene flow and for the long-generation times of trees. We critically review data on the extent of long-distance gene flow and summarise theory that allows us to predict evolutionary responses of trees to climate change. Estimates of long-distance gene flow based both on direct observations and on genetic methods provide evidence that genes can move over spatial scales larger than habitat shifts predicted under climate change within one generation. Both theoretical and empirical data suggest that the positive effects of gene flow on adaptation may dominate in many instances. The balance of positive to negative consequences of gene flow may, however, differ for leading edge, core and rear sections of forest distributions. We propose future experimental and theoretical research that would better integrate dispersal biology with evolutionary quantitative genetics and improve predictions of tree responses to climate change.

VL  - 24
IS  - 2
SP  - 159-171
AB  - Inbred strains of the brine shrimp were developed from dry dormant cysts of wild-type Artemia franciscana produced in the Great Salt Lake, U.S.A. The established strains were named GSL2, 4, and 7 They were raised in 2% natural sea salt solution at 28 degrees C under a long-day condition, and fed on food sold for Artemia. Ovoviviparous offspring (free-swimming nauplii) in each brood derived from full sib (sister x brother) matings were used for succeeding generations. The ordinal number of the filial generation increased at a rate of ten generations per year. The number was over 60, and the lineage was recorded. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses of the inbred strains revealed the uniqueness, homogeneity, and genetic similarity among them. Their life span, the time required to become sexually mature, brood size, mode of reproduction, and adaptation and tolerance to salinity changes were investigated. The inbred strains usually released free-swimming nauplii rather than spawning encysted gastrulae (dormant cysts). On the other hand, the opposite results were obtained from wild-type Artemia under the same conditions. Both adults and nauplii of the inbred strains appeared to be less adaptive and less tolerant to salinity changes compared to those of the wild type. The established inbred strains should provide a wider and deeper scope for Artemia biology in particular, and the life sciences in general.

AB  - Aim: The guppy was used to demonstrate the effect of continues full-sib mating to the genetic changes and occurrence of inbreeding depression through heat stress tolerance. Methodology: Inbreeding depression were assessed from data collected from microsatellite markers and thermal tolerance experiment. The AY and NA1 strains were selected for this experiment. Results: With the progress in the inbred generations, significant decrease in thermal tolerance was observed. The observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity also decreased, indicating the on going inbred process. Significant correlation was observed only in the NA1 strain between thermal tolerances with multilocus heterozygosity (MLH) experiment both in Internal Relatedness (IR) and Standardize Heterozygosity (SH), respectively. Interpretation: MLH can be used to determent inbreeding depression only when the samples are severely inbred.

SP  - 651-658
AB  - The increasing needs of the automotive industries in order to shape thinner and more geometrically complex components along with continuous optimization of this process has put the tooling design limitation as a major challenge to be addressed. The main issues are related to thermophysical properties of the tool material, the cooling design possibilities to obtain a controlled temperature distribution over the tool working surface and the required tribological properties of the tool surface versus the blank condition. In the past few years, the challenge of obtaining high thermal conductivity tool steels with a hardenability of over 50BRc required for the tool of hot stamping has been addressed through the HTCS-lxx generation. The experience gathered with this generation confirmed the benefit of higher thermal conductivity for both the process productivity and component quality. It shows also that to face the challenges of complex shape and cooling design, the conventional hardening process on the pre-machined tool is the main limiting factor especially if one attempts to make advanced cooling design or/and complex one in the limit of machinability. Considering the promising perspectives for the emerging additive manufacturing process, more complex and sophisticated cooling lines is expected to emerge also. This paper presents the new grade of High Thermal Conductivity tool Steels (HTCS) which provides optimizations both in terms of material properties, by means of higher thermal conductivity at increased hardness levels, and also in terms of tool manufacturing. The material can be provided in a soft state in which machining is easy, but hard enough to serve for prototyping, and only a low temperature heat treatment is thereafter necessary to harden the entire block to hardness levels up to 5056 HRc. In addition to the benefit of eliminating the severe quenching requirement for hardening, cost and time consuming parts of tool manufacturing like hard machining can be avoided. Different applications in hot stamping require different properties from the tool material with respect to capacity to extract heat, tribological performance, toughness, environment resistance and reparability. In this contribution, general properties of the new tool steel grade, as well as its response to nitriding, welding, and deformation will be presented and supported by study cases.

VL  - 66

SP  - 818-830
AB  - Hybridization significantly affects the ecology and evolution of numerous plant and animal lineages. Most studies have focused on endogenous drivers of hybridization and neglected variation in exogenous factors, such as seasonal weather patterns. In this study, we take advantage of a unique dataset consisting of records of hybridization between the butterflies Colias eurytheme and C. eriphyle (Pieridae) for 66 generations (22 years) to investigate the importance of seasonal weather on the production and survival of hybrid offspring. Important seasonal weather variables for each parental species and hybrid offspring were determined using model averaging, and these weather variables, along with butterfly abundances, were analyzed using path analysis. The most important drivers of hybridization were the abundance of C. eriphyle, summer minimum temperature, and spring maximum temperature. In contrast, the abundance of C. eurytheme and weather variables prior to the current flight season were relatively unimportant for variation in hybrid abundance. Parental abundances were mostly driven by weather variables prior to the flight season possibly because these variables affect host plant quality. Our results suggest that exogenous, climatic factors can influence hybridization in natural systems, and that these factors can act both directly on hybrid abundance and indirectly through the population dynamics of parental species.

VL  - 62
IS  - 9
SP  - 1736-1742
AB  - Background Platelets for transfusion have a storage time of 5-7 days at 22 degrees C-24 degrees C, which results in a strain on the supply chain and supply shortages. We describe a novel method to extend platelet storage using xenon (Xe) gas under high pressure and refrigeration. Study Design and Methods Apheresis platelets (APU) prepared in 65% platelet additive solution (PAS) were stored under standard conditions (SC) at 20 degrees C-24 degrees C to Day 5. Paired APUs were prepared with Xe and stored to Day 14 at 2 degrees C-6 degrees C under hyperbaric conditions (XHC). A standard panel of in vitro assays was conducted. Results XHC platelets were viable out to Day 14. The average pH of Day 14 platelets was 6.58, and 86% maintained some degree of swirl compared with 7.02 and 100% swirl for Day 5 SC platelets. The rate of glycolysis was reduced under XHC storage with less glucose consumption and lactate generation. Activation levels for Day 14 platelets, while increased, did not prevent response to agonists in vitro, including epinephrine + Adenosine 5-Diphosphate (EPI/ADP) and thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP) aggregation. Thromboelastogram (TEG) assessment showed 80% or greater conservation of platelet function for Day 14 xenon stored platelets compared with Day 5 SC platelets. Discussion Platelet storage with the Xe/hyperbaric/cold method is a feasible candidate for extension of storage to 14 days based on in vitro characteristics. In vivo recovery and survival studies are indicated. The capability to extend platelet storage to 14 days would make large strides toward resolving issues of platelet outdating for prophylactic use.

AB  - Understanding airborne survival and decay of microorganisms is important for a range of public health and biodefense applications, including epidemiological and risk analysis modeling. Techniques for experimental aerosol generation, retention in the aerosol phase, and sampling require careful consideration and understanding so that they are representative of the conditions the bioaerosol would experience in the environment. This review explores the current understanding of atmospheric transport in relation to advances and limitations of aerosol generation, maintenance in the aerosol phase, and sampling techniques. Potential tools for the future are examined at the interface between atmospheric chemistry, aerosol physics, and molecular microbiology where the heterogeneity and variability of aerosols can be explored at the single-droplet and single-microorganism levels within a bioaerosol. The review highlights the importance of method comparison and validation in bioaerosol research and the benefits that the application of novel techniques could bring to increasing the understanding of aerobiological phenomena in diverse research fields, particularly during the progression of atmospheric transport, where complex interdependent physicochemical and biological processes occur within bioaerosol particles.

TI  - Hydrogen energy as a possibility of utilization of the secondary energy of Brazilian hydropower plant of Itaipu
SP  - 116-121
AB  - Secondary energy can be described as a surplus of electrical energy in a hydropower. The largest hydropower plant in Brazil and South America is Itaipu and it pertains Brazil and Paraguai. Itaipu has a lot of secondary energy disposal because of its size, the one is lost as energy spilled no turbined in the reservoir. In this study is proposed the use from this energy for electrolytical hydrogen production. The hydrogen is produced as a gas and after can be storaged as a liquid, pressurized gas, metal hydride, and transported for other places in the same country or to other country for use as energy (fuel for ZEV vehicles, electrical generation, heating, and others), used as energy carrier, or used as raw material in chemical industries (ammonia synthesis). In this study is determined the viability in the use of hydrogen of secondary energy from Itaipu as energy carrier and ammonia processing for nitrogen fertilizers.

AB  - Productivity in the machining of titanium alloys is adversely affected by rapid tool wear as a consequence of high cutting zone temperature. Conventional cutting fluids are ineffective in controlling the cutting temperature in the cutting zone. In this research work, an attempt has been made to investigate the effect of liquid nitrogen when it is applied to the rake surface, and the main and auxiliary flank surfaces through holes made in the cutting tool insert during the turning of the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The cryogenic results of the cutting temperature, cutting forces, surface roughness and tool wear of the modified cutting tool insert have been compared with those of wet machining. It has been observed that in the cryogenic cooling method, the cutting temperature was reduced by 61-66% and the surface roughness was reduced to a maximum of 36% over wet machining. The cutting force was decreased by 35-42% and the flank wear was reduced by 27-39% in cryogenic cooling over that of wet machining. Cryogenic cooling enabled a substantial reduction in the geometry of tool wear through the control of the tool wear mechanisms. The application of liquid nitrogen to the heat generation zones through holes made in the cutting tool insert was considered to be more effective over conventional machining. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The growth rates of four strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus were measured and compared in a model broth system. The results for the fastest growing strain, based on 77 combinations of temperature and water activity (a(w)) using NaCl as the humectant, were summarised in the form of a predictive mathematical model. The model, of the square-root type includes a novel term to describe the effects of super-optimal water activity, and can be used to predict generation times for the temperature range (8-45 degrees C) and water activity range (0.936-0.995) which permit growth of Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Predicted generation times from the model were compared to literature data, using bias and accuracy factors, for both laboratory media and foods. The model was shown to give realistic growth estimates, with a bias value of 1.01, and an accuracy factor of 1.38. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - Robustness promotes evolvability of thermotolerance in an RNA virus
VL  - 8
AB  - Background: The ability for an evolving population to adapt to a novel environment is achieved through a balance of robustness and evolvability. Robustness is the invariance of phenotype in the face of perturbation and evolvability is the capacity to adapt in response to selection. Genetic robustness has been posited, depending on the underlying mechanism, to either decrease the efficacy of selection, or increase the possibility of future adaptation. However, the true effect of genetic robustness on evolvability in biological systems remains uncertain. Results: Here we demonstrate that genetic robustness increases evolvability of thermotolerance in laboratory populations of the RNA virus phi 6. We observed that populations founded by robust clones evolved greater resistance to heat shock, relative to populations founded by brittle (less-robust) clones. Thus, we provide empirical evidence for the idea that robustness can promote evolvability in this environment, and further suggest that evolvability can arise indirectly via selection for robustness, rather than through direct selective action. Conclusion: Our data imply that greater tolerance of mutational change is associated with virus adaptability in a new niche, a finding generally relevant to evolutionary biology, and informative for elucidating how viruses might evolve to emerge in new habitats and/or overcome novel therapies.

TI  - Thermal traits govern the response of microbial community dynamics and ecosystem functioning to warming
VL  - 13
AB  - Understanding the ecological processes that underpin the dynamics of community turnover in response to environmental change is critical to predicting how warming will influence ecosystem functioning. Here, we quantify the effect of changing temperature on community composition and ecosystem functioning via the action of ecological selection on population-level thermal traits. To achieve this, we use microbes isolated from a network of geothermal streams in Iceland where in situ temperatures span 8-38 degrees C within a single catchment. We first quantified variability in thermal tolerance between taxa, and then assembled synthetic communities along a broad thermal gradient to explore how temperature-driven selection on thermal tolerance traits shaped the emergent community structures and functions. We found marked changes in community structure and composition with temperature, such that communities exposed to extreme temperatures (10, 35 degrees C) had highly asymmetric biomass distributions and low taxonomic richness. Thermal optima were a good predictor of the presence and relative abundance of taxa in the high-temperature treatments. We also found that the evenness of the abundance distribution was related to ecosystem production, such that communities with more equitable abundance distribution were also the most productive. Our results highlight the utility of using a multi-level approach that links population-level traits with community structure and ecosystem functioning to better understand how ecological communities will respond to global warming.

TI  - Sanitation and Drying of Sewage Sludge on Radiant Floors Using Solar Energy and Biogas: Comparison between Different Thicknesses of Deposited Mass
VL  - 61
AB  - Sewage sludge is a solid waste composed of water, rich in organic matter and nutrients, but concentrator of pathogenic microorganisms. Its use as agricultural fertilizer in the state of Parana, Brazil is common. However, it is necessary to eliminate or significantly reduce microorganisms by means of a hygiene process. This can be obtained thermally, requiring a source of energy for heat generation. In this sense, a pilot system was constructed consisting of a stainless steel radiant floor, capable of transferring heat to the sewage sludge from coils coupled in base, through which the heated water circulates. The energy comes from solar radiation and is complemented by biogas from the anaerobic sewage treatment. Aiming to investigate the system's ability to transfer heat and, consequently, to sanitize and dry the sludge, a layer of 0.10 m was deposited on the radiant floor, the temperature being monitored at two different heights, obtaining averages of 328.95 K (55.8 degrees C) and 336.95 K (63.8 degrees C), respectively. The sludge was still submitted to a drying process, where a 68.68% increase in the total solids content was verified. Finally, the energy consumption was measured where a demand of 29.22 Nm(3) of methane per m(3) of treated sludge had been estimated.

TI  - Timing and Weather Offer Alternative Mitigation Strategies for Lowering Bat Mortality at Wind Energy Facilities in Ontario
VL  - 11
IS  - 12
AB  - Simple Summary Wind farms represent one of the largest sources of anthropogenic mortality for bats. Wind proponents attempt to mitigate these effects via operational curtailment, such that wind energy is not produced on nights with low wind speeds during the late summer and fall. Our study modeled bat activity and mortality on two timescales (nightly and seasonally) and in response to a range of weather variables. We showed that bat mortality risks could be lowered and opportunities for wind energy production can be increased by focusing curtailment efforts to the periods of the night and year when bats are most active and by considering a wider range of weather variables, compared to standard curtailment strategies. Relatively high mortality of migratory bats at wind energy facilities has prompted research to understand the underlying spatial and temporal factors, with the goal of developing more effective mitigation approaches. We examined acoustic recordings of echolocation calls at 12 sites and post-construction carcass survey data collected at 10 wind energy facilities in Ontario, Canada, to quantify the degree to which timing and regional-scale weather predict bat activity and mortality. Rain and low temperatures consistently predicted low mortality and activity of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and three species of migratory tree bats: hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), eastern red bat (L. borealis), and silver-haired bat (Lasionycteris noctivagans). Bat activity occurred in waves with distinct peaks through the season; regardless of seasonal timing, most activities occurred in the first half of the night. We conclude that wind energy facilities could adopt a novel and more effective curtailment strategy based on weather and seasonal and nocturnal timing that would minimize mortality risks for bats while increasing the opportunities for power generation, relative to the mitigation strategy of increasing cut-in wind speed to 5.5 m/s.

TI  - Prokaryotic RNA Associated to Bacterial Viability Induces Polymorphonuclear Neutrophil Activation
VL  - 7
AB  - Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are the first cellular line of antibacterial host defense. They sense pathogens through recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by innate pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR). The aim of this study was to investigate whether PMN sense bacterial viability and explore which viability factor could be involved in this phenomenon. For this purpose, different functions were evaluated in isolated human PMN using live Escherichia coli (Ec) and heat-killed Ec (HK-Ec). We found that bacterial viability was indispensable to induce PMN activation, as measured by forward-scatter (FSC) increase, CD11b surface expression, chemotaxis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. As uncapped non-polyadenylated prokaryotic mRNA has been recognized as a PAMP associated to bacterial viability by macrophages and dendritic cells, total prokaryotic RNA (pRNA) from live Ec was purified and used as a stimulus for PMN. pRNA triggered similar responses to those observed with live bacteria. No RNA could be isolated from HK-Ec, explaining the lack of effect of dead bacteria. Moreover, the supernatant of dead bacteria was able to induce PMN activation, and this was associated with the presence of pRNA in this supernatant, which is released in the killing process. The induction of bactericidal functions (ROS and NETosis) by pRNA were abolished when the supernatant of dead bacteria or isolated pRNA were treated with RNAse. Moreover, endocytosis was necessary for pRNA-induced ROS generation and NETosis, and priming was required for the induction of pRNA-induced ROS in whole blood. However, responses related to movement and degranulation (FSC increase, CD11b up-regulation, and chemotaxis) were still triggered when pRNA was digested with RNase, and were not dependent on pRNA endocytosis or PMN priming. In conclusion, our results indicate that PMN sense live bacteria through recognition of pRNA, and this sensing triggers potent bactericidal mechanisms.

AB  - From a brief historical overview of the ideas on bubble generation, some directives for developing of efficient structures with nucleate boiling are deduced in the first part of the paper. Then, starting from the survival conditions of a vapour bubble in a liquid with a temperature gradient, a criterion is obtained for the creation of such structures. The efficiency of a heater surface covered with a structure is considered ideal if the driving temperature difference does not change with the heat flux. Experiments show that constancy of the wall superheat can be realized on surfaces provided with an appropriate micro-structure. The required properties of the structure are: It must be generated from identical elements which are arranged in a mono-pattern on the heating surface, the structure elements (protrusions) must trap vapour after bubble detachment and generate a possibly long three-phase-line (TPL) formed by intersection of the vapour-liquid interface with the heating surface.

TI  - Biodiversity monitoring: some proposals to adequately study species' responses to climate change
VL  - 18
IS  - 12
SP  - 3185-3203
AB  - Climate change affects all levels of biology and is a major threat for biodiversity. Hence, it is fundamental to run biodiversity monitoring programs to understand the effects of climate change on the biota and to be able to adjust management and conservation accordingly. So far, however, very few existing monitoring programs allow for the detection of climate change effects, as shown by a survey undertaken by the European project EuMon. Despite this shortcoming, several methods exist which allow to make inferences from existing data by integrating data across different monitoring programs: correlative analyses, meta-analyses and models. In addition, experiments are thought to be useful tools to understand the effects of climate change on plants and animals. Here, we evaluate the utility of these four main approaches. All these methods allow to evaluate long term effects of climate change and make predictions of species' future development, but they are arguable. We list and compare their benefits and inconveniences, which can lead to uncertainties in the extrapolation of species responses to global climate change. Individual characteristics and population parameters have to be more frequently monitored. The potential evolution of a species should be also modelled, to extrapolate results across spatial and temporal scales as well as to analyse the combined effects of different climatic and biotic factors, including intra but also interspecific relationships. We conclude that a combination of methodologies would be the most promising tool for the assessment of biological responses to climate change, and we provide some thoughts about how to do so. Particularly, we encourage long-term studies along natural gradients (altitudinal or latitudinal) on the same species/habitats to be able to extrapolate to large geographic scales, and to have more complete data sets, necessary to understand the mechanisms of responses. Such data may provide a more accurate base for simulations across spatial and temporal scales, especially if they are publicly available in a common database. These recommendations could allow the adaptation of species management and the development of conservation tools to climate change which threatens species.

TI  - Genetic variability and possible genetic advance for sterility tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L) through breeding
SP  - 135-143
AB  - Sterility in wheat is becoming one of the most important constraints to wheat production in Nepal. Cold temperatures during the reproductive phase at higher elevations and low concentrations of available soil boron at lower altitudes are the two major causes identified. Research in the last three decades has been concentrated on husbandry practices to tackle the problem, but there have been few practical recommendations made for the farmers. Earlier studies had indicated genetic variation for relative tolerance to both types of sterility. However, all types of soils, irrespective of altitude and cropping patterns, are deficient in available soil boron. Consequently, it is very likely that low-boron-induced sterility has been confounded with cold-induced sterility. In this study, well adapted modem varieties such as L-52, NL-297, Annapurna-3 and Paudur Local (a landrace) were identified as sterility-tolerant parents and included in a crossing program. Broad sense heritability (h(2)) and genetic gains for sterility tolerance were measured. Broad sense heritability of the means of the F-2 and F-3 plants for sterility tolerance was between 14% and 53%. Progeny of Annapurna-3/RR-21, Annapurna-3/BL-1142, Paudur Local/BL-1022 and Paudur Local/NL-297 showed transgressive segregation for sterility tolerance. The predicted genetic gain for sterility tolerance by early generation selection was between 10% and 44%. High predicted genetic gains from selection at early stages in some families were found, but further studies need to be conducted to prepare for a program to develop sterility-tolerant varieties.

AB  - The depletion of fossil fuels and environmental issues that have been brought by them make researchers search for alternative energy resources. Geothermal energy as a reliable sustainable resource has significant potential in the mitigation of greenhouse gas and pollution emissions. In this article, three different geothermal-based systems are designed for hydrogen and electricity production. All three configurations used the same low temperature geothermal energy. The three proposed systems include ORC, APC and KCS system integrated with PEM technology. These systems are analyzed and compared to energy, exergy, thermoeconomic aspects. The net thermal productivity for the PEM-ORC system, PEM-APC system, and PEM-KCS system are respectively 11.89%, 13.46%, and 11.05%. The overall exergy efficiency for the PEM-ORC system, PEM-APC system, and PEMKCS system are respectively 50.82%, 48.41%, and 49.02%. The hydrogen production rate of three configurations of PEM-ORC, PEM-APC, and PEM-KCS is 4.78 kg/h, 5.154 kg/h and 4.581 kg/h. Besides the total SUCP of the PEM-ORC unit is 76.72 $/GJ. The net SUCP of the PEM-APC system is 78.89 $/GJ, this value for combined PEM-KCS is 259.9 $/GJ. Moreover, a comprehensive sensitivity evaluation is carried out on the system to evaluate the impact of the key variables on the operation of the plant. Then, optimization procedures are conducted for all three systems. Four TOED, EOED, SOED and MOED methods are employed for this purpose. The SOED method decreased the SUCP of the PEM-KSC system signifi-cantly about 22%. The MOED enhances the exergy productivity of the PEM-ORC system about 10%.

VL  - 75
SP  - 665-674
AB  - Central receiver systems (CRS) are a promising concentrated solar power (CSP) technology for dispatchable electricity generation. The CRS levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is usually increased by low power-block capacity factors or by high thermal storage costs. The economical turnover is still positive for the Portuguese case but depends on the bonus feed-in tariffs. On the other hand, with biomass existing feed-in tariffs and raising prices, the viability of current biomass power plants is at risk. To address these issues, several base case power plants and hybrid biomass/CSP options are analyzed: wood gasification, refuse-derived fuel pellets, biogas from a wastewater anaerobic digester, biogas from a landfill and natural gas. The solution with lower LCOE was obtained for the hybridization of a 4 MWe CRS using an atmospheric volumetric receiver with biogas from an anaerobic digester using sludge from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Different results would be obtained for the hybrid systems if different CRS technologies are used. The hybrid CRS/anaerobic digester power plant LCOE is 0.15 (sic)/kWh, returning the investment in 13 years (assuming sludge collection and transport without cost) with the best net present value (15 million euro) and internal rate of return of all the hybrid options.

TI  - Calorific Value of Festuca rubra Biomass in the Phytostabilization of Soil Contaminated with Nickel, Cobalt and Cadmium Which Disrupt the Microbiological and Biochemical Properties of Soil
VL  - 15
IS  - 9
AB  - The choice of optimal plant species for phytoremediation and organic fertilization plays an important role in stabilizing the functions of soils contaminated with heavy metals. The influence of nickel, cobalt and cadmium on the biomass yield and calorific value of Festuca rubra, heavy metal concentrations in soil and plants and the microbiological, biochemical and physicochemical proprieties of soil were analyzed in a pot experiment. The tolerance index (TI) describing Festuca rubra's ability to tolerate heavy metals, as well as the translocation (TF), accumulation (AF) and bioaccumulation (BF) factors of heavy metals in Festuca rubra were calculated. The experiment was conducted in two series: In soil fertilized and not fertilized with compost. Nickel and cobalt significantly inhibited the growth and development of Festuca rubra. The experiment demonstrated that this plant species can be grown on soil contaminated with heavy metals. Festuca rubra contained on average 46.05% C, 34.59% O, 5.91% H, 3.49% N, 0.19% S and 9.76% ash. Festuca rubra has a stable calorific value which is not affected by heavy metals; therefore, biomass harvested from heavy metal-polluted soil can be used for energy generation. The calorific value of Festuca rubra ranged from 15.924 to 16.790 MJ kg(-1) plant d.m., and the heat of combustion from 17.696 to 18.576 MJ kg(-)(1). It has a stable calorific value which is not affected by heavy metals, therefore biomass harvested from heavy metal-polluted soil can be used for energy generation. Festuca rubra is particularly useful for the phytostabilization of soil contaminated with cadmium and cobalt. Compost minimizes the adverse effects of heavy metal pollution on the microbiological, biochemical and physicochemical properties of soil.

VL  - 1
AB  - Biomass incineration is increasingly used for the generation of heat and/or electricity. After incineration two ash fractions remain. Bottom ashes (the coarser ash fraction) can usually be used as fertilizing agent on fields as it contains valuable elements for soils and plants and only minor concentrations of heavy metals. Fly ashes (the finer ash fraction) are in most cases disposed as their heavy metal concentrations are too high for a usage as soil enhancer. In this study highly heavy metal contaminated fly ash has been cleaned through extraction with hydrochloric acid. The heavy metals were removed from the extract by precipitation with sodium hydroxide. After the cleaning procedure the ash can be pelletized and be returned to the soils.

AB  - We report lasing from nonpolar p-i-n InGaN/GaN multi-quantum well core-shell single-nanowire lasers by optical pumping at room temperature. The nanowire lasers were fabricated using a hybrid approach consisting of a top-down two-step etch process followed by a bottom-up regrowth process, enabling precise geometrical control and high material gain and optical confinement. The modal gain spectra and the gain curves of the core-shell nanowire lasers were measured using micro-photoluminescence and analyzed using the Hakki-Paoli method. Significantly lower lasing thresholds due to high optical gain were measured compared to previously reported semipolar InGaN/GaN core-shell nanowires, despite significantly shorter cavity lengths and reduced active region volume. Mode simulations show that due to the core-shell architecture, annular shaped modes have higher optical confinement than solid transverse modes. The results show the viability of this p-i-n nonpolar core-shell nanowire architecture, previously investigated for next-generation light-emitting diodes, as low-threshold, coherent UV-visible nanoscale light emitters, and open a route toward monolithic, integrable, electrically injected single-nanowire lasers operating at room temperature.

AB  - The 1998 global coral bleaching event was the largest recorded historical disturbance of coral reefs and resulted in extensive habitat loss. Annual censuses of reef fish community structure over a 12-year period spanning the bleaching event revealed a marked phase shift from a prebleach to postbleach assemblage. Surprisingly, we found that the bleaching event had no detectable effect on the abundance, diversity or species richness of a local cryptobenthic reef fish community. Furthermore, there is no evidence of regeneration even after 5-35 generations of these short-lived species. These results have significant implications for our understanding of the response of coral reef ecosystems to global warming and highlight the importance of selecting appropriate criteria for evaluating reef resilience.

AB  - This research aimed at studing Telenomas remus Nixon biology reared on Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) eggs at different temperatures. Based on the development of the cycle (egg-adult), the thermal requirements and the number of parasitoid generations at constant temperatures were determined. Initially, 24-hour-old S. frugiperda eggs were submitted to parasitism by T remus during 5 h, being then transferred to acclimatized chambers regulated at 15, 20, 25, 28, 31, and 35 degrees C. The cycle (egg to adult) was influenced by temperature varying front 8.3 +/- 0.01 to 47.2 +/- 0.01 for females and 8.1 +/- 0.01 to 46.8 +/- 0.01 days for males at 31 and 15 degrees C, respectively. The emergency (%) was also influenced by temperature. A reduction in emergency was observed at 15 degrees C and no emergency at 35 degrees C. T remus sex ratio was not influenced by temperature. Sexual rate was not changed by temperature. Regarding to thermal requirements, thermal constant (K) and linferior thermal threshold (Tb) were higher for T remus females (158.88 degree-days anti 12.5 degrees C) when compared to males (154.12 degree-days and 12.6 degrees C). The estimated number of T. remus generation per year for males and females at laboratory conditions was 5.6 and 5.6, 16.9 and 17.3, 28.3 and 29.0, 35.1 and 36.0, 39.6 and 40.7 at 15, 20, 25, 28, and 31 degrees C, respectively.

AB  - Studies on the development and mortality of Paratanytarsus grimmii (Schneider) and Corynoneura scutellata (Winnertz), which can infest potable water distribution networks, were carried out at eight constant temperatures between 10 degreesC and 27 degreesC. Using weighted linear regression, the developmental thresholds were calculated as 7.9 and 8.7degreesC for P. grimmii and C. scutellata, respectively. Corynoneura scutellata had a day-degree requirement of 172.4 per generation and developed significantly faster (P < 0.001) than P. grimmii with a day-degree requirement of 294.1. Both species were identified as multivoltine with a maximum theoretical number of five generations per year for P. grimmii and seven for C. scutellata. These results are discussed in the context of the management of chironomid infestations within water-treatment works.

AB  - The paper provides an assessment of the current wind energy potential in Ukraine, and discusses developmental prospects for wind-hydrogen power generation in the country. Hydrogen utilization is a highly promising option for Ukraine's energy system, environment, and business. In Ukraine, an optimal way towards clean zero-carbon energy production is through the development of the wind-hydrogen sector. In order to make it possible, the energy potential of industrial hydrogen production and use has to be studied thoroughly. Ukraine possesses huge resources for wind energy supply. At the beginning of 2020, the total installed capacity of Ukrainian wind farms was 1.17 GW. Wind power generation in Ukraine has significant advantages in comparison to the use of traditional sources such as thermal and nuclear energy. In this work, an assessment of the wind resource potential in Ukraine is made via the geographical approach suggested by the authors, and according to the "Methodical guidelines for the assessment of average annual power generation by a wind turbine based on the long-term wind speed observation data". The paper analyses the long-term dynamics of average annual wind speed at 40 Ukrainian weather stations that provide valid data. The parameter for the vertical wind profile model is calculated based on the data reanalysis for 10 m and 50 m altitudes. The capacity factor (CF) for modern wind turbine generators is determined. The CF spatial distribution for an average 3 MW wind turbine and the power generation potential for the wind power plants across the territory of Ukraine are mapped. Based on the wind energy potential assessment, the equivalent possible production of water electrolysis-derived green hydrogen is estimated. The potential average annual production of green hydrogen across the territory of Ukraine is mapped. It is concluded that Ukraine can potentially establish wind power plants with a total capacity of 688 GW on its territory. The average annual electricity production of this system is supposed to reach up to 2174 bln kWh. Thus, it can provide an average annual production of 483 billion Nm(3) (43 million tons) of green hydrogen by electrolysis. The social efficiency of investments in wind-hydrogen electricity is presented. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The growth on different stored legume species affects the profiles of cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) in Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say)
VL  - 50
SP  - 66-72
AB  - Acanthoscelides obtectus (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) is a widespread pest of stored products from Fabaceae family. The evolution of this species is associated with common bean domestication and the ability to invade other hosts in storages. To analyze the role of diverse nutrition in the ability of insects to shift to another host species we tested the effects of nutrition history on composition of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), the compounds that have various ecological and reproductive functions in insects. The study was performed on A. obtectus laboratory populations which were bred for 51 generations either on common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris (L), or on chickpea, Cicer arietinum (L), a novel and less suitable species for larval development. To obtain conclusions about short-term nutritional effects, we tested whether exposure of seed weevils to alternative hosts for just one generation might influence CHC composition. Gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses were performed and compounds' relative abundances were computed from the corresponding GC-FID peak areas. A total of 21 compounds were identified, among which 38% showed significant abundance differences between selection regimes and for 33% of compounds short-term developmental effects were revealed. All except three compounds showed significant differences between genders. We hypothesized that long-term changes in quantitative levels of specific CHC compounds were the results of diverse selection pressures on weevils' metabolic pathways induced by chemically divergent hosts. However, long-term adaptations to host species did not influence the ability of A. obtectus to quickly respond to chemical specificities of novel hosts (i.e., short-term effects were significant) which could be one of the major reasons for the great expansiveness of this species. Differences in relative CHCs abundances between sexes implied their roles in chemical communication and mate recognition systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Increased Missense Mutation Burden of Fatty Acid Metabolism Related Genes in Nunavik Inuit Population
VL  - 10
IS  - 5
AB  - Background Nunavik Inuit (northern Quebec, Canada) reside along the arctic coastline where for generations their daily energy intake has mainly been derived from animal fat. Given this particular diet it has been hypothesized that natural selection would lead to population specific allele frequency differences and unique variants in genes related to fatty acid metabolism. A group of genes, namely CPT1A, CPT1B, CPT1C, CPT2, CRAT and CROT, encode for three carnitine acyltransferases that are important for the oxidation of fatty acids, a critical step in their metabolism. Methods Exome sequencing and SNP array genotyping were used to examine the genetic variations in the six genes encoding for the carnitine acyltransferases in 113 Nunavik Inuit individuals. Results Altogether ten missense variants were found in genes CPT1A, CPT1B, CPT1C, CPT2 and CRAT, including three novel variants and one Inuit specific variant CPT1A p.P479L (rs80356779). The latter has the highest frequency (0.955) compared to other Inuit populations. We found that by comparison to Asians or Europeans, the Nunavik Inuit have an increased mutation burden in CPT1A, CPT2 and CRAT; there is also a high level of population differentiation based on carnitine acyltransferase gene variations between Nunavik Inuit and Asians. Conclusion The increased number and frequency of deleterious variants in these fatty acid metabolism genes in Nunavik Inuit may be the result of genetic adaptation to their diet and/or the extremely cold climate. In addition, the identification of these variants may help to understand some of the specific health risks of Nunavik Inuit.

SP  - 819-828
AB  - The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is leading a national effort to develop next-generation cooling technologies for hybrid vehicle electronics, as part of the Advanced Power Electronics and Electrical Machines program area in the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Vehicle Technologies Program. The overarching goal is to reduce the size, weight, and cost of power electronic modules that convert direct current from the batteries to alternating current for the motor, and vice versa. Aggressive thermal management techniques help in achieving the goals of increased power density and reduced weight and volume, while keeping the chip temperatures within acceptable limits. The viability of aggressive cooling schemes such as spray and jet impingement in conjunction with enhanced surfaces is being explored as part of the program. In this work, we present results from a series of experiments with pool and spray boiling on enhanced surfaces, such as a microporous layer of copper and copper nanowires, using HFE-7100 as the working fluid. Spray impingement on the microporous coated surface showed an enhancement of 100%-300% in the heat transfer coefficient at a given wall superheat with respect to spray impingement on a plain surface under similar operating conditions. The critical heat flux also increased by 7%-20%, depending on the flow rates. Heat transfer coefficients obtained on the nanowire-grown surface are considerably better than those obtained on the plain surface, although the enhancement is lower than those obtained on the microporous surface. The critical heat flux is also considerably lower for the nanowire surface than for the plain surface.

AB  - Bagasse is abundantly available agricultural crop waste obtained from renewable source, so it was used as raw material for ethanol production. Acid and heat pretreatment in combination with biological saccharificarion was evaluated for conversion of bagasse cellulose and hemicelluloses to fermentable sugars. Maximum yield of monomeric sugars (13.98 w/v) was achieved when acidic pretreatment in combination with heat was subsequently followed by enzymatic saccharificarion. The maximum ethanol production from S. cerevisae cells (1.6 x 10(9)) entrapped in sodium alginate beads of diameter 2.0-2.5 mm 14.0 g/L was achieved with ethanol productivity of 10 gL(-1) h(-1) and sugar utilization of 85% at dilution rate of 0.25 h(-1) by feeding 60 g/L glucose concentration in packed bed reactor at temperature 25 degrees C and pH 5.5. This system for ethanol production was operationally stable for 136 h (cycle of 68 h).

AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) have been emerging as attractive and promising methods for tumor treatment in clinical approaches. CuS nanoparticles are effective and cost-effective agents for PIT. Recently, it was observed that CuS nanoparticles are also excellence candidates for PDT. However, the mechanisms for CuS nanoparticles as PDT agents have never been discussed. The goal here is to explore the killing mechanisms of CuS nanoparticles as PTT and PDT agents. CuS nanoparticles were synthesized by a simple wet chemistry method by coating with amphiphilic polymer and examined for their therapeutic potential on lung adenocarcinoma cell line SPC-A-1 in vitro and in vivo using a murine cancer model. The CuS nanoparticles produce heat as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) when excited by 808 nm laser and show strong anticancer effects both in vitro and in vivo. The heating effects and release of copper ions from CuS upon heating in the tumor acidic environments are the main mechanisms for the generation of reactive oxygen species which are lethal bullets for cancer destruction. As a dual-function agent for PTT and PDT, CuS nanoparticles are promising phototherapy agents for cancer treatment.

TI  - Characterising the source rocks in petroleum systems using organic and stable isotope geochemistry: An overview
VL  - 23
IS  - 1
SP  - 10-27
AB  - Geochemical investigations for correlating the petroleum (oil and gas) with source rocks and that with petroleum itself, which can be produced from a similar or dissimilar source rock, is important for the assessment of generation potential of a prolific or potential petroleum system. Analytical advancements have synergized the hydrocarbon exploration methods, with exploration geochemistry becoming increasingly an integral part of source rock characterization. Geochemical studies investigate the presence and properties of hydrocarbons trapped in geological formations, or the potential to generate such hydrocarbons and provide source rocks properties, by measuring the compositional changes associated with hydrocarbon generation, migration, accumulation and production. These are critical for proper and efficient management of the hydrocarbon assets at all stages. The source rocks and the petroleum are primarily characterized utilizing the organic geochemical and stable isotope techniques. Organic geochemistry deciphers the source, depositional environment and thermal maturity of sedimentary organic matter from which the hydrocarbons are generated and the stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen describe the paleo productivity, origin, evolution and correlation of organic matter with generated or in situ hydrocarbon components. The paper presents an overview of the stable isotopic and organic geochemical properties of shales from Damodar Valley basin of India in the light of its gas generation potential.

TI  - Techno-economic analysis of polygeneration systems with carbon capture and storage and CO2 reuse
VL  - 219
SP  - 96-108
AB  - Several decarbonised polygeneration schemes exploiting carbon capture and storage (CCS) or CO2 reuse technologies for the generation of clean fuels, chemicals, electricity and heat have been systematically analysed for techno-economic feasibility. Process simulation, energy integration and economic analysis were undertaken to analyse the effect of process configurations and operating conditions on the economic potential (EP) and risks. CO2 capture and reuse producing methane using Sabatier's reaction shows less favourable economics compared to the counterpart CCS based scheme, both producing electricity, hydrogen, acetic acid and methanol in common. Post-combustion CO2 tri-reforming into methanol production in addition to electricity generation shows overall favourable economics compared to the counterpart integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) with CCS scheme. Thus, increasing product portfolio from energy products in a cogeneration plant to chemical products evolved from thermodynamic and process integration synergies increases the techno-economic viability. Bio-oil can be processed as an alternative low carbon feedstock. While bio-oil creates environmental incentives, its economic competitiveness can be enhanced by introducing credits on product prices.

TI  - Paleoproterozoic mafic dike swarms of northeast Laurentia: products of plumes or ambient mantle?
VL  - 225
IS  - 3
SP  - 305-317
AB  - The occurrence of mafic dike swarms in Archean and Paleoproterozoic terranes is often cited as evidence for mantle plume activity associated with abnormally high mantle potential temperatures (T-p). Quantitative modeling of rare-carth-element (REE) abundances for the 2.04 Ga Kangamiut dike swarm in west Greenland and comparisons among other Paleoproterozoic dike swarms in northeast Laurentia indicates that the conditions for mantle melt generation were similar beneath much of Laurentia and only ca. 120 degreesC hotter than present-day ambient mantle (T-p ca. 1300 degreesC). These thermal conditions correspond closely to estimates of ambient mantle potential temperatures during the Paleoproterozoic era based on secular cooling models and continental freeboard constraints. Thus, the geochemistry of most Paleoproterozoic dikes of northeast Laurentia can be accounted for by partial melting of upwelling mantle accompanying passive rifting and do not necessitate plume activity. Ambient mantle conditions during the Paleoproterozoic (T-p ca. 1420 degreesC) are similar to those inferred for the Paleogene volcanic rift margins of the North Atlantic igneous province, where the rate of crustal production associated with early oceanic spreading was two to three times higher than at the modern ridge. Likewise, rifting under ambient mantle conditions in the Precambrian could have resulted in similar rates of crustal productivity and thus contributed significantly to continental growth.

VL  - 7

SP  - 7111-7117
AB  - The integration of electrochromic (EC) and thermochromic (TC) systems is important for realizingmulti-functional smart windows, which can adaptively control light transmittance and solar energy in response to diverse external stimuli. In this study, we developed an all-solid-state multifunctional smart window, in which tungsten oxide (WO3)-based EC and vanadium oxide (VO2)-based TC cells were integrated into a single device. In hybrid smart windows, the WO3-based EC layer modulates optical transmission in response to electrical voltage, while the VO2-based TC layer regulates solar energy transmission responding to the surrounding temperature. Therefore, such windows can control optical transmission and solar energy transmission in response to an electric stimulus and temperature change simultaneously or independently, allowing for a selective modulation of light in the visible and near-infrared regions. We demonstrated the viability of the proposed integrated smart window system by varying its optical transmission in four different optical states depending on its EC reaction and TC behavior. The concept for the integration of EC and TC cells into a single device can pave the way for next-generation multifunctional smart window systems.

VL  - 70

SP  - 735-737
AB  - The influence of ambient temperature and applied electric field on the electrical properties of high resistivity (1-30 k Omega cm), semi-insulating (>100 k Omega cm), and insulating (10(11)-10(12)Omega cm) single-crystal 6H-SiC is reported. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of lateral metal-semiconductor-metal test structures were measured in vacuum in a temperature range of 295-730 K and under moderate pulsed electric fields (0.5-80 kV/cm). It is shown that the resistivity of the undoped 6H-SiC varies strongly with the ambient temperature after a temperature/field function dominated by a factor containing the activation (ionization) energy of residual boron of 0.35 eV. The dominant activation energy of semi-insulating Vanadium-compensated material (6H-SiC:V) varies with the ambient temperature, increasing from similar to 0 eV at 295-320 K to similar to 0.8 eV at T greater than or equal to 600 K. This result can explain the relatively low decrease of the resistivity of insulating 6H-SiC at very high ambient temperatures and its viability as a substrate for next-generation high temperature microwave integrated circuits based on large band gap semiconductors.

VL  - 70
SP  - 805-813
AB  - The combustion of fossil fuels for purposes of energy production has accelerated the rate at which the planet is warming, thereby causing adverse effects on natural ecosystems across the globe. The consequences of climate change arising from the use of conventional fuels such as coal, oil, and gas deinands a shift towards the use of sustainable, emissions-free renewable energy technologies. When planning for the implementation of new energy systems, several factors must be examined in order to determine the viability of a system to Meet energy demands in a sustainable and efficient manner. This paper provides an overview of tidal current turbines (TCTs), examining how they function to produce electricity, the possible environmental impacts surrounding large-scale implementation, associated economic factors, and public acceptability. A case study of the Gulf of St. Lawrence is presented as an implementation site, demonstrating the potential for TCTs to assist in phasing out the use of fossil fuels for electricity generation on the Newfoundland island interconnected electricity system. A multi-criteria decision making matrix is presented to discern the benefits of TCTs compared to fossil fuels for the purpose of electricity generation. The paper concludes by examining the potential future of TCTs in the world.

AB  - Ethylene glycol-based nanogels (NGs) have demonstrated their potential for the development of next-generation formulations for biomedical applications due to their interesting properties. In this work, monodispersed NGs based on oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylates (OEG) were synthesized through free radical precipitation/dispersion polymerization assisted by ultrasonication. Di(ethylene glycol)methyl ether methacrylate (DEGMA) and oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (OEGMA; M-n 475 g mol(-1)) were used as the main monomers, acrylic acid (AA) or itaconic acid (IA) as co-monomers (OEG-co-AA and OEG-co-IA, respectively) and tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) as crosslinker. The physicochemical properties of OEG-co-AA and OEG-co-IA NGs were studied including hydrodynamic diameter, poly-dispersity index, zeta potential and pH/temperature responsiveness. Samples with 4 mol% of both AA and IA showed nanometric sizes. Regarding their thermo-responsiveness, unexpected differences between NGs with AA or with IA were observed. Besides, NGs did not impair the cell viability of a breast tumour cell line even when high concentrations were added to the culture medium. The properties of the synthetized NGs showed that either NGs with 4% AA or with 4% IA are outstanding candidates for biomedical applications.

TI  - The Potential Role of Flexibility During Peak Hours on Greenhouse Gas Emissions: A Life Cycle Assessment of Five Targeted National Electricity Grid Mixes
VL  - 12
IS  - 23
AB  - On the path towards the decarbonization of the electricity supply, flexibility and demand response have become key factors to enhance the integration of distributed energy resources, shifting the consumption from peak hours to off-peak hours, optimizing the grid usage and maximizing the share of renewables. Despite the technical viability of flexible services, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has not been proven. Traditionally, emissions are calculated on a yearly average timescale, not providing any information about peak hours' environmental impact. Furthermore, peak-hours' environmental impacts are not always greater than on the base load, depending on the resources used for those time periods. This paper formulates a general methodology to assess the potential environmental impact of peak-hourly generation profiles, through attributional life cycle assessment. This methodology was applied to five different countries under the INVADE H2020 Project. Evaluation results demonstrate that countries like Spain and Bulgaria could benefit from implementing demand response activities considering environmental aspects, enhancing potential greenhouse gas reductions by up to 21% in peak hours.

AB  - The embryonic developmental response of two abalone species (disk abalone Haliotis discus discus, giant abalone Haliotis gigantea) to a drop in salinity with different exposure times was investigated to gain a better understanding of the reasons for the decrease in natural stock populations. Two experimental designs-first, combinations of two salinities (34 and 17 psu) and four exposure times (0, 1, 2 and 4 h), and second, combinations of three salinities (34, 24 and 14 psu) and four exposure times (0, 1, 3 and 6 h)-were tested on disk and giant abalone eggs to determine the effects on hatching onset time, hatching success, percentage of abnormality and survival rate. Hatching onset time increased significantly for both species as salinity dropped and exposure time increased. Both species followed a decreasing trend in terms of hatching success as exposure time increased at low salinity levels. As for abnormality, both species showed a significant negative effect of low salinity and long exposure times. Giant abalone showed better adaptability to long exposure time at low salinity levels, and hence a higher survival rate, than disk abalone.

AB  - Noctuidonema guyanense is an interesting ectoparasite of adult Lepidoptera that feeds on hosts from at least five families with its long styler. Noctuidonema guyanense spends its entire life on the adult moth and is sustained as it is passed from moth to moth during host mating. Overlapping host generations are essential for parasite survival. This nematode occurs throughout tropical and subtropical America and is transported by at least one of its hosts, Spodoptera frugiperda, during migration to northern sites in the United States each spring. Noctuidonema guyanense debilitates its hosts, Research conducted to help determine the biological control importance of this nematode is reviewed. Two additional species, N. daptria and N. dibolia, are now known for Noctuidonema.

VL  - 116
SP  - 956-962
AB  - The best option to overcome the energy penalty in Ca-looping is to take advantage of the surplus heat by external integration to produce additional power and increase net efficiency. As calciner represents the main energy consumption, another possibility is to internally use the surplus heat to preheat the solids entering this reactor. The objective of internal integration is to reduce the energy demand per captured tonne of CO2. It represents a reduction of the coal and oxygen needs and also a total decrease in the CO2 generation regarding the ordinary configuration. However, the amount of available heat for extra power generation by external integration, essential for the viability of this technology, is also reduced. This is the case of the configurations including a cyclonic preheater or a mixing seal valve. This study assess the energy penalty minimization that may be reached by external integration of these internal energy integration configurations. A methodological process has been applied to obtain a reduction of the energy penalty with respect to the ordinary configuration. This energy saving combined with the lower size of equipment and reduced capital cost would make the cyclonic preheater the most suitable configuration to improve the viability of this technology.

AB  - Bioenergy is considered to be an attractive option mainly due to driving forces of an environmental nature (e.g. climate change and sustainability issues). This is particularly the case for energy crops, which show higher productivity per land unit than their conventional counterparts. In addition, by comparison, such crops are more homogeneous in terms of their physical and chemical characteristics than residual resources that are often described as the biomass resource of the future. However, despite the long-term research and the considerable efforts to promote them, implementation is still rather slow across Europe. In this paper, two perennial energy crops, cardoon and giant reed, are evaluated in Rodopi, northern Greece, as alternative land use, through comparative financial appraisal with the main conventional crops. Based on the output of this analysis, the breakeven for the two energy crops is defined and an economic and socio-economic evaluation of a biomass district heating system is conducted. Results prove that energy crops can be attractive alternatives if they are properly integrated into existing agricultural activities and complement the current cropping options. As such, they provide raw material for local heat applications, thus resulting in increased income for the region and an increase in the number of jobs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Negative Phototaxis Results from Avoidance of Light and Temperature in Stream Salamander Larvae
VL  - 51
IS  - 2
SP  - 263-269
AB  - Forest removal is a global threat to amphibian diversity. Declines occur within these areas, but many amphibians also avoid moving into or through disturbed areas. Understanding which cues result in avoidance may provide targets for preservation of amphibian occupancy and population connectivity. Negative phototaxis is known from many amphibians, but light can serve as a cue or as a proxy for other environmental cues like temperature. This study sought to evaluate whether larval salamander habitat selection was influenced most by light or temperature cues. Because some individuals choose to remain in deforested habitat, we also assessed whether differences in habitat selection existed between individuals from forested and deforested habitat. Using a laboratory experiment, we found that salamanders use both light and temperature cues for habitat selection. Although salamanders demonstrated larger responses to temperature, they were willing to move into warmer habitats to avoid light. Individuals from deforested regions preferred brighter and warmer areas than individuals from forested regions although plasticity was higher with respect to light relative to temperature. We also noted that salamander thermal preferences were lower than daytime temperatures in small (< 60 m) deforested regions. Overall, a combination of light and thermal cues following forest removal may contribute to avoidance of deforested regions, but more research is necessary to understand why some salamanders continue to occupy warm and bright-disturbed areas.

SP  - 342-348
AB  - The effect of the gene-enzyme system of esterase-6 (EST-6) on the expression of viability traits in Drosophila melanogaster was studied at normal and high temperatures. Interline, ontogenetic, and sexual differences of beta-esterase activity in tissue extracts were found. The differences were not correlated with the viability parameters of the flies. Some flies in the b line, in contrast to the other lines examined (N, Canton S, cn, vg), had EST-6 forms with different electrophoretic mobility. This indicates genetic polymorphism of this line at EST-6 locus. The b(S) and b F lines, isogenic at the chromosomes 1, 2, and 3 and homozygous for Est-6(S) and Est-6(F), respectively, were derived from a heterozygous line b female by means of a special crossing scheme and selection. The S allozyme had lesser mobility but was more resistant to high temperature (57 degrees C). Flies from the b(S) line were more resistant to high temperature and were two times as fertile as the b(F) flies. These selective advantages of the b(S) line persisted for 20-45 generations at permissive high temperatures (29 degrees C). in the experimental population that started with a 1 : 1 ratio of Est-6(S) and Est-6(F) and was kept at 29 degrees C, an increase in the allele S frequency was demonstrated. Thus, the S allele of EST-6 can be considered as a part of the adaptational gene complex arising in population under high temperature conditions.

AB  - A mechanistic model was developed to assess the impact of predation of juvenile Notonecta maculata on size structured Daphnia magna populations and to provide a framework for quantifying the back-swimmers uptake of food. Results of experiments and model predictions clearly demonstrate selective predation of backswimmers when fed with a choice of daphnid size classes, with patterns of selectivity differing across N. maculata instars. The model describes the foraging process empirically on the base of a general predation cycle including four conditional events instead of using classic functional response curves. For model parameterisation components of predation, namely probability of encounter, attack and success as well as time spent on handling prey was directly observed by means of video tracking experiments. Since attack rate, capture success and handling time appeared to be a function of prey size differing between Notonecta instars, the model takes into account ontogenic changes in both predator and prey characteristics. Independent data of functional response and size selectivity experiments were used for model validation and proved the model outcome to be consistent with observations. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The tendencies to diminish for abundance and biomass of the Black Sea originated zooplankton species and to increase for the proportion of their carcasses in the direction from the Black Sea toward the Marmara Sea were found. The mortality in the Black Sea species increased with depth in the Marmara Sea. The contribution of organic matter of carcasses of the Black Sea originated organisms to bacterial processes in the deep strata of the Marmara Sea was estimated. Different salinity and temperature regimes restrict mutual penetration of the species in these seas. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 38

SP  - 209-218
AB  - Parasitoids are key regulators of the population dynamics of their arthropod hosts, are integral to the structure and dynamics of food webs, and provide ecosystem services by suppressing agricultural pests. Despite their ecological and functional importance, relatively few studies have considered the effects of a warming climate on hostparasitoid interactions. The three primary modes through which parasitoids might respond to a warming climate are by (i) shifting distributions into cooler environments, (ii) altering phenology, and (iii) adjusting to persist in situ through phenotypic plasticity or evolutionary adaptation. Here, we focus on examples of altered distributions and phenology in response to climate warming. We suggest that the responses of parasitoids to elevated temperatures and the population dynamic consequences for their hosts will be linked to two key traits: the dispersal ability of both partners, and the host specificity of parasitoids. Effects of climate warming on hostparasitoid interactions will be complicated by interactions with other co-occurring environmental changes, such as elevated carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and to interactions with competitors, mutualists, and antagonists. These factors will complicate efforts to generate predictive models of hostparasitoid interactions, for example in the context of the ecosystem service of biological pest control.

VL  - 78
SP  - 226-235
AB  - The study assessed the potential and economic viability of solar PV standalone systems for embedded generation, taking into account its benefits to small off-grid rural communities in forty meteorological sites in Nigeria. A specific electric load profile was developed to suite the communities consisting 200 homes, a school and community health centre. Data (daily mean relative humidity, maximum and minimum temperatures, and daily global solar radiation for 24 years spanning 1987-2010) obtained from the Nigeria Meteorological Agency were used. It focused on the assessment of design that will optimally meet daily load demand for the rural communities with an LOLP of 0.01. The HOMER (R) software optimizing tool was engaged for the feasibility study and design. A 15 MW PV distributed generation system was utilized to economically compare the different sites in terms of life cycle cost as well as levelised cost of producing energy. A profit for potential investors in the range of $ 0.01/kWh to $ 0.17/kWh was discovered for 29 of the 40 available meteorological sites, while the remaining sites were not profitable with the present tariff regime in Nigeria.

TI  - Planning Algorithm for Optimal Combined Heat & Power Generation Plant Connection in Urban Distribution Network (UDN)
AB  - Combined Heat & Power (CHP) generation is the most efficient way of energy supply in urban area available today. It delivers significant benefits to its host facilities and urban distributed network (UDN) to which is connected. Economic viability of CHP generation for many sites requires integration with the UDN for backup and supplementary power needs and in some case the export of excess power to the UDN. CHP system integration into existing UDN entail installation costs. How these integration costs are distributed will have considerable impact on development and implementation of CHP generation in urban areas. The objective of this paper is to use analytical and statistical methods to develop an algorithm that provide means of determining the optimum capacity of a CHP generating plant that can be accommodated within the UDN, which correspond to Least Cost Technically Acceptable (LCTA) principle, and the UDN long term network planning policy. In order to determine optimal size of CHP generating plant that could be connected at any particular busbar on the UDN without causing a significant adverse impact on performance of the UDN, an algorithm is created that incorporate an analytical and multiple regression analysis model. It is tested using data obtained from ERAC power analysing software incorporating load flow, fault current level and power losses analysis. Additional data needed for effective algorithm creation was obtained via surveys of local UDN operators and planners. These analyses are performed on a 34 busbar network resembling part of the real UDN of Cork city for validation purposes and accuracy of the algorithm proposed.

TI  - ARTIFICIAL SELECTION OF REACTION NORMS OF WING PATTERN ELEMENTS IN BICYCLUS-ANYNANA
VL  - 74
SP  - 91-99
AB  - A novel use of selection was applied to the examination of the genetics of phenotypic plasticity. The approach provides a sensitive way of detecting genotype-environment (g x e) interactions and also allows the form of any interactions across an environmental gradient to be investigated through changes in the shapes of the reaction norms. The wing pattern of the butterfly B, anynana varies with season; eyespot size increases with development temperature. Selection lines to increase and to decrease eyespot size at 28 degrees C were carried out. The effect of selection on the eyespot reaction norms with temperature was examined. Selection produced divergent reaction norms across the entire range of temperature in most eyespots. Significant g x e interactions were sometimes present but the degree of interaction was always relatively small. When present, the form of the interaction varied between the sexes. There was a high degree of genetic independence between the eyespots on the ventral and on the dorsal wing surfaces, except in the dorsal eyespot in the wing cell corresponding to the wing cell of the selected ventral wing surface eyespot. The significance of the results for the maintenance of genetic variation in B, anynana is considered.

TI  - Silane functionalization on zeolite 13X surface for direct steam generation in a solid sorption heat pump
VL  - 244
AB  - High-temperature steam has been directly generated from hot water based on a solid sorption heat pump system by employing silane functionalized zeolite 13X (XS). The adsorbent is prepared by a liquid phase grafting method to modify functional groups on the zeolite surface with a silane coupling agent. The static water contact angle (WCA) and surface functional groups are analyzed by optical contact angle measuring instruments and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. Analytical results confirm the successful preparation of surface hydrophobic zeolite. The water adsorption capacity of XS is slightly less than that of 13X, while the overall adsorption heat remains almost constant. Dry air at 130 degrees C is utilized for the regeneration of the wet zeolite in cyclic experiments. Steam at 207 degrees C is generated from input hot water at 72 degrees C in a packed bed filled with XS-25 (zeolite 13X functionalized by a saline solution concentration of 25%). The thermal response during the steam generation process is accelerated by utilizing XS. The mass of steam product does not change during the generation with XS, whereas cyclic time is shortened. Moreover, XS facilitates the regeneration process by decreasing the heat demand for the removal of free water. System evaluation results show that a higher Sp (steam productivity) is obtained for XS than that for zeolite 13X. COPh (coefficient of performance for heating) and SHP (specific heating power) are elevated by 23.6% and 5.7% for XS compared with those for zeolite 13X, respectively.

TI  - Gene Flow Limits Adaptation along Steep Environmental Gradients
VL  - 195
IS  - 3
SP  - E67-E86
AB  - When environmental variation is spatially continuous, dispersing individuals move among nearby sites with similar habitat conditions. But as an environmental gradient becomes steeper, gene flow may connect more divergent habitats, and this is predicted to reduce the slope of the adaptive dine that evolves. We compared quantitative genetic divergence of Rana temporaria frog populations along a 2,000-m elevational gradient in eastern Switzerland (new experimental results) with divergence along a 1,550-km latitudinal gradient in Fennoscandia (previously published results). Both studies found significant countergradient variation in larval development rate (i.e., animals from cold climates developed more rapidly). The dine was weaker with elevation than with latitude. Animals collected on both gradients were genotyped at similar to 2,000 singlenucleotide polymorphism markers, revealing that dispersal distance was 30% farther on the latitudinal gradient but 3.9 times greater with respect to environmental conditions on the elevational gradient. A meta-analysis of 19 experimental studies of anuran populations spanning temperature gradients revealed that countergradient variation in larval development, while significant overal I, was weaker when measured on steeper gradients. These findings support the prediction that adaptive population divergence is less pronounced, and maladaptation more pervasive, on steep environmental gradients.

TI  - Experimental Approaches for Testing if Tolerance Curves Are Useful for Predicting Fitness in Fluctuating Environments
VL  - 5
AB  - Most experimental studies on adaptation to stressful environments are performed under conditions that are rather constant and rarely ecologically relevant. Fluctuations in natural environmental conditions are ubiquitous and include for example variation in intensity and duration of temperature, droughts, parasite loads, and availability of nutrients, predators and competitors. The frequency and amplitude of many of these fluctuations are expected to increase with climate change. Tolerance curves are often used to describe fitness components across environmental gradients. Such curves can be obtained by assessing performance in a range of constant environmental conditions. In this perspective we briefly list theoretical and experimental evidence why results obtained under constant environmental conditions might be misleading for processes in nature and therefore may not be suitable for predicting fitness and future species distribution and abundance. We further suggest experimental avenues that can provide a better foundation for forecasts of the distribution of biota.

TI  - Immobilized Iron Oxide Nanoparticles as Stable and Reusable Catalysts for Hydrazine-Mediated Nitro Reductions in Continuous Flow
VL  - 7

SP  - 3122-3131
AB  - An experimentally easy to perform method for the generation of alumina-supported Fe3O4 nanoparticles [(6 +/- 1)nm size, 0.67wt%]and the use of this material in hydrazine-mediated heterogeneously catalyzed reductions of nitroarenes to anilines under batch and continuous-flow conditions is presented. The bench-stable, reusable nano-Fe3O4@Al2O3 catalyst can selectively reduce functionalized nitroarenes at 1mol% catalyst loading by using a 20mol% excess of hydrazine hydrate in an elevated temperature regime (150 degrees C, reaction time 2-6min in batch). For continuous-flow processing, the catalyst material is packed into dedicated cartridges and used in a commercially available high-temperature/-pressure flow device. In continuous mode, reaction times can be reduced to less than 1min at 150 degrees C (30bar back pressure) in a highly intensified process. The nano-Fe3O4@Al2O3 catalyst demonstrated stable reduction of nitrobenzene (0.5M in MeOH) for more than 10h on stream at a productivity of 30mmolh(-1) (0.72mol per day). Importantly, virtually no leaching of the catalytically active material could be observed by inductively coupled plasma MS monitoring.

TI  - Environmental impacts of irrigated and rain-fed barley production in Iran using life cycle assessment (LCA)
VL  - 15
IS  - 2
AB  - Current intensive grain crops production is often associated with environmental burdens. However, very few studies deal with the environmental performance of both current and alternative systems of barley production. This study was undertaken to evaluate energy consumption and environmental impacts of irrigated and rain-fed barley production. Additionally, three alternative scenarios were examined for irrigated barley fields including conservation tillage and biomass utilization policies. The findings showed that around 25 GJ/ha energy is needed in order to produce 2300 kg/ha irrigated barley and 13 GJ/ha for 1100 kg/ha rain-fed barley. Life cycle assessment (LCA) results indicated that irrigated farms had more environmental impacts than rain-fed farms. Electricity generation and consumption had the highest effect on the abiotic depletion potential, human toxicity potential, freshwater and marine aquatic ecotoxicity potential. However, alternative scenarios revealed that using soil conservation tillage systems and biomass consumption vs. gas for electricity generation at power plants can significantly mitigate environmental impacts of irrigated barley production similar to the rain-fed conditions while higher yield is obtained.

SP  - 683-689
AB  - Plasma spraying of large-scale components (such as paper mill rolls, rocket exit nozzles, parts of the land-based turbines for power generation, thermally sprayed free-standing tubes, etc.) and also powder spheroidization) are just several examples of industrial applications where the processing time and costs are critical. To ensure productivity and cost-effectivity of the process, it is beneficial to use plasma torches which can process high powder throughputs, i.e. with feed rates in tens of kilograms per hour. Such torches must have sufficiently high enthalpy and plasma temperature, to ensure homogeneous particle treatment and high deposition efficiency. Hybrid water-stabilized plasma (WSP-H) system with its enthalpy of more than 140 MJ/kg and plasma temperature of 25 000 K is able to process up to 40 kg of powders per hour. Since the WSP-H torch consumes typically only 15 slm of Ar at full power of 180 kW, it is a very powerful and also economical tool that meets all the prerequisites for large-scale plasma spraying applications. Spraying of three representative ceramics: alumina, zircon, and yttria-stabilized-zirconia is presented in this study. It reveals only limited influence of increasing powder throughput on particle velocity, temperature and coating microstructure. Deposition efficiency of the processes is discussed and the deposited coatings are analyzed by SEM and XRD.

TI  - Identification and validation of drought-responsive microRNAs from Hevea brasiliensis
VL  - 41
IS  - 1
AB  - Drought, in combination with high temperature and low humidity affects the productivity of Hevea brasiliensis, the natural rubber tree and its expansion to non-traditional regions. The genotypes of H. brasiliensis that perform well in traditional regions often failed in non-traditional regions thus necessitating breeding for stress-tolerant genotypes. This can be accomplished by adopting molecular-assisted selection method. Recent developments in identification of drought-responsive transcripts from H. brasiliensis and the findings on role of small RNAs indicate the possibility of employing them as markers for identification of suitable genotypes. In this study, we attempted to identify drought-responsive miRNAs from H. brasiliensis through next-generation sequencing (Illumina HiSeq) method. The results revealed the expression of 33 conserved and 32 novel drought-responsive miRNAs. Further, validation of differentially expressed miRNAs by quantitative expression analysis indicated the association of two novel miRNAs, viz., HbmiRn_63 and HbmiRn_42 and two conserved miRNAs, viz., miR168 and miR160 miRNAs with drought tolerance. These miRNAs can be employed as markers for drought tolerance after validation in a larger set of genotypes. This study opens up the possibility of employing miRNAs as markers for drought tolerance in Hevea.

AB  - Global warming has become a problem in many areas. The orientation of farmers towards an agriculture adapted to drought conditions, which uses dry-farming systems, allows the responsible and sustainable management of agricultural lands, without fragmenting habitats and contributing to the extinction of some species of flora and fauna. The survival of some species with a role in biodiversity for agricultural crops, the adaptability of some of them in dry areas and the improvement to create different hybrids with resistance to increasingly aggressive environmental factors, is due to this type of agriculture and to the new directions in specialized research. The study was conducted as an open-field experience, in the southeastern part of Romania, at the Agricultural Research and Development Station, Braila. The research started with the agricultural year 2019 but its climatic conditions were registered as excessive, which is why the capitalization of the results was made only for the agricultural year 2020-2021. Of the 7 cultivated plant species that do not normally fit into the crop plan in the study area, only three species ( flax, sorghum, mustard) coped with climate stress and could be analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.

TI  - Experimental study on performance of a miniature heat pipe with woven-wired wick
SP  - 129-133
AB  - The thermal density of electronic parts and systems has been increased continuously as high speed and high density are required for them. The heat generation of the CPU of a notebook PC of higher than the Pentium-II grade has been recently increased to be more than 10W, and the available packaging space has been compacted. Therefore, it has become inevitable to perform cooling by using miniature heat pipes. In the present study, new woven-wired-type wick with a large capillary limit and a high productivity has been developed, and hear pipes with the diameter of 3mm or 4mm to cooling of small-sized electronic parts such as CPU of a notebook PC, have been designed and manufactured. Further, in as much as the operational characteristics of miniature heat pipes(MHPs) with the diameter of 3mm or 4mm are different from those of general medium-sized heat pipes, a performance test has been performed in order to review heat-transfer characteristics and affects of various factors on the performance of MHPs. The operational factors include charging ratio of working fluid, the total length of heat pipes, lengths of an evaporator and a condenser, inclination of installation, number of wick strands, thermal load, etc. The limiting powers of 3mm MHP and 4mm MHP are shown to be 6.8W and 19.5W, respectively, with angle of inclination of -5 degrees. These show that there is a high possibility of application if one or two MHPs are installed for cooling of CPU more than 10W.

AB  - Literature on biodiesel production over the last 10 years (2007-2018) has been critically reviewed directing further research toward membrane-based sustainable and green production. The manuscript discusses how biodiesel production strategies have evolved in the recent years through adoption of better feedstock, better catalysts, more efficient reactor technology, and through incorporation of more efficient downstream separation-purification techniques. The review reveals that though transesterification reaction between alcohol and plant oil/animal fats leading to production of biodiesel is simple, the downstream separation and purification of the final product (fatty acid methyl esters) is quite challenging. This review shows that productivity can be enhanced through new generation catalysts, use of green solvents, and a more efficient reactor technology while the use of tailor-made membrane in appropriate modules holds the promise of low-cost and eco-friendly downstream purification. It is exposed that a membrane-based technology can bring about high degree of process intensification, whereas recovery and reuse of catalysts and alcohol are likely to add to the economy of the process, resulting in sustainable production technology.

TI  - Mating-Induced Trade-Offs upon Egg Production versus Fertilization and Offspring's Survival in a Sawfly with Facultative Parthenogenesis
VL  - 12
IS  - 8
AB  - Simple Summary Study of mating-induced trade-offs between reproduction and survival is conducive to provide evolutionary insights into reproductive strategies and aging. Using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics, we found that mating induced changes of genes and pathways related to reproduction and survival in females of a pine sawfly. Mating induced substantial downregulation on genes associated to immunity, stress response, and longevity. However, mating induced divergent reproductive response, with downregulation on genes related to egg production while upregulation on genes related to egg fertilization. Considering the nature of limited resources in adults, low fecundity and egg protection behavior in this sawfly, we suggest that mating triggers trade-offs between reproduction and survival in this insect and females of this species have evolved specific strategies to adapt to the living conditions, e.g., restrict whole fecundity to ensure higher fertilization and offspring's survival. Investigation of mating-induced trade-offs between reproduction and survival is conducive to provide evolutionary insights into reproductive strategies and aging. Here, we used RNAseq and bioinformatics to reveal mating-induced changes of genes and pathways related to reproduction and survival in female Cephalcia chuxiongica, a pine defoliator with facultative parthenogenesis and long larval dormancy. Results showed that mating induced substantial downregulation on genes and pathways associated to immunity, stress response, and longevity. However, mating induced divergent reproductive response, with downregulation on genes and pathways related to egg production while upregulation on genes and pathways related to egg fertilization. Considering the nature of limited resources in adults, low fecundity, and egg protection behavior in C. chuxiongica, we suggest that mating triggers trade-offs between reproduction and survival in this insect and females of this species may have evolved specific strategies to adapt to the environmental and hosts' conditions, e.g., restrict whole fecundity to ensure higher fertilization and offspring's survival. Moreover, mating induced significant responses on genes and pathways that play important roles in vertebrate reproduction while their function in insects are unclear, such as the progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathway; the significant regulation after mating suggests that their function may be evolutionarily conserved in animal kingdom.

TI  - Macroscale intraspecific variation and environmental heterogeneity: analysis of cold and warm zone abundance, mortality, and regeneration distributions of four eastern US tree species
VL  - 5
IS  - 21
SP  - 5033-5048
AB  - I test for macroscale intraspecific variation of abundance, mortality, and regeneration of four eastern US tree species (Tsuga canadensis, Betula lenta, Liriodendron tulipifera, and Quercus prinus) by splitting them into three climatic zones based on plant hardiness zones (PHZs). The primary goals of the analysis are to assess the differences in environmental heterogeneity and demographic responses among climatic zones, map regional species groups based on decision tree rules, and evaluate univariate and multivariate patterns of species demography with respect to environmental variables. I use the Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) data to derive abundance, mortality, and regeneration indices and split the range into three climatic zones based on USDA PHZs: (1) cold adapted, leading region; (2) middle, well-adapted region; and (3) warm adapted, trailing region. I employ decision tree ensemble methods to assess the importance of environmental predictors on the abundance of the species between the cold and warm zones and map zonal variations in species groups. Multivariate regression trees are used to simultaneously explore abundance, mortality, and regeneration in tandem to assess species vulnerability. Analyses point to the relative importance of climate in the warm adapted, trailing zone (especially moisture) compared to the cold adapted, leading zone. Higher mortality and lower regeneration patterns in the warm trailing zone point to its vulnerability to growing season temperature and precipitation changes that could figure more prominently in the future. This study highlights the need to account for intraspecific variation of demography in order to understand environmental heterogeneity and differential adaptation. It provides a methodology for assessing the vulnerability of tree species by delineating climatic zones based on easily available PHZ data, and FIA derived abundance, mortality, and regeneration indices as a proxy for overall growth and fitness. Based on decision tree rules, ecologically meaningful variations in species abundance among the climatic zones can be related to environmental variability and mapped.

VL  - 75

SP  - 897-907
AB  - We studied the potential effects of predicted climate change on the energetic demands of juvenile steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and their consequences for local population size and structure in Idaho, USA. Projected increases in water temperature incurred on average a 10% higher energetic cost by 2040 (range 7.0%-12.5% among study reaches in the watershed) and a 16% increase (range 8.5%-21.3%) by 2080 following the A1B scenario. The predicted increase in energetic cost was largest in the coolest stream reaches, where the proportional increases in energetic cost exceed that of temperature. Energetically, and in absence of increases in food supply, local densities were consequently expected to decline. We examined which factors best described the shape of current size distributions to explore future size distributions as temperatures increase. Mass distribution skewness was best explained by local biomass (positive relationship) and water temperature (negative relationship). The results suggest that local steelhead cohorts will approach a platykurtic, slightly negatively skewed distribution with increasing temperatures and demonstrate that temperature can exacerbate demographic density dependence in fish populations.

TI  - Impact economic of climate change on crop of organic quinua in the Altiplano Region: a Richardian approach
VL  - 23
IS  - 4
SP  - 236-243
AB  - The climate crisis is affecting the production yield of rice, wheat, corn, coffee, beans and other food crops in the country and internationally. The objective of the research was to quantify the impact of climate change on the net income of organic quinoa producers under dry farming conditions in the Altiplano region. Using the Ricardian approach, the impact of climatic variables (temperature and precipitation) on the yield of organic quinoa was estimated in the districts of Cabana, Capachica and Ilave in the Altiplano region, and with primary data collected through a survey to A sample of 237 farmers estimated the value of land productivity. The climatic variables were provided by the National Service of Meteorology and Hydrology of Puno. The results reveal an average production of 1,497 kilos per hectare, obtaining a net income of 14,969 soles per hectare, for a market price of 9.60 soles per kilo. The adaptability of the quinoa producer to climate change was relevant to improve the productivity of the crop. In conclusion, the impact of the agroclimatic variables on the productivity-economic income of organic quinoa producers was marginal in the 2015-2016 agricultural season in the Puno Region.

TI  - How Dispersal Evolution and Local Adaptation Affect the Range Dynamics of Species Lagging Behind Climate Change
VL  - 197
IS  - 6
SP  - E173-E187
AB  - As climate changes, species' ability to spatially track suitable climate depends on their spread velocity, a function of their population growth and dispersal capacity. When climate changes faster than species can spread, the climate experienced at species' expanding range edges may ameliorate as conditions become increasingly similar to those of the range core. When this boosts species' growth rates, their spread accelerates. Here, we use simulations of a spreading population with an annual life history to explore how climatic amelioration interacts with dispersal evolution and local adaptation to determine the dynamics of spread. We found that depending on the timing of dispersal evolution, spread velocity can show contrasting trajectories, sometimes transiently exceeding the climate velocity before decelerating. Climatic amelioration can also accelerate the spread of populations composed of genotypes best adapted to local climatic conditions, but the exact dynamics depends on the pattern of climatic adaptation. We conclude that failing to account for demographic variation across climatic gradients can lead to erroneous conclusions about species' capacity to spatially track suitable climate.

VL  - 62

SP  - 441-460
AB  - Climate change is causing habitat salinity to transform at unprecedented rates across the globe. While much of the research on climate change has focused on rapid shifts in temperature, far less attention has focused on the effects of changes in environmental salinity. Consequently, predictive studies on the physiological, evolutionary, and migratory responses of organisms and populations to the threats of salinity change are relatively lacking. This omission represents a major oversight, given that salinity is among the most important factors that define biogeographic boundaries in aquatic habitats. In this perspective, we briefly touch on responses of organisms and populations to rapid changes in salinity occurring on contemporary time scales. We then discuss factors that might confer resilience to certain taxa, enabling them to survive rapid salinity shifts. Next, we consider approaches for predicting how geographic distributions will shift in response to salinity change. Finally, we identify additional data that are needed to make better predictions in the future. Future studies on climate change should account for the multiple environmental factors that are rapidly changing, especially habitat salinity.

TI  - Early metamorphosis in common frog Rana temporaria tadpoles at risk of drying: an experimental demonstration
VL  - 20
IS  - 4
SP  - 421-430
AB  - Does the development rate of common frog tadpoles accelerate if their habitat dries? To study this, the water level in experimental tanks was reduced shortly before time of metamorphosis. Water level remained high in control tanks. The experiment was performed at two different tadpole densities and replicated four times, with tadpoles from different source ponds. The experimental treatment, simulating a drying pond, resulted in earlier metamorphosis while no significant difference in size at metamorphosis was found. Resources per capita decreased as a result of the decreased water level so the increase in development rate was not an effect of feeding conditions. Temperatures in the tanks were such that it is unlikely that the increased development rate was due to temperature effects. I interpret the advancement of metamorphosis as an adaptive response to the threat of drying. This response has been documented for several other anuran species. All those breed in temporary water bodies, supporting the hypothesis that the trait is an evolved adaptation for breeding in such waters.

TI  - THE LONG-TERM VIABILITY OF CONCENTRATED PHOTOVOLTAIC SYSTEMS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN US
AB  - Total lifetime costs of photovoltaic (PV) systems are important determinants of profitability. But such costs are not always accurately measured and compared against fluctuating electricity costs, which can be an important contributor to long-term profitability. In this paper, we consider the economics of concentrated photovoltaics (CPV), which offer significantly higher efficiency and greater energy production over traditional fixed flat-plate PV installations in high-irradiance regions, but are perceived to be risky investments. Working with two models, one a simple annual model that uses only direct normal solar insolation; the other a more complex hourly model that uses direct normal solar insolation, ambient temperature, and wind speed to predict energy yield, we calculated the energy production and corresponding revenue generation for a 28 kW CPV unit and a comparable single-axis tracker field in Nevada. Our resulting cost matrix shows how much revenue a CPV system can reasonably be expected to generate under different pricing schemes and time periods. While the values vary depending on the assumptions made, the matrix provides an index of profitability, enabling prospective buyers to compare the costs of purchasing, installing and maintaining a system against likely revenue. As a result of our calculations, we anticipate that CPV systems will still be viable in high flux areas because they offer the promise of profitability now and continued or increased profitability as cell costs decrease and/or overall efficiency increases. Nonetheless, other factors, such as long-term reliability and O&M costs, must be addressed if CPV is to compete with other simpler technologies, such as single-axis PV trackers, which have lower upfront costs and are therefore becoming more attractive to potential customers.

AB  - We evaluated the influence of host preference, mating, and release density on Telenomus remus (Nixon, 1937) (Hymenoptera: Platygastridae) parasitizing eggs of Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith, 1797) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). First, we tested host preference of T. remus (free choice test) offered a choice between eggs of Corcyra cephalonica (Stainton, 1865) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) and S. frugiperda. Parasitism capacity and host preference (S. frugiperda) of T. remus reared on either of the two hosts did not differ. Secondly, we evaluated the influence of mating behavior of T. remus females on its parasitism. Only the offspring sex ratio differed between treatments, indicating that the species reproduces by parthenogenesis of the arrhenotoky type. Finally, we evaluated the influence of release density on T. remus parasitism. This was tested by releasing different numbers of the parasitoid per S. frugiperda egg using T. remus reared for different numbers of generations on C cephalonica eggs. The regression analysis between percentage of parasitism and density of released T. remus females showed a quadratic effect for all tested parasitoid generations (F-35, F-40, and F-45) with maximum parasitism from 65.07% to 71.69%. Our results allow the conclusion that (a) T. remus prefers S. frugiperda eggs, regardless of the host on which this parasitoid was reared, showing no preimaginal conditioning; (b) Mating does not affect the number of eggs parasitized by T. remus or the development of its offspring; and (c) The optimal T. remus release density when reared on C. cephalonica is between 0.133 and 0.150 females/S. frugiperda.

TI  - Greenhouse gas emissions and net global warming potential of vineyards under different fertilizer and water managements in North China
VL  - 243
AB  - Ensuring fruit productivity and mitigation climate change under low consumption of fertilizer and irrigation can contribute to sustainable agriculture. The objective of this study was to determine whether higher fruit production and lower net global warming potential (Net-GWP) could be realized concomitantly by reducing the amount of fertilizer and water applied. The effect of water and fertilizer management on fruit yield, N2O and CH4 emissions variation was measured over a two-year period to gain insight into Net-GWP and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) in wine grape vineyard (WGV) and table grape vineyard (TGV) in North China. Two fertilizer and water managements were set in each vineyard: optimized practice (OP) treatment and traditional practice (TP) treatment. The results showed that the OP treatment significantly (P < 0.05) increased grape fruit by 10.2 % and 10.7 % in WGV and TGV, respectively, in comparison with TP treatment. Besides, the fluxes N2O and CH4 showed significant seasonal variation and the maximum were occurred from April to September and the N2O emissions were strongly decreased in OP treatment. Compared with the TP treatment, the OP treatment significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the Net-GWP and GHGI by 13.2 % and 21.5 % in WGV, as well as decreased that by 21 % and 28.6 % in TGV. The process of manufacture and transport of N fertilizer, the N2O emission and the electricity generation for pumping irrigation were the three main contributors to vineyard Net-GWP. Thus we concluded that higher fruit production and lower Net-GWP could be realized concomitantly by reducing fertilizer and water application in WGV and TGV in North China.

AB  - There is an abundance of woody biomass in Japan. However, its economic feasibility is limited. There have been several discussions on whether generation of heat or electrical power is more suitable for woody biomass. In this study, we clarified the feasibility of generating heat and electricity from the viewpoint of biomass unit price and biomass productivity based on actual operation data for the first time. It was determined that heat production is feasible for a small-scale biomass energy use of 2,660 t/year or more. Electrical power generation is feasible only for a large-scale biomass energy use of 13,100 t/year or more, but it allows use of woody biomass with a higher unit price.

AB  - In coming age, new technologies for survivals of human beings on our earth are required. These technologies include for energy and natural resources conservation, waste disposal techniques, and reduction of global warming gases. To achieve this advanced functions of materials are essential. In this paper, new frontiers of microwave dielectrics are presented in relations with these energy issues. The microwave dielectrics are familiar with radio frequency wave. The low loss dielectric materials are resonated by microwaves in air and change it to electric current in circuit, and vice versa. It is well known that the microwave materials have three important characteristic properties such as high quality factor Q, dielectric constant er and temperature coefficient of resonant frequency TCf. These properties enable the following functions: (1) electromagnetic resonance, (2) electromagnetic-wave shortening, (3) electromagnetic-wave delay, (4) temperature variation of resonant frequency, (5) electromagnetic-wave absorption, and (6) other functions: such as transparency and refractive index. In this paper, for future excellent usages of these functions, some applications are presented showing the fundamental explanations. The content in this paper is planned for the publication in a handbook of advancements of functional ceramics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights reserved.

TI  - Selection for longevity confers resistance to low-temperature stress in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 53
IS  - 2
SP  - B147-B153
AB  - One theory of the evolution of longevity says that improvement in life span is dependent on an increased ability to resist environmental stresses of all kind. Selective breeding of Drosophila melanogaster populations for longevity has demonstrably increased life span and also altered a number of other traits, such as resistance to starvation, desiccation, and ethanol fumes, and the ability to sustain longer flight. While the exact physiologic basis of some of these traits is not yet fully understood, at least some are known to derive from the properties of metabolic substrates of glycolysis. Improvement in those characters can depend partially, therefore, on altered stores of metabolites created from glycogen. Based on the known general relationship of some traits and the suspected basis in metabolism of others, we examine the possibility here that increased life span is accompanied by other traits that also confer physiologic resistance to stress. Specifically, we test the prediction that long-lived populations of fruit flies should be more resistant to low (prefreezing) and freezing temperature extremes. Both selected and control populations were found to be susceptible to prefreezing (1.5 degrees C) and freezing temperatures (0 degrees C) here, but adults and pupae of the long-lived populations generally survived better in both situations, and at all durations of exposure. The resistance of individuals improved with acclimatization, but was superior in the long-lived populations whether thermal decline was rapid or stepwise. Cold resistant, long-lived populations also had significantly higher in vitro levels of glycerol, a cryoprotectant metabolite produced from glycogen. However, while adults and pupae of long-lived stocks were more resistant to cold, larvae of those stocks were more sensitive and survived relatively poorly at every length of exposure and acclimation. This surprising result implies that larvae maintain lower levels of cryoprotectant substances. Upon becoming pupae, however, stage-specific capabilities for environmental resistance and long life emerge. This conclusion agrees with a prior study of these stocks indicating that the uptake and use of nutrients in developing larvae are restricted in long-lived populations.

VL  - 11
IS  - 1
SP  - 49-57
AB  - Laboratory and field studies were conducted to determine whether all larval stages of Culicoides variipennis sonorensis Wirth and Jones were susceptible to parasitism by Heleidomermis magnapapula Poinar and Mullens. All four larval instars (L1-L4) were readily attacked in the laboratory, although parasites took significantly longer to enter older hosts (average of 119 s for L1 to 199 s for L4). Field studies indicated that free-living adult nematodes, and presumably the preparasitic (infective) stages, were distributed above the waterline, where early-stage host larvae (L1 and L2) were most common. Dissection of field-collected hosts over a full host generation showed maximum parasitism was lower in L4 (40%) than in L1 (71%), L2 (64%), and L3 (64%) hosts. Second stage parasites were found only in L1 and L2 hosts. Absence of second stage parasites in L3 and L4 hosts showed that older larvae were seldom attacked in nature. The mature parasites emerge primarily from L4 hosts. Collecting L4 hosts in the field can significantly underestimate parasitism due to emergence of H. magnapapula from L4 hosts prior to sampling or premature host mortality due to parasitism. Dissection of L3 hosts should result in the most accurate parasitism estimates, but these estimates still ignore some parasite-induced mortality in the early host stages. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

SP  - 105-114
AB  - Despite the implementation of technical management measures to facilitate stock recovery of European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax (L.), the survival rate of discarded hook-and-line caught sea bass remains unknown. This makes the effectiveness of management measures that result in discarding difficult to assess. Therefore, a questionnaire was distributed to 421 UK-based commercial hook-and-line fishers (65 respondents) to characterise how sea bass are caught, handled and released. Responses suggested fishing was selective with a reported estimated mean discard rate of 12.9% (+/- 3.3% SE). Low rates of foul and deep hooking, and short periods of air exposure were reported. Combined with data from a post-release mortality experiment using hook-and-line caught captive sea bass, a fleet-wide discard survival rate of 89.3% (+/- 2.6% SE) was calculated for the UK commercial hook-and-line sea bass fishery. This survival rate suggests that technical management measures, for example minimum conservation reference sizes and catch limits, could be effective tools for managing the sea bass hook-and-line fishery.

TI  - Fast weight recovery, metabolic rate adjustment and gene-expression regulation define responses of cold-stressed honey bee brood
VL  - 128
AB  - In temperate climates, low ambient temperatures in late winter and in spring can result in cold stress conditions in brood areas of weakened honey bee colonies, leading to increased levels of developmental interruptions and death of the brood. Very little is known about the physiological and molecular mechanisms that regulate honey bee brood responses to acute cold-stress. Here, we hypothesized that central regulatory pathways mediated by insulin/insulin-like peptide signalling (IIS) and adipokinetic hormone (AKH) are linked to metabolic changes in cold-stressed honey bee brood. A. mellifera brood reared at suboptimal temperatures showed diminished growth rate and arrested development progress. Notably, cold-stressed brood rapidly recovers the growth in the first 24 h after returning at control rearing temperature, sustained by the induction of compensatory mechanisms. We determined fast changes in the expression of components of IIS and AKH pathways in cold-stressed brood supporting their participation in metabolic events, growth and stress responses. We also showed that metabolic rate keeps high in brood exposed to stress suggesting a role in energy supply for growth and cell repair. Additionally, transcript levels of the uncoupling protein MUP2 were elevated in cold-stressed brood, which could indicate that this protein acts in the heat generation through mitochondrial decoupling mechanisms and/or in the ROS attenuation. Physiological, metabolic and molecular mechanisms that shape the responses to cold-stress in honey bee brood are addressed and discussed.

VL  - 9
AB  - The viability of starter cultures is essential for an adequate contribution to the fermentation process and end-product. Therefore, robustness during processing and storage is an important characteristic of starter culture strains. For instance, during spray drying cells are exposed to heat and oxidative stress, generally resulting in loss of viability. In this study, we exposed the industrially relevant but stress-sensitive Lactococcus lactis strain SK11 to two cycles of heat stress, with intermediate recovery and cultivation at moderate temperatures. After these two cycles of heat exposure, the abundance of robust derivatives was increased as compared with the original culture, which enabled isolation of heat-resistant subpopulations displaying up to 1,000-fold enhanced heat stress survival. Moreover, this heat-resistant subpopulation demonstrated an increased survival during spray drying. Derivatives from two independent lineages displayed different transcriptome changes as compared with the wild type strain, indicating that the increased robustness within these lineages was established by different adaptive strategies. Nevertheless, an overlap in differential gene expression in all five derivatives tested in both lineages included three genes in an operon involved in zinc transport. The link between zinc homeostasis and heat stress survival in L. lactis was experimentally established by culturing of the wild type strain SK11 in medium with various levels of zinc ions, which resulted in alterations in heat stress survival phenotypes. This study demonstrates that robust derivatives of a relatively sensitive L. lactis strain can be isolated by repeated exposure to heat stress. Moreover, this work demonstrates that transcriptome analysis of these robust derivatives can provide clues for improvement of the robustness of the original strain. This could boost the industrial application of strains with specific desirable traits but inadequate robustness characteristics.

TI  - A coal-fired heat exchanger for an externally fired gas turbine
VL  - 118
IS  - 1
SP  - 22-31
AB  - Significant improvements in efficiency for electricity generation from coal can be achieved by cycles that employ a high temperature, highly recuperative gas turbine topping cycle. The principal difficulty of employing a gas turbine in a coal-fired power generation system is the possible erosion and corrosion of the high-temperature rotating gas turbine components caused by the coal's inorganic and organically bound constituents (ash, sulfur, and alkali metals). One route to overcome this problem is the development of an externally fired gas turbine system employing a coal fired heat exchanger. The solution discussed in this paper is the design of a Radiatively Enhanced, Aerodynamically Cleaned Heat-Exchanger (REACH-Exchanger). The REACH-Exchanger is fired by radiative and convective heat transfer from a moderately clean fuel stream and radiative heat transfer from the same of a much larger uncleaned fuel stream, which supplies most of the heat. The approach is to utilize the best ceramic technology available for high-temperature parts of the REACH-Exchanger and to shield the high-temperature surfaces from interaction with coal minerals by employing clean combustion gases that sweep the tube surface exposed to the coal flame. This paper presents a combined experimental/computational study to assess the viability, of the REACH-Exchanger concept. Experimental results indicated that the REACH-Exchanger can be effectively fired using radiation from the coal flame. Both computation and experiments indicate that the ceramic heat exchanger can be aerodynamically protected by a tertiary stream with an acceptably low pow rate.

VL  - 91
IS  - 3
SP  - 519-539
AB  - This paper describes a recent development of the Synthetic Eddy Method (SEM) proposed by Jarrin et al. (Int J Heat Fluid Flow 30(3):435-442, 2009) for generation of synthetic turbulence. The present scheme is designed to produce a divergence-free turbulence field that can reproduce almost all possible states of Reynolds stress anisotropy. This improved representation, when used to provide inlet conditions for an LES, leads to reduced near-inlet pressure fluctuations in the LES and to a reduced development length, both of which lead to lower computer resource requirements. An advantage of this method with respect to forcing approaches (which require an iterative approach) is the suitability for direct usage with embedded LES. Results for a turbulent channel flow are reported here and compared to those from the original SEM, and other direct approaches such as the VORTEX method of Sergent (2002) and the Synthesized Turbulence approach of Davidson and Billson (Int J Heat Fluid Flow 27(6):1028-1042, 2006), showing overall improved performance and a more accurate representation of turbulence structures immediately downstream of the inlet.

TI  - Modified Social Group Optimization-a meta-heuristic algorithm to solve short-term hydrothermal scheduling
VL  - 95
AB  - Social Group Optimization (SGO), developed by Satapathy et al. in the year 2016, is a class of metaheuristic optimization inspired by social behavior. It has two phases: improving phase and acquiring phase. In the improving phase, each individual improves its knowledge by interacting with the best person/solution and in acquiring phase, the individuals interact with randomly selected individuals and the best person simultaneously to acquire knowledge. Modified Social Group Optimization (MSGO) is the improved version of SGO, where the acquiring phase is modified. A self-awareness probability factor is added in the acquiring phase, which enhances the learning capability of an individual from the best-learned person in the societal setup. It is observed that this modification has improved both exploration and exploitation abilities in comparison with the conventional SGO. To analyze the performance of the MSGO, an exhaustive performance comparison is made with GA, PSO, DE, ABC, and a few newer algorithms of the years 2010-2019. The results are tabulated in six experiments. Later, MSGO is applied to solve the short-term hydrothermal scheduling (HTS) problem. The central objective of the HTS problem is to ascertain the optimal plan of action for hydro and thermal generation minimizing the fuel cost of thermal plants and, at the same time satisfying various operational and physical constraints. The valve point loading effect related to the thermal power plants, transmission loss, and other constraints lead HTS as a complex non-linear, non-convex, and non-smooth optimization problem. Simulation results clearly show that the MSGO method is capable of obtaining a better solution. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Survival, growth and wood specific gravity of interspecific hybrids of Pinus strobus and P wallichiana grown in Ontario
VL  - 234
IS  - 1
SP  - 97-106
AB  - Interspecific hybrids between eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) and Himalayan blue pine (P. wallichiana A.B. Jacks.) were created in Ontario, Canada, to introduce blister rust (caused by Cronartium ribicola Fisch.) resistance genes to the former. In this paper, we report the survival, growth, and wood specific gravity of these interspecific hybrids from field trials established between the 1970s and 1990s. Results indicate that while P. wallichiana generally performed poorly due to insufficient cold hardiness, progressive improvement in survival and growth was evident for the first generation hybrids (F-1) and backcrosses (B-1) to P. strobus, with a trend of better performance with increasing parentage of P. strobus. In southern Ontario, where climatic conditions were relatively mild, some interspecific hybrids outperformed P. strobus in 20- to 40-year-old trials. In northern Ontario, insufficient cold hardiness seemed to limit the survival and growth of the interspecific hybrids. Measured wood specific gravity was highest for P. wallichiana and lowest for P. strobus, with that of the interspecific hybrids being intermediate. Implications of the field trial results to breeding for increasing blister rust resistance of eastern white pine are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Impact of Process Control on UBM/RDL Contact Resistance for Next-Generation Fan-Out Devices
SP  - 909-916
AB  - The design flexibility of FOWLP plays a crucial role in meeting the rising demand for higher performance advanced semiconductor packages at lower cost. From a manufacturing standpoint, the requirements are not only for increased wafer throughput and tighter defects density specification, but also for low resistance interconnects. Keeping Rc low can be particularly challenging in UBM/RDL processes since the widely used organic passivation films and polymer-based substrates are inherently incompatible with plasma processes. This work presents the experimental characterization of Rc values achieved with two state-of-the-art multi-chambers PVD platforms used for volume manufacturing in WLP, namely Cluster-type and Indexer-type systems. In particular, the study highlights how the Indexer platform, which reaches 40% higher productivity due to faster chamber-to-chamber wafer transfer, also shows 50% lower Rc baseline. The Rc values measured on single-contact Kelvin resistors are: 1.2 mOhm for the Cluster with a corresponding throughput of 31.5 wafers/hour and 0.6 mOhm for the Indexer system running the same process flow with a throughput of 51 wafers/hour. The impact of hardware configuration and process control on Rc baseline is discussed. In addition, Rc of 0.3 mOhm was measured on Kelvin resistors manufactured in molded wafers with PBO passivation and processed on the FOWLP Indexer with throughput of 45 wafers/hour. The peak wafer temperature during the whole process did not exceed 120 degrees C. Similar Rc performance was measured on test vehicles with Al-Ti-Cu and Cu-Ti-Cu interfaces. TEM and EDX analysis of the contact interfaces excluded the presence of metal oxide or other contamination films.

TI  - Evidence for a role for the Dictyostelium Rap1 in cell viability and the response to osmotic stress
VL  - 115
IS  - 18
SP  - 3675-3682
AB  - The Dictyostelium genome contains a single rapA gene, which encodes a Rap1 monomeric G protein. As attempts at generating rapA-null Dictyostelium cells had been unsuccessful, expression of antisense RNA from the rapA gene under control of the folate repressible discoidin promoter was used to reduce cellular levels of the Rapt protein. As Rap1 levels gradually decreased following antisense rapA RNA induction, growth rate and cell viability also decreased, a result consistent with the idea that rapA is an essential gene. The Rap1-depleted cells exhibited reduced viability in response to osmotic shock. The accumulation of cGMP in response to 0.4 M sorbitol was reduced after rapA antisense RNA induction and was enhanced in cells expressing the constitutively activated Rap1(G12V) protein, suggesting a role for Rap1 in the generation of cGMP. Dictyostelium Rap1 formed a complex with the Ras-binding domain of RalGDS only when it was in a GTP-bound state. This assay was used to demonstrate that activation of Rap1 in response to 0.4 M sorbitol occurred with initial kinetics similar to those observed for the accumulation of cGMP. Furthermore, the addition of 2 mM EDTA to osmotically shocked cells, a treatment that enhances cGMP accumulation, also enhanced Rap1 activation. These results suggest a direct role for Rap1 in the activation of guanylyl cyclase during the response to hyperosmotic conditions. Rap1 was also activated in response to low temperature but not in response to low osmolarity or high temperature.

Control toads injected with saline did not exhibit an increase in mean selected temperature. 2. The thermal tolerance (as measured by the critical thermal maximum, CTM) of pyrogen-treated toads increased significantly over that of saline-injected toads if both groups of toads were incubated at a febrile temperature (32-degrees-C) but not if they were incubated at a normothermic temperature (25-degrees-C). 3. The importance of permitting ectotherms to become hyperthermic in order to study the physiological correlates of pyrogen treatment is discussed.

AB  - We have been developing an electron beam recorder for next-generation optical disk mastering. Using a ZEP-520 resist that had high resolution, we fabricated read-only memory disks and obtained sufficient reproduction performance. But the recording velocity was 0.7 m/s to obtain sufficient jitter of the disk. We could not expect such low recording velocity to be used in mass production. Therefore we decided to use a chemically amplified resist, which had high sensitivity. To reduce the recording time, we adopted the resist to the optical disk mastering and investigated the process conditions. We examined the effect of development power and post-exposure banking (PEB) temperature on the jitter of the reproduced signals and obtained 6.4% jitter at a 2.5 m/s recording velocity.

VL  - 50

SP  - 227-235
AB  - The present study aimed to test the effect of three stocking densities: 100, 200, and 300 ind m(-3) (D100, D200, and D300, respectively) on survival, growth (weight and total length), and condition factor of Microphis brachyurus. At the end of the six-week trial, there were no significant differences in the fish's survival, growth, and condition. The results suggest that this species presents high adaptability under culture conditions. A suboptimal stocking density generates a suboptimal use of infrastructure and decreases the production system's profitability. Based on the present study, a stocking density of 300 ind m(-3) is recommended to increase the aquaculture infrastructure's profitability for ornamental or conservation purposes.

TI  - Temperature Impacts the Development and Survival of Common Cutworm (Spodoptera litura): Simulation and Visualization of Potential Population Growth in India under Warmer Temperatures through Life Cycle Modelling and Spatial Mapping
VL  - 10
IS  - 4
AB  - The common cutworm, Spodoptera litura, has become a major pest of soybean (Glycine max) throughout its Indian range. With a changing climate, there is the potential for this insect to become an increasingly severe pest in certain regions due to increased habitat suitability. To examine this possibility, we developed temperature-based phenology model for S. litura, by constructing thermal reaction norms for cohorts of single life stages, at both constant and fluctuating temperatures within the ecologically relevant range (15-38 degrees C) for its development. Life table parameters were estimated stochastically using cohort updating and rate summation approach. The model was implemented in the geographic information system to examine the potential future pest status of S. litura using temperature change projections from SRES A(1)B climate change scenario for the year 2050. The changes were visualized by means of three spatial indices demonstrating the risks for establishment, number of generations per year and pest abundance according to the temperature conditions. The results revealed that the development rate as a function of temperature increased linearly for all the immature stages of S. litura until approximately 34-36 degrees C, after which it became non-linear. The extreme temperature of 38 degrees C was found lethal to larval and pupal stages of S. litura wherein no development to the next stage occurred. Females could lay no eggs at the extreme low (15 degrees C) and high (>35 degrees C) test temperatures, demonstrating the importance of optimum temperature in determining the suitability of climate for the mating and reproduction in S. litura. The risk mapping predicts that due to temperature increase under future climate change, much of the soybean areas in Indian states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, will become suitable for S. litura establishment and increased pest activity, indicating the expansion of the suitable and favourable areas over time. This has serious implication in terms of soybean production since these areas produce approximately 95% of the total soybeans in India. As the present model results are based on temperature only, and the effects of other abiotic and biotic factors determining the pest population dynamics were excluded, it presents only the potential population growth parameters for S. litura. However, if combined with the field observations, the model results could certainly contribute to gaining insight into the field dynamics of S. litura.

TI  - Ground-Based Thermal Imaging of Stream Surface Temperatures: Technique and Evaluation
VL  - 35
IS  - 6
SP  - 1209-1218
AB  - We evaluated a ground-based handheld thermal imaging system for measuring water temperatures using data from eight southwestern USA streams and rivers. We found handheld thermal imagers could provide considerably more spatial information on water temperature (for our unit one image D 19,600 individual temperature measurements) than traditional methods could supply without a prohibitive amount of effort. Furthermore, they could provide measurements of stream surface temperature almost instantaneously compared with most traditional handheld thermometers (e.g., >20 s/reading). Spatial temperature analysis is important for measurement of subtle temperature differences across waterways, and identification of warm and cold groundwater inputs. Handheld thermal imaging is less expensive and equipment intensive than airborne thermal imaging methods and is useful under riparian canopies. Disadvantages of handheld thermal imagers include their current higher expense than thermometers, their susceptibility to interference when used incorrectly, and their slightly lower accuracy than traditional temperature measurement methods. Thermal imagers can only measure surface temperature, but this usually corresponds to subsurface temperatures in well-mixed streams and rivers. Using thermal imaging in select applications, such as where spatial investigations of water temperature are needed, or in conjunction with stationary temperature data loggers or handheld electronic or liquid-in-glass thermometers to characterize stream temperatures by both time and space, could provide valuable information on stream temperature dynamics. These tools will become increasingly important to fisheries biologists as costs continue to decline.

TI  - Energy efficiency in China: optimization and comparison between hydropower and thermal power
VL  - 11
IS  - 1
AB  - Background The energy generation efficiencies of thermal power and hydropower, which are the two main forces of electric power in China, are important factors affecting the energy conservation, emission reduction, and green development of the country's whole power industry. Methods Considering regional differences and multiple efficient decision-making units (DMUs), this research uses the meta-Frontier super-efficiency slack-based measure (meta-SE-SBM) undesirable model to comprehensively evaluate the efficiencies of hydropower and thermal power generation in China. The CO2 emissions of thermal power generation are taken as the undesirable output. Results The ranking of the average meta-efficiency of thermal power generation in China is Eastern China > Central China > Western China, and all regions show an upward trend. However, the ranking of the average meta-efficiency of hydropower generation is Western China > Central China > Eastern China, and all these regions present a downward trend. In 2017, the technology gap ratio (TGR) values for the thermal power generation efficiency of the eastern and western regions showed a rising trend, while that for the central region showed a declining trend. The TGR values of the hydropower generation efficiency of the western region continued to increase, while those of the central and eastern regions decreased. The development trends of the TGR values of the thermal power or hydropower generation efficiencies of the three regions were not consistent with each other, indicating that technological convergence has not been achieved. In the three regions, the technology gaps in hydropower have slightly expanded, but the technology gaps in thermal power have gradually narrowed. The undesirable output CO2 of the thermal power energy efficiency of the three regions is in a surplus, and the generation of hydropower in the eastern and central regions is insufficient. Conclusions The government and power industry managers should fully consider regional heterogeneity in the efficiency of hydropower and thermal power to reduce the technology gap in China. The thermal power industry is relatively mature, but its CO2 emissions should be controlled. The hydropower industry needs further policy support to promote an efficiency improvement in it under the condition of resource endowments.

AB  - The reactions of catalytic autothermal and steam conversion of n-C16H34 (model compound simulating diesel fuel), and partial oxidation of natural gas and LPG were studied using 0.24wt%Rh/(12wt%Zr0.25Ce0.25O2-delta-eta-Al2O3)/Fecralloy wire mesh honeycomb modules. The experiments were carried out in a flow setup in the temperature range of 550 960 C and at atmospheric pressure. It was shown that the observed syngas (CO + H-2) productivities were 65 and 53 m(3)Lcat(-1)h(-1) (STP) at GHSV of 100,000 and 80,000 h(-1) in natural gas and liquid petroleum gas catalytic partial oxidation processes, respectively. The product distributions were still close to the calculated equilibrium values. The catalyst activity was very high and, potentially, the maximum syngas productivity may even exceed experimentally demonstrated values. It was shown also that 0.24wt%Rh/(12wt%Zr0.25Ce0.75O2-delta-eta-Al2O3)/Fecralloy catalyst provided complete n-hexadecane conversion with the maximum syngas (CO + H-2) productivity of 6.2 m(3)Lcat(-1)h(-1) (STP) at GHSV of 13,300 h-1. The proposed concept of hydrogen-rich gas production from various hydrocarbon feedstocks in a multi-fuel catalytic reformer over single composite catalyst was proved feasible. The produced synthesis gas can be supplied as a fuel for power generation units based on high-temperature solid oxide fuel cells. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper depicts Cuba as a relic of the Cold War Its coverage of healthcare demonstrates steadfastness and success in surmounting hurdles of complacency and disregard to socialized medicine - an extension of Soviet patronage and third world alliances. The literature relays a mission of inclusivity underpinned by political ideology and a conviction to humanity. With the aid of endorsements, it speaks to contrasts and critiques in service and results by reflecting on the delivery of free healthcare for all Cuban citizens and its impression on the eradication of numerous diseases, reduced mortality rate and increased life expectancy. Punished by the longest trade embargo in modern history, the regime is in possession of limited resources to expedite remedy to its subjects. Such, much to the dislike of the authorities, elevates elements of distinction in association with the dispensation of service and drugs demonstrated by an evolving two-tier system for the disenfranchised and privileged clientele while simultaneously impacting the maintenance of facilities and equipment. Consequently, it recognizes harsh ramifications attributed to compliance with ideology and subtle adjustments to withstand external exertion. The Cuban replica is currently a tale of sorts awaiting a comprehensible definition for future generations.

TI  - The initial tolerance to sub-lethal Cd exposure is the same among ten naive pond populations of Daphnia magna, but their micro-evolutionary potential to develop resistance is very different
VL  - 144
SP  - 322-331
AB  - Genetic variation complicates predictions of both the initial tolerance and the long-term (micro-evolutionary) response of natural Daphnia populations to chemical stressors from results of standard single-clone laboratory ecotoxicity tests. In order to investigate possible solutions to this problem, we aimed to compare the initial sub-lethal tolerance to Cd of 10 naive natural pond populations of Daphnia magna as well as their evolutionary potential to develop increased resistance. We did so by measuring reproductive performance of 120 clones, i.e. 12 clones hatched from the recent dormant egg bank of each of 10 populations, both in absence (Cd-free control) and presence of 4.4 mu g Cd/L. We show that the initial tolerance, defined as the reproductive performance of individuals of the first generation exposed to Cd relative to that in a Cd-free control was not significantly different among the 10 studied pond populations and averaged 0.82 +/- 0.04 over these populations. Moreover, these populations' initial tolerances were also not significantly different from the mean initial tolerance of 0.87 +/- 0.08 at 4.0 mu g Cd/L measured for a group of 7 often-used laboratory clones, collected from a range of European ecotoxicity testing laboratories. This indicates that the initial response of naive natural pond populations to sub-lethal Cd can be relatively accurately predicted from ecotoxicity test data from only a handful of laboratory clones. We then used estimates of broad-sense heritability of Cd tolerance (H-2) - based on the same dataset - as a proxy of these populations' capacities to evolutionarily respond to Cd in terms of the development of increased resistance, which is here defined as the increase with time of the frequency of clones with a higher Cd tolerance in the population (accompanied with an increase of mean Cd-tolerance of the population above the initial tolerance). We show that the populations' estimated H-2 values of Cd-tolerance cover almost the entire theoretically possible range, ranging from not significantly different from zero (for five populations) to between 0.48 and 0.81 (for the five other populations). This indicates that, unlike the initial tolerance to Cd, the (long-term) micro-evolutionary response to Cd may be very different among natural pond populations. Therefore, we conclude that it may be very difficult to predict the long-term response of an unstudied population to chemical stress from tolerance data on a sample of other populations. It is therefore suggested that new methods for forecasting long-term responses should be explored, such as the development of predictive models based on the combination of population-genomic and tolerance time-series data.

TI  - When do Indians feel hot? Internet searches indicate seasonality suppresses adaptation to heat
VL  - 13
IS  - 5
AB  - In a warming world an increasing number of people are being exposed to heat, making a comfortable thermal environment an important need. This study explores the potential of using Regional Internet Search Frequencies (RISF) for air conditioning devices as an indicator for thermal discomfort (i.e. dissatisfaction with the thermal environment) with the aim to quantify the adaptation potential of individuals living across different climate zones and at the high end of the temperature range, in India, where access to health data is limited. We related RISF for the years 2011-2015 to daily daytime outdoor temperature in 17 states and determined at which temperature RISF for air conditioning starts to peak, i.e. crosses a heat 'threshold', in each state. Using the spatial variation in heat thresholds, we explored whether people continuously exposed to higher temperatures show a lower response to heat extremes through adaptation (e.g. physiological, behavioural or psychological). State-level heat thresholds ranged from 25.9 degrees C in Madhya Pradesh to 31.0 degrees C in Orissa. Local adaptation was found to occur at state level: the higher the average temperature in a state, the higher the heat threshold; and the higher the intra-annual temperature range (warmest minus coldest month) the lower the heat threshold. These results indicate there is potential within India to adapt to warmer temperatures, but that a large intra-annual temperature variability attenuates this potential to adapt to extreme heat. This winter 'reset' mechanism should be taken into account when assessing the impact of global warming, with changes in minimum temperatures being an important factor in addition to the change in maximum temperatures itself. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of local heat thresholds and people's adaptive capacity, which can support the design of local thermal comfort standards and early heat warning systems.

TI  - Towards optimal operation of sequential NOx storage and reduction and selective catalytic reduction
VL  - 184
SP  - 364-380
AB  - Combined NOx storage and reduction (NSR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) were conducted in a bench flow reactor comprising a Pt/Rh/BaO/Al2O3 lean NOx trap (LNT) catalyst and either Fe-ZSM-5 or Cu-SSZ-13 SCR catalyst. Simulated exhaust gas containing C3H6 or CO reductant was used to evaluate catalyst performance in terms of cycle-averaged NOx conversion and product selectivities over a range of feed concentrations and temperatures, and gas hourly space velocities (GHSV). Instantaneous concentration and temperature measurements reveal strong coupling of mass and energy between the LNT and SCR. The data show the importance of NH3 generation by the LNT for effective use of the downstream SCR. Operating conditions are identified that maximize utilization of the downstream SCR. A non-NH3 SCR pathway is found to be significant for Cu-SSZ-13 at intermediate temperature and high space velocity. The post-LNT NH3 to NOx ratio (ANR) correlates with the incremental NOx conversion achieved for Fe-ZSM-5, noting that ANR similar to 1 favors NH3-based standard SCR at high conversion. A reactor system productivity metric for N-2 generation (space-time yield analog) is used to rank-order the LNT + SCR systems and together with the propylene conversion are used to identify conditions giving the best performance. The combination of an overall GHSV of 135 k h(-1) and 350 degrees C feed temperature generates a SCR feed from the LNT that results in the highest incremental cycle-averaged NOx conversion in the SCR (similar to 30% with Cu-SSZ-13) and high cycle-averaged conversions of NOx (similar to 90%) and propylene (similar to 80%). The Cu-SSZ-13 out-performs the Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst under most conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

VL  - 9

SP  - 3576-3602
AB  - The outstretched applications of biosensors in diverse domains has become the reason for their attraction for scientific communities. Because they are analytical devices, they can detect both quantitative and qualitative biological components through the generation of detectable signals. In the recent past, biosensors witnessed significant changes and developments in their design as well as features. Nanotechnology has revolutionized sensing phenomena by increasing biodiagnostic capacity in terms of specificity, size, and cost, resulting in exceptional sensitivity and flexibility. The steep increase of non-communicable diseases across the world has emerged as a matter of concern. In parallel, the abrupt outbreak of communicable diseases poses a serious threat to mankind. For decreasing the morbidity and mortality associated with various communicable and non-communicable diseases, early detection and subsequent treatment are indispensable. Detection of different biological markers generates quantifiable signals that can be electrochemical, mass-based, optical, thermal, or piezoelectric. Speculating on the incumbent applicability and versatility of nano-biosensors in large disciplines, this review highlights different types of biosensors along with their components and detection mechanisms. Moreover, it deals with the current advancements made in biosensors and the applications of nano-biosensors in detection of various non-communicable and communicable diseases, as well as future prospects of nano-biosensors for diagnostics.

TI  - Estimating acute mortality of Lepidoptera caused by the cultivation of insect-resistant Bt maize - The LepiX model
VL  - 371
SP  - 50-59
AB  - The cultivation of Bt maize, genetically modified to be resistant to insect pests, has led to intense scientific and political debate about its possible adverse impacts on biodiversity. To better address this question we developed an individual-based simulation model (LepiX). LepiX considers the temporal dynamics of maize pollen shedding and larval phonology, and pollen deposition on host plants related to distance from the maize field, in order to estimate mortality of lepidopteran larvae exposed to toxic Bt pollen. We employed a refined exposure analysis, comparison to previous approaches, using recent evidence on leaf pollen deposition and accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of pollen on leaves. Moreover, we used a stochastic approach, considering literature data on a minimum dataset for butterfly biology in combination with historic data on temporal pollen deposition to predict the coincidence between larval phenology and pollen deposition. Since conservation management actions may act at the level of the individual for protected species, LepiX, as an individual based spatially explicit model, is suited to assist both risk assessment and management measures based on threshold mortalities. We tested our model using Inachis io (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) as butterfly species and the cultivation of insect resistant MON810 maize. In accordance to predictions based on other models we identified mortality risks of I. io larvae for the second larval generation. An analysis of the sensitivity of input parameters stressed the importance of both the slope and the LC50 value of the dose-response curve as well as the earliest day of larval hatching. Using different published data to characterize the dose-response of MON810 pollen to I. io we revealed consequences due to uncertainties in ecotoxicological parameters and thus highlight the importance of key biological parameters for reliable estimates of effects, and decision making (e.g. isolation distances) in risk assessment.

AB  - Linking ecology and evolution can be challenging, particularly as these fields evolve rapidly tracking technological and theoretical developments. Thus, it is important for practitioners of different biological disciplines to understand new opportunities and challenges. Since theory and methods evolve, so will research programmes-often tracking opportunity. Here, we describe a research programme where we have investigated the population biology of grayling Thymallus thymallus in a Norwegian alpine landscape over three decades. Starting with classical ecological studies, we identified a set of populations that had evolved population-specific phenotypic traits over a relatively short time span (10-30 generations). These observations led us into evolutionary studies at various levels of biological organization, using population and quantitative genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic approaches. Overall, the results show that the populations exhibit evolutionary responses to local-scale differences in environment (mainly water temperature during early development). Further, plastic responses are important in the early phase of population diversification. Population genomic studies are now becoming possible following the completion of an annotated genome. This will help us and others in addressing questions about the genetic architecture of traits important for local adaptation, thus emphasizing that combining ecological and evolutionary approaches is more important and interesting than ever.

TI  - Climate change impacts on lakes: an integrated ecological perspective based on a multi-faceted approach, with special focus on shallow lakes
VL  - 73
SP  - 88-111
AB  - Freshwater ecosystems and their biodiversity are presently seriously threatened by global development and population growth, leading to increases in nutrient inputs and intensification of eutrophication-induced problems in receiving fresh waters, particularly in lakes. Climate change constitutes another threat exacerbating the symptoms of eutrophication and species migration and loss. Unequivocal evidence of climate change impacts is still highly fragmented despite the intensive research, in part due to the variety and uncertainty of climate models and underlying emission scenarios but also due to the different approaches applied to study its effects. We first describe the strengths and weaknesses of the multi-faceted approaches that are presently available for elucidating the effects of climate change in lakes, including space-for-time substitution, time series, experiments, palaeoecology and modelling. Reviewing combined results from studies based on the various approaches, we describe the likely effects of climate changes on biological communities, trophic dynamics and the ecological state of lakes. We further discuss potential mitigation and adaptation measures to counteract the effects of climate change on lakes and, finally, we highlight some of the future challenges that we face to improve our capacity for successful prediction.

VL  - 50

SP  - 1111-1118
AB  - Recent studies of evolution in heterogeneous environments have concentrated on the role of coarse-grained environmental variation. Here I explore the potential for a modular organism to adapt to fine-grained environmental variation through within-individual variation among modules. I describe the pattern of variation among leaves of single individuals and report results of initial analyses of genetic variation for within-individual variability in leaf traits and of genetic correlations that could influence the rate of further evolution of within-individual variation of these traits. Plants from 24 paternal half-sib families were raised in growth chambers, and five traits were measured for two leaves produced by each plant. Four of the five traits differed significantly between sampling times. Genetic analyses revealed significant additive genetic variation for within-individual variation in several traits. Estimates of family mean correlations between traits expressed at different times suggest few relationships that would be expected to impede response to selection for changes in the pattern of within-individual variation in leaf traits. These results support the possibility that within-individual variation could evolve as an adaptive response to fine-grained environmental variation and suggest a need for further investigation to improve understanding of evolution in heterogeneous environments.

TI  - A life cycle comparison of disposal and beneficial use of coal combustion products in Florida
VL  - 13
IS  - 7
SP  - 555-563
AB  - Background, aim, and scope Beneficial use of coal combustion products (CCPs) in industrial or construction operations has the potential to minimize environmental and human health impacts that would otherwise be associated with disposal of CCPs in the life cycle of coal used for electricity generation. To assess opportunities for reducing impacts associated with four CCP materials considered in this study, fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) material, this paper reports results of expanding a life cycle inventory of raw material and emissions (part 1 of this series of papers) by performing life cycle impact assessment on five scenarios of CCP management. Materials and methods SimaPro 5.1 software (PRe Consultants) was used to calculate comparative environmental impacts of all scenarios using CML2001 and Environmental Design of Industrial Products 1997 midpoint impact assessment methods and Heirarchist and Individualist levels of the Eco-indicator 99 end point method. Trends were compared for global and local environmental and human health impact categories of global warming, acidification, smog formation, human toxicity, and ecotoxicity. Results In each impact category, beneficial use of fly ash, bottom ash, and FGD material resulted in a reduced impact compared to disposal of these materials. The extent to which beneficial use reduced impacts depended on several factors, including the impact category in consideration, the magnitude of potentially avoided impacts associated with producing raw materials that CCPs replace, and the potential impact of CCP disposal methods. Global warming impacts were reduced by the substitution of fly ash for Portland cement in concrete production, as production of Portland cement generates large quantities of CO2. However, for categories of global warming, smog formation, and acidification, impact reductions from CCP beneficial use are small, less than 6%, as these impacts were attributable, in greater part, to upstream processes of coal mining, transportation, and combustion. Human toxicity and ecotoxicity categories showed larger but more varied reductions, from 0% to 50%, caused by diverting CCPs from landfills and surface impoundments. Discussion When comparing beneficial use scenarios, the four impact assessment methods used showed similar trends in categories of global warming, acidification, and smog formation. However, results diverged for human toxicity and ecotoxicity categories due to the lack of consensus among methods in classification and characterization of impacts from heavy metal release. Similarly, when assessing sensitivity of these results to changes in assumptions or system boundaries, human toxicity and ecotoxicity categories were most susceptible to change, while other impact categories had more robust results. Conclussions Impact assessment results showed that beneficial use of CCPs presented opportunities for reduced environmental impacts in the life cycle of coal combusted for electricity generation, as compared to the baseline scenario of 100% CCP disposal, although the impact reductions varied depending on the CCPs used, the ultimate beneficial use, and the impact category in consideration. Recommendations and perspectives As regulators and electric utilities increasingly consider viability and economics of the use of CCPs in various applications, this study provides a first-basis study of selected beneficial use alternatives. With these initial results, future studies should be directed towards beneficial uses that promise significant economic and environmental savings, such as use of fly ash in concrete, to quantify the currently unknown risk of these applications.

AB  - The molten salt reactor (MSR) represents one of the promising high temperature nuclear reactor types for future generation of electricity which is characterized by remarkable advantages in inherent safety, fuel cycle, miniaturization, effective utilization of nuclear resources and proliferation resistance. The molten salt reactor is characterized by circulation of fuel salt (mixture of molten salt and fissile-fertile isotopes). The circulation of fuel salt serves the purpose of coolant as well as fuel simultaneously. This results in strongly coupled neutronics and thermo-hydraulics system. These special features require a modification to mathematical models applicable to static fuel system. In this paper, coupled point kinetics equations and core heat transfer have been modeled by developing a mathematical model for MSR based on lumped parameters technique and modes of transients such as: reactivity insertion, fuel mass flow rate variations, and the inlet temperature drop conditions. The results showed that the program is a suitable tool for MSR transient analysis.

TI  - GridPix application to dual phase TPC
VL  - 460
AB  - GridPix is a gas-filled detector with an aluminium mesh stretched 50 m above the Timepix CMOS pixel chip. This defines a high electric field where gas amplification occurs. A feasibility study is ongoing at Nikhef for the application of the GridPix technology as a charge sensitive device in a dual phase noble gas Time Projection Chamber (TPC), within the framework of the DARWIN design study for next generation dark matter experiments. The smallness of the device and well defined materials allow for high radio-purity and low outgassing. The high granularity of a pixel readout and the high detection efficiency of single electrons of GridPix bring benefits especially in terms of energy resolution for small energy deposits. This feature is interesting also for the measurement of the scintillation yield and the ionisation yield of noble liquids. The accurate measurements of such quantities have a direct impact on the data interpretation of dark matter experiments. The application in dual phase argon or xenon TPCs implies several technological challenges, such as the survival of the device at cryogenic temperature as well as the operation in a pure noble gas atmosphere without discharges. We describe here the recent developments of the project.

AB  - Ice nucleation and ice repellence are properties which appear to be contradictory. Both are of great importance: The former for ice generation in the food and cooling industry and the latter for avoiding the adhesion of ice to structures. By mimicking a peculiar survival mechanism of some cold-adapted organisms a new type of coating system, able to both nucleate and repel the ice was developed. A heterogeneous surface containing locally isolated nucleation points in a low surface energy matrix were synthesised by a sol-gel process. The ice nucleating and ice releasing performance of the new ice nucleating coatings (INC) has been tested in a specially designed crystallisation chamber in comparison to commercial low surface energy coating systems. A mixture of demineralised water and a water freezing point depressant was used in the experiments. Compared to the commercial coatings, the INC surfaces showed a much higher ice nucleation rate but also a distinctly better ice releasing ability. Obviously the novel concept of local embedded nucleation points improves the ice repellent properties of surfaces.

AB  - Molecular technologies have enabled the generation of various transgenic insect strains for the area-wide control of agricultural pests and vectors of human diseases. Individual maintenance of several diverse transgenic lines or strains involves a lot of resources, and sometimes problems arise that threaten the strains being maintained. Here, we present a way to cost-effectively maintain transgenic lines or strains of the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata by extending their generation time. Immature stages were kept at 20 degrees C instead of 28 degrees C, and the subsequent generation of transgenic flies kept at different temperatures were found to have laboratory fecundity comparable to the untreated transgenic flies. Extension of generation time offers inexpensive strain maintenance as it reduces the resources, time and energy spent on maintenance of transgenic medfly strains, in addition to minimizing exposure of strains to problems sometimes associated with strain maintenance.

VL  - 49
SP  - 360-369
AB  - Green-sustainable approaches prompt urgent attention for recycling end-of-life spent solid-state lithium batteries (SSLBs), which are candidates for next-generation energy storage systems. Here, we propose a green method of deformation-driven re-sintering (DDR) to recycle spent SSLBs with emphasis on garnet-type solid-state electrolyte (SSE) recovery. The recycled fine SSE particles via DDR provide sufficient sintering activity for grain fusion and promote Li absorption with the Li2O atmosphere. The severe deformation accelerates the phase transformation process from the tetragonal phase to cubic phase and inhibits the proton/lithium exchange process. The homogeneous distribution of Li-ions eliminates discontinuous connection areas, facilitating the establishment of fast ionic pathways. The critical current density of DDR-SSE reaches 1.24 mA.cm(-2 ), indicating a stable process of the stripping and plating lithium. SSLBs assembled by the DDR-SSE and LiFePO4 cathode show a superior cycling performance with a discharge capacity of 126.7 mAh.g(-1) and capacity retention of 89.7% after 400 cycles (0.5 C) at room temperature. The work firstly provides a feasible green-sustainable method for spent SSEs with high performances, promoting the environmental benignity and economic viability for the sustainable solution of resources.

TI  - Does inbreeding affect the extinction risk of small populations? predictions from Drosophila
VL  - 13
IS  - 3
SP  - 502-514
AB  - A fundamental assumption underlying the importance of genetic risks within conservation biology is that inbreeding increases the extinction probability of populations. Although inbreeding has been shown to have a detrimental impact on individual fitness, its contribution to extinction is still poorly understood. We have studied the consequences of different levels of prior inbreeding for the persistence of small populations using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. To this end, we determined the extinction rate of small vial populations differing in the level of inbreeding under both optimal and stress conditions, i.e. high temperature stress and ethanol stress. We show that inbred populations have a significantly higher short-term probability of extinction than non-inbred populations, even for low levels of inbreeding, and that the extinction probability increases with increasing inbreeding levels. In addition, we observed that the effects of inbreeding become greatly enhanced under stressful environmental conditions. More importantly, our results show that the impact of environmental stress becomes significantly greater for higher inbreeding levels, demonstrating explicitly that inbreeding and environmental stress are not independent but can act synergistically. These effects seem long lasting as the impact of prior inbreeding was still qualitatively the same after the inbred populations had been expanded to appreciable numbers and maintained as such for approximately 50 generations. Our observations have significant consequences for conservation biology.

VL  - 157
SP  - 35-46
AB  - Steam production has a wide range of applications such as seawater desalination, waste sterilization, and power generation. The utilization of solar energy for this purpose has attracted much attention due to its inexhaustibility and pollution-free nature. Here, direct solar steam generation at low-concentrated solar power using plasmonic nanofluids containing gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) was investigated experimentally. The key factors required for highly efficient solar steam generation, including Au NP concentration and solar power intensity, were studied in a simulated solar system by measuring the water weight loss and system temperature change. The best evaporation performance was obtained using a plasmonic nanofluid containing 178 ppm of Au NPs under 10 sun (1 sun =1 kW m(-2)) illumination intensity, and the total efficiency reached 65%. However, the total efficiency of pure water was only 16%, which means that the plasmonic nanofluids reached a similar to 300% enhancement in efficiency. Higher solar power led to a higher evaporation rate, higher specific vapor productivity (SVP), and higher Au NP concentrations resulted in better evaporation performance. Localized solar heating at the fluid-air interface was shown to contribute more to solar steam generation than to bulk fluid heating. Furthermore, the model of photothermal heating of plasmonic nanoparticle was established and the numerical results demonstrated the photothermal conversion process of plasmonic NPs from the light absorption to the heat dissipation into the bulk fluid.

AB  - In his PAA presidential address and corresponding article in Demography, David Lam (Demography 48: 1231-1262, 2011) documented the extraordinary progress of humankind-vis-a-vis poverty alleviation, increased schooling, and reductions in mortality and fertility-since 1960 and noted that he expects further improvements by 2050. However, although Lam briefly covered the problems of global warming and pollution, he did not address several other major environmental problems that are closely related to the rapid human population growth in recent decades and to the progress he described. This commentary highlights some of these problems to provide a more balanced perspective on the situation of the world. Specifically, humans currently are using resources at an unsustainable level. Groundwater depletion and overuse of river water are major problems on multiple continents. Fossil fuel resources and several minerals are being depleted. Other major problems include deforestation, with the annual forest clearing globally estimated to be an area the size of New York State; and species extinction, with rates estimated to be 100 to 1,000 times higher than background rates. Principles of ecological economics are presented that allow an integration of ecology and economic development and better potential for preservation of the world for future generations.

VL  - 20
IS  - 6
SP  - 1045-1053
AB  - 1. We examined the effect of thermal acclimation on fighting success and underlying performance traits in the crayfish Cherax destructor. We tested the hypothesis that animals will be more successful when fighting at their acclimation temperature than at a colder or warmer temperature, and that changes in metabolic capacity underlie differences in behavioural performance. 2. Thermal acclimation (to 20 degrees C and to 30 degrees C) had a significant effect on behavioural contests, and the likelihood of winning was significantly greater when individuals fought at their acclimation temperature against an individual from an alternate acclimation temperature. 3. The ratio of ADP stimulated respiration to proton leak (respiratory control ratio) of isolated mitochondria increased significantly in chelae muscle of the cold-acclimated group, and differences in respiratory control ratio between winners and losers were significantly correlated with the outcome of agonistic encounters. However, acclimation did not affect tall muscle mitochondria or the activity of pyruvate kinase in either chelae or tail muscle. 4. The force produced by closing chelae was thermally insensitive within acclimation groups, and there were no significant differences between acclimation treatments. None the less, differences in chelae width between contestants were significantly correlated with the outcome of agonistic encounters, but this perceived resource holding power did not reflect the actual power of force production. 5. Thermal acclimation in C destructor has beneficial consequences for dominance and competitive ability, and the success of cold acclimated animals at the cold temperatures can be at least partly explained by concomitant up-regulation of oxidative ATP production capacity.

TI  - DEVELOPMENT OF A 250-KWE CLASS SUPERCRITICAL CARBON DIOXIDE RANKINE CYCLE POWER GENERATION SYSTEM AND ITS CORE COMPONENTS
AB  - Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials (KIMM) investigated a supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) cycle for a heat recovery power generation system for several years. The objective of the study focuses on the development of the technologies and the establishment of the development procedure of turbomachinery, heat exchangers, and auxiliary equipment for the sCO2 power cycle. A motor-driven centrifugal starter pump with an inducer is developed for startup operation. The main pump-drive turbine module adopts magnetic bearings as axial and radial bearings to remove oil lubrication and exhibits a hermetic structure to eliminate leakage problems. The power turbine and a generator are linked via a gearbox in the power turbine-generator module. An oil bearing and floating ring seal with dry gas injection are applied to minimize sCO2 leakage. The recuperator is developed as a printed circuit heat exchanger (PCHE) owing to its high efficiency and compactness. The integrated test facility is designed as a 250-kWe class sCO2 recuperated Rankine cycle to evaluate the performance of the core modules as opposed to demonstrating the viability of a particular sCO2 cycle. The test facility is proven to successfully operate in startup mode and self-sustaining mode using the starter pump and the main pump-drive turbine module. An overview of the operation of the startup mode and self-sustaining mode is presented.

SP  - 860-867
AB  - This study is to analyze how to extend the sugar plants by a polygeneration technology to produce sugar, bioethanol, biogas and bioelectricity. The possibility of selling the bioelectricity to the national grid in Brazil is also investigated through optimizing the energy production at an industrial plant. The viability of the generation rates for renewable energy proposed by the regulatory bodies within the Brazilian electricity sector is analyzed. The plant's short-term planning was obtained by applying non-trivial optimal solutions that allow officials to choose the best alternative for planning production employing the most economical combinations of sugar, bioethanol, biogas, and electricity. We calculated the cost of exporting electricity to the electrical grid from January 2008 to December 2009, concluding that the spot market prices were too low to stimulate the sale of the bioelectricity to the electrical grid. Moreover, the remuneration guaranteed by the Brazilian Program of Incentives for Renewable Resources (PROINFA) was not sufficient to stimulate the sale of the bioelectricity. However, the price set by the Brazilian Electrical Regulating Agency (ANEEL) in the 2009 auction was sufficient to support exporting electricity for all the months except December 2009.

TI  - GAS TURBINE CO-FIRING OF STEELWORKS AMMONIA WITH COKE OVEN GAS OR METHANE: A FUNDAMENTAL AND CYCLE ANALYSIS
AB  - Following on from successful experimental trials employing ammonia/hydrogen blends in a model gas turbine combustor, with favorable NO. and unburned fuel emissions, a detailed numerical study has been undertaken to assess the viability of using steelworks by-product ammonia in gas turbines. Every metric ton (tonne) of steel manufactured using a blast furnace results in approximately 1.5 kg of by-product ammonia, usually present in a vapor form, from the cleansing of coke oven gas (COG). This study numerically investigates the potential to utilize this by-product for power generation. Ammonia combustion presents some major challenges, including poor reactivity and a propensity for excessive NO. emissions. Ammonia combustion has been shown to be greatly enhanced through the addition of support fuels, hydrogen and methane (both major components of COG). CHEMKIN-PRO is employed to demonstrate the optimal ratio of ammonia vapor, and alternatively anhydrous ammonia recovered from the vapor, to COG or methane at equivalence ratios between 1.0 and 1.4 under an elevated inlet temperature of 550K. Aspen Plus was used to design a Brayton-Rankine cycle with integrated recuperation, and overall cycle efficiencies were calculated for a range of favorable equivalence ratios, identified from the combustion models. The results have been used to specify a series of emissions experiments in a model gas turbine combustor.

AB  - Long-term changes in temperature can negatively affect human livelihoods with resulting implications for health outcomes. While increasing attention has been paid to the direct health consequences of climate change, there has been less focus on indirect health effects, partly due to the relative complexity of establishing and modeling these outcomes. Here, I leverage a dataset of over 400,000 individuals across 25 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, coupled with high-resolution climate data for the region, to test the effect of long-run temperature changes on HIV prevalence. I find that warmer periods are linked with an increase in HIV prevalence, particularly for younger generations. Both economic and behavioral changes likely drive this linkage: I find evidence that male migration and sex-market use increase with higher temperatures. I generate projections for future HIV prevalence using two methods. First, I project directly using the empirical estimate, an approach frequently used in econometric studies of climate change impacts. Second, I develop a mechanistic model of HIV spread, incorporating the estimated temperature effect. I find that agreement between the models is strong (77%). Under the RCP8.5 scenario for warming, I find that climate change will lead to between 11.6 and 16.0 million additional cases of HIV by 2050, an increase in prevalence of 1.4-2.1 percentage points.

AB  - The thermal physiology determines the whole biology of ectotherm organisms, by limiting their acquisition and allocation of resources. Herein, we aim to add knowledge on how different species use the thermal resources when they coexist in a habitat, studying the thermal physiology of three sympatric and syntopic liolaemid lizards, Phymaturus querque, Phymaturus zapalensis, and Liolaemus elongatus during the summer season. We measured the body temperatures at capture places, the operative microenvironmental temperatures in the field, and the preferred body temperature in an experimental thermal gradient in the laboratory. We found that the three species are thermoregulators, selecting cooler thermal microenvironments than the ones expected by chance, and even cooler than the temperatures they selected in a laboratory environment. Liolaemus elongatus is a more efficient thermoregulator (E = 0.671) than the two Phymaturus species, P. querque (E = 0.441) and P. zapalensis (E = 0.471), which are moderate thermoregulators and, apparently, specialists in finding specific types of shelters, since they seem to select certain types of rock crevices. Herein, we found that during the summer season, although individuals have access to warm microenvironments, they spend time on cool refuges, probably to prevent overheating. This highlights the importance of an adequate spatial distribution of operative temperatures (T-e), more than just a mere availability of appropriate temperatures.

TI  - State-of-the-art process simulations and techno-economic assessments of ionic liquid-based biogas upgrading techniques: Challenges and prospects
VL  - 314
AB  - Biogas has emerged as an alternative renewable fuel to natural gas. However, the presence of trace contaminants and large quantities of CO2 in biogas necessitates its purification and upgrading to increase its calorific value. Different technologies have been developed to upgrade biogas to biomethane. Among these, chemical absorption is commonly employed due to its high process efficiency and less solvent requirement due to high selectivity compared to physical absorption. However, the chemical decomposition of amine-based solvents, toxicological impact, high plant maintenance costs, high enthalpy of reaction, and corrosivity associated with chemical absorption limit its large-scale application. Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) have garnered attention as alternative absorption media to conventional solvents. ILs have a high CO2 uptake, thermal stability, and negligible vapor pressure. Recent process simulation studies featuring ILs as solvents for biogas upgrading reveal the suitability of these approaches as alternatives to laborious experimental work to assess the practical, technical, and economic viability of ILs. As per the authors' knowledge, this is the first review comparing biogas upgrading technologies from a technical, environmental, and economic perspective. Primarily, studies relating to IL-based biogas upgrading are considered, and challenges associated with the large-scale adoption of ILs as absorption media are discussed. Process simulations and techno-economic assessments of IL-based biogas upgrading techniques are presented. A conceptual design approach is proposed for the successful scale-up of IL-based biogas upgrading. Based on results, deep eutectic solvents are recommended as next-generation solvents for absorption as technical and economic aspects are found superior to conventional amines and ionic liquids.

TI  - Additive and mostly adaptive plastic responses of gene expression to multiple stress in Tribolium castaneum
VL  - 16
IS  - 5
AB  - Gene expression is known to be highly responsive to the environment and important for adjustment of metabolism but there is also growing evidence that differences in gene regulation contribute to species divergence and differences among locally adapted populations. However, most studies so far investigated populations when divergence had already occurred. Selection acting on expression levels at the onset of adaptation to an environmental change has not been characterized. Understanding the mechanisms is further complicated by the fact that environmental change is often multivariate, meaning that organisms are exposed to multiple stressors simultaneously with potentially interactive effects. Here we use a novel approach by combining fitness and whole-transcriptome data in a large-scale experiment to investigate responses to drought, heat and their combination in Tribolium castaneum. We found that fitness was reduced by both stressors and their combined effect was almost additive. Expression data showed that stressor responses were acting independently and did not interfere physiologically. Since we measured expression and fitness within the same individuals, we were able to estimate selection on gene expression levels. We found that variation in fitness can be attributed to gene expression variation and that selection pressures were environment dependent and opposite between control and stress conditions. We could further show that plastic responses of expression were largely adaptive, i.e. in the direction that should increase fitness. Author summary During environmental change organisms are exposed to several stressors simultaneously to which they can show plastic and evolutionary responses. Gene regulation can play a crucial role in both processes. Measuring gene expression gives us detailed insights into underlying molecular pathways, relative importance of different stressors and how they may interfere with each other in combination. However, it is challenging to understand how plastic responses are ultimately linked to fitness and adaptation. We combined measurements of a fitness component (offspring number) with gene expression data to study responses of the model organism T. castaneum (red flour beetle) to single and joint effects of drought and heat. Higher temperatures resulted in a stronger reduction of offspring number and a larger number of differently expressed genes compared to reduced humidity. We could show that stressors affected different physiological processes and consequently responses did not show much modification in combination. Combining fitness and transcriptomic data of the same individuals enabled us to estimate selection on gene expression levels. We found that selection under control conditions (to which the beetles are adapted) was in general opposite to selection under the new, stressful conditions and that large parts of the response to heat were adaptive.

SP  - 321-343
AB  - We outline the strategy and constraints adopted for the design of medium-power lead-alloy-cooled actinide-burning reactors that strive for a lower cost than accelerator-driven systems and for robust safety. Reduced cost is pursued through the use of (1) a modular design and maximum power rating to capitalize on an economy of scale within the constraints imposed by modularity, (2) a very compact and simple supercritical-CO2 power cycle, and (3) simplifications of the primary system allowed by the use of lead coolant. Excellent safety is pursued by adopting the integral fast reactor approach of achieving a self-controllable reactor that responds to all key abnormal occurrences, including anticipated transients without scrams, by a safe shutdown without exceeding core integrity limits. The three concepts developed are the fertile-free actinide burner for incineration of all transuranics from light water reactor (LWR) spent fuel, the fertile-free minor actinide (MA) burner for preferential burning of MAs working in tandem with LWRs or gas-cooled thermal reactors, and the actinide burner with thorium fuel aimed also at reducing the electricity generation costs through longer-cycle operation.

SP  - 1691-1706
AB  - Since the Brazilian Sugarcane Mills have adopted the practice of mechanized harvesting, the large amounts of straw mulching on the soil surface have become an important issue to be investigated. This residue represents a valuable feedstock for 2nd generation ethanol production and bioelectricity cogeneration while could be left in the field for agronomic purposes. In the present study, we assess the temporal variability of moisture content, soil temperature and sugarcane yield in response to different amounts of straw mulching (SM), along two seasons (2014/2015 and 2015/2016) in three important locations of sugarcane expansion areas in Brazil. The treatments were bare soil, 50% and 100% straw mulch(SM) and dielectric sensors MPS-2 measured soil water potential and temperature every 6 hours at a depth of 0.20 m.SM suppressed soil temperature during the initial crop development (regrowth); water storage was improved by SM and enhanced the soil moisture maintenance, which in dry periods (early harvest) is essential to the crop establishment; sugarcane yield increased in response to 100 SM in clayey soils, with amounts above 14.9 Mg ha(-1)of SM; no increase in sugarcane yield was observed in sandy soil with amounts below 9.2 Mg ha(-1)of SM.

SP  - 101-118
AB  - A model composed of two straight lines describes the relation between overwintering spring adults of Colorado potato beetle [Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say)] and potato yield. Potato vines (Solanum tubersoum (L.), cv. 'Superior') had a damage boundary of around 5.8 spring adults per plant. However, under conditions favorable for reproduction, overwintering adults of 0.07 beetles per plant would produce a large population of first-generation larvae that would reduce considerably the potato yield if not controlled. There is no appreciable seasonal overlapping between adults and young larvae in the field. Monitoring activities should therefore be directed at the beginning of the season against overwintering adults and later against first-generation larvae. For summer adults, an action threshold of 10 per plant is proposed.

AB  - To examine the role of impacts in the evolution of asteroids as seen through their chondritic offspring, we have performed a quantitative three dimensional (3D) study of metal grains in a suite of increasingly shocked L chondrites with synchrotron X-ray microtomography (XMT). Our data allow rigorous quantification of size-number distributions and collective morphology of Fe(Ni) metal phases in chondritic meteorites. At the resolution of our XMT measurements (8.4-17.9 mu m/voxel), the number of metal particles increase with higher degrees of petrographically identified shock loading, indicating a coalescing of Fe-Ni metal at or below this scale. Our results demonstrate that collective degrees of metal grain preferred orientation increase with greater degrees of impact-related compaction and shock loading. Ductile metal grains in L chondrites begin to show foliation at peak shock pressures < 5 GPa, pressures great enough to compact and indurate loosely bound chondritic material, and Our results Constitute evidence for multiple generations of impact events acting on the L parent body or bodies.

TI  - Statistical evaluation of voltages in distribution systems with embedded wind generation
VL  - 147
IS  - 4
SP  - 207-212
AB  - The commercial viability of wind-driven embedded renewable generation (ERG) projects is sensitive lo connection costs. These costs vary with the voltage level at which the ERG is connected; generally the higher the voltage, the higher the cost. Windfarm developers of ERG therefore prefer to connect at lower voltages. However, because distribution networks are normally limited by permissible voltage fluctuations rather than by thermal considerations, network operators prefer to connect ERG at higher voltages where their overall impact on voltage profiles is minimal. This conflict of objectives between ERG developers and network operators is usually settled through simple deterministic load flow studies, usually based on one critical case representing conditions of minimum load and maximum ERG output. Such studies only consider extreme events and do not take into account the likelihood of these events occurring. However, new European standards describe voltage characteristics in statistical terms. Although these standards are not intended for use in assessing the level of penetration of ERG, they point to statistical and probabilistic approaches as the way forward in such assessments. This is particularly important for wind generation because of its: stochastic output. Two simple wind speed models based on the Markov modelling technique are presented, which may be used to evaluate the impact of windfarms. The models give satisfactory results when applied to the evaluation of voltage profiles in distribution networks. The probability density function of voltage call be obtained and used in assessing the level of ERG that might be accepted on an existing network. A 281-node generic distribution system model based on a real network is used to illustrate the application of the proposed models.

TI  - Meeting global cooling demand with photovoltaics during the 21st century
VL  - 12
IS  - 9
SP  - 2706-2716
AB  - Space conditioning, and cooling in particular, is a key factor in human productivity and well-being across the globe. During the 21st century, global cooling demand is expected to grow significantly due to the increase in wealth and population in sunny nations across the globe and the advance of global warming. The same locations that see high demand for cooling are also ideal for electricity generation via photovoltaics (PV). Despite the apparent synergy between cooling demand and PV generation, the potential of the cooling sector to sustain PV generation has not been assessed on a global scale. Here, we perform a global assessment of increased PV electricity adoption enabled by the residential cooling sector during the 21st century. Already today, utilizing PV production for cooling could facilitate an additional installed PV capacity of approximately 540 GW, more than the global PV capacity of today. Using established scenarios of population and income growth, as well as accounting for future global warming, we further project that the global residential cooling sector could sustain an added PV capacity between 20-200 GW each year for most of the 21st century, on par with the current global manufacturing capacity of 100 GW. Furthermore, we find that without storage, PV could directly power approximately 50% of cooling demand, and that this fraction is set to increase from 49% to 56% during the 21st century, as cooling demand grows in locations where PV and cooling have a higher synergy. With this geographic shift in demand, the potential of distributed storage also grows. We simulate that with a 1 m3 water-based latent thermal storage per household, the fraction of cooling demand met with PV would increase from 55% to 70% during the century. These results show that the synergy between cooling and PV is notable and could significantly accelerate the growth of the global PV industry.

TI  - Green Integrated Structural Elements for Retrofitting and New Construction of Buildings
VL  - 660
AB  - Governments across Europe have ambitious visions for the construction sector sector. For example, in the UK, as part of the Clean Growth Grand Challenge within the Governments Industrial Strategy, we are aiming to halve the energy use of new buildings by 2030; delivering new construction assets at a third of the cost and significantly quicker; provide assets that are cheaper to run, smarter, safer with lower emissions; and ultimately create cleaner air. As part of this deal and the wider The 'Construction Sector Deal' sets out an ambitious partnership between the industry and Government that aims to transform the sector's productivity through innovative technologies and a more highly skilled workforce aims to transform the efficiency of construction techniques through digital technologies like Business Information Modelling; reduce running costs through energy generation and storage technologies; and conduct research and development and demonstration programmes supporting innovations. The core aim of the project is to seamlessly combine four integrated layers with high structural performance, which would provide high levels of insulation, a healthy indoor environment, high aesthetic value, along with CO2 capture, and greywater management. The competitive advantage of the Green INSTRUCT panel is (1) sustainable and cost effective - using more than 70% wt. C&DW including concrete, bricks, plastic, metals; (2) safety and energy efficiency - meeting Eurocode standards for fire safety, thermal insulation with U-value of 0.14 W/m(2).K and acoustic insulation coefficient under 60dB and (3) Customisation potential - multi-layered, modular & prefabricated building block for new and old building. This paper will discuss key project achievements in terms of material development and innovation and challenges faced so far during the project.

TI  - A set of discrete formulae for the performance of a tsetse population during aerial spraying
VL  - 125
IS  - 2
SP  - 202-213
AB  - A set of discrete formulae that calculates the hypothetical impact of aerial spraying on a tsetse population is derived and the work is thought to be novel. Both the original population and the subsequent generations which survive the aerial spraying, may ultimately be thought of as deriving from two, distinct sources. These origins are, however, neither distinct, nor relevant by the third generation. It is for this reason that the female population is considered to be composed of the following four categories for the purposes of derivation: Original flies which existed as such at the commencement of spraying; original pupae which existed as such at the commencement of spraying; the immediate descendants of both the aforementioned categories, during spraying; third and higher generation descendants. In theory, the latter category is a recurrence relation. In practice, the third generation's pupal stage has hardly come into existence, even by the end of a completed operation. Implicit in the formulae is the assumption of one, temperature-dependent mortality rate for the entire pupal stage, a second for the period between eclosion and ovulation and yet a third for the entire, adult life-span. Gravid female resistance to the insecticide is assumed to be inconsequential. A further assumption of the formulae is that at least one male is always available (degree of sterility variable).

TI  - Determination of optimal pre-treatment conditions for ethanol production from olive-pruning debris by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation
VL  - 89
IS  - 10
SP  - 2891-2896
AB  - Ethanol generation from lignocellulose materials provides an alternative energy-production system. This study investigates the effect of pre-treatment conditions: maximum temperature (range 423.15-483.15 K) and sulfuric-acid concentration (interval 0.002-0.059 kmol/m(3)) on fuel-ethanol production from simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of olive-pruning debris by Saccharomyces cerevisiae IR2-9a (a thermal acclimatized microorganism, 313.15 K). The influence of these two variables was determined by using a response-surface methodology. Cellulose percentage in pre-treated solids reached a maximum of 71.6% of the content in raw material at 483.15 K and 0.010 kmol/m(3) of acid concentration. The conversion of hemicellulose into monosaccharides and oligosaccharides also was analyzed. After the wash and filtration of solids, a significant quantity of D-glucose was obtained in the liquid fraction. For ethanol generation, the bio-fuel yield (maximum of 9.6 kg from 100 kg olive-pruning debris), and volumetric ethanol productivity (maximum of 0.27 kg/(m(3) h)), strongly depended on pre-treatments conditions. According to statistical optimization, the highest ethanol yield (9.9 kg ethanol from 100 kg olive-pruning debris) is achieved at 480.15 K using a catalyst concentration of 0.016 kmol/m(3). A maximum overall process yield of 15.3 kg ethanol/100 kg olive-pruning debris may result when taking into account ethanol from SSF and D-glucose present in the pre-hydrolysate, assuming its theoretical conversion (22.8 kg ethanol/100 kg raw material, also considering the total conversion of D-xylose in the filtrate).

TI  - Ice-Release and Erosion Resistant Materials for Wind Turbines
VL  - 926
AB  - Icing conditions may cause wind turbine generators to partially lose productivity or to be completely shut down to avoid structural damage. At present, commercially available technologies to mitigate this problem consist of expensive, energy hungry heating elements, which costs roughly 70,000 euro per medium size turbine. Conventional passive ice protection coating systems heavily rely on delicate surface structures and expensive materials to create water repellent superhydrophobic / low surface energy surfaces, which have been proven to be ineffective against ice accumulation. The lack of performance among conventional ice protection materials stems from a flaw in the approach to the problem: failure to recognize that water in its liquid form (WATER) and water in its solid form (ICE) are two different things. Something that works for WATER does not automatically work for ICE. Another reason is that many superhydrophobic materials are often reliant upon often fragile micro-structured surfaces to achieve their intended effects. This paper discusses a fundamentally different approach to the creation of a robust, low cost, durable, and multifunctional materials for ice release and erosion resistance. This National Science Foundation sponsored ice-release coating technology holds promise for protecting wind turbine blades and towers, thus potentially increasing reliability for power generation under icing conditions. Because of the vulnerability of wind turbine blades to ice buildup and erosion damages, wind farm facilities stand to reap considerable benefits.

TI  - Robustness against extinction by stochastic sex determination in small populations
VL  - 86
IS  - 4
AB  - Sexually reproducing populations with a small number of individuals may go extinct by stochastic fluctuations in sex determination, causing all their members to become male or female in a generation. In this work we calculate the time to extinction of isolated populations with fixed number N of individuals that are updated according to the Moran birth and death process. At each time step, one individual is randomly selected and replaced by its offspring resulting from mating with another individual of the opposite sex; the offspring can be male or female with equal probability. A set of N time steps is called a generation, the average time it takes for the entire population to be replaced. The number k of females fluctuates in time, similarly to a random walk, and extinction, which is the only asymptotic possibility, occurs when k = 0 or k = N. We show that it takes only one generation for an arbitrary initial distribution of males and females to approach the binomial distribution. This distribution, however, is unstable and the population eventually goes extinct in 2(N) / N generations. We also discuss the robustness of these results against bias in the determination of the sex of the offspring, a characteristic promoted by infection by the bacteria Wolbachia in some arthropod species or by temperature in reptiles.

TI  - Synthesis-Structure-Activity Relationship in Cu-MOR for Partial Methane Oxidation: Al Siting via Inorganic Structure-Directing Agents
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
SP  - 2166-2177
AB  - In the pursuit of controlling the propensity of Cu-mordenite (MOR) for the selective oxidation of CH4, we take a closer look at intrinsic zeolite parameters. Via synthesis design, we vary the relative proportion of Al situated near the 8-rings and 12-rings of MOR zeolite. This is accomplished using different Al sources impacting the local degree of silica dissolution and zeolite formation as evidenced by crystallization times and morphological differences. Interrogating the crystalline system with steric probe molecules in conjunction with spectroscopic techniques such as H-1 magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR, infrared spectroscopy, as well as temperature-programmed desorption confirms discrete changes of the Al within the unit cell. The subsequent copper exchange allows for the generation of Cu-MOR materials of different inclinations for the activation of methane in the stepwise formation of MeOH. Here, an increasing degree of acid sites in more easily accessible locations (e.g., 12-ring) correlates with increasing maximum productivity toward MeOH at moderate exchange degrees. X-ray absorption spectroscopy supports this notion, finding a higher concentration of self-reduction-resistant framework-associated Cu2+ species, previously established as the active sites in the selective oxidation of CH4.

TI  - When Is Habitat Limiting for Striped Bass? Three Decades of Testing the Temperature-Oxygen Squeeze Hypothesis
VL  - 80
SP  - 65-91
AB  - Striped bass Morone saxatilis, originally a coastal and estuarine species, has been introduced in reservoirs in the southeastern and western United States. Although such stocking established many successful fisheries, there were troublesome die-offs of adult striped bass (3-9 kg, generally >5 kg) in some waters, usually in late summer. In contrast, juveniles and small adults thrived. In response to these patterns, my students and I conducted several years of telemetry studies of adult striped bass, primarily in Cherokee and Watts Bar reservoirs, Tennessee, and laboratory studies of juvenile temperature selection. In 1985, I published the "temperature oxygen squeeze" hypothesis to explain mortalities of large fish on the basis of limited availability of cool (<25 degrees C), oxygenated (>2 mg/L) water in summer while juveniles successfully occupied a warmer thermal niche (>25 degrees C). We now have more than 20 years of research and management since 1985, primarily across the Southeast, in which the published hypothesis has, explicitly or not, been tested, generally confirmed, and applied to management. This retrospective paper reviews the studies our team conducted to develop and test the hypothesis and about 20 years of relevant studies by others that have added important nuances, addressed lingering issues, and turned a controversial idea into generally accepted understanding and management practice. Nonetheless, issues remain for understanding the effects of poor summer habitat on striped bass, such as why some studies show striped bass occupying warmer temperatures without mortalities and the role of prey availability in survival of fish obliged to occupy warm water. Other papers in this volume augment and extend the saga of progressively developing knowledge that this paper recalls of striped bass habitat requirements, thermal niche segregation by size (or age), and management constraints and opportunities.

TI  - Association between fatty acid signature and growth rate of larval Pacific bluefin tuna in two major spawning grounds
VL  - 689
SP  - 127-136
AB  - Fatty acid composition and total fatty acids of field-caught Pacific bluefin tuna (PBF) Thunnus orientalis larvae were investigated to identify relationships between spawning ground, physiological condition, and growth rate. Multivariate statistical analyses revealed that both growth rate and environmental conditions at spawning grounds were substantially associated with variations in fatty acid compositions. Fast-growing larvae typically contained more a-linolenic acid and 22:5n-3, which are important as metabolic precursors of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Larval PBF fatty acid compositions differed by spawning ground; larvae caught around the Nansei Islands contained more 15:0, 17:0, 19:0, and 22:5n-6, and less EPA and arachidonic acid (ARA) than those from the Sea of Japan. Differences in larval odd-numbered fatty acid compositions might indicate different degrees of dependence on microbial loop energy supply between spawning grounds. Environments subject to sudden changes, such as those in water temperature and prey density in the Sea of Japan, might cause variability in fatty acid profiles, including extremely low %DHA. We suggest that continuous food intake and subsequent fatty acid catabolism for energy generation would be needed to facilitate fast growth.

TI  - Selection on adaptive and maladaptive gene expression plasticity during thermal adaptation to urban heat islands
VL  - 12
IS  - 1
AB  - Phenotypic plasticity enables a single genotype to produce multiple phenotypes in response to environmental variation. Plasticity may play a critical role in the colonization of novel environments, but its role in adaptive evolution is controversial. Here we suggest that rapid parallel regulatory adaptation of Anolis lizards to urban heat islands is due primarily to selection for reduced and/or reversed heat-induced plasticity that is maladaptive in urban thermal conditions. We identify evidence for polygenic selection across genes of the skeletal muscle transcriptome associated with heat tolerance. Forest lizards raised in common garden conditions exhibit heat-induced changes in expression of these genes that largely correlate with decreased heat tolerance, consistent with maladaptive regulatory response to high-temperature environments. In contrast, urban lizards display reduced gene expression plasticity after heat challenge in common garden and a significant increase in gene expression change that is congruent with greater heat tolerance, a putatively adaptive state in warmer urban environments. Genes displaying maladaptive heat-induced plasticity repeatedly show greater genetic divergence between urban and forest habitats than those displaying adaptive plasticity. These results highlight the role of selection against maladaptive regulatory plasticity during rapid adaptive modification of complex systems in the wild. Anthropogenic change, such as urban heat islands, present challenges to biodiversity that can be overcome through phenotypic plasticity. Unlike their ancestral counterparts, urban lizards have fewer maladaptive gene expression responses to higher temperatures in a common garden experiment, suggesting the evolution of adaptive plasticity.

AB  - Nitrates are widely used as fertilizer and oxidizing agents. Commercial nitrate production from nitrogen involves high-temperature-high-pressure multi-step processes. Therefore, an alternative nitrate production method under ambient environment is of importance. Herein, an electrochemical nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) approach is developed to produce nitrate catalyzed by ZnFexCo2-xO4 spinel oxides. Theoretical and experimental results show Fe aids the formation of the first N-O bond on the *N site, while high oxidation state Co assists in stabilizing the absorbed OH- for the generation of the second and third N-O bonds. Owing to the concerted catalysis, the ZnFe0.4Co1.6O4 oxide demonstrates the highest nitrate production rate of 130 +/- 12 mu mol h(-1) g(MO)(-1) at an applied potential of 1.6 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).

AB  - Hatching from cysts and eggsacs of six successive generations of Heterodera cajani produced on cowpea during a single growing season in the glasshouse was compared in distilled water, soil leachate and host root diffusate from four week old plants. The majority of eggs in eggsacs hatched within 7 days in all treatments and there were no differences between generations. Hatch from cysts in all treatments was similar over the first four generations but the fifth and sixth generations, produced on senescing plants, showed a marked dependency on host root diffusate for hatch. The ratio of eggs in eggsacs to eggs in cysts decreased with each succeeding generation and a comparison between third and sixth generations indicated that, in the older generation, more lipid reserves are partitioned into the encysted J2 than into the J2 in eggsacs. The results are discussed in the context of the survival requirements of H. cajani in the absence of a host.

AB  - This review paper provides a perspective on residue generation, reasons for on-site burning of residue, its ill effects on soil properties, environment, soil biota, challenges faced by the farmers in managing a huge quantity of residue and various schemes, policies, and punishments undertaken by the government to curb the problem of on-site residue burning. Several studies show that crop residue burning in the field has a negative impact on soil organic carbon, soil fertility, soil microbes, and environment and also hinders the long-term sustainability of crop production. Crop residue is a good source of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur; on burning, these cause the loss of nutrients as CO, CO2, NO, particulate matter, and smoke, which are lost into the atmosphere, thereby creating the problem of air pollution and global warming, which will also pose threat to human health.

TI  - Novel hybrid CSP-biomass CHP for flexible generation: Thermo-economic analysis and profitability assessment
VL  - 204
SP  - 994-1006
AB  - This paper focuses on the thermo-economic analysis of a 2.1-MWe and 960 kWt hybrid solar-biomass combined heat and power (CHP) system composed of a 1.4-MWe Externally Fired Gas-Turbine (EFGT) and a 0.7-MWe bottoming Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power plant. The primary thermal energy input is provided by a hybrid Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) collector array covering a total ground area of 22,000-32,000 m(2), coupled to a biomass boiler. The CSP collector array is based on parabolic-trough concentrators (PTCs) with molten salts as the heat transfer fluid (HTF), upstream of a 4.5-9.1 MWt fluidized-bed furnace for direct biomass combustion. In addition, two molten-salt tanks are considered that provide 4.8-18 MWh (corresponding to 1.3-5.0 h) of Thermal Energy Storage (TES), as a means of reducing the variations in the plant's operating conditions, increasing the plant's capacity factor and total operating hours (from 5500-6000 to 8000 h per year). On the basis of the results of the thermodynamic simulations, upfront and operational costs assessments, and considering an Italian energy policy scenario (feed-in tariffs, or FiTs, for renewable electricity), the global energy conversion efficiency and investment profitability of this plant are estimated for different sizes of CSP and biomass furnaces, different operation strategies (baseload and modulating) and cogenerative vs. electricity-only system configurations. Upfront costs in the range 4.3-9.5 MEur are reported, with operating costs in the range 1.5-2.3 MEur annually. Levelized costs of energy from around 100 Eur/MWh to above 220 Eur/MWh are found, along with net present values (NPVs) from close to 13,000 to -3000 kEur and internal rates of return (IRRs) from 30% down to almost zero when prioritizing electrical power generation (i.e., not in cogenerative mode). In all cases the economic viability of the systems deteriorate for larger CSP section sizes. The results indicate the low economic profitability of CSP integration in comparison to biomass-only plants, due to high investment costs of the former, which are not compensated by the higher global energy conversion efficiency and energy sales revenues.

TI  - Model-data synthesis for the next generation of forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments
VL  - 209

SP  - 17-28
AB  - The first generation of forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments has successfully provided deeper understanding about how forests respond to an increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Located in aggrading stands in the temperate zone, they have provided a strong foundation for testing critical assumptions in terrestrial biosphere models that are being used to project future interactions between forest productivity and the atmosphere, despite the limited inference space of these experiments with regards to the range of global ecosystems. Now, a new generation of FACE experiments in mature forests in different biomes and over a wide range of climate space and biodiversity will significantly expand the inference space. These new experiments are: EucFACE in a mature Eucalyptus stand on highly weathered soil in subtropical Australia; AmazonFACE in a highly diverse, primary rainforest in Brazil; BIFoR-FACE in a 150-yr-old deciduous woodland stand in central England; and SwedFACE proposed in a hemiboreal, Pinus sylvestris stand in Sweden. We now have a unique opportunity to initiate a model-data interaction as an integral part of experimental design and to address a set of cross-site science questions on topics including responses of mature forests; interactions with temperature, water stress, and phosphorus limitation; and the influence of biodiversity.

TI  - Synthesis and Characterization of Eggshell-Derived Hydroxyapatite via Mechanochemical Method: A Comparative Study
VL  - 1835
AB  - The focus of bone graft properties has developed through generations, from the ability to withstand mechanical stress to the ability to integrate with the biological structure. In recent years, the use of hydroxyapatite (HA) as bone graft material in orthopedic and dental applications has been increasing. HA is a natural occuring mineral with excellent bioactivity but relatively poor mechanical properties. It constitutes 96% portion of enamel in teeth and 67% portion of bone. HA can be extracted from animal bones or fabricated from synthetic or biologic sources. In this study, eggshells were used as raw material to synthesize eggshell-derived HA (EHA) via mechanochemical method. The synthesis of EHA involved CaO, which was obtained from the calcination of eggshells, and reaction with dicalcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrous (DCPD) or phosphoric acid (H3PO4). The effects of rotational speed and heat treatment temperature on EHA's characteristics were investigated. The characterization studies were carried out by using the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). HA powder was successfully synthesized with crystallite and particle sizes in the range of 8-47 nm and 250-550 nm respectively. It was observed from this study that the increase of milling rotational speed had increased the phase purity of EHA samples. Furthermore, the higher heating temperature of HA samples resulted in higher degree of crystallinity of HA and the appearance of beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) as secondary phase.

TI  - Assessment of biomass and lipid productivity and biodiesel quality of an indigenous microalga Chlorella sorokiniana MIC-G5
VL  - 15
IS  - 1
SP  - 45-52
AB  - Generation of biodiesel from microalgae has been extensively investigated; however, its quality is often not suitable for use as fuel. Our investigation involved the evaluation of biodiesel quality using a native isolate Chlorella sorokiniana MIC-G5, as specified by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), after transesterification of lipids with methanol, in the presence of sodium methoxide. Total quantity of lipids extracted from dry biomass, of approximately 410-450 mg g(-1) was characterized using FTIR and H-1 NMR. After transesterification, the total saturated and unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were 43% and 57%, respectively. The major FAMEs present in the biodiesel were methyl palmitate (C16:0), methyl oleate (C18:1), and methyl linoleate (C18:2), and the H-1 NMR spectra matched with criteria prescribed for high-quality biodiesel. The biodiesel exhibited a density of 0.873 g cm(-3), viscosity of 3.418 mm(2) s(-1), cetane number (CN) of 57.85, high heating value (HHV) of 40.25, iodine value of 71.823 g I-2 100 g(-1), degree of unsaturation (DU) of 58%, and a cold filter plugging point (CFPP) of -5.22 degrees C. Critical fuel parameters, including oxidation stability, CN, HHV, iodine value, flash point, cloud point, pour point, density, and viscosity were in accordance with the methyl ester composition and structural configuration. Hence, C. sorokiniana can be a promising feedstock for biodiesel generation.

TI  - The impacts of maternal stress on worker phenotypes in the honey bee
VL  - 50
IS  - 5
SP  - 704-719
AB  - Maternal stress is a common source of heritable health and behavioral variation. This type of maternal effect could be particularly important for honey bees (Apis mellifera), as a single queen is responsible for many generations of workers who perform all colony functions including raising subsequent worker generations. Multiple factors work synergistically to cause colony loss, but a role for maternal stress effects is unstudied. We used an artificial cold temperature treatment as a proof-of-concept approach to investigate whether acute queen stress causes changes in worker phenotypes, including egg hatching rate, development time, and adult behavior and immune function. We found that queen stress impacts early-life phenotypes (egg hatching and development time), with more limited impacts on adult phenotypes (behavior and immune function). Thus, if maternal stress impacts colony health, it is likely through cumulative impacts on worker population numbers, not through phenotypic effects that impact individual adult worker behavior or health resilience. This study addresses an important and overlooked question, and provides a baseline understanding of the likely impacts of queen stress on worker phenotypes.

SP  - 798-808
AB  - Liquid metals have been used in various applications in nuclear systems. Lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) is foreseen as a coolant and target for neutron generation in accelerator-driven systems (ADS), whereas pure lead will be used as coolant in Gen IV-type lead-cooled fast reactors (LFR). The advantage of heavy liquid metal alloys is their high thermal conductivity and their relative safety in case of an accident. A major problem in non-isothermal systems is the corrosion of their structural components. consisting mainly of ferritic/martensitic and austenitic stainless steels, since the solubility of dissolved elements depends strongly on temperature. The formation of oxide scales on structural components is considered a viable approach to limiting the corrosion rates. To maintain a specific oxygen content in lead or LBE. an oxygen control system (OCS) is crucial. This requires continuous measurement of the oxygen activity in the liquid metal by means of electrochemical sensors. It must be assured that no oxides of the liquid metal itself are formed; otherwise, the system can be blocked. Therefore. this paper addresses the development of oxygen sensors for corrosion control of martensitic and austenitic steels in a lead-bismuth eutectic system at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany).

TI  - The study of Salmonella enteritidis growth kinetics using rapid automated bacterial impedance technique
VL  - 84
IS  - 6
SP  - 945-949
AB  - In order to study strain-specific differences in their growth behaviour at different, and particularly lower, temperatures, generation times for 45 strains of Salmonella enteritidis isolated from food were determined impedimetrically over a temperature range from 7 to 42 degrees C. In practical terms, 7 degrees C is the minimum requirement for Salm. enteritidis growth, and generation time variability increases markedly as this temperature is reached. Reports in the literature describing psychrotrophic behaviour and multiplication at lower temperatures cannot be confirmed. Generation time variability increased as temperature moved away from the optimal range with variation coefficients tending to rise as temperature fell. The great variability of multiplication parameters near the growth limit found in Salm. enteritidis may also be a characteristic of other bacterial species. It is therefore imperative to commence studies on larger numbers of strains to allow prediction of their behaviour at lower temperatures.

VL  - 70

SP  - 2255-2263
AB  - In the present paper, a new attitude has been proposed for optimization of the separation efficiency (SE) and the Gaudin's selectivity index (SI) in a flotation process by Hybrid artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA). The chemical reagent's dosage (collector, frother and fuel oil), pH, solid percentage, feed rate, Cu, Mo, and Fe grades in the flotation feed were selected as input variables and the SE-Cu and SI-Mo and SI-Fe were selected as output ones. Multilayer NN with back propagation (BP) algorithm was trained by the standard Bayesian regulation algorithm in which the validation data set did not required to be apart from its training. This algorithm with four-layer was used to relate output and input variables. Employment of Hybrid GA-ANN method resulted in significant improvement on GA fitnesses, as SE-Cu = 88, SI-Mo = 4.47 and SI of Fe = 12.85 were achieved. The input parameters corresponding to the fitnesses were as follows: pH = 12.25; the grade of Cu = 0.55%, Mo = 0.04% and Fe = 5.53%; the collector, frother and fuel-oil concentrations being 16.55, 15.54 and 2.71 (g/ton), respectively; the solid percentage was 25.84% and feed rate was 38,380 ton/day. The best fitness of GA was obtained after 10 generations by MSE value of 2.23.

TI  - Potential of deterministic and geostatistical rainfall interpolation under high rainfall variability and dry spells: case of Kenya's Central Highlands
VL  - 124
IS  - 1
SP  - 349-364
AB  - Drier parts of Kenya's Central Highlands endure persistent crop failure and declining agricultural productivity. These have, in part, attributed to high temperatures, prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall. Understanding spatial-temporal variability of climatic indices such as rainfall at seasonal level is critical for optimal rain-fed agricultural productivity and natural resource management in the study area. However, the predominant setbacks in analysing hydro-meteorological events are occasioned by either lack, inadequate, or inconsistent meteorological data. Like in most other places, the sole sources of climatic data in the study region are scarce and only limited to single stations, yet with persistent missing/unrecorded data making their utilization a challenge. This study examined seasonal anomalies and variability in rainfall, drought occurrence and the efficacy of interpolation techniques in the drier regions of eastern Kenyan. Rainfall data from five stations (Machang'a, Kiritiri, Kiambere and Kindaruma and Embu) were sourced from both the Kenya Meteorology Department and on-site primary recording. Owing to some experimental work ongoing, automated recording for primary dailies in Machang'a have been ongoing since the year 2000 to date; thus, Machang'a was treated as reference (for period of record) station for selection of other stations in the region. The other stations had data sets of over 15 years with missing data of less than 10 % as required by the world meteorological organization whose quality check is subject to the Centre for Climate Systems Modeling (C2SM) through MeteoSwiss and EMPA bodies. The dailies were also subjected to homogeneity testing to evaluate whether they came from the same population. Rainfall anomaly index, coefficients of variance and probability were utilized in the analyses of rainfall variability. Spline, kriging and inverse distance weighting interpolation techniques were assessed using daily rainfall data and digital elevation model in ArcGIS environment. Validation of the selected interpolation methods were based on goodness of fit between gauged (observed) and generated rainfall derived from residual errors statistics, coefficient of determination (R (2)), mean absolute errors (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) statistics. Analyses showed 90 % chance of below cropping-threshold rainfall (500 mm) exceeding 258.1 mm during short rains in Embu for 1 year return period. Rainfall variability was found to be high in seasonal amounts (e.g. coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.56, 0.47, 0.59) and in number of rainy days (e.g. CV = 0.88, 0.53) in Machang'a and Kiritiri, respectively. Monthly rainfall variability was found to be equally high during April and November (e.g. CV = 0.48, 0.49 and 0.76) with high probabilities (0.67) of droughts exceeding 15 days in Machang'a. Dry spell probabilities within growing months were high, e.g. 81 and 60 % in Machang'a and Embu, respectively. Kriging interpolation method emerged as the most appropriate geostatistical interpolation technique suitable for spatial rainfall maps generation for the study region.

TI  - Customized Photothermal Therapy of Subcutaneous Orthotopic Cancer by Multichannel Luminescent Nanocomposites
VL  - 33
IS  - 30
AB  - Photothermal therapy (PTT) is a potentially advanced strategy for highly precise cancer treatment. Tumor-microenvironment-activatable agents provide useful tools for PTT, but their photothermal conversion capacities vary and cannot be evaluated in vivo; thus, a general PTT prescription does not work with individual activatable agents. Here, glutathione (GSH)-activatable nanocomposites, silicomolybdate-functionalized NaLuF4:Yb,Er@NaLuF4@NaLuF4:Nd are prepared, for customized PTT of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer. By simultaneously determining intratumoral GSH concentration and the amount of accumulated agent using multiple orthogonal luminescent emissions of nanocomposites, near-infrared absorbance of photothermal conversion agents is evaluated in vivo, based on the optimized irradiating prescriptions (irradiating power density and time) established. This allows customized PTT of each individual case with high efficacy and viability. This work also includes a method for investigating individual intratumoral variation, and the development of the next generation of customized nanomedicine for efficacious PTT of subcutaneous orthotopic cancer.

TI  - Comparative transcriptome profiling of heat stress response of the mangrove crab Scylla serrata across sites of varying climate profiles
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
AB  - BackgroundThe fishery and aquaculture of the widely distributed mangrove crab Scylla serrata is a steadily growing, high-value, global industry. Climate change poses a risk to this industry as temperature elevations are expected to threaten the mangrove crab habitat and the supply of mangrove crab juveniles from the wild. It is therefore important to understand the genomic and molecular basis of how mangrove crab populations from sites with different climate profiles respond to heat stress. Towards this, we performed RNA-seq on the gill tissue of S. serrata individuals sampled from 3 sites (Cagayan, Bicol, and Bataan) in the Philippines, under normal and heat-stressed conditions. To compare the transcriptome expression profiles, we designed a 2-factor generalized linear model containing interaction terms, which allowed us to simultaneously analyze within-site response to heat-stress and across-site differences in the response.ResultsWe present the first ever transcriptome assembly of S. serrata obtained from a data set containing 66 Gbases of cleaned RNA-seq reads. With lowly-expressed and short contigs excluded, the assembly contains roughly 17,000 genes with an N50 length of 2,366 bp. Our assembly contains many almost full-length transcripts - 5229 shrimp and 3049 fruit fly proteins have alignments that cover >80% of their sequence lengths to a contig. Differential expression analysis found population-specific differences in heat-stress response. Within-site analysis of heat-stress response showed 177, 755, and 221 differentially expressed (DE) genes in the Cagayan, Bataan, and Bicol group, respectively. Across-site analysis showed that between Cagayan and Bataan, there were 389 genes associated with 48 signaling and stress-response pathways, for which there was an effect of site in the response to heat; and between Cagayan and Bicol, there were 101 such genes affecting 8 pathways.ConclusionIn light of previous work on climate profiling and on population genetics of marine species in the Philippines, our findings suggest that the variation in thermal response among populations might be derived from acclimatory plasticity due to pre-exposure to extreme temperature variations or from population structure shaped by connectivity which leads to adaptive genetic differences among populations.

VL  - 290
SP  - 12-22
AB  - Although more than sixty hot springs have been reported in West Malaysia, their geochemistry, geothermometry and utilization as a potential energy source have not been considered yet. This study reports the geochemistry, geothermometry and mineral saturation indices of a number of hot springs in West Malaysia. The potential of these hot springs as a source of geothermal energy as well as their origin and possible mixing with surface cold waters have been discussed. Surface temperatures of the studied hot springs range from 41 to 99 degrees C and pH values vary between 5.5 and 9. Geochemical data showed that among cations, Si, Na, Ca and K occur in relatively high contents, while Mg and Fe show very low concentrations. On the other hand, HCO3 is present in relatively high concentration compared to other anions (SO4, Cl and F). Data also illustrated that most of the studied hot springs are K-Na-bicarbonate rich waters although they represent different geological provenances in West Malaysia reflecting homogeneity in the geological formations and/or hydrochemical processes governing the characteristics of these waters. This homogeneity also indicates the insignificant effect of local geology on the chemistry of the studied hot springs. Saturation indices calculations of the studied thermal waters indicate that most of the secondary mineral phases such as goethite and hematite are apparently supersaturated while quartz and chalcedony are saturated. Conversely, amorphous silica is slightly under-saturated. These results suggest similar rock-water interactions for both geothermal and non-geothermal waters. The geological settings of the studied hot springs either in or close to granitic masses or along the major fault or shear zones as well as the Na-bicarbonate nature of the waters and low sulfate concentrations suggest their non-volcanic origin. They are also similar in their geological setting and water chemistry to other non-volcanic hot springs in other parts of the world. However, the possible mixing of the original hot waters with near surface cold water is evident from the clear disagreement between the silica and cation geothermometers as well as the disequilibrium with their associated host rocks as indicated from the plot of studied hot springs in the Na-K-Mg ternary diagram and saturation indices calculations. Quartz geothermometers gave equilibrium temperatures ranging from 93 degrees C in the Ayer Hangat hot spring to 154 degrees C in the Lojing hot spring. This requires 398 to 649 kJ/kg energy to heat the water suggesting an intermediate enthalpy. These results also pointed out that some of the studied hot springs have potential to generate adequate heat, which could be harnessed for energy generation upon further work to prove their viability.

TI  - Comparative investigation of double slope solar still by incorporating different types of collectors: A mini review
VL  - 38
SP  - 300-304
AB  - The fresh water scarcity is the contemporary issue for all areas around the globe due to available water getting polluted by various anthropogenic activities. The conventional Reverse osmosis (RO) system for purification of water needs electricity for its working and generation of electricity by conventional source emits polluting elements which is detrimental for the environment. Unlike conventional RO system, solar based water purification system called solar still is environment friendly and has the potential to mitigate the contemporary issue of fresh water scarcity. Various designs and material selection has been reported by researchers around the globe. In this review work, an effort by authors have been put to summarize double slope solar based water purification units by incorporating different kinds of collectors. After studying different solar based double slope water purification units, a comparison has been made on the basis of yield. It has been concluded that solar based double slope water purification unit incorporated with evacuated tubular collectors is better than other similar setups. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Infection pattern and negative effects of a facultative endosymbiont on its insect host are environment-dependent
VL  - 9
AB  - Regiella insecticola is a bacterial endosymbiont in insects that exhibits a negative effect on the fitness of hosts. Thus, it is not clear why this costly endosymbiont can persist in host populations. Here, we tested a hypothesis that the infection pattern and negative roles of the endosymbiont were not constant but environmentally dependent. The grain aphids Sitobion avenae, belonging to different genotypes and infected with Regiella or not, were used in this study. We found that S. avenae populations were infected with Regiella, Hamiltonella defensa, Serratia symbiotica and Rickettsia. The predominant endosymbionts in the aphid populations varied with season. Serratia and Rickettsia were predominant from December to February while Regiella predominated from March to May. The vertical transmission of Regiella was poorer at high temperature, but following conditioning for seven generations, the transmission rate improved. Regiella inhibited the production of winged aphids at 25 degrees C, but it did not affect winged morph production at the higher temperatures of 28 degrees C and 31 degrees C. Regiella infection decreased the intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) of aphids at 25 degrees C and 28 degrees C. However, at 31 degrees C, the effect of Regiella on the r(m) varied depending on the aphid genotype and density. Thus, the negative effects of this endosymbiont on its host were environmentally dependent.

TI  - Evidence of Local Adaptation in the Demographic Response of American Ginseng to Interannual Temperature Variation
VL  - 25
IS  - 5
SP  - 922-931
AB  - Bioclimatic envelope models of species' responses to climate change are used to predict how species will respond to increasing temperatures. These models are frequently based on the assumption that the northern and southern boundaries of a species' range define its thermal niche. However, this assumption may be violated if populations are adapted to local temperature regimes and have evolved population-specific thermal optima. Considering the prevalence of local adaptation, the assumption of a species-wide thermal optimum may be violated for many species. We used spatially and temporally extensive demographic data for American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) to examine range-wide variation in response of population growth rate (.) to climatic factors. Our results suggest adaptation to local temperature, but not precipitation. For each population,. was maximized when annual temperatures were similar to site-specific, long-term mean temperatures. Populations from disparate climatic zones responded differently to temperature variation, and there was a linear relation between population-level thermal optima and the 30-year mean temperature at each site. For species that are locally adapted to temperature, bioclimatic envelope models may underestimate the extent to which increasing temperatures will decrease population growth rate. Because any directional change from long-term mean temperatures will decrease population growth rates, all populations throughout a species' range will be adversely affected by temperature increase, not just populations at southern and low-elevation boundaries. Additionally, when a species' local thermal niche is narrower than its range-wide thermal niche, a smaller temperature increase than would be predicted by bioclimatic envelope approaches may be sufficient to decrease population growth.

TI  - Two-seasonal thermal analyzes of systems with a vapor compressor heat pump and horizontal ground heat exchangers
VL  - 94
IS  - 2
AB  - Selected results of thermal analyzes of heating systems with vapor compressor heat pumps and horizontal ground heat exchangers are presented in this paper. Operation of this system for two lengths of heat exchanger pipes was considered and compared. The thermal analyzes concern two consecutive heating seasons. During heating seasons the heat pump works periodically, supplying heat to a small residential house. Heat is also periodically transferred from the ground to the heat pump unit. The demand for heat for this house, variable in time, was calculated. The heat pump is supported by an additional, conventional heat source when heat pump productivity is insufficient. The characteristic operating parameters of this system (among others: characteristic temperatures, heat fluxes, electric driving power of the compressor) are variable in time. The thermal state of the ground is also variable in time. Natural, thermal regeneration of the ground during spring and summer, when the heat pump system does not operate, was taken into account. The thermal analyzes of the system enable one to compare the electric energy consumption in the system: heat pump-ground heat exchanger and energy transferred from the additional heat source to the heated space during the first and the second heating seasons. The results presented in this paper also make it possible to determine the influence of the length of the horizontal ground heat exchanger pipes on the functioning parameters of this system during two-seasonal operation.

TI  - Gel-Emulsion-Templated Polymeric Aerogels for Water Treatment by Organic Liquid Removal and Solar Vapor Generation
VL  - 13
IS  - 4
SP  - 749-755
AB  - The importance of water cannot be overstated. It is the most important natural resource for our survival and development. The development of suitable materials for efficient water purification will provide a critical contribution for sustainable water use. In this context, a gel-emulsion-templated synthesis of a polymeric aerogel has been developed for water treatment. Owing to its hydrophobic nature, the aerogel shows high sorption (nearly 20 times its weight) for organic liquids, such as toluene, phenol, and nitrobenzene, and can be used to remove them from water. The aerogel shows low thermal conductivity (0.032 W m(-1) K-1) and excellent light absorption efficiency (>92 %) after carbonization, which provides the possibility for the construction of an interfacial solar vapor generation system. The as-prepared materials are used to develop a two-step approach to remove both organic and inorganic contaminants (salts) from water. Importantly, the aerogel shows excellent reusability and high efficiency both for oil sorption and for solar vapor generation. Moreover, the low cost and easy scale-up of the preparation process lay a solid foundation for practical application. It is anticipated that the prepared aerogels would contribute not only to water purification but also to other related areas.

VL  - 13
IS  - 5
SP  - 397-405
AB  - Growth and survival of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) were studied in tryptic soy broth (TSB), brain-heart infusion (BHI), and whole milk at 12, 9.5, 8.5, 7.5, 6.5, and 5.5 degrees C (+/-0.2 degrees C). Colony forming units (cfu) were enumerated by surface plating on eosin methylene blue (EMB) agar plates and incubating at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Growth curves were plotted and lag and generation times were determined. Results indicated that the average generation times for each strain was similar in each medium (4.6+/-0.9 h) at 12 degrees C. However, at 9.5 degrees C the average generation time differed significantly among the media (P<0.05). The average generation time was longer in BHI compared to TSB and whole milk at 9.5 degrees C (14 h in BHI vs 11 h in milk and TSB). Also, the generation time of individual strains in BHI varied from 9.5-22 h at 9.5 degrees C. Decrease of temperature to 8.5 degrees C resulted in lack of growth of two strains in BHI. At 7.5 degrees C none of the strains grew in BHI, one grew in TSB, whereas all grew in milk. A further decrease of temperature to 6.5 degrees C did not allow growth of any of the strains in TSB or BHI whereas all grew in milk. Addition of 5% lactose to TSB and BHI enabled survival and growth of all strains at 6.5 degrees C. The results of this study demonstrate the influence of growth medium composition on the minimum growth temperature of verotoxigenic E. coli. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

TI  - The Effects of Iron-Bearing Intermetallics on the Fitness-for-Service Performance of a Rare-Earth-Modified A356 Alloy for Next Generation Automotive Powertrains
VL  - 11
IS  - 5
AB  - Aimed at improving the tensile strength and creep resistance of a rare earth-modified A356 alloy, this study adjusted the Mg and Mn concentration in the alloy, specifically aiming to transform the harmful Al5FeSi and Al9FeSi3Mg5 phase into Al-15(Fe,Mn)(3)Si-2. It was found that lowering the Mg concentration from 0.49 to 0.25 wt.% and raising the Mn concentration from 0.10 to 0.41 wt.% resulted in a near complete transformation of the Fe-bearing phases. This transformation led to a greater total volume fraction of Fe-intermetallics (2.9 to 4.1%), without affecting the volume fraction of the desirable, temperature-resistant, AlSiRE phase. Moreover, the chemistry modification led to a shift in the morphology of the AlSiRE phase while reducing its size. Combined with the decreased volume fraction of the harmful Fe precipitates, the chemistry modification improved the yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and modulus of elasticity by similar to 14%, 9%, and 10%, respectively. In addition, the steady-state creep rates of the high Mn alloy were lower at all stresses as compared to the low Mn alloy and the fracture stress was similar to 15 MPa higher, reaching 100% of the alloy's original 250 degrees C YS.

TI  - Developmental responses to pond desiccation in tadpoles of the British anuran amphibians (Bufo bufo, B-calamita and Rana temporaria)
VL  - 252
SP  - 61-69
AB  - Tadpole development was compared in three amphibian species (Bufo calamita, B. bufo and Rana temporaria) that suffer different risks of pond desiccation in nature. Using a replicated pond system, development was monitored in desiccating and non-desiccating ponds, and in vertical-sided and gently shelving ('shoreline') ponds. In desiccating ponds, tadpoles suffered from crowding effects and metamorphosed at a smaller size, but development was not accelerated in response to desiccation in any of the three species. Desiccating ponds had higher maximum temperatures but also lower minimum temperatures, which may explain the lack of ally difference in development time between desiccating and non-desiccating ponds. Although shoreline ponds were slightly warmer than vertical-sided ponds, development under these conditions was also consistent with a crowding, rather than a temperature, effect. In shoreline ponds, metamorphosis generally took longer, was less synchronized between individuals, and resulted in a smaller size at metamorphosis, compared to development in vertical-sided ponds. The lack of species-by-desiccation interactions indicated that there were no differences between the three species in developmental plasticity. Developmental constraints may place a limit on the degree of plasticity that can evolve in a species such as B, calamita, which breeds only in ephemeral ponds with a variable hydroperiod. Alternatively, low genetic variability within British populations of B. calamita may have cont;trained the evolution of adaptive plasticity in this species.

VL  - 182
IS  - 18
SP  - 5231-5237
AB  - Elevation of active sigma(E) levels in Escherichia coli by either repressing the expression of rseA encoding an anti-sigma(E) factor or cloning rpoE in a multicopy plasmid, led to a large decrease in the number of dead cells and the accumulation of cellular proteins in the medium in the stationary phase. The numbers of CFU, however, were nearly the same as those of the wild type or cells devoid of the cloned gene. In the wild-type cells, rpoE expression was increased in the stationary phase and a low-level release of intracellular proteins was observed. These results suggest that dead fell lysis in stationary-phase E. coli occurs in a sigma(E)-dependent fashion. We propose there is a novel physiological function of the sigma(E) regulon that may guarantee cell survival in prolonged stationary phase by providing nutrients from dead cells for the next generation.

TI  - Anaerobic digestion for methane generation and ammonia reforming for hydrogen production: A thermodynamic energy balance of a model system to demonstrate net energy feasibility
VL  - 56
SP  - 493-505
AB  - During anaerobic digestion, organic matter is converted to carbon dioxide and methane, and organic nitrogen is converted to ammonia. Generally, ammonia is recycled as a fertilizer or removed via nitrification-denitrification in treatment systems; alternatively it could be recovered and catalytically converted to hydrogen, thus supplying additional fuel. To provide a basis for further investigation, a theoretical energy balance for a model system that incorporates anaerobic digestion, ammonia separation and recovery, and conversion of the ammonia to hydrogen is reported. The model Anaerobic Digestion-Bioammonia to Hydrogen (ADBH) system energy demands including heating, pumping, mixing, and ammonia reforming were subtracted from the total energy output from methane and hydrogen to create an overall energy balance. The energy balance was examined for the ADBH system operating with a fixed feedstock loading rate with C:N ratios (gC/gN) ranging from 136 to 3 which imposed corresponding total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentrations of 20-10,000 mg/L. Normalizing total energy potential to the methane potential alone indicated that at a C:N ratio of 17, the energy output was greater for the ADBH system than from anaerobic digestion generating only methane. Decreasing the C:N ratio increased the methane content of the biogas comprising primarily methane to >80% and increased the ammonia stripping energy demand. The system required 23-34% of the total energy generated as parasitic losses with no energy integration, but when internally produced heat and pressure differentials were recovered, parasitic losses were reduced to between 8 and 17%.

TI  - Sulphate radical generation through interaction of peroxymonosulphate with Co(II) for in-line sample preparation aiming at spectrophotometric flow-based determination of phosphate and phosphite in fertilizers
VL  - 158
SP  - 270-275
AB  - An advanced oxidative process relying on the interaction of peroxymonosulphate and cobalt(II) was implemented for generating the sulphate radicals in flow analysis, in order to accomplish in-line sample preparation thus improving the spectrophotometric determination of phosphate and phosphite in liquid foliar fertilizers. To this end, a flow-batch system with a heated chamber was designed. The sample was handled twice, with and without the step of phosphite oxidation to phosphate, and the formed orthophosphate was quantified after interaction with the vanadate-molybdate reagent. Phosphite was determined as the difference in analytical signals corresponding to sample handling with and without the oxidation step. Influence of Co(II) on the peroxymonosulphate activation, reagent concentrations and added volumes, acidity, temperature and heating time were investigated like aiming at to improve analytical recovery and measurement repeatability, as well as the and system ruggedness. The 6.6-20.0 mg L-1 P2O5 standards were in-line prepared from a single stock solution. Detection limits were estimated as 0.8 and 0.1 mg L-1 for P2O5 and P-PO4. Twenty-four samples are were run per hour, and results are were in agreement with those obtained by the official procedure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Suitability of Jatropha seed shells as fuel for small-scale combustion units
VL  - 51
SP  - 46-52
AB  - Increasing use of deshelled Jatropha seeds will result in a rising amount of seed shells as processing residues. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the physical and chemical properties of Jatropha seed shell and ashes as well as the development and testing of a robust and functional combustion unit for the thermal use those residual materials. Analyses of physical and chemical properties of jatropha seed shell and ash were done according to standard methods and compared to rice husk and pinewood. The combustion of Jatropha seed shell for heat generation is well accomplishable without previous processing of seed shell such as pelletizing or briquetting. Thermal power was between 11.1 kW and 36.7 kW corresponding to a feeding rate of Jatropha seed shells between 2.9 kg/h and 9.0 kg/h with furnace efficiency of 87% and 91%. Ash melting and slag creation on the grate as well as clogging of the combustion air supply holes, by sintering ash on the grate was not observed. The concentrations of CO in the flue gas was 2.8 +/- 0.8 g/m(3) and therefore lower than threshold value with 4 g/m(3) for CO emission for combustion of wood according to German legal requirements for combustion units up to 50 kW. Coarse ashes are suitable for application as fertilizer in agriculture due to their high contents of the major plant nutrients. However, attention has to be paid to the content of heavy metals, which has to be reduced by suitable methods. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SP  - 567-581
AB  - This paper outlines the development of a 2-D axisymmetnic mathematical model to predict the evolution of temperature during the Direct Chill (DC) casting of AZ31 magnesium billets. Model predictions of temperature have been compared to measurements made on an industrial DC casting machine at Timminco Ltd. in Haley, Ontario. These measurements have been used to fine-tune the thermal boundary conditions employed in the mathematical model. The model, which is based on the commercial finite-element code ABAQUS, has been developed as part of a strategic project aimed at improving the DC casting process for light metals through a reduction in casting related defects and increased productivity.

VL  - 44

SP  - 218-226
AB  - White peach scale (Pseudaulacaspis pentagona) is a polyphagous pest of perennial horticulture in Asia and many other warmtemperate and tropical regions. In China, it is a serious pest of kiwifruit. The optimal time to control P. pentagona field populations is at the first instar stage of the first, spring generation. Three methods for predicting the hatching of eggs of the first generation from field populations were tested on kiwifruit in Sichuan, based upon the accumulation of heat units (day-degrees) above a developmental threshold, calculated as 10.75 degrees C. A method developed for P. pentagona control in tea in Japan gave excellent predictions of 50% hatching in 5 of the 6 years under study (2009-2014). The other two methods also gave acceptable predictions of dates of 50% egg hatching (within 5 days of field observed dates). These models may be used as a basis for forecasting spring insecticide application dates targeting the first instar stage (crawlers and settled 'white caps').

VL  - 72
IS  - 6
SP  - 926-937
AB  - Species' thermal limits play a key role in determining spatial distributions and understanding their response to changing environments. Manipulation of thermal habitat is a potential avenue of exploration for management of invasive species such as the cold-water rainbow smelt(Osmerus mordax), which has adverse effects on native fish communities in central North American inland lakes. In an effort to test the thermal limits and selectively eradicate rainbow smelt, we experimentally mixed Crystal Lake, Wisconsin, USA, during summer of 2012 and 2013 to warm the hypolimnion and eliminate cold-water habitat. This whole-ecosystem manipulation allowed for field testing of published thermal thresholds reported for rainbow smelt. The rainbow smelt population responded to the thermal manipulation by exhibiting unexpected shifts in behavior, intrapopulation divergence in body condition, and significant population declines. Small individuals of each adult age-class tended to survive the manipulation, and the population persisted despite high mortality rates. Our results indicate a high degree of size-based intrapopulation variation in thermal sensitivity for this species. Our findings also raise questions regarding applicability of lab-and model-derived thermal limits to field scenarios, highlighting a need for further field evaluations of species' thermal limits.

TI  - Placement and reflow of solder balls for FC, BGA, wafer-level-CSP, optoelectronic components and MEMS by using a new solder jetting method
VL  - 4931
SP  - 145-150
AB  - Today the requirements for the packaging of optoelectronics and MEMS devices can no longer be met with standard flux-based processes which use a long temperature reflow profile and are implementing a lot of mechanical handling steps and processes. Basically, the packaging of these new devices requires fluxless soldering, no thermal stress by localized heating, low respectively no mechanical contact and damage on sensitive membranes in MEMS or optical components (like lenses, etc.). Some of these applications even require 3D-packaging and selective solder application in 3D-structures, like cavity, vertical assembly, etc. An additional, very challenging requirement is a high flexibility in solder alloys because eutectic SnPb and other lead-based solder alloys are not applicable. Instead AuSn and Indium,based solder alloys are required. In order to fulfill the specific needs in these applications, a new laser-based solder jetting technology has been developed. This technology fulfills all the needs of fluxless soldering, local heating and reflow, no mechanical contact and stress during soldering, high solder alloy flexibility and capability of 3D-packaging. Prior to developing the Solder Ball Bumper Jet (SB2-Jet) process, many potential applications have been elaborated using the Solder Ball Bumping (SB2)-technology. The advantage of SB2-Jet is basically the higher throughput which the jet process. With a throughput of 10 balls/s, it fulfills most of the requirements for today's packaging of optoelectronics and MEMS devices in production. A further increase in speed to 20 and 30 balls/s is in progress for the next generation. An additional feature of the SB2-and SB2-Jet-technology is the repair option and repair capability. This permits individual removal and replacement of solder balls and solder contacts and allows to increase the yield and productivity of cost-intensive high end devices.

VL  - 711
AB  - Despite the fact that cold weather has been widely documented as a major factor that can elevate the mortality in a subtropical population due to a lack of adaptability, the disastrous impacts from a major cold event in East Asia caused by a super El Nino event in January 2016 have passed largely unreported. In order to minimize the catastrophic risk from such events given ongoing concerns about climate change, as also noted in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (SFDRR), it is important to evaluate the individual- and community-level shifts in mortality patterns during such cold waves, in order to develop health protocols for surveillance and disaster planning. This study evaluated the impacts of the 2016 cold wave on mortality patterns in Hong Kong because this city has been highlighted as a city with severe negative impacts from the disaster by social media. Based on a sensitivity analysis, we found significantly higher daily mortality for up to ten weeks during this cold wave compared to the same calendar days between 2007 and 2015. We also found that the short-term impact of the cold wave was prolonged and fatal, with the potential to increase the mortality across the city for up to five weeks compared to the pre-disaster period. An examination of the individual- and community-level shifts in mortality patterns reveals that the unmarried and economically inactive were most vulnerable during the 2016 cold wave, and respiratory diseases were the greatest medical problems, while age and gender effects as well as cardiovascular diseases did not enhance the fatal effect. The excessive mortality was citywide, and not limited to particular locations or specific characteristics of a community within the city. Based on the results, disaster education as well as social and health services should be provided to all local people for an extended period in order to minimize the fatal and prolonged effects of future cold waves.

TI  - Practical Potential of Reverse Electrodialysis As Process for Sustainable Energy Generation
VL  - 43
IS  - 17
SP  - 6888-6894
AB  - Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a nonpolluting sustainable technology that converts the free energy of mixing of two solutions with different salinity directly into electrical energy. Although the theoretical potential is high, the practical power output obtained is limited yet due to concentration polarization phenomena and spacer shadow effects. In this work we combine theoretical calculations with direct current and alternating current experimental stack characterization methods to quantify the contribution of concentration polarization phenomena, spacer shadow effects and stack resistance in RED under different hydrodynamic conditions in a temperature range from 10 to 40 degrees C to show the practical potential of RED. Concentration polarization phenomena play an important role and their influence can be minimized by optimal stack hydrodynamics. Improved spacer designs and new spacer concepts offer extensive room to reduce the spacer shadow effect and to further increase the practical power output Improvement of hydrodynamics and reduction of the spacer shadow effect directly result in a significant increase in power output of the RED process, and values almost double the values currently obtained can be realized, which brings RED close to economical viability.

TI  - Advanced remote-sensing imaging emission spectrometer (ARIES): An instrument concept for a next-generation imager/sounder
VL  - 6744
AB  - It is now possible to combine high spectral resolution observations (like AIRS) with moderate spatial resolution (like MODIS) in a single instrument. The ARIES instrument concept provides over 3000 spectral channels in the 0.4-15.4 pm spectral region with spatial resolution of 1.0 km while still scanning +/- 55 degrees. The ARIES has size and mass less than half that of AIRS or MODIS primarily due to the advancements in focal plane assemblies and wide field optical systems developed under the NASA IIP and in US industry. The combined capability will allow more cloud free observations per unit area, and improve the overall cloud-clearing approach applied on AIRS. It will also improve sensitivity to atmospheric water vapor, temperature and trace gases in the boundary layer and facilitate studies of surface and atmospheric interaction for global climate studies. Improvements are expected in regional weather forecasts and hurricane prediction. This paper discusses the primary requirements for ARIES, the expected science and operational benefits and an instrument concept that demonstrates the viability and low risk of the approach.

VL  - 83

AB  - We study optimal subsidies for renewable energy (RE) generation to internalize external benefits from inter-temporal learning-by-doing spillovers, taking into account increasing marginal costs at the industry level due to limited availability of sites suitable for RE. We find that the optimal RE subsidy is differentiated according to productivity and derive a condition on production and spillovers under which less efficient, i.e. more costly, technologies should receive higher support, as common in actual policy-making. We show that such a support of technological diversification is optimal if (i) productive sites are scarce, which limits future utilization of knowledge and if (ii) technologies mature rapidly with little further scope for learning. Prima facie evidence for these elasticities for Germany, Denmark and UK suggests that support for technology diversification is the optimal approach for these countries. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Avenues of reef-building coral acclimatization in response to rapid environmental change
VL  - 224
AB  - The swiftly changing climate presents a challenge to organismal fitness by creating a mismatch between the current environment and phenotypes adapted to historic conditions. Acclimatory mechanisms may be especially crucial for sessile benthic marine taxa, such as reef-building corals, where climate change factors including ocean acidification and increasing temperature elicit strong negative physiological responses such as bleaching, disease and mortality. Here, within the context of multiple stressors threatening marine organisms, I describe the wealth of metaorganism response mechanisms to rapid ocean change and the ontogenetic shifts in organism interactions with the environment that can generate plasticity. I then highlight the need to consider the interactions of rapid and evolutionary responses in an adaptive (epi)genetic continuum. Building on the definitions of these mechanisms and continuum, I also present how the interplay of the microbiome, epigenetics and parental effects creates additional avenues for rapid acclimatization. To consider under what conditions epigenetic inheritance has a more substantial role, I propose investigation into the offset of timing of gametogenesis leading to different environmental integration times between eggs and sperm and the consequences of this for gamete epigenetic compatibility. Collectively, non-genetic, yet heritable phenotypic plasticity will have significant ecological and evolutionary implications for sessile marine organism persistence under rapid climate change. As such, reef-building corals present ideal and time-sensitive models for further development of our understanding of adaptive feedback loops in a multi-player (epi)genetic continuum.

VL  - 30
IS  - 8
SP  - 1356-1379
AB  - This research presents optimum operation strategies for multi-energy systems as combined cooling, heat, and power systems with the approach of electricity supply priority regime. A grid with energy hub structure including electrical, thermal, and cooling hubs is explored. Accordingly, an energy hub structure integrated with storages and renewable resources is designed. The mathematical model of the operation system for the presented triple generation micro-grid is considered for energy flow to the energy grid. Considering the limitations of the storage system and the performance of the equipment as well as electricity and gas line, a dynamic optimum operation model is prepared on the basis of mixed integer linear programming and is solved in general algebraic modeling system optimization software so as to minimize energy supply costs. For the model verification, different scenarios are developed in a residential building for a typical summer day so that the renewable resources and storages are fed into the system gradually. According to the findings, as each element is included in the micro-energy grid, its operational parameters, viz. the cost of electricity, gas, and pollutant emissions, are improved remarkably. Scenario I includes a combined cooling, heat, and power system, Scenario II is supplemented with renewable solar and wind energy, and Scenario III includes electrical, heat, and cold storages in addition to renewable sources and combined cooling, heat, and power system. Results reveal a decrease in total productivity cost by 12.2% in Scenario II versus Scenario I and 10.9% in Scenario III versus Scenario II.

TI  - Biochar as a viable carbon sequestration option: Global and Canadian perspective
VL  - 36
IS  - 4
SP  - 2011-2016
AB  - Biochar production and mixing in soil are seen as the best options for atmospheric carbon sequestration, providing simultaneous benefits to soil and opportunities for distributed energy generation. The proximity of biomass source and biochar dispersal greatly reduces the energy and emissions footprint of the whole process. The viability of the whole biochar process is examined from two boundary points: is there enough biomass around to have significant impact on the atmospheric CO2 levels and is there enough soil area for biochar dispersal. The answers are soundly positive, both for the world as a whole and for Canada, for which a more detailed analysis was done. However, the massive adoption of biochar solution is critically dependent on proper recognition of its carbon sequestration impact its soil improvement potentials. To that extent the International Biochar Initiative, together with national chapters, including recently formed Canadian Biochar Initiative, are actively promoting biochar related research and policy framework. This paper addresses the questions of availability of sources and sites that would benefit from its dispersal. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A waste to energy technology for Enrichment of biomethane generation: A review on operating parameters, types of biodigesters, solar assisted heating systems, socio economic benefits and challenges
VL  - 293
AB  - Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is one of the promising wastestoenergy (WtE) technologies that convert organic wastes to useful gaseous fuel (biogas). In this process methane is produced in the presence of methanogens (bacteria). The survival and activities of methanogens are based on several parameters such as pH, temperature, organic loading rate, types of biodigester. Moreover, these parameters influence the production of biogas in terms of yield and composition. Maintaining an appropriate temperaturefor AD is highly critical and energy intensive. This study reviews the various hybrid technologies assistedbio gas production schemes particularly from renewable energy sources. Also discuss the direct and indirect solar assisted bio-digester impacts and recommendation to improve its performance. In addition, the performance analysis Solar Photovoltaic (PV) and thermal collector assisted bio gas plants; besides their impact on the performance of anaerobic digesters. Since opportunities of solar energy are attractive, the effective utilization of the same is selected for the discussion. Besides, the various constraints that affect the yield and composition of biogas are also evaluated along with the current biogas technologies and the biodigesters. The environmental benefits, challenges and socio-economic factors are also discussed for the successful implementation of various technologies.

TI  - Adaptive parental effects: the importance of estimating environmental predictability and offspring fitness appropriately
VL  - 123
IS  - 7
SP  - 769-776
AB  - Anticipatory parental effects (APE's) occur when parents adjust the phenotype of their offspring to match the local environment, so as to increase the fitness of both parents and offspring. APE's, as in the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity more generally, are predicated on the idea that the parental environment is a reliable predictor of the offspring environment. Most studies on APE's fail to explicitly consider environmental predictability so risk searching for APE's under circumstances where they are unlikely to occur. This failure is perhaps one of the major reasons for mixed evidence for APE's in a recent meta-analysis. Here, we highlight some often-overlooked assumptions in studies of APE's and provide a framework for identifying and testing APE's. Our review highlights the importance of measuring environmental predictability, outlines the minimal requirements for experimental designs, explains the important differences between relative and absolute measures of offspring fitness, and highlights some potential issues in assigning components of offspring fitness to parental fitness. Our recommendations should result in more targeted and effective tests of APE's.

TI  - Laser Thermal Processing System for Creation of Low Temperature Polycrystalline Silicon using High Power DPSS Laser and Excimer Laser
SP  - 647-650
AB  - Low temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) technology using a high power laser have been widely applied to thin film transistors (TFTs) for liquid crystal, organic light emitting diode (OLED) display, driver circuit for system on glass (SOG) and static random access memory (SRAM). Recently, the semiconductor industry is continuing its quest to create even more powerful CPU and memory chips. This requires increasing of individual device speed through the continual reduction of the minimum size of device features and increasing of device density on the chip. Moreover, the flat panel display industry also need to be brighter, with richer more vivid color, wider viewing g angle, have faster video capability and be more durable at lower cost. Kornic Systems Co., Ltd developed the KORONA (TM) LTP/GL TP series - an innovative production tool for fabricating flat panel displays and semiconductor devices - to meet these growing market demands and advance the volume production capabilities of flat panel displays and semiconductor industry. The KORONA (TM) GLTP/LTP series using DPSS laser and XeCl excimer laser is designed for the new generation of the wafer & FPD glass annealing processing equipment combining advanced low temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) crystallization technology and object-oriented software architecture with a semi-standard graphical user interface (GUI). These leading edge systems show the superior annealing ability to the conventional other method The KORONA (TM) GLTP/LTP series provides technical and economical benefits of advanced annealing solution to semiconductor and FPD production performance with an exceptional level of productivity. High throughput, low cost of ownership and optimized system efficiency v brings the highest Yield and lowest cost per wafer/glass on the annealing market.

VL  - 73

SP  - 367-375
AB  - With the cell therapy industry continuing to grow, the ability to preserve clinical grade cells, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), whilst retaining cell viability and function remains critical for the generation of off-the-shelf therapies. Cryopreservation of MSCs, using slow freezing, is an established process at lab scale. However, the cytotoxicity of cryoprotectants, like Me2SO, raises questions about the impact of prolonged cell exposure to cryoprotectant at temperatures >0 degrees C during processing of large cell batches for allogenic therapies prior to rapid cooling in a controlled rate freezer or in the clinic prior to administration. Here we show that exposure of human bone marrow derived MSCs to Me2SO for >= 1 h before freezing, or after thawing, degrades membrane integrity, short-term cell attachment efficiency and alters cell immunophenotype. After 2 h's exposure to Me2SO at 37 degrees C post-thaw, membrane integrity dropped to similar to 70% and only similar to 50% of cells retained the ability to adhere to tissue culture plastic. Furthermore, only 70% of the recovered MSCs retained an immunophenotype consistent with the ISCT minimal criteria after exposure. We also saw a similar loss of membrane integrity and attachment efficiency after exposing osteoblast (HOS TE85) cells to Me2SO before, and after, cryopreservation. Overall, these results show that freezing medium exposure is a critical determinant of product quality as process scale increases. Defining and reporting cell sensitivity to freezing medium exposure, both before and after cryopreservation, enables a fair judgement of how scalable a particular cryopreservation process can be, and consequently whether the therapy has commercial feasibility.

TI  - Divergent developmental patterns of induced morphological defenses in rotifers and Daphnia: Ecological and evolutionary context
VL  - 64
IS  - 2
SP  - 541-557
AB  - Induced morphological defenses commonly develop in some loricate rotifers as greatly increased spine development and in many species of the cladoceran genus Daphnia as an alteration in the shape and size of its head, producing helmets, crests, and neck spines. This restructuring of the shape of these animals during development, which reduces their vulnerability to a variety of planktonic predators, involves a series of developmental challenges and potential evolutionary constraints for each specific type of defense. In this review, we examine these challenges and the divergent developmental patterns that evolved in rotifers and Daphnia in response to the particular forms of predation pressure they face in their lake and pond environments. These patterns involve differences in the sensitivity of various developmental stages to predator kairomones, the timing of when the defense is present during postembryonic development, the ability to reverse the induced defense if the predator disappears from the community, and the effect of water temperature on the induction process. The type of developmental pattern associated with each induced defense appears to have been shaped by natural selection to effectively protect the animal, at minimal cost, from the specific kind of predation pressure to which it is commonly subjected.

TI  - Clinal variation in shell morphology of the freshwater gastropod Potamopyrgus antipodarum along two hill-country streams in New Zealand
VL  - 33
IS  - 2
SP  - 549-560
AB  - The extremely polymorphic gastropod Potamopyrgus antipodarum is widespread in freshwater habitats throughout New Zealand. This study describes morphological variation of P. antipodarum along two streams in Waikato (North Island, New Zealand), and explores relationships between morphology and selected environmental variables (temperature, conductivity, pH, flow, shade, vegetation). Along each stream, fully grown snails were collected at 11 sites extending from the source of flow to 1 or 1.5 km downstream. In both streams, shells increased in size and in one stream they also became more obese with distance from the source. Of the environmental variables assessed only flow, which increased downstream, was found to have potential influence on shell morphology. Larger snails have a larger foot and thus a larger attachment area and therefore may be able to withstand higher currents, despite having a higher Reynolds number resulting in increased drag on them relative to smaller individuals. Other studies have found that clines of morphological variation in lakes are apparently driven by the differential risk of infection by parasites. This can be excluded for the stream populations in this study, because parasitised individuals were absent at upstream sites, suggesting that similar morphological patterns may have entirely different causes.

TI  - Stochastic environmental fluctuations drive epidemiology in experimental host-parasite metapopulations
VL  - 280
IS  - 1769
AB  - Environmental fluctuations are important for parasite spread and persistence. However, the effects of the spatial and temporal structure of environmental fluctuations on host-parasite dynamics are not well understood. Temporal fluctuations can be random but positively autocorrelated, such that the environment is similar to the recent past (red noise), or random and uncorrelated with the past (white noise). We imposed red or white temporal temperature fluctuations on experimental metapopulations of Paramecium caudatum, experiencing an epidemic of the bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. Metapopulations (two subpopulations linked by migration) experienced fluctuations between stressful (5 degrees C) and permissive (23 degrees C) conditions following red or white temporal sequences. Spatial variation in temperature fluctuations was implemented by exposing subpopulations to the same (synchronous temperatures) or different (asynchronous temperatures) temporal sequences. Red noise, compared with white noise, enhanced parasite persistence. Despite this, red noise coupled with asynchronous temperatures allowed infected host populations to maintain sizes equivalent to uninfected populations. It is likely that this occurs because subpopulations in permissive conditions rescue declining subpopulations in stressful conditions. We show how patterns of temporal and spatial environmental fluctuations can impact parasite spread and host population abundance. We conclude that accurate prediction of parasite epidemics may require realistic models of environmental noise.

TI  - Molecular analyses of ostracod flocks from Lake Baikal and Lake Tanganyika
VL  - 682
IS  - 1
SP  - 91-110
AB  - Ancient lakes are excellent laboratories for evolutionary research, where species can be studied in the cradle where they originated. In this article, we investigate two endemic ostracod species flocks from the two oldest lakes in the world, Lake Baikal (LB) (ca. 28 myr) and Lake Tanganyika (LT) (ca. 12 myr), with DNA sequence data. Nuclear ITS1 failed to resolve the phylogeny of both flocks. Whilst most phylogenetic relationships of the Tanganyika flock are resolved with mitochondrial COI, the Baikalian tree contains multifurications of up to seven different clades. The Tanganyikan Cyprideis flock shows higher genetic variability, which matches its higher morphological variability. A significant deviation from a constant divergence rate through time indicates that the Cytherissa flock most likely experienced explosive speciation events during its earlier history. Comparative analyses of substitution rates furthermore revealed that they are not clock-wise for COI. Ancestral Cytherissa probably radiated in LB 5-8 myr ago, around the time when the cold, oxygenated abyss was formed in LB. The Tanganyikan Cyprideis flock is almost twice as old as the Baikalian Cytherissa flock, and possibly older than LT itself, ca. 15 myr. The Cyprideis flock has survived drastic lake level changes and resulting salinity crises during its entire history.

TI  - Socialization of Solar Energy Utilization in Ponpes Al Hidayah, Arjasa, Kangean Island, Sumenep
VL  - 997
AB  - Electricity problem of most small islands in Indonesia has become a serious problem and need to be immediately resolved. In this present paper, Kangean Islands, Sumenep district of Madura, Indonesia, is one of the most suitable islands for an example. In this island, the existing electricity supply is mainly generated by diesel generators. Even though there are also electricity supplies from the government and private companies, it is very limited capacities just a few families. It is clear that the daily electricity requirements in the Kangean Islands are not adequately met. There is no self-supporting from the local residents to meet their daily energy needs. The community service activity helps to improve the understanding and the self-supporting of the Kangean Island community, especially for the young generation, in the field of electrical energy by utilizing renewable energy sources, especially solar cell system technology. Thus, it is expected that natural resources in Kangean Island can be utilized properly and able to increase the productivity. Finally, in this paper, the light intensity and surface temperature effects on the performance of a monocrystal solar cell are discussed.

TI  - Adaptation to a Warming-Drying Trend Through Cropping System Adjustment over Three Decades: A Case Study in the Northern Agro-Pastural Ecotone of China
VL  - 29
IS  - 3
SP  - 496-514
AB  - Long-term field monitoring data and historical crop data are useful to assess the impacts of climate change and to manage cropping systems. The objectives of this study are to understand the cropping system response to a warming-drying trend in the northern agro-pastural ecotone (NAE) of China and to document how farmers can adapt to the warming-drying trend by changing cropping system structure and adjusting planting date. The results indicate that a significant warming-drying trend existed in the NAE from 1980 to 2009, and this trend significantly decreased crop (spring wheat, naked oat, and potato) yields. Furthermore, the yield decreased by 16.2%-28.4% with a 1 degrees C increase in maximum temperature and decreased by 6.6%-11.8% with a 10% decrease in precipitation. Considering food security, water use efficiency, and water ecological adaptability in the semi-arid NAE, cropping system structure adjustment (e.g., a shift from wheat to potato as the predominant crop) and planting date adaptation (e.g., a delay in crop planting date) can offset the impact of the warming-drying trend in the NAE. Based on the successful offsetting of the impact of the warming-drying trend in the NAE, we conclude that farmers can reduce the negative effects of climate change and minimize the risk of crop failure by adapting their cropping system structure at the farming level.

TI  - The Combination of Plasma-Processed Air (PPA) and Plasma-Treated Water (PTW) Causes Synergistic Inactivation of Candida albicans SC5314
VL  - 10
IS  - 9
AB  - Microwave-induced plasma was used for the generation of plasma-processed air (PPA) and plasma-treated water (PTW). By this way, the plasma was able to functionalize the compressed air and the used water to antimicrobial effective agents. Their fungicidal effects by single and combined application were investigated on Candida albicans strain SC5314. The monoculture of C. albicans was cultivated on specimens with polymeric surface structures (PE-stripes). The additive as well as the synergistic fungicidal potential of PPA and PTW was investigated by different process windows of plasma exposure time (5-50 s) and sample treatment time with PPA/PTW (1-5 min). For a single PTW or PPA treatment, an increase in the reduction factor with the indicated treatment time was observed (maximum reduction factor of 1.1 and 1.6, respectively). In comparison, the combined application of PTW and then PPA resulted in antagonistic, additive and synergistic effects, depending on the combination. An application of the synergistically acting processes of PTW for cleaning and PPA for drying can be an innovative alternative to the sanitary processes currently used in production plants.

TI  - Transgenerational DNA Methylation Changes in Daphnia magna Exposed to Chronic gamma Irradiation
VL  - 52

SP  - 4331-4339
AB  - Our aim was to investigate epigenetic changes in Daphnia magna after a 25-day chronic external gamma irradiation (generation F0 exposed to 6.5 mu Gy.h(-1) or 41.3 mGy.h(-1)) and their potential inheritance by subsequent recovering generations, namely, F2 (exposed as germline cells in F1 embryos) and F3 (the first truly unexposed generation). Effects on survival, growth, and reproduction were observed and DNA was extracted for whole-genome bisulfite sequencing in all generations. Results showed effects on reproduction in F0 but no effect in the subsequent generations F1, F2, and F3. In contrast, we observed significant methylation changes at specific CpG positions in every generation independent of dose rate, with a majority of hypomethylation. Some of these changes were shared between dose rates and between generations. Associated gene functions included gene families and genes that were previously shown to play roles during exposure to ionizing radiation. Common methylation changes detected between generations F2 and F3 clearly showed that epigenetic modifications can be transmitted to unexposed generations, most likely through the germline, with potential implications for environmental risk.

AB  - Optimization of thermal processes relies on adequate degradation kinetic models to warrant food safety and quality. The knowledge on thermal inactivation kinetics of antimicrobial peptides is necessary to allow for their adequate use as natural biopreservatives in the food industry. In this work, thermal inactivation of the previously characterized bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) P34 was kinetically investigated within the temperature range of 90-120 degrees C. Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644 was used as the indicator microorganism for antimicrobial activity. Applicability of various inactivation models available in the literature was critically evaluated. The first-order model provided the best description of the kinetics of inactivation over the selected temperatures, with k values between 0.059 and 0.010 min(-1). D and k values decreased and increased, respectively, with increasing temperature, indicating a faster inactivation at higher temperatures. Results suggest that BLIS P34 is thermostable, with a z value of 37.74 degrees C and E-a of 72 kJ mol(-1).

TI  - Stand-Alone Photovoltaic System Assessment in Warmer Urban Areas in Mexico
VL  - 11
IS  - 2
AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the possibility of using a stand-alone photovoltaic system (SAPVS) for electricity generation in urban areas in Southern Mexico. In Mexico, an urban area is defined as an area where more than 2500 inhabitants live. Due to constant migration from the countryside to the cities, the number of inhabitants of urban localities has been increasing. Global horizontal irradiation (GHI) data were recorded every 10 min during 2014-2016 in Coatzacoalcos in the state of Veracruz located on 18 degrees 08'09 '' N and 94 degrees 27'48 '' W. In this study, batteries represented 77% of the total cost, 12 PV panels of 310 W could export 5.41 MWh to the grid, and an inverter with an integrated controller and charger was selected, which decreased the initial cost. The city of Coatzacoalcos was chosen because the average annual temperature is 28 degrees, with an average relative humidity of 75% and an average irradiance of 5.3 kWh/m(2)/day. An emission factor 0.505 tCO(2)/MWh of greenhouse gases (GHG) were obtained, based on the power system, the reduction of net annual GHG would be 11 tCO(2) and a financial revenue of 36.951 x 10(3) $/tCO(2) would be obtained. Financial parameters such as a 36.3% Internal Rate Return (IRR) and 3.4 years payback show the financial viability of this investment. SAPVSs in urban areas in Mexico could be a benefit as long as housing has a high consumption of electricity.

TI  - Biosynthesis of Ag-Pt bimetallic nanoparticles using propolis extract: Antibacterial effects and catalytic activity on NaBH4 hydrolysis
VL  - 206
AB  - The critical environmental issues of antibiotic resistance and renewable energies supply urge researching materials synthesis and catalyst activity on hydrogen production processes. Aiming to analyse the antibacterial effect of platinum-silver (Ag-Pt) nanoparticles (NPs) and the catalyst effect on NaBH4 hydrolysis that can be used for hydrogen generation technology, in this work, Ag-Pt NPs were prepared using aqueous propolis extract. Various methods were used for the characterization (Uv-vis Spectroscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction Spectroscopy (XRD)). The antimicrobial activity of Ag-Pt bimetallic nanoparticles was evaluated in vitro by the microdilution method against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Serratia marcescens. The results confirmed the antimicrobial activity of bimetallic NPs Ag-Pt concentrations of (25, 50, and 100 mu g/ml). A concentration of 100 mu g/ml showed low bacterial viability varying between 22.58% and 29.67% for the six tested bacteria. For the catalyst activity on NaBH4 hydrolysis, the results showed high turnover factor (TOF) and low activation energy of 1208.57 h(-1) and 25.61 kJ/mol, respectively, with high hydrogen yield under low temperature. Synthesized Ag-Pt NPs can have great potential for biological and hydrogen storage applications.

VL  - 111

SP  - 2192-2200
AB  - Coffee culture, one of the main agricultural activities in Brazil, has undergone recent negative impacts due to unfavorable climate conditions, with a subnormal rainy period and increased temperatures during the second half of 2015. The coffee berry borer Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari, 1867) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is one of the main insect pests of coffee crops worldwide.The present research aimed to determine the climate zones for coffee berry borer in the state of Sao Paulo, based on its thermal requirements. The results showed that the mean biological development time of H. hampei was affected by temperature, completing its life cycle more rapidly in increased temperatures until the 30 degrees C threshold temperature, and more slowly above this temperature. Development time (egg-adult) was inversely related to temperature in the range between 18 and 32 degrees C.The temperature threshold (T-t) was 13.9 degrees C and the thermal constant (K) was 299 degree-days.These laboratory estimates of thermal requirements and the Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to generate insect life span distribution maps for Sao Paulo. In this state, the coffee berry borer can produce 5.09-10.53 generations annually. Higher pest incidences should coincide with both temperature increases and the availability of coffee fruit for infestation.The data obtained can be used to estimate the monthly and yearly number of generations of this pest, for use in integrated pest management programs.

TI  - Reproductive effort of Pacific oysters: A trait associated with susceptibility to summer mortality
VL  - 304
IS  - 1
SP  - 95-99
AB  - Summer mortality of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is the result of a complex interaction between oysters, their environment and their pathogens. The physiological status of an oyster, especially its reproductive status, is suspected to play a significant role in the outcome of this interaction. As genetic variability exists for susceptibility to summer mortality, resistant (R) and susceptible (S) oyster lines were produced using a divergent selection scheme. The present paper reports a histological study on gonad area, which is representative of reproductive effort, in randomly chosen five R and five S oyster lines. The R lines showed a significantly lower gonad area than the S lines (P<0.001). with an estimated mean difference of 12.5%, whereas, taken together, R and S lines showed a similar distribution of gametogenic stages when sampled. Considering the lines separately, the significant difference in gonad area went up to 24% between R and S lines. The present data confirm and strengthen the negative correlation between reproductive effort and resistance to summer mortality observed in previous studies. Summer mortality of C. gigas in France could, therefore, be partly due to a physiological disorder and metabolic disturbance in oysters associated with their reproductive effort. This does not, however, imply a direct link between the cost of reproduction and mortality because other causal factors, such as pathogenic agents, could be the primary causal factors.

TI  - Computer-aided working-fluid design, thermodynamic optimisation and thermoeconomic assessment of ORC systems for waste-heat recovery
VL  - 161
SP  - 1181-1198
AB  - The wider adoption of organic Rankine cycle (ORC) technology for power generation or cogeneration from renewable or recovered waste-heat in many applications can be facilitated by improved thermodynamic performance, but also reduced investment costs. In this context, it is suggested that the further development of ORC power systems should be guided by combined thermoeconomic assessments that can capture directly the trade-offs between performace and cost with the aim of proposing solutions with high resource-use efficiency and, importantly, improved economic viability. This paper couples, for the first time, the computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) of the ORC working-fluid based on the statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT)-gamma Mie equation of state with thermodynamic modelling and optimisation, in addition to heat-exchanger sizing models, component cost correlations and thermoeconomic assessments. The resulting CAMD-ORC framework presents a novel and powerful approach with extended capabilities that allows the thermodynamic optimisation of the ORC system and working fluid to be performed in a single step, thus removing subjective and pre-emptive screening criteria that exist in conventional approaches, while also extending to include cost considerations relating to the resulting optimal systems. Following validation, the proposed framework is used to identify optimal cycles and working fluids over a wide range of conditions characterised by three different heat-source cases with temperatures of 150 degrees C, 250 degrees C and 350 degrees C, corresponding to small- to medium-scale applications. In each case, the optimal combination of ORC system design and working fluid is identified, and the corresponding capital costs are evaluated. It is found that fluids with low specific-investment costs (SIC) are different to those that maximise the power output. The fluids with the lowest SIC are isoheptane, 2-pentene and 2-heptene, with SICs of 5620 pound, 2760 pound and 2070 pound per kW respectively, and corresponding power outputs of 32.9 kW, 136.6 kW and 213.9 kW.

TI  - Ocean acidification promotes broad transcriptomic responses in marine metazoans: a literature survey
VL  - 17
IS  - 1
AB  - For nearly a decade, the metazoan-focused research community has explored the impacts of ocean acidification (OA) on marine animals, noting that changes in ocean chemistry can impact calcification, metabolism, acid-base regulation, stress response and behavior in organisms that hold high ecological and economic value. Because OA interacts with several key physiological processes in marine organisms, transcriptomics has become a widely-used method to characterize whole organism responses on a molecular level as well as inform mechanisms that explain changes in phenotypes observed in response to OA. In the past decade, there has been a notable rise in studies that examine transcriptomic responses to OA in marine metazoans, and here we attempt to summarize key findings across these studies. We find that organisms vary dramatically in their transcriptomic responses to pH although common patterns are often observed, including shifts in acid-base ion regulation, metabolic processes, calcification and stress response mechanisms. We also see a rise in transcriptomic studies examining organismal response to OA in a multi-stressor context, often reporting synergistic effects of OA and temperature. In addition, there is an increase in studies that use transcriptomics to examine the evolutionary potential of organisms to adapt to OA conditions in the future through population and transgenerational experiments. Overall, the literature reveals complex organismal responses to OA, in which some organisms will face more dramatic consequences than others. This will have wide-reaching impacts on ocean communities and ecosystems as a whole.

TI  - First insight into the heritable variation of the resistance to infection with the bacteria causing the withering syndrome disease in Haliotis rufescens abalone
VL  - 150
SP  - 15-20
AB  - Withering syndrome disease has experienced worldwide spread in the last decade. This fatal disease for abalone is produced by a rickettsia-like organism (WS-RLO), the bacterium "Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis". To evaluate the potential of the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) to improve its resistance to infection by WS-RLO, the additive genetic component in the variation of this trait was estimated. For this, the variation in infection intensity with WS-RLOs and WS-RLOv (phage-infected RLOs) was analyzed in 56 families of full-sibs maintained for three years in a host-parasite cohabitation aquaculture system. A WS-RLO prevalence of 65% was observed in the analysed population; and from the total WS-RLO inclusions 60% were hyperparasited with the phage (WS-RLOv). The decrease in the food ingestion rate was the sole negative effect associated with increasing WS-RLO intensity of infection, suggesting that the high level of WS-RLOv load may have diminished the symptoms of WS disease in the analyzed abalones. The estimated heritabilities were moderate to mid, but significant, varying from 0.21 to 0.23 and 0.36 for WS-RLO and WS-RLOv infections, respectively. This suggests that variation in resistance to infection with WS-RLO may respond to selection in the evaluated red abalone population. Estimated response to selection (G) for the level of infection by WS-RLO indicated that if the 10% of red abalone with the lowest infection level is selected as broodstock, a 90% reduction in the intensity of infection in the progeny can be expected, even with the lowest estimation of heritability (h(2) = 0.21). This strong response would be also due to the large phenotypic variance of this trait. Strong positive correlations, both phenotypic and genotypic, were observed between infection intensities with WS-RLO and WS-RLOv, indicating that selection to increase resistance to one of the types of RLOs will affect resistance in the other in the same direction. This is the first study that demonstrates the existence of additive genetic variation for resistance to WS-RLO in abalone. Consequently, it is possible to increase the resistance to WS-RLO in H. rufescens by selective breeding, which can be an economically attractive and environmentally friendly manner to reduce mortalities and growth effects caused by WS in abalone farms.

TI  - Effect of extreme sea surface temperature events on the demography of an age-structured albatross population
VL  - 372
IS  - 1723
AB  - Climate changes include concurrent changes in environmental mean, variance and extremes, and it is challenging to understand their respective impact on wild populations, especially when contrasted age-dependent responses to climate occur. We assessed how changes in mean and standard deviation of sea surface temperature (SST), frequency and magnitude of warm SST extreme climatic events (ECE) influenced the stochastic population growth rate log(lambda(s)) and age structure of a black-browed albatross population. For changes in SST around historical levels observed since 1982, changes in standard deviation had a larger (threefold) and negative impact on log(lambda s) compared to changes in mean. By contrast, the mean had a positive impact on log(lambda s). The historical SST mean was lower than the optimal SST value for which log(lambda s) was maximized. Thus, a larger environmental mean increased the occurrence of SST close to this optimum that buffered the negative effect of ECE. This 'climate safety margin' (i.e. difference between optimal and historical climatic conditions) and the specific shape of the population growth rate response to climate for a species determine how ECE affect the population. For a wider range in SST, both the mean and standard deviation had negative impact on log(lambda s), with changes in the mean having a greater effect than the standard deviation. Furthermore, around SST historical levels increases in either mean or standard deviation of the SST distribution led to a younger population, with potentially important conservation implications for black-browed albatrosses. This article is part of the themed issue 'Behavioural, ecological and evolutionary responses to extreme climatic events'.

AB  - Techniques for the development of mathematical models in the area of predictive microbiology have greatly improved recently, allowing better and more accurate descriptions of microbial responses to particular environmental conditions, thus enabling predictions of those responses to be made with greater confidence. Recognising the potential value of applying these techniques in the food industry, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) initiated a nationally coordinated five-year programme of research into the growth and survival of microorganisms in foods, with the aim of developing a computerised Predictive Microbiology Database in the UK. This initiative has resulted in the systematic generation of data, through protocols which ensure consistency of methodology, so that data in the database are truly comparable and compatible, and lead to reliable predictive models. The approaches taken by scientists involved in this programme are described and the various stages in the development of mathematical models summarized. It is hoped that this initiative and others being developed in the USA, Australia, Canada and other countries, will encourage a more integrated approach to food safety which will influence all stages of food production and, eventually, result in the development of an International Predictive Microbiology Database.

TI  - Timing the tides: Genetic control of diurnal and lunar emergence times is correlated in the marine midge Clunio marinus
VL  - 12
AB  - Background: The intertidal zone of seacoasts, being affected by the superimposed tidal, diurnal and lunar cycles, is temporally the most complex environment on earth. Many marine organisms exhibit lunar rhythms in reproductive behaviour and some show experimental evidence of endogenous control by a circalunar clock, the molecular and genetic basis of which is unexplored. We examined the genetic control of lunar and diurnal rhythmicity in the marine midge Clunio marinus (Chironomidae, Diptera), a species for which the correct timing of adult emergence is critical in natural populations. Results: We crossed two strains of Clunio marinus that differ in the timing of the diurnal and lunar rhythms of emergence. The phenotype distribution of the segregating backcross progeny indicates polygenic control of the lunar emergence rhythm. Diurnal timing of emergence is also under genetic control, and is influenced by two unlinked genes with major effects. Furthermore, the lunar and diurnal timing of emergence is correlated in the backcross generation. We show that both the lunar emergence time and its correlation to the diurnal emergence time are adaptive for the species in its natural environment. Conclusions: The correlation implies that the unlinked genes affecting lunar timing and the two unlinked genes affecting diurnal timing could be the same, providing an unexpectedly close interaction of the two clocks. Alternatively, the genes could be genetically linked in a two-by-two fashion, suggesting that evolution has shaped the genetic architecture to stabilize adaptive combinations of lunar and diurnal emergence times by tightening linkage. Our results, the first on genetic control of lunar rhythms, offer a new perspective to explore their molecular clockwork.

TI  - Effect of high-temperature treatment on Fe/ZSM-5 prepared by chemical vapor deposition of FeCl3II. Nitrous oxide decomposition, selective oxidation of benzene to phenol, and selective reduction of nitric oxide by isobutane
VL  - 221
IS  - 2
SP  - 575-583
AB  - The catalytic performance (nitrous oxide decomposition, hydroxylation of benzene to phenol with nitrous oxide, and selective reduction of nitric oxide by i-butane) was evaluated for a set of HZSM-5 and sublimed Fe/ZSM-5 catalysts, which have been extensively characterized in an earlier contribution (J. Catal. (2003)). Nitrous oxide decomposition rates for the sublimed samples strongly increase after high-temperature calcination and particularly, after high-temperature steaming. Only a small fraction of the total iron content is active in this decomposition. For benzene hydroxylation the initial phenol productivity also increases with increasing severity of treatment. It is concluded that similar catalytic sites are important. Nevertheless, Fe/ZSM-5 and Fe/ZSM-5(HTC) exhibit relatively low phenol selectivities due to significant hydrocarbon combustion. The steamed Fe/ZSM-5, however, produces phenol with high selectivity. The stability of the sublimed samples is relatively low due to the large coke make, attributable to the large number of active sites. Commercial HZSM-5 with an iron content of 0.024 wt% and its steamed counterpart are also active and have a better stability, the latter one having the highest phenol productivity after prolonged reaction times. The beneficial effect of severe activation treatments to sublimed Fe/ZSM-5, where iron is introduced at extraframework positions, is taken as an indication that removal of lattice aluminum is important for the generation of active sites. The different activity order in NO reduction by i-butane suggests that the active sites for this reaction are different from those for nitrous oxide decomposition and selective benzene oxidation.

TI  - Potential productivity of the Miscanthus energy crop in the Loess Plateau of China under climate change
VL  - 8
IS  - 4
AB  - With a vast area of marginal land, the Loess Plateau of China is a promising region for large-scale production of second-generation energy crops. However, it remains unknown whether such production is sustainable in the long run, especially under climate change. Using a regional climate change model, PRECIS, we analyzed the impact of climate change on Miscanthus production in the Loess Plateau. Under three emission scenarios, A2, B2, and A1B, both the average yield and total area capable of supporting Miscanthus production would increase continuously in the future period (2011-2099). As a result, the total yield potential in the region would increase by about 20% in this future period from the baseline period (1961-1990). This was explained primarily by predicted increases in temperature and precipitation across the Loess Plateau, which improved the yield of the perennial C4 plants relying exclusively on rainfed production. The areas that are currently too dry or too cold to support Miscanthus production could be turned into energy crop fields, especially along the arid-semiarid transition zone. Thus the Loess Plateau would become increasingly desirable for growing second-generation energy crops in this century, which could in turn contribute to soil improvement and ecological restoration of the region.

TI  - Synergistic Ecoclimate Teleconnections from Forest Loss in Different Regions Structure Global Ecological Responses
VL  - 11
IS  - 11
AB  - Forest loss in hotspots around the world impacts not only local climate where loss occurs, but also influences climate and vegetation in remote parts of the globe through ecoclimate teleconnections. The magnitude and mechanism of remote impacts likely depends on the location and distribution of forest loss hotspots, but the nature of these dependencies has not been investigated. We use global climate model simulations to estimate the distribution of ecologically-relevant climate changes resulting from forest loss in two hotspot regions: western North America (wNA), which is experiencing accelerated dieoff, and the Amazon basin, which is subject to high rates of deforestation. The remote climatic and ecological net effects of simultaneous forest loss in both regions differed from the combined effects of loss from the two regions simulated separately, as evident in three impacted areas. Eastern South American Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) increased due to changes in seasonal rainfall associated with Amazon forest loss and changes in temperature related to wNA forest loss. Eurasia's GPP declined with wNA forest loss due to cooling temperatures increasing soil ice volume. Southeastern North American productivity increased with simultaneous forest loss, but declined with only wNA forest loss due to changes in VPD. Our results illustrate the need for a new generation of local-to-global scale analyses to identify potential ecoclimate teleconnections, their underlying mechanisms, and most importantly, their synergistic interactions, to predict the responses to increasing forest loss under future land use change and climate change.

TI  - Experimental and Numerical Study on Dieless Bending of 2-piece Parallel Flow Microchannel Heat Exchanger
VL  - 749
SP  - 13-27
AB  - Parallel flow microchannel heat exchangers have been increasingly applied in HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) field due to their characteristics, such as high efficient heat transfer performance, compact form and low cost. Production rationalization of the heat exchanger is required for realization of a competitive, light-weight and easy-to-assemble product. The heat exchanger is usually bent to L-shape so as to decrease the volume of air conditioner. To correspond with design changes for multi-generation use and to achieve good forming quality, a dieless forming technique is developed to offer flexible manufacturing. Using this method, heat exchangers can be formed with variable bending radius conveniently, which can reduce the mold cost and obtain high productivity. Meanwhile, product defects such as fin damage can also be reduced because there is no physical contact against tools in the bending portion. In the present study, the forming principle of dieless bending process is first stated by theoretical analysis. Then to verify the proposed forming mechanism, a NC dieless bending machine is manufactured to implement the bending experiment. Finally, based on the verified FE model, the bending process for the 2-piece heat exchanger has been improved. As a result, the dieless bending process has been successfully developed and can be applied to produce square-shape heat exchanger with variable bending radius.

TI  - Assessment of next generation refrigerants for air conditioning systems integrated with air-membrane heat and mass exchangers
VL  - 154
SP  - 344-353
AB  - Thermodynamic analysis was conducted, in detail, to compare the performance of an air conditioning system with and without an air-membrane heat and mass exchanger. The study evaluated the performance of the system considering four promising new refrigerants: R1234yf, R1234ze, R32, and R423A. To evaluate the performance of the system, key performance parameters were used, including, coefficient of performance (COP), exergy destruction rate, second law efficiency, compressor work, irreversibility ratio, fuel depletion ratio, and productivity lack. In addition, the effect of varying the compressor pressure ratio, effectiveness of the membrane, and the relative humidity of fresh air on the performance of the system were evaluated for both configurations. The performance of an air conditioning system significantly improves when an air-membrane heat and mass exchanger is used. The main reason of this improvement is the significant drop in the cooling load and, consequently, the compressor input power. Furthermore, the study showed that COP as a measure of performance is not enough to have an appropriate comparison for the performance and further detailed analysis is needed, such as exergy analysis. Therefore, exergy analysis was also conducted to fully assess the advantages of using a membrane with an air conditioning system. From thermodynamics point of view, the study showed that R1234ze has the best performance while R32 has the lowest performance.

VL  - 5

SP  - 1939-1950
AB  - With the rapid development of flexible wearable strain sensor systems, electronic textiles with comfort and controllable strain/pressure-sensing capabilities have attracted great interest. However, it is still a great challenge to prepare multifunctional wearable strain/pressure sensor with an ultra-low detection limit through a facile and cost-effective method. Here, conductive carbon nanotubes modified silk nonwoven fabric (CNTs/SNWF) composite was successfully prepared by the surface micro-dissolution and adhesion technology (SD&AT). Micromorphology analysis showed that CNTs were adhered firmly on the surface of silk fiber to form an effective conductive network. The conductive CNTs/SNWF-based strain/pressure sensor can detect a strain as low as 0.05% and an ultralow pressure of 10 Pa, showing an ultrahigh discernibility. Besides, it also exhibited excellent sensing stability and reproductivity under different conditions, making it applicable in the field of real-time human movement monitoring. Moreover, electronic skin was also established based on the conductive CNTs/SNWF to recognize different tactile stimulus. Interestingly, the prepared conductive CNTs/SNWF also displayed great applicability for optical and thermal sensing, endowing it with more functionality for next-generation wearable electronics.

TI  - How aquatic insects live in cold climates
VL  - 139
IS  - 4
SP  - 443-471
AB  - In cold climates most aquatic habitats are frozen for many months. Nevertheless, even in such regions the conditions in different types of habitat, in different parts of one habitat, and from one year to the next can vary considerably; some water bodies even allow winter growth. Winter cold and ice provide challenges for aquatic insects, but so do high spring flows, short, cool summers, and unpredictable conditions. General adaptations to cope with these constraints, depending on species and habitat, include the use of widely available foods, increased food range, prolonged development (including development lasting more than one year per generation), programmed life cycles with diapause and other responses to environmental cues (often enforcing strict univoltinism), and staggered development. Winter conditions may be anticipated not only by diapause and related responses but also by movement for the winter to terrestrial habitats, to less severe aquatic habitats, or to different parts of the same habitat, and by construction of shelters. Winter itself is met by various types of cold hardiness, including tolerance of freezing in at least some species, especially chironomid midges, and supercooling even when surrounded by ice in others. Special cocoons provide protection in some species. A few species move during winter or resist anoxia beneath ice. Spring challenges of high flows and ice scour may be withstood or avoided by wintering in less severe habitats, penetrating the substrate, or delaying activity until after peak flow. However, where possible species emerge early in the spring to compensate for the shortness of the summer season, a trait enhanced (at least in some lentic habitats) by choosing overwintering sites that warm up first in spring. Relatively low summer temperatures are offset by development at low temperatures, by selection of warm habitats and microhabitats, and in adults by thermoregulation and modified mating activity. Notwithstanding the many abiotic constraints in cold climates, aquatic communities are relatively diverse, though dominated by taxa that combine traits such as cold adaptation with use of the habitats and foods that are most widely available and most favourable. Consequently, except in the most severe habitats, food chains and community structure are complex even at high latitudes and elevations, including many links between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Despite the complex involvement of aquatic insects in these cold-climate ecosystems, we know relatively little about the physiological and biochemical basis of their cold hardiness and its relationship to habitat conditions, especially compared with information about terrestrial species from the same regions.

TI  - Linking energy budget to physiological adaptation: How a calcifying gastropod adjusts or succumbs to ocean acidification and warming
VL  - 715
AB  - Accelerating CO2 emissions have driven physico-chemical changes in the world's oceans, such as ocean acidification and warming. How marine organisms adjust or succumb to such environmental changes may be determined by their ability to balance energy intake against expenditure (i.e. energy budget) as energy supports physiological functions, including those with adaptive value. Here, we examined whether energy budget is a driver of physiological adaptability of marine calci hers to the near-future ocean acidification and warming; i.e. how physiological energetics (respiration rate, feeding rate, energy assimilation and energy budget) relates to adjustments in shell growth and shell properties of a calcifying gastropod (Austrocochlea concamerata). We found that ocean warming boosted the energy budget of gastropods due to increased feeding rate, resulting in faster shell growth and greater shell strength (i.e. more mechanically resilient). When combined with ocean acidification, however, the gastropods had a substantial decrease in energy budget due to reduced feeding rate and energy assimilation, leading to the reduction in shell growth and shell strength. By linking energy budget to the adjustability of shell building, we revealed that energy availability can be critical to determine the physiological adaptability of marine calcifiers to the changing oceanic climate.

TI  - An Examination of the Techno-Economic Viability of Hybrid Grid-Integrated and Stand-Alone Generation Systems for an Indian Tea Plant
VL  - 10
AB  - All tea plants in India rely on the national grid for their electrical needs and diesel for their thermal energy and transportation, which are encountering high costs, high emissions, and issues of accessibility. In this paper, hybrid renewable systems based on both standalone and grid-connected technologies have been modeled using HOMER Pro software for supplying power to a tea manufacturing plant in a typical rural area in India, namely, Gudalur village (Nilgiris), geographically located at 11 degrees 30.2 ' N and 76 degrees 29.5 ' E, which is presently run by the state grid to meet their energy requirements. The different configurations comprised of Solar PV, biomass, hydro, electrolyzer, boiler, thermal load controller to utilize excess electricity, and waste heat recovery options, and lead-acid batteries were designed to meet 650 kWh/day of electricity for processing units, 101 kWh/day of electricity for general applications, 4,450 kWh/day of thermal energy, and 86.35 kg/day of hydrogen energy. To determine the most feasible system design among various scenarios, several criteria such as NPC, COE, LCOH, and CO2 emission of the system have been investigated. In the case of off-grid hybrid systems, results show the highest NPC of $7.01 M with an LCOE of $1.06/kWh is obtained for the diesel generator/boiler/reformer/TLC system. It is reduced to $1.75 M with an LCOE of -$.420/kWh for the PV/biomass-CHP/hydro/TLC scenario. In a grid-connected system, the maximum NPC of $6.20 M with an LCOE of $0.835/kWh is obtained for a diesel generator/boiler system, and it is reduced to -$10.5 M with an LCOE of -$.240/kWh for the PV/biomass-CHP/hydro/TLC scenario. Additionally, in the off-grid systems, the PV/biomass-CHP/hydro/TLC system has LCOH of $4.27/kg, which is economical with the highest renewable fraction of 93%. The PV/biomass-CHP/hydro/TLC hybrid system has the lowest LCOH of -$64.5/kg with a maximum renewable fraction of 96% in on-grid systems. The findings show that recovering excess electricity and waste heat would increase renewable fraction, decrease the energy cost and emissions from the system, and emphasize the importance of TLC and CHP in HRES. According to the simulation results, the grid-connected system is more cost-effective than a stand-alone system due to the revenue obtained from selling renewable power to the grid.

SP  - 668-677
AB  - A minute pirate bug, Amphiareus constrictus (Stal) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), the biology of which has been less studied, was successfully reared in the laboratory for more than 20 generations. Studies were conducted to understand its biology, life table parameters, and predatory potential. Besides the adult, the egg and all five nymphal instars are described with live images, which can serve as additional characters for identification. The biological parameters were studied at different temperatures. Rearing temperatures of 25 and 30 degrees C were found to be suitable for hatching and nymphal survival to adult stage (88.5 and 75%, respectively). Life table parameters like net reproductive rate (R-0), precise intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)), finite rate of increase () and hypothetical F-2 females were higher at 25 degrees C. A nymph could consume a total of 32.8 +/- 1.8 Corcyra cephalonica Stainton eggs. Male and female adult consumed a total of 179.0 +/- 15.6 and 388.5 +/- 58.6 C. cephalonica eggs, respectively. The data generated through studies on biology, fertility, and predatory potential led to the standardization of a simple production protocol for A. constrictus utilizing the eggs of the rice moth C. cephalonica. Predatory potential studies on Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) indicated that a nymph could consume 154.8 eggs during nymphal duration. Male and female adults could consume 1280.5 and 1435 eggs, respectively. The mass-reared A. constrictus can be field evaluated against the tomato pinworm TT absoluta and the brown plant hopper Nilaparvata lugens Stal.

TI  - High-speed reference-beam-angle control technique for holographic memory drive
VL  - 55
IS  - 9
AB  - We developed a holographic memory drive for next-generation optical memory. In this study, we present the key technology for achieving a highspeed transfer rate for reproduction, that is, a high-speed control technique for the reference beam angle. In reproduction in a holographic memory drive, there is the issue that the optimum reference beam angle during reproduction varies owing to distortion of the medium. The distortion is caused by, for example, temperature variation, beam irradiation, and moisture absorption. Therefore, a reference-beam-angle control technique to position the reference beam at the optimum angle is crucial. We developed a new optical system that generates an angle-error-signal to detect the optimum reference beam angle. To achieve the high-speed control technique using the new optical system, we developed a new control technique called adaptive final-state control (AFSC) that adds a second control input to the first one derived from conventional final-state control (FSC) at the time of angle-error-signal detection. We established an actual experimental system employing AFSC to achieve moving control between each page (Page Seek) within 300 mu s. In sequential multiple Page Seeks, we were able to realize positioning to the optimum angles of the reference beam that maximize the diffracted beam intensity. We expect that applying the new control technique to the holographic memory drive will enable a giga-bit/s-class transfer rate. (C) 2016 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

AB  - Abrupt environmental changes are of particular interest to understand how species can quickly evolve at the boundary of their current niche. In particular the sliding niche model, wherein a niche shifts globally toward the new condition, has been used in understanding and modeling this process. Here, we investigate the dynamics of relative fitness change in four evolutionary replicates of Escherichia coli populations exposed to an extreme pH shift. We analyzed these changes at generations 500, 1000, and 2000 to determine whether niche global deformations fully capture the temporal dynamics of niche evolution. Strikingly, this analysis reveals that fitness variations can indeed be attributed to simple and global deformation of an underlying simple niche template. Analysis from two experimental replicates displays a transient increase in niche width, consistent with recent theory considering plasticity evolution in the context of an abrupt environmental change. We term this scenario the sidestep niche model.

TI  - Phenology of the beech splendour beetle Agrilus viridis L. (Col., Buprestidae) in southern Germany
VL  - 188

SP  - 176-185
AB  - Initiated by a severe outbreak of the beech splendour beetle (Agrilus viridis L.) in Hungary and the increasing importance of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) for managed forests in Central Europe, we studied the phenology of A. viridis. From 2010 to 2012 we investigated swarming, activity density and development time of A. viridis in eight mature beech stands located in prominent beech growing areas of Bavaria (southern Germany) (Fig. 1). Swarming set on in the second half of May and lasted until begin (2011, 2012) and end (2010) of September, respectively (Fig. 3A). Heat sum calculated as DDT-max15 (sum of daily maximum crown temperature minus 15 degrees C) synchronized the flight activity of the beetles very well (Fig. 3B) and significantly better than the Julian date (Fig. 4). The relative low number of trapped beetles (384 in three years) indicated a latent population density during the study period. Swarming beetles correlated significantly with mean maximum temperatures in the beech crowns (Fig. 5). In latency, the beetles showed only an unremarkable dispersal activity and seemed to remain for more than one generation in an individual beech crown, when they initially achieved to colonize some branches. The dieback of infested branches enhances the temperature within the crown and thus, the thermophilic beetle itself improves the habitat for further generations. Oviposition on trap trees peaked 3 to 4 weeks after felling (Tab. 1). The number of egg clusters deposited on trap trees ranged from 28 to 159 per tree (mean 81). The percentage of egg clusters with entrance holes of 1st instar larvae was 52,7%. Based on these clusters the mean number of eggs per cluster was 5.32. In the field, mean development time ranged between 352 and 403 days (Tab. 2). Thus, A. viridis must be expected to occur in overlapping generations with one and two-year development.

TI  - A perspective on insect-microbe holobionts facing thermal fluctuations in a climate-change context
VL  - 24
IS  - 1
SP  - 18-29
AB  - Temperature influences the ecology and evolution of insects and their symbionts by impacting each partner independently and their interactions, considering the holobiont as a primary unit of selection. There are sound data about the responses of these partnerships to constant temperatures and sporadic thermal stress (mostly heat shock). However, the current understanding of the thermal ecology of insect-microbe holobionts remains patchy because the complex thermal fluctuations (at different spatial and temporal scales) experienced by these organisms in nature have often been overlooked experimentally. This may drastically constrain our ability to predict the fate of mutualistic interactions under climate change, which will alter both mean temperatures and thermal variability. Here, we tackle down these issues by focusing on the effects of temperature fluctuations on the evolutionary ecology of insect-microbe holobionts. We propose potentially worth-investigating research avenues to (i) evaluate the relevance of theoretical concepts used to predict the biological impacts of temperature fluctuations when applied to holobionts; (ii) acknowledge the plastic (behavioural thermoregulation, physiological acclimation) and genetic responses (evolution) expressed by holobionts in fluctuating thermal environments; and (iii) explore the potential impacts of previously unconsidered patterns of temperature fluctuations on the outcomes and the dynamic of these insect-microbe associations.

TI  - Modelling mountain pine beetle phenological response to temperature
VL  - 399
SP  - 210-222
AB  - Maintaining an adaptive seasonality, with life cycle events occurring at appropriate times of year and in synchrony with ephemeral resources, is a basic ecological requisite. For poikilothermic organisms, phenology is largely determined through adaptive evolution with the prevailing climate, and in particular, annual temperature cycles. In addition to the direct effect of temperature, most temperate region insects have physiological mechanisms (e.g., diapause) that help to maintain an adaptive seasonality. The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins), however, exhibits no obvious manifestations of diapause. This has led to the ecologically important question: How is an appropriate seasonality maintained in the mountain pine beetle without the synchronizing influence of diapause? In answer to this basic question, we briefly review the mathematical relationship between environmental temperatures and developmental timing and discuss the consequences of viewing these models as circle maps from the cycle of oviposition dates and temperatures of one year to oviposition dates for subsequent generations. Univoltinism, associated with reproductive success for the mountain pine beetle, is related to stable fixed points of the developmental circle map. Univoltine fixed points are stable and robust in broad temperature bands, but lose stability suddenly to maladaptive cycles at the edges of these bands. This leads to the obvious observation that temperatures (weather) can be too cold for the mountain pine beetle to thrive, as well as the less obvious implication that it can also be too warm. These results are placed in an ecological and management context by relating adaptive seasonality to outbreak potential. The relationship between outbreak potential and temperature is further considered in view of climate change (i.e., global warming). We briefly note the potential for global warming to intensify outbreak characteristics in the current range of mountain pine beetle, as well as promote invasion into new habitats, such as the high elevation pines and northern range expansion into Canadian jack pine.

TI  - A comprehensive overview of the effects of urbanisation on sexual selection and sexual traits
VL  - 97
IS  - 4
SP  - 1325-1345
AB  - Urbanisation can affect mating opportunities and thereby alter inter- and intra-sexual selection pressures on sexual traits. Biotic and abiotic urban conditions can influence an individual's success in pre- and post-copulatory mating, for example through impacts on mate attraction and mate preference, fertilisation success, resource competition or rival interactions. Divergent sexual selection pressures can lead to differences in behavioural, physiological, morphological or life-history traits between urban and non-urban populations, ultimately driving adaptation and speciation. Most studies on urban sexual selection and mating interactions report differences between urban and non-urban populations or correlations between sexual traits and factors associated with increased urbanisation, such as pollution, food availability and risk of predation and parasitism. Here we review the literature on sexual selection and sexual traits in relation to urbanisation or urban-associated conditions. We provide an extensive list of abiotic and biotic factors that can influence processes involved in mating interactions, such as signal production and transmission, mate choice and mating opportunities. We discuss all relevant data through the lens of two, non-mutually exclusive theories on sexual selection, namely indicator and sensory models. Where possible, we indicate whether these models provide the same or different predictions regarding urban-adapted sexual signals and describe different experimental designs that can be useful for the different models as well as to investigate the drivers of sexual selection. We argue that we lack a good understanding of: (i) the factors driving urban sexual selection; (ii) whether reported changes in traits result in adaptive benefits; and (iii) whether these changes reflect a short-term ecological, or long-term evolutionary response. We highlight that urbanisation provides a unique opportunity to study the process and outcomes of sexual selection, but that this requires a highly integrative approach combining experimental and observational work.

TI  - Stimulation experiments in sedimentary, low-enthalpy reservoirs for geothermal power generation, Germany
VL  - 32
IS  - 4
SP  - 487-495
AB  - Hydraulic stimulation experiments were conducted in a re-used Rotliegend well situated in the eastern part of the North German Basin. The well is used as an "in-situ geothermal laboratory" and as a reference location for several ongoing research projects. The aim of the projects and experiments is to develop technologies that will put primary low-productive aquifer structures into use for geothermal power generation. The frac operations in 2002 were designed to enhance the inflow performance by connecting the well to productive reservoir zones. Two consecutive zones within the Rotliegend sandstones were selected. Here core measurements show the most promising petrophysical reservoir properties with respect to a productivity increase. The stimulation treatments were performed as hydraulic proppant fracturing operations. Proppants were used to support the fractures and to guarantee a long-term fracture aperture. The treatment intervals are located in the open-hole section of the well at depths between 4080 m and 4190 m and at temperatures of about 140degreesC. The technical demands were therefore unprecedented in these challenging conditions. An open-hole-packer at the top and a sand plug at the bottom of each interval were used as hydraulic barriers. Applying this configuration the intervals were fracture-treated by injecting about 11 tonnes of proppant (high-strength ceramic grains) and over 200 m(3) of frac fluid (highly viscous gel) into the formation. The fracture treatments were conducted by means of two successive operations in each interval: first, a diagnostic treatment (datafrac), followed by the main treatment (mainfrac) with the proppant stages. The frac operations were successful. Propped fractures were created in both intervals and the inflow behaviour of the reservoir was decisively enhanced. The effective pressures applied for fracture initiation and propagation were only slightly above the in-situ pore pressures. The stimulation ratio predicted by modelling, however, could not be achieved. There were a number of reasons for this mismatch. Probably chemical and mechanical processes during closure led to a reduced fracture conductivity. The insights gained from the experiments are important for future fracture treatment projects on this site and in comparable locations. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of CNR.

TI  - Thermal Comfort and Indoor Air Quality of Task Ambient Air Conditioning in Modern Office Buildings
SP  - 533-+
AB  - Energy and environmental sustainability is a major global trend for the 21st century. Thermal discomfort and poor air quality in office buildings can result in loss of productivity, absenteeism and medical problems. The most frequently identified causes are related to inadequate ventilation and contaminants from indoor sources. Task ambient air conditioning aims to provide each occupant with personalized clean air direct to the breathing zone. A typical modern office is selected to study the thermal comfort and indoor air quality of the working environment. The temperature distribution, draught rating, volume concentration of the contaminants and ventilation efficiencies for the contaminants are calculated. For fresh air is directly to sent to breathing zone of the occupants by the task air outlet, the temperature, the CO2 concentration and benzene concentration around the occupants are lower than that of the other zones. And ventilation efficiencies for both the CO2 and benzene around occupants are also higher. These show the effectiveness of the task ambient air conditioning system in forming energy-saving, comfort and clean environment.

TI  - Seasonal proteome variation in intertidal shrimps under a natural setting: Connecting molecular networks with environmental fluctuations
VL  - 703
AB  - The ability of intertidal organisms to maintain their performance via molecular and physiological adjustments under low tide, seasonal fluctuations and extreme events ultimately determines population viability. Analyzing this capacity in the wild is extremely relevant since intertidal communities are under increased climate variability owing to global changes. We addressed the seasonal proteome signatures of a key intertidal species, the shrimp Palaemon elegans, in a natural setting. Shrimps were collected during spring and summer seasons at low tides and were euthanized in situ. Environmental variability was also assessed using hand-held devices and data loggers. Muscle samples were taken for 2D gel electrophoresis and protein identification through mass spectrometry. Proteome data revealed that 55 proteins (10.6% of the proteome) significantly changed between spring and summer collected shrimps, 24 of which were identified. These proteins were mostly involved in cytoskeleton remodelling, energy metabolism and transcription regulation. Overall, shrimps modulate gene expression leading to metabolic and structural adjustments related to seasonal differences in the wild (i.e. abiotic variation and possibly intrinsic cycles of reproduction and growth). This potentially promotes performance and fitness as suggested by the higher condition index in summer-collected shrimps. However, inter-individual variation (% coefficient of variation) in protein levels was quite low (min-max ranges were 0.6-8.3% in spring and 1.2-4.8% in summer), possibly suggesting reduced genetic diversity or physiological canalization. Protein plasticity is relevant to cope with present and upcoming environmental variation related to anthropogenic forcing (e.g. global change, pollution) but low inter-individual variation may limit evolutionary potential of shrimp populations.

TI  - Environmental fluctuations accelerate molecular evolution of thermal tolerance in a marine diatom
VL  - 9
AB  - Diatoms contribute roughly 20% of global primary production, but the factors determining their ability to adapt to global warming are unknown. Here we quantify the capacity for adaptation to warming in the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. We find that evolutionary rescue under severe (32 degrees C) warming is slow, but adaptation to more realistic scenarios where temperature increases are moderate (26 degrees C) or fluctuate between benign and severe conditions is rapid and linked to phenotypic changes in metabolic traits and elemental composition. Whole-genome re-sequencing identifies genetic divergence among populations selected in the different warming regimes and between the evolved and ancestral lineages. Consistent with the phenotypic changes, the most rapidly evolving genes are associated with transcriptional regulation, cellular responses to oxidative stress and redox homeostasis. These results demonstrate that the evolution of thermal tolerance in marine diatoms can be rapid, particularly in fluctuating environments, and is underpinned by major genomic and phenotypic change.

TI  - A Proposed Hybrid Model for Electric Power Generation: A Case Study of Rajasthan, India
AB  - In recent years, hybrid systems have been proved to be revolutionary concepts for meeting the deficit in electrical energy with better overall system's reliability. The proposed system includes the combination of solar, wind, MHD (magneto-hydrodynamics) and fuel cell, to exploit the advantage of each, and reduce the dependency on any one source, and explores a new perspective for using renewable sources as a hybrid system. MHD generator is proposed as a substitute for the conventional thermal power plant. In the proposed hybrid system, both MHD and Modified PEMFC (Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell), also known as Proton Battery, are used. Both are static and totally sustainable energy sources. Moreover, the use of a proton battery offers an added advantage that it can work in a reversible mode. In the electrolyzer mode, the hydronium ions will be absorbed in the porous carbon electrode. In the fuel cell mode, the stored hydronium ions combine with free electrons and oxygen to give pure water as a by-product. The fuel cell is an environment-friendly alternative to the traditional energy storage system and also acts as an energy source for the MHD generator. In this manuscript, an attempt has been made to check the feasibility of the proposed system through a case study. The economic assessment and impact on the environment of the system is also investigated using HOMER Pro software. Simulink results are presented to justify the technical viability of the hybrid proposed model.

TI  - Biomass from trees for bioenergy and biofuels-A briefing paper
VL  - 65
SP  - 461-467
AB  - Tree biomass may be utilised to produce heat, electricity, and biofuels. Despite the fact that the technology for turning woody biomass into energy has existed in many cases for decades, bioenergy generation from woody biomass has not been extensively embraced since the cost of woody biomass energy is not viable with old fossil fuels. However, current predictions of future energy usage, as well as proposed renewable energy and climate change laws, imply that forest and farm biomass energy will be used more in the next decades. Biomass, which accounts for roughly 11% of the world's major energy supply, is mostly made up of organic matter, with a lesser proportion of inorganic compounds comprising a range of intricately linked phases or minerals of various origins. Over 55 percent of the 4 billion m(3) of wood utilised yearly in developing countries is immediately utilised as a source of forest products or carbon to satisfy the daily energy requirements to be used for warming and culinary. The proximal and ultimate analyses are commonly used to characterise a fuel's composition. Concerns about the environmental effect of fossil-fuel-based energy generation are rising. In this context, replacing fossil fuel-based energy with bio-energy might be a viable option. The attraction to forest biomass as an energy source stems from some of its characteristics, such as its global availability and homogeneity, as well as its CO2 emissions neutrality. However, there are concerns associated with its usage, the most of which are connected to the long-term viability of forest systems and their products. Due to huge uncertainty regarding future agricultural productivity improvements and land availability for biomass plants, bioenergy's potential for cli-mate change mitigation remains unknown. Bioenergy potentials, global food costs, and water shortages are all expected to be affected by large-scale growth of dedicated biomass. As a result, coordinated energy, land use, and water management strategies are required. Because biomass contains all of the components found in fossil fuels, albeit in various proportions, current and emerging technologies can help us move toward a future based on renewable, sustainable, and low-carbon economies.

TI  - Genetic by environmental variation but no local adaptation in oysters (Crassostrea virginica)
VL  - 7
IS  - 2
SP  - 697-709
AB  - Functional trait variation within and across populations can strongly influence population, community, and ecosystem processes, but the relative contributions of genetic vs. environmental factors to this variation are often not clear, potentially complicating conservation and restoration efforts. For example, local adaptation, a particular type of genetic by environmental (G*E) interaction in which the fitness of a population in its own habitat is greater than in other habitats, is often invoked in management practices, even in the absence of supporting evidence. Despite increasing attention to the potential for G*E interactions, few studies have tested multiple populations and environments simultaneously, limiting our understanding of the spatial consistency in patterns of adaptive genetic variation. In addition, few studies explicitly differentiate adaptation in response to predation from other biological and environmental factors. We conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment of first-generation eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) juveniles from six populations across three field sites spanning 1000 km in the southeastern Atlantic Bight in both the presence and absence of predation to test for G*E variation in this economically valuable and ecologically important species. We documented significant G*E variation in survival and growth, yet there was no evidence for local adaptation. Condition varied across oyster cohorts: Offspring of northern populations had better condition than offspring from the center of our region. Oyster populations in the southeastern Atlantic Bight differ in juvenile survival, growth, and condition, yet offspring from local broodstock do not have higher survival or growth than those from farther away. In the absence of population-specific performance information, oyster restoration and aquaculture may benefit from incorporating multiple populations into their practices.

TI  - Development of experimental setup of High Temperature Helium Loop and preparation for In-Pile Operation
AB  - Rapidly increasing energy and electricity demands, global concerns over the climate changes and strong dependence on foreign fossil fuels supplies are powerfully influencing greater use of nuclear power. In order to establish the viability of next-generation reactor concepts to meet tomorrow's needs for clean and reliable energy production the fundamental research and development issues need to be addressed for the Generation-IV nuclear-energy systems. Generation-IV reactor concepts are being developed to use more advanced materials, coolants and higher burn-ups fuels, while keeping a nuclear reactor safe and reliable. One of the six Generation-IV concepts which will utilize thermal neutron spectrum is a Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR). This reactor concept uses a graphite-moderated core with a once-through uranium fuel cycle, using high temperature helium as the coolant. Because helium is naturally inert and single-phase, the helium-cooled reactor can operate at much higher temperatures, leading to higher efficiency. Current VHTR concepts will use fuels such as uranium dioxide, uranium carbide, or uranium oxycarbide. Since some of these fuels are new in nuclear industry and due to their unknown properties and behaviour within VHTR conditions it is very important to address these issues by investigate their characteristics within conditions close to those in VHTRs. This research can be performed in a research reactor with in-pile helium loop designed and constructed in Research Centre Rez, Ltd. The purpose of the High Temperature Helium Loop (HTHL) is to simulate technical and chemical conditions of VHTR's coolant. The loop is intended to serve an as experimental device for fatigue and creep tests of construction metallic materials for gas-cooled reactors and it should be also employed for research in field of gaseous coolant chemistry. The loop will serve also for tests of nuclear graphite, dosing and Helium purification systems. Because the VHTR is a new reactor concept, major technical uncertainties remain relative to helium-cooled advanced reactor systems. This paper summarizes the concept of the HTHL in the Research Centre Rez Ltd., its design, utilization and future plans for experimental setup.

TI  - The effect of landscape on functional connectivity and shell shape in the land snail Humboldtiana durangoensis
VL  - 8
AB  - The populations of Humboldtiana durattgoensis have experienced a drastic reduction in the effective population size; in addition, the species is threatened by anthropogenic activities. For the aforementioned, landscape genetics will serve as a tool to define the potential evolutionarily significant units (ESU) for this species. To complete our objective, we evaluated the effect of cover vegetation and climate on the functional connectivity of the species from the last glacial maximum (LGM) to the present as well as the effect of climate on shell shape. Partial Mantel tests, distance-based redundance analysis and a Bayesian framework were used to evaluate connectivity. On the other hand, geometric morphometrics, phylogenetic principal component analysis and redundancy analysis were used for the analysis of shell shape. Our results suggest that the suitable areas have been decreasing since the LGM; also, vegetation cover rather than climate has influenced the genetic connectivity among land snail populations, although temperature had a high influence on shell shape in this species. In conclusion, vegetation cover was the main factor that determined the functional connectivity for the land snail; however, local selective pressures led to different phenotypes in shell shape that allowed us to postulate that each one of the previously defined genetic groups must be considered as a different ESU.

TI  - Economic Feasibility of Power Generation by Recovering Cold Energy during LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) Regasification
VL  - 6
IS  - 8
SP  - 10687-10695
AB  - Liquefied natural gas (LNG) has emerged as the leading option for global natural gas trade. Imported LNG must be regasified at the receiving terminal. The practice of using seawater as the heat source for regasification is a sheer waste of the available cold energy in LNG. In this study, power generation from LNG cold energy is investigated to reverse this wastage. We have developed a superstructure for this power generation process (PGP) that includes direct expansion of LNG and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) with simultaneous selection of the working fluid components and their compositions. Using a simulation-based optimization paradigm, the economic viability of the PGP is investigated by maximizing its net present value (NPV). Our results show that although a PGP with both direct expansion and ORC has a higher exergy efficiency, its NPV is nearly 64% lower than that of a PGP with ORC only. We present case studies for various combinations of process parameters and found that LNG regasification pressure has the maximum impact on NPV of the PGP followed by LNG feed temperature and composition. The maximum-NPV PGP uses only ORC and produces a net power of about 0.5-12.9 kW/t(LNG) after satisfying the power demand of the LNG regasification process. The NPV is about $6.87-2.45 million; thus, power generation by recovering cold energy in an LNG regasification terminal is economically viable. We also present a robust process design strategy to handle uncertainties in LNG composition.

AB  - Many tropical ectotherms are considered vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change because they have evolved to become thermal specialists. Indeed, several recent studies have suggested that even small increases in mean operative temperature may lead to a reduction in activity and the subsequent extinction of populations. Within the tropics, lizards are considered particularly vulnerable due to the potential for climate change to directly impact physiology and alter community interactions. However, models usually focus on the effects of mean operative temperature at the expense of other climate variables that may also affect lizard physiology. We used daily variation in operative temperature, humidity and wind speed to examine how changes in climate influence activity in two species of lizards from the island of Cayo Menor, Honduras. Anolis lemurinus is a forest species, whereas A.allisoni is an open-habitat species. We conducted daily surveys for active lizards in habitat typical to each species, while simultaneously measuring operative thermal environments with physical models. The effects of the thermal environment were considered in the context of the thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance for each species and compared with the effects of the hydric (humidity) and convective (wind) environments. When all surveys were combined into a single analysis, the activity of the forest species Anolis lemurinus was positively correlated with wind speed, the spatial heterogeneity of operative temperature, and the mismatch between mean operative temperature and the optimal temperature for sprint performance. Mean operative temperature did significantly affect Anolis lemurinus activity, but only when it was above their thermal optimum. Activity of the open-habitat species A.allisoni was negatively correlated with wind speed, but was not related to any other climate variable. Whereas the mismatch between mean operative temperature and the thermal optimum for performance predicted the activity level of the forest species in ways partially consistent with its use in models for the response of lizards to climate change, the effects of the abiotic environment were habitat dependent. Our results suggest that successfully predicting the biological impacts of climate change will require holistic models that account for more than changes in mean temperature alone.

TI  - DIFFERENCES IN THE REGULATION OF GROWTH AND BIOMINERALIZATION GENES REVEALED THROUGH LONG-TERM COMMON-GARDEN ACCLIMATION AND EXPERIMENTAL GENOMICS IN THE PURPLE SEA URCHIN
VL  - 67

SP  - 1901-1914
AB  - Across heterogeneous landscapes, populations may have adaptive differences in gene regulation that adjust their physiologies to match local environments. Such differences could have origins in acclimation or in genetically fixed variation between habitats. Here we use common-garden experiments to evaluate differences in gene expression between populations of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, spanning 1700 km and average temperature differences of 5 degrees C to 8 degrees C. Across expression profiles from 18,883 genes after 3 years of common conditions, we find highly correlated expression patterns (Pearson's r = 0.992) among most genes. However, 66 genes were differentially expressed, including many ribosomal protein and biomineralization genes, which had higher expression in urchins originally from the southern population. Gene function analyses revealed slight but pervasive expression differences in genes related to ribosomal function, metabolism, transport, bone development, and response to stimuli. In accord with gene expression patterns, a post-hoc spine regrowth experiment revealed that urchins of southern origin regrew spines at a faster rate than northern urchins. These results suggest that there may be genetically controlled, potentially adaptive differences in gene regulation across habitats and that gene expression differences may be under strong enough selection to overcome high, dispersal-mediated gene flow in this marine species.

TI  - Why do Californian striders fly?
VL  - 22
IS  - 1
SP  - 36-49
AB  - Discerning the adaptive significance of migratory strategies poses significant challenges, not the least of which is measuring migratory capability in natural populations. We take advantage of a visible migratory dimorphism to study variation in migratory capability in the stream-dwelling water strider, Aquarius remigis. Theory predicts loss of migratory capability in this species because streams have been viewed as stable and persistent habitats. As expected, A. remigis lack wings throughout most of North America. However, Californian populations are noted for unexpectedly high frequencies of winged, migratory morphs. To deduce the adaptive significance of this anomalous regional variation, we compare proportion winged among 37 Californian populations. We discover a strong, positive correlation with altitude, but no correlations with latitude, rainfall or stream size. A common garden experiment reveals that both proportion winged and its reaction norm to temperature differ genetically among populations, and a half-sibling experiment demonstrates that wing morph has high heritability, moderate genetic correlations across environments and a significant genotype by environment interaction. These results support the hypothesis that proportion winged and its reaction norm to temperature have diverged genetically in California. We conclude that high migratory capability is an evolutionary adaptation to the unusual harshness and instability of Californian stream habitats, and particularly to the high elevational gradients and extreme seasonal variation characteristic of montane streams.

TI  - Retention of plankton within ocean eddies
VL  - 25
IS  - 10
SP  - 1264-1277
AB  - AimMesoscale ocean eddies (closed circular currents typically 100-300 km in diameter) are ubiquitous features of the world's oceans. They form partially isolated environments with distinct physical and chemical conditions capable of supporting and transporting whole plankton communities. The productivity and biodiversity of these communities is ultimately dependent on an eddy's ability to retain planktonic organisms. Our aim was to estimate eddy retention time-scales across a range of oceanic environments and larval behaviours, with implications for both distributions and future changes in plankton communities. LocationThe Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. MethodsA particle-tracking model was forced using ocean currents from a number of validated hydrodynamic models covering environments ranging from shelf seas to the open ocean and equatorial to high-latitude waters. Eddies were seeded with large numbers of particles and their rate of loss from the eddy was used to estimate retention times. The influences of common plankton swimming behaviours were explicitly captured in the model. ResultsEddy retention times of modelled plankton ranged from 5 to 67 days, with a median of 19 days. Retention times were not correlated with latitude or eddy size. However, plankton residing near the surface of eddies rotating cyclonically (anticlockwise in the Northern Hemisphere) had significantly shorter retention times than those residing in the same eddy at depth, and vice versa for eddies rotating anticyclonically. Main conclusionsWe show that ocean eddies have the potential to retain and support planktonic (and even nektonic) communities over many generations and are likely to enhance larval survival for many invertebrate and fish species. Differences in retention with depth suggest that cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies will support differing plankton communities. If their relative geographical distributions change with global climate, then the relative proportions of diatom-based and dinoflagellate-based communities may also change, with potential implications for higher trophic animals.

VL  - 52

SP  - 292-299
AB  - Open pollinated progeny from eight maternal trees from three European populations of Ulmus laevis Pall. (European white elm) were cultivated in a growth chamber for one growth period in either a well watered or a drought stress treatment. Traits important for adaptation such as growth rate, time of budset and final dry weight were measured. Two leaves were removed from each plant for analysis of leaf morphology, as described by moment invariants and elliptic Fourier coefficients. We used univariate and multivariate analyses of variance to calculate genetic parameters in order to answer the questions: i) How much genetic variation is present in populations and families of U. laevis? ii) What is the effect of the water regime on the expression of genetic variation? Treatment effects and genotype rank changes were relatively small, but the strongly significant population and family differentiation across and within treatments for most adaptive traits and for some of the leaf shape components suggest that there is substantial additive genetic variation within these populations of U. laevis which could serve as a genetic basis for adaptation to future changes in water availability. Furthermore, the amounts of genetic variation for adaptive traits and leaf morphology were of similar magnitude within both watering regimes, i.e. there was no straightforward relationship between the water treatments and the expression of genetic variation.

VL  - 48

AB  - Members of the genus Ebolavirus cause fulminating outbreaks of disease in human and non-human primate populations with a mortality rate up to 90%. To facilitate rapid detection of these pathogens in clinical and environmental samples, robust reagents capable of providing sensitive and specific detection are required. In this work recombinant antibody libraries were generated from murine (single chain variable domain fragment; scFv) and nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum (IgNAR V) hosts immunised with Zaire ebolavirus. This provides the first recorded IgNAR V response against a particulate antigen in the nurse shark. Both murine scFv and shark IgNAR V libraries were panned by phage display technology to identify useful antibodies for the generation of immunological detection reagents. Two murine scFv were shown to have specificity to the Zaire ebolavirus viral matrix protein VP40. Two isolated IgNAR V were shown to bind to the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and to capture viable Zaire ebolavirus with a high degree of sensitivity. Assays developed with IgNAR V cross-reacted to Reston ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus and Bundibugyo ebolavirus. Despite this broad reactivity, neither of IgNAR V showed reactivity to Cote divoire ebolavirus. IgNAR V was substantially more resistant to irreversible thermal denaturation than murine scFv and monoclonal IgG in a comparative test. The demonstrable robustness of the IgNAR V domains may offer enhanced utility as immunological detection reagents in fieldable biosensor applications for use in tropical or subtropical countries where outbreaks of Ebolavirus haemorrhagic fever occur.

Thermal inactivation of peroxidase in mint leaves was kinetically investigated at the temperature range of 70100 degrees C. Applicability of various enzyme inactivation models available in the literature was critically evaluated. The Weibull distribution model provided a good description of the kinetics of inactivation of peroxidase in mint leaves over the selected temperatures.

TI  - Basal cold but not heat tolerance constrains plasticity among Drosophila species (Diptera: Drosophilidae)
VL  - 24
IS  - 9
SP  - 1927-1938
AB  - Thermal tolerance and its plasticity are important for understanding ectotherm responses to climate change. However, it is unclear whether plasticity is traded-off at the expense of basal thermal tolerance and whether plasticity is subject to phylogenetic constraints. Here, we investigated associations between basal thermal tolerance and acute plasticity thereof in laboratory-reared adult males of eighteen Drosophila species at low and high temperatures. We determined the high and low temperatures where 90% of flies are killed (ULT90 and LLT90, respectively) and also the magnitude of plasticity of acute thermal pretreatments (i.e. rapid cold-and heat-hardening) using a standardized, species-specific approach for the induction of hardening responses. Regression analyses of survival variation were conducted in ordinary and phylogenetically informed approaches. Low-temperature pretreatments significantly improved LLT90 in all species tested except for D. pseudoobscura, D. mojavensis and D. borealis. High-temperature pretreatment only significantly increased ULT90 in D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. LLT90 was negatively correlated with low-temperature plasticity even after phylogeny was accounted for. No correlations were found between ULT90 and LLT90 or between ULT90 and rapid heat-hardening (RHH) in ordinary regression approaches. However, after phylogenetic adjustment, there was a positive correlation between ULT90 and RHH. These results suggest a trade-off between basal low-temperature tolerance and acute low-temperature plasticity, but at high temperatures, increased basal tolerance was accompanied by increased plasticity. Furthermore, high-and low-temperature tolerances and their plasticity are clearly decoupled. These results are of broad significance to understanding how organisms respond to changes in habitat temperature and the degree to which they can adjust thermal sensitivity.

AB  - The environmental degradation caused by the increased use of fossil fuels in the energy sector, call for an urgent switch to alternative energy sources which can assure sustainability, energy security and reliability. So far, solutions based on Renewable Energy Sources (RES) have been proved reliable in providing energy even in autonomous networks, if they combine different sources (e.g. solar and wind) or combined with conventional energy generators. Among the promising solutions to the energy problem is the geothermal energy which consists of stored energy in the earth in the form of water or steam at high pressure and temperature. The countries which are most likely to possess a high geothermal potential are those located in seismic zones close to destructive and constructive plate margins. Greece is among the countries that, due to location, possesses a remarkable geothermal potential of medium and high enthalpy fields. The interest in exploiting geothermal energy in Greece for electricity generation is mainly focused on non-interconnected islands, where energy is produced from oil-based generators with high energy cost, mainly during the summer months which is a period of rapid increase in energy demand. In this respect, the present study investigates, through an economic evaluation, the optimum sizing of a hybrid solution, which includes a geothermal power plant and a solar field of concentrated collectors able to cover the energy needs of an isolated island. The combination of solar and geothermal energy source aims to maintain the long-term productivity of the geothermal field by reducing its degradation ratio. The thermal energy, generated by the solar installation, increases the temperature of the geothermal brine before injected it back into the well and therefore reduces its energy degradation. In this study, different cases of solar field sizes are evaluated in order to achieve the optimum combination of the geothermal power plant and the concentrated solar array. According to the results, the proposed installation can guarantee energy autonomy with increased economic efficiency and competitive energy production cost, compared to the current prices in small isolated Aegean Sea islands.

TI  - Profiling of Host Cell Proteins by Two-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis (2D-DIGE): Implications for Downstream Process Development
VL  - 105

SP  - 306-316
AB  - Host cell proteins (HCPs) constitute a major group Of impurities for biologic drugs produced using cell culture technology. HCPs are required to be closely monitored and adequately removed in the downstream process. However, HCPs are a complex mixture of proteins with significantly diverse molecular and immunological properties. An overall understanding of the composition of HCPs and changes in their molecular properties upon changes in upstream and harvest process conditions can greatly facilitate downstream process design. This article describes the use of a comparative proteomic profiling method viz. two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) to examine HCP composition in the harvest stream of CHO cell culture. The effect of upstream process parameters such as cell culture media, bioreactor control strategy, feeding strategy, and cell Culture duration/cell viability on HCP profile was examined using this technique. Among all the parameters studied, cell viability generated the most significant changes on the HCP profile. 2D-DIGE was also used to compare the HCP differences between monoclonal antibody producing and null cell cultures. The HCP species in production cell culture was found to be well represented in null Cell Culture, which confirms the suitability of using the null cell culture for immunoassay reagent generation. 2D-DIGE is complimentary to the commonly used HCP immunoassay. It provides a direct comparison of the changes in HCP composition under different conditions and can reveal properties (pI, MW) of individual species, whereas the immunoassay sensitively quantifies total HCP amount in a given sample.

VL  - 19

AB  - Increasing surface air temperature is a fundamental characteristic of a warming world. Rising temperatures have potential impacts on human health through heat stress. One heat stress metric is the wet-bulb globe temperature, which takes into consideration the effects of radiation, humidity, and wind speed. It also has broad health and environmental implications. This study presents wet-bulb globe temperatures calculated from the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis and combines it with health guidelines to assess heat stress variability and the potential for reduction in labor hours over the past decade on both the continental and urban scale. Compared to 2010-2014, there was a general increase in heat stress during the period from 2015 to 2019 throughout the northern hemisphere, with the largest warming found in tropical regions, especially in the northern part of the Indian Peninsula. On the urban scale, our results suggest that heat stress might have led to a reduction in labor hours by up to similar to 20% in some Asian cities subject to work-rest regulations. Extremes in heat stress can be explained by changes in radiation and circulation. The resultant threat is highest in developing countries in tropical areas where workers often have limited legal protection and healthcare. The effect of heat stress exposure is therefore a collective challenge with environmental, economic, and social implications.

VL  - 241
SP  - 514-524
AB  - Amine-based carbon dioxide capture is the most mature technology for reducing flue gas CO2 emissions. It has been postulated and observed during commercialisation of this technology that significant quantities of waste amines are produced. Further industrial implementation of this technology requires adequate disposal or valorisation options for this waste. This review presents an analysis of seven biological and chemical technologies for waste amine amelioration or valorisation. Of these, the biological treatments are identified as being more mature for industrial application with the capacity for marketable product generation. Slow speed is the main drawback of the biological processes but this does not hinder their commercial viability. Using waste amine for NOx reduction in power stations is a secondary option, where it seems probable that the amount of waste amine generated in the CO2 capture plant is sufficient to fulfil the DeNOx requirements of the flue gas. This route, however, requires investigation into the impact of waste amine impurities on the power station and the CO2 capture plant operations.

SP  - 901-908
AB  - The rapid increase of world energy demand over the past decades has led to an extensive exploitation of the planet's natural resources. Given that the population growth will continue for the next decades, there is an urgent need for a switch to Renewable Energy Sources (RES). One of the promising solutions to the energy problem is the geothermal energy which consists of stored energy in the earth in the form of water or steam at high pressure and temperature. Countries located in seismic zones possess a high geothermal potential due to their position at destructive and constructive plate margins. Greece is one of the countries with a remarkable potential in geothermal energy of medium and high enthalpy fields. Interest in the exploitation of geothermal fields for electricity generation is mainly focused on non-interconnected Greek islands, where energy is produced from oil-based generators with high energy cost and low-quality electricity, mainly during the summer months which is a period of high energy demand. In this respect, the present study investigates the possibility of combining a geothermal power plant with a concentrated solar array to provide energy to an autonomous island grid. Since the productivity of geothermal fields is gradually decreasing over the years, the combination of solar with geothermal energy source aims to the extension of the productive lifetime of the field, achieved by reheating the geothermal fluid during reinjection to the injection well. The thermal energy, generated by concentrated solar collectors, increases the temperature of the geothermal brine and reduces the energy degradation of the field. In this study, the energy efficiency of different reheat values are studied in order to achieve the combination of a geothermal power plant and a concentrated solar field that can meet specific targets for lifetime energy production. According to the results, the proposed installation can merely contribute to the energy autonomy of the island grid during periods of low demand and provide energy security in periods of high energy consumption.

TI  - Spatial variation in high temperature-regulated gene expression predicts evolution of plasticity with climate change in the scarlet monkeyflower
VL  - 31
IS  - 4
SP  - 1254-1268
AB  - A major way that organisms can adapt to changing environmental conditions is by evolving increased or decreased phenotypic plasticity. In the face of current global warming, more attention is being paid to the role of plasticity in maintaining fitness as abiotic conditions change over time. However, given that temporal data can be challenging to acquire, a major question is whether evolution in plasticity across space can predict adaptive plasticity across time. In growth chambers simulating two thermal regimes, we generated transcriptome data for western North American scarlet monkeyflowers (Mimulus cardinalis) collected from different latitudes and years (2010 and 2017) to test hypotheses about how plasticity in gene expression is responding to increases in temperature, and if this pattern is consistent across time and space. Supporting the genetic compensation hypothesis, individuals whose progenitors were collected from the warmer-origin northern 2017 descendant cohort showed lower thermal plasticity in gene expression than their cooler-origin northern 2010 ancestors. This was largely due to a change in response at the warmer (40 degrees C) rather than cooler (20 degrees C) treatment. A similar pattern of reduced plasticity, largely due to a change in response at 40 degrees C, was also found for the cooler-origin northern versus the warmer-origin southern population from 2017. Our results demonstrate that reduced phenotypic plasticity can evolve with warming and that spatial and temporal changes in plasticity predict one another.

TI  - ALASKA'S RENEWABLES-SOURCE FUEL ENERGY STORAGE PILOT PLANT: TOWARD COMMUNITY ENERGY INDEPENDENCE VIA SOLID STATE AMMONIA SYNTHESIS (SSAS)
AB  - Alaska village survival is threatened by the high cost of imported fuels for heating, electricity generation, and vehicles. During Winter 2007-8, the price per gallon of heating oil and diesel generation fuel exceeded $8 in many villages. Many villagers were forced to move to Anchorage or Fairbanks. Although indigenous renewable energy (RE) resources may be adequate to supply a community's total annual energy needs, the innate intermittent and seasonal output of the renewables - except geothermal, where available, which may be considered "baseload" - requires large-scale, low-cost energy storage to provide an annually-firm energy supply. Anhydrous ammonia, NH3, is the most attractive, carbon-free fuel for this purpose at Alaska village scale, because of its 17.8% mass hydrogen content and its high energy density as a low-pressure liquid, suitable for storage in inexpensive mild steel tanks. NH3 may be synthesized directly from renewable-source electricity, water, and atmospheric nitrogen (N-2) via solid state ammonia synthesis (SSAS), a new process to be pioneered in Alaska.

TI  - Growth and survival of Enterobacter sakazakii in human breast milk with and without fortifiers as compared to powdered infant formula
VL  - 122

SP  - 171-179
AB  - Enterobacter sakazakii infections often involve debilitated neonates Consuming contaminated I the possibility that expressed human breast milk can become contaminated with E. sakazakii in the hospital or home setting and through the use Of contaminated breast milk fortifiers. In addition, although breast milk has been shown to have some antimicrobial effects, this has not been extensively researched in regards to E. sakazakii. Thus, we examined the Survival and growth of 9 strains of E. sakazakii in breast milk, human breast milk with fortifiers and powdered infant formula at 10, 23 and 37 degrees C. The average generation times for clinical, food and environmental isolates in breast milk were 0.94 +/- 0.04, 0.75 +/- 0.04 and 0.84 +/- 0.04 h at 23 degrees C; and 0.51 +/- 0.03, 0.33 +/- 0.03 and 0.42 +/- 0.03 h at 37 degrees C, respectively. E. sakazakii was able to Survive up to 12 days in breast milk with fortifiers at 10 degrees C. However, its average generation times among replicates and isolate sources ranged from 11.97 +/- 3.82 to 27.08 +/- 4.54 h in breast milk at 10 degrees C. Interestingly, average generation times in breast milk with fortifiers at 23 degrees C (0.83 +/- 0.05, 0.93 +/- 0.06 and 0.96 +/- 0.06 h) and 37 degrees C (0.41 +/- 0.04, 0.51 +/- 0.05 and 0.54 +/- 0.05 h) were longer than in powdered infant formula and breast inilk at the same temperatures, indicating that human breast milk fortifiers may have an inhibitory effect on the growth of E. sakazakii. However, the intrinsically ascribed antimicrobial properties of breast inilk do not appear to inhibit the growth of this foodborne pathogen in-vitro. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A theoretical study of the reaction of N(S-4) with nitrogen dioxide on the N2O2 potential energy surface
VL  - 86
IS  - 9
SP  - 1438-1446
AB  - The reaction of N((4) S) radical with NO2 molecule has been studied theoretically using density functional theory and ab initio quantum chemistry method. Both singlet and triplet electronic state [N2O2] potential energy surfaces (PESs) are calculated at the G3B3 level of theory. Also, the highly cost-expensive coupled-cluster theory including single and double excitations and perturbative inclusion of triple excitations CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ single-point energy calculation is performed on the basis of the geometries obtained at the Becke's three parameter Lee-Yang-Parr B3LYP/6-311++G(d, p) level. On the singlet PES of the title reaction, it is shown that the most feasible pathway should be as follows. The atomic radical N attacking the NO bond of the NO2 molecule first to form the adduct 1 N(NO)O, followed by one of the NO bond broken to give intermediate 2 ONNO, and then to the major products P1 (2NO). On the triplet PES of the title reaction, it is shown that the most favorable pathway should be the atomic radical N attacking the N-atom of NO2 firstly to form the adduct 7 NN(OO), followed by one of the NO bonds breaking to give intermediate 8 NNOO, and then leading to the major products P2 (O-2 + N-2). As efficient routes to the reduction of NO2 to form N-2 and O-2 are sought, both kinetic and thermodynamic considerations support the viability of this channel. All the involved transition states for generation of (2NO), (O-3 + N2O), and (O-2 + N-2) lie much lower than the reactants. Thus, the novel reaction N + NO2 can proceed effectively even at low temperatures and it is expected to play a role in both combustion and interstellar processes. The other reaction pathways are less competitive due to thermodynamical or kinetic factors. On the basis of the analysis of the kinetics of all path-ways through which the reactions proceed, we expect that the competitive power of reaction pathways may vary with experimental conditions for the title reaction. The calculated reaction heats of formation are in good agreement with that obtained experimentally.

TI  - Dissociation of carbon dioxide in arrays of microchannel plasmas
VL  - 52
IS  - 11
AB  - Energy efficiencies above eta = 12% have been observed for the non thermal dissociation of pure carbon dioxide (i.e. in the absence of carrier gas) at atmospheric pressure in arrays of microchannel plasmas. Microplasma 'chips' similar to those developed for the plasmachemical production of ozone from O-2 or air (Kim et al 2017 Eur. Phys. J. Spec. Top. 226 2923) generate spatially uniform, abnormal glow plasmas in >= 1 atm. of CO2 and consume 1-8 W of average power when driven by sinusoidal or bipolar pulsed voltage waveforms (pulse repetition frequency of 15-20 kHz). Fabricated in nanoporous alumina, the microchannels are 250 mu m in width. 150 mu m in depth, and 3 an in length, and the array on each chip typically comprises 12 channels. Intense emission from microplasma arrays, recorded over the similar to 335-700 nm spectral interval when E/N approximate to 100 Td, is dominated by CO2+ ((A) over tilde (2)Pi -> (X) over tilde (2)Pi) fluorescence which indicates that both CO2+ and electronically-excited CO (e.g. CO*) are generated primarily by multistep electron impact processes. Dissociative recombination of the CO2+ ((X) over tilde) ground state species appears to also be a contributing factor in CO* production. Owing to the modest power consumption and active volume of a single chip, the CO generation efficiency for a single array is 45 g kWh(-1) for a CO2 flow rate of 70 sccm and the dissociation efficiency is 4.3%. The connection of four chips in tandem in a commercial module increases the CO2 dissociation efficiency to 20% and similar to 11% for flow rates of 70 sccm and 200 sccm, respectively. Data acquired with multiple chips confirms the scalability of the CO2 dissociation process, and suggests the economic viability of the commercial production of CO for the synthesis of formic acid, methanol, and syngas.

TI  - Supervised machine learning of thermal comfort under different indoor temperatures using EEG measurements
VL  - 225
AB  - In this paper, machine learning techniques in conjunction with passive EEG (electroencephalogram) measurement were explored to classify occupants' real-time thermal comfort states, which have the potential in the future for energy saving through adopting time varying set points when real-time changes in thermal comfort can require less energy input. The performances of different machine learning techniques were compared, and the method to select linear continuous features for class interpolation was also explored. For the full-set features, the performances of different classifiers were satisfactory, with classification rates all above 90%. The LDA classifier had the best performance. The second best was the NB classifier, and the relatively worst was the KNN classifier. The linear continuous EEG features were selected by interpolation and can be found for all human subjects. Higher selection threshold led to less selected features but higher average performance of these features. In general, the EEG based machine learning methods can classify occupants' real-time thermal comfort states, and could potentially lead to more building energy saving through comfort-driven time varying set points.

TI  - Current state of biogas production in Croatia
VL  - 10
IS  - 1
AB  - For biogas production, different renewable feedstocks, e.g., feces, manure, silage, industrial by-products, and municipal waste, can be used. Biogas production from various renewable feedstocks has positive socioeconomic and environmental impact. In Europe, biogas is mainly used for generating heat and electricity. It consists of methane (55-70% by volume), carbon dioxide (30-45% by volume), and small amounts of other compounds. In some cases, biogas is upgraded to pure biomethane and utilized as vehicle fuel, instead of fossil fuels, thus reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. Biomethane can also serve as a platform chemical in chemical and biochemical synthesis to produce value-added products. The additional positive effects of anaerobic digestion of animal manure and slurries are organic waste degradation, reducing odors, and pathogens. Digestate, obtained as a by-product of anaerobic digestion, is rich in nutrients and therefore is applied as fertilizer in agriculture. Biogas production in Croatia is mainly based on manure and by-products from agriculture, food industry, and slaughterhouses. The obtained biogas is mostly used for electricity and heat generation. Potential for large-scale biogas production in Croatia is still insufficiently used, although various renewable feedstocks are available. More rational and focused management of lignocellulosic residues, animal excrements, food processing by-products, and biodegradable fraction of municipal waste could contribute to the development of Croatian biogas sector. Biogas production in Croatia can be affected by the changes of animal breeding capacity due to the struggle to cope with the European Union (EU) standards and prices. Concerning large unused agricultural areas, great potential lies in their rational exploitation for fast-growing biomass, e.g., for energy crops or perennial grasses. This review will discuss the potential of biogas in the industrial and farming sector, current state of biogas production, and various key drivers and barriers influencing biogas production in Croatia.

TI  - Development of a program for high-temperature design evaluation according to RCC-MRx
VL  - 324
SP  - 181-195
AB  - A web-based design evaluation program is developed for the elevated temperature design (ETD) analysis according to the RCC-MRx for Generation IV and fusion reactor systems. The program, named 'HITEP_RCC-MRx,' is composed of two modules: 'HITEP_RCC-DBA,' which computerizes the design-by-analysis (DBA) for class 1 components according to RB-3200 procedures, and 'HITEP_RCC-PIPE,' which computerizes the design-by-rule (DBR) analysis for class 1 piping according to RB-3600 procedures. Each module performs three major design evaluations on load-controlled stress, inelastic strain and creep-fatigue damage in a reliable and efficient way. The program is verified with a number of components and piping systems in sodium test facilities subjected to high temperature loading for the DBA module and the DBR module, respectively. Since HITEP_RCC-MRx is programmed with web-based language, it can operate on a smartphone as well as on a personal computer once it is connected to an internet or WIFI. Comparisons of the ETD codes of RCC-MRx and ASME Section III Subsection NH are made in terms of the programmability and reproduction of the evaluation results. A new creep model proposed for Grade 91 steel is incorporated in the program for comparison of creep behaviors between the creep models of RCC-MRx and the new Garofalo creep model for Grade 91 steel. Comparisons for verification between the evaluation results from HITEP_RCC-MRx and direct calculations using Excel confirm that the HITEP_RCC-MRx performs ETD evaluations in an efficient and reliable way.

TI  - Phenology and plasticity can prevent adaptive clines in thermal tolerance across temperate mountains: The importance of the elevation-time axis
VL  - 12
IS  - 10
AB  - Critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin) decrease with elevation, with greater change in CTmin, and the risk to suffer heat and cold stress increasing at the gradient ends. A central prediction is that populations will adapt to the prevailing climatic conditions. Yet, reliable support for such expectation is scant because of the complexity of integrating phenotypic, molecular divergence and organism exposure. We examined intraspecific variation of CTmax and CTmin, neutral variation for 11 microsatellite loci, and micro- and macro-temperatures in larvae from 11 populations of the Galician common frog (Rana parvipalmata) across an elevational gradient, to assess (1) the existence of local adaptation through a P-ST-F-ST comparison, (2) the acclimation scope in both thermal limits, and (3) the vulnerability to suffer acute heat and cold thermal stress, measured at both macro- and microclimatic scales. Our study revealed significant microgeographic variation in CTmax and CTmin, and unexpected elevation gradients in pond temperatures. However, variation in CTmax and CTmin could not be attributed to selection because critical thermal limits were not correlated to elevation or temperatures. Differences in breeding phenology among populations resulted in exposure to higher and more variable temperatures at mid and high elevations. Accordingly, mid- and high-elevation populations had higher CTmax and CTmin plasticities than lowland populations, but not more extreme CTmax and CTmin. Thus, our results support the prediction that plasticity and phenological shifts may hinder local adaptation, promoting thermal niche conservatism. This may simply be a consequence of a coupled variation of reproductive timing with elevation (the "elevation-time axis" for temperature variation). Mid and high mountain populations of R. parvipalmata are more vulnerable to heat and cool impacts than lowland populations during the aquatic phase. All of this contradicts some of the existing predictions on adaptive thermal clines and vulnerability to climate change in elevational gradients.

TI  - ECOPHYSIOLOGY OF MARINE FISH RECRUITMENT - A CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING INTERANNUAL VARIABILITY
VL  - 32
IS  - 2
SP  - 135-152
AB  - Present data and our application of logic do not permit confident rejection of the null hypothesis: Interannual variation in recruitment of marine fishes (typified by certain flatfishes) is independent of ecophysiological factors. Our inability to reject this hypothesis reflects not its likely validity but rather a lack of conceptual structure and appropriate data for realistic evaluation of alternative hypotheses. Therefore, in this paper, we set aside as presently intractable the problem of understanding in any generalizable way the specific effects of environment on interannual variation in marine fish recruitment. Instead, we return to a conceptual scheme first proposed almost 50 years ago by F.E.J. Fry for considering effects of environmental factors on the physiology of fishes. We first extend this scheme to population-level responses, including recruitment, and then even further, to community/ecosystem-level responses. Fry supposed that all of environment can be resolved into five classes of physiological effects-controlling (which set the pace of metabolism), limiting (which constrain maximum metabolism), lethal (which completely interdict metabolism), masking (which increase obligatory metabolic work), and directive (which release and unload metabolism by guiding enviroregulatory responses). We suggest that corresponding effects can be recognized at the levels both of population and community/ecosystem. The key analogy is that environment operates on individuals through metabolism, on populations through recruitment, and on communities/ecosystems through abiotic and biotic diversification. In the context of marine-fish populations, we propose that scope for population increase is the difference between maximum and maintenance recruitment to the spawning stock. Maintenance recruitment is the product of critical spawner density and spawner mortality rate; this product varies with environment as the resultant of controlling effects on the metabolism of individuals, and is increased by loading due to masking factors-e.g, predation-that increase one or both multiplicands. Maximum recruitment is limited by deficiencies of resources, primarily food, but also, potentially, by low spawner density. Population-level lethal factors cause extinction, by reducing population scope to sub-zero values for a time exceeding the generation interval. Directive factors distribute the population in space and time, influencing not only habitat use and zoogeographic range, but also providing context for genetic adaptation and speciation. Exploration of this conceptual scheme from the perspective of flatfish life-history strategies and population dynamics, leads to several testable ecophysiological hypotheses about recruitment.

AB  - (MO)CVD have proven to be the most preferred technology for the fabrications of layers and structures of complex material systems. Since more than 2 decades; this technology is employed as key technology for the development, research and manufacturing of compound semiconductors for optical and high speed electrical devices like HB-LEDs, Laser, HBTs, HEMT etc. The main reason is that the flexibility and productivity with this deposition technology is unrivaled today. Similarly, low manufacturing costs for blue and green high brightness LEDs using the high temperatures process (up to 1200degreesC) for Nitrides are achieved with the introduction of an MOCVD technology with a capacity of up to 24 x 2". But the technological limit of the MOCVD technology in terms of temperature, capacity and application is still not reached today. As example, MOCVD is today used for the large scale deposition technology for SiC materials on 7 x 2" wafers at 1600degreesC. But tools for 4" will be required soon. Also MOCVD is expected to be the technology of choice in the Silicon industry for the next generation of devices like memories using highK dielectrics and ferroelectrics: And why not for the deposition of organic materials for electrical and optical device application?

TI  - A novel hybrid and interactive solar system consists of Stirling engine/vacuum evaporator thermoelectric cooler for electricity generation and water distillation
VL  - 153
SP  - 1053-1066
AB  - This paper introduces a novel hybrid and interactive solar system to generate electricity and produce desalinated water. The system consists of a Stirling engine driven by concentrated solar radiation and cooled by saline water. Also, the system consists of an evacuated evaporator chamber to evaporate the saline water and thermoelectric cooler, driven by Stirling engine, to condensate the distilled water. The novelty of the system is in its positive interactivity since each component and product enhances the performance and productivity of others. The rejected heat from both the cold side of Stirling engine and the hot side of the TEC modules is used to heat the saline water before entering the evaporator. Also, the cold side of the TEC modules is used to enhance the condensation and hence the desalination rate. The importance of the second enhancement technique relays in the fact that many applications do not suffer from the absence of hot evaporative heating sources but suffer from the absence of condensation cool surfaces. A steady-state mathematical model has been proposed and validated by being compared with published data. The results show that at an optimized design point (solar radiation of 700 W/m2, wind speed of 5 m/s, swept volume of 210 cm(3), dish diameter of 2.68 m, etc.), the overall efficiency of the system was 65.8% with a net output power of 506 W and desalinated water of 28 kg/day. Including the TEC system has enhanced the condensation rate from 2.93 kg/day to 34.14 kg/day and the efficiency from 22.84% to 54.87%. Also, the two preheating effects (rejected heat from Stirling engine and from TEC modules) enhance the desalination rate from 2.93 kg/day to 11.74 kg/day and efficiency from 22.84% to 34.53%. Combining both enhancement techniques increase the desalination rate from 2.93 kg/day to 40.96 kg/day and efficiency from 22.84% to 64.44%. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Conventional practices of synthesis, manufacturing, and processing have led to severe adverse consequences for living beings and the environment. Objectives: Although medications cannot be replaced, the methods of synthesizing, manufacturing, and processing them can be changed and/or replaced. This paper explains the significance of green chemistry practices in the pharmaceutical industry. It emphasizes that we must replace conventional drug synthesis, processing, and manufacturing techniques with greener ones that are cost-effective, sustainable, environment-friendly, and profitable. Discussion: This paper comprises five sections. Section 1 is an introduction to green chemistry and its correlation with the pharmaceutical industry. Section 2 discusses the metrics necessary to measure the greenness of a process. Section 3 is about solvents used in the pharmaceutical industry, hazards, safety status, and environmental effects, including the ozone depletion potential. Section 4 explains catalytic amidation reactions because amides are one of the most commonly occurring functional groups with pharmacological activity. Section 5 discusses successful cases of converting conventional synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients and/or their intermediates to greener, sustainable alternatives. Conclusion: A balance is necessary between profits, processes, consumers, and the environment to ensure the survival of all stakeholders and decrease the environmental burden of pharmaceuticals. Incentives such as green chemistry awards should be endorsed and encouraged, in addition to making green chemistry part of tertiary education. In addition, changes to rules and regulations for drug approval in the context of green chemistry principles are necessary in order to preserve our planet for future generations.

AB  - The thermal inactivation of selected microbes was studied using the low temperature long time (LTLT), high temperature short time (HTST) and 'pot' pasteurization methods. Survivors were enumerated after heating for up to 40 min for the LTLT and HTST pasteurization methods and after heating for up to 30 min for the 'pot' pasteurization method. With the exception of the Bacillus cereus strain, the selected microbes did not survive the LTLT and HTST pasteurization methods. The results from the 'pot' pasteurizer showed that B. cereus, Chryseobacterium meningosepticum, Pseudomonas putida, Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli strains survived the pasteurization conditions applied, showing that the 'pot' pasteurizer does not pasteurize effectively.

IS  - 1
AB  - Background: An increasing number of ecological processes have been incorporated into Earth system models. However, model evaluations usually lag behind the fast development of models, leading to a pervasive simulation uncertainty in key ecological processes, especially the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle. Traceability analysis provides a theoretical basis for tracking and quantifying the structural uncertainty of simulated C storage in models. Thus, a new tool of model evaluation based on the traceability analysis is urgently needed to efficiently diagnose the sources of inter-model variations on the terrestrial C cycle in Earth system models. Methods: A new cloud-based model evaluation platform, i.e., the online traceability analysis system for model evaluation (TraceME v1.0), was established. The TraceME was applied to analyze the uncertainties of seven models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Results: The TraceME can effectively diagnose the key sources of different land C dynamics among CMIIP6 models. For example, the analyses based on TraceME showed that the estimation of global land C storage varied about 2.4 folds across the seven CMIP6 models. Among all models, IPSL-CM6A-LR simulated the lowest land C storage, which mainly resulted from its shortest baseline C residence time. Over the historical period of 1850-2014, gross primary productivity and baseline C residence time were the major uncertainty contributors to the inter-model variation in ecosystem C storage in most land grid cells. Conclusion: TraceME can facilitate model evaluation by identifying sources of model uncertainty and provides a new tool for the next generation of model evaluation.

TI  - Tectonics of early Earth: Some geodynamic considerations
VL  - 440
SP  - 157-171
AB  - Today, plate tectonics is the dominant tectonic style on Earth, but in a hotter Earth tectonics may have looked different due to the presence of more melting and associated compositional buoyancy as well as the presence of a weaker mantle and lithosphere. Here we review the geodynamic constraints on plate tectonics and proposed alternatives throughout Earth's history. Observations suggest a 100-300 degrees C mantle potential temperature decrease since the Archean. The use of this range by theoretical studies, parameterized convection studies, and numerical simulations puts a number of constraints on the viability of the different tectonic styles. The ability to sufficiently cool early Earth with its high radiogenic heat production forms one of the major constraints on the success of any type of tectonics. The viability of plate tectonics is mainly limited by the availability of sufficient driving forces and lithospheric strength. Proposed alternative mechanisms include local or global magma oceans, diapirism, independent dynamics of crust and underlying mantle, and large-scale mantle overturns. Transformation of basaltic crust into dense eclogite is an important driving mechanism, regardless of the governing tectonic style.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE MGE DM412 TRANSPOSITIONS - INDUCED BY HEAVY HEAT-SHOCK IN DROSOPHILA
VL  - 28
IS  - 3
SP  - 68-86
AB  - Heavy heat shock treatment (HHS: 37-degrees-C for 2 h, then 4-degrees-C for 1 h, and in this way three times in succession) of males from the isogenic Drosophila line was shown to induce mass transpositions of MGE Dm412 among descendants and multiple ones in separate individuals. The probabilities of transpositions in control sample and after HHS are equal, correspondingly, to < 3,3. .10(-4) and 7,2 . 10(-2) transpositions per site, per spermium, per generation. The <<hot sites>> of transpositions were discovered. Multisite patterns of the sample (<<HSI haplotypes>>) were shown to be random combinations of independent single-site transpositions. The <<hot>> HSI haplotypes (66A, 43B-49CD and 43B-49CD-56A-56E) as well as the <<cold>> ones were found. Real multiplicity of <<hot>> and <<cold>> HSI haplotypes among descendants of separate males is substantially higher (l congruent-to 5 and more) than the expected ones (l = 1). The hypothesis was formulated which explains this fact and some others by the influence of HSI haplotypes of the spermia fertility, and possibly, on acceleration of generative cells' mitoses. This results in selective 10-fold increase in such HSI haplotypes portion among male generative cell population. Minimal probabilities of emergence of separate HSI haplotypes were estimated as 3 . 10(-2) events per chromosome, per genome, per fly generation - for "hot" HSI haplotypes and 3 . 10(-3) for <<cold>> ones. The chromosomal HSI haplotypes were supposed to arise as single independent events after HHS. Thus, the phenomenon of transpositions by HHS could be estimated as statistically significant and real.

TI  - The Techno-Economic Comparison of Solar Power Generation Methods for Turkish Republic of North Cyprus
SP  - 17-23
AB  - The objective of this work is to examine and compare the techno-economic and environmental feasibility of 40MW photovoltaic (PV) power plant and 40MW parabolic trough (PT) power plant to be installed in two different cities, namely Nicosia and Famagusta in Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). Long term solar radiation and sunshine data for Nicosia and Famagusta are considered and analysed to assess the distribution of solar radiation, sunshine duration, and air temperature. In addition, these two different technologies with same rated power of 40MW will be compared with the performance of the proposed Solar Power Plant at Bari, Italy. The project viability analysis is performed using System Advisor Model (SAM) through Annual Energy Production and economic parameters for both cities. It is found that for the two cities; Nicosia and Famagusta, considered through this study, the PT plants produce more energy than PV plant. It is also observed that installation of the PT system near an existing steam turbine power plant will make the investment more feasible if the steam produced by the PT system is used to run the steam turbine power plant. The high temperatures that are used to produce steam for the turbines in the PT plant system can be supplemented with a secondary plant based on natural gas or other biofuels and can be used as backup. Although the initial investment of PT plant is higher, it has higher economic return and occupies smaller area compared to PV plant of the same capacity.

VL  - 19
IS  - 1
SP  - 64-75
AB  - Sublethal plant defences, resulting in impaired growth of insect herbivores, may increase the impact of natural enemies upon those herbivores. This study examined whether such effects could be reproduced by chemically altering host growth rates. Fresh residues of piperonyl butoxide (a compound which slows growth in nymphs of the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius)) showed relatively little toxicity to adults and larvae of the parasitoid Eretmocerus mundus (Mercet), and once residues were 48 h old, they caused no discernible Lethal or behavioral effects on adult wasps. Piperonyl butoxide had lethal effects on whitefly nymphs, but immature parasitoids continued to develop successfully in those hosts that survived. The hypothesis that slowing the growth rate of hosts might lead to increased parasitism by E. mundus was tested on large host populations in controlled temperature cabinets over two generations. On host populations of comparable size, highly significant increases in parasitism (7-8%, P < 0.0001) were observed. This work provides unique evidence that host growth rates can be artificially manipulated to confer advantage to parasitoids, The implications for biological control strategies and an understanding of plant allelochemical effects are discussed, (C) 2000 Academic Press.

TI  - Multi-Approaches Analysis Reveals Local Adaptation in the Emmer Wheat (Triticum dicoccoides) at Macro- but not Micro-Geographical Scale
VL  - 10
IS  - 3
AB  - Detecting local adaptation and its spatial scale is one of the most important questions of evolutionary biology. However, recognition of the effect of local selection can be challenging when there is considerable environmental variation across the distance at the whole species range. We analyzed patterns of local adaptation in emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides, at two spatial scales, small (inter-population distance less than one km) and large (inter-population distance more than 50 km) using several approaches. Plants originating from four distinct habitats at two geographic scales (cold edge, arid edge and two topographically dissimilar core locations) were reciprocally transplanted and their success over time was measured as 1) lifetime fitness in a year of planting, and 2) population growth four years after planting. In addition, we analyzed molecular (SSR) and quantitative trait variation and calculated the Q(ST)/F-ST ratio. No home advantage was detected at the small spatial scale. At the large spatial scale, home advantage was detected for the core population and the cold edge population in the year of introduction via measuring life-time plant performance. However, superior performance of the arid edge population in its own environment was evident only after several generations via measuring experimental population growth rate through genotyping with SSRs allowing counting the number of plants and seeds per introduced genotype per site. These results highlight the importance of multi-generation surveys of population growth rate in local adaptation testing. Despite predominant self-fertilization of T. dicoccoides and the associated high degree of structuring of genetic variation, the results of the Q(ST) - F-ST comparison were in general agreement with the pattern of local adaptation at the two spatial scales detected by reciprocal transplanting.

AB  - The effect of temperature on the developmental period and oviposition of the Tea Rust Mite, Acaphylla theavagrans Kadono, was examined by rearing the mite on tea (Camellia sinensis). The developmental periods from egg to egg on mature tea leaves were 22.4, 16.5, 11.4, 9.3 and 7.7 days at 15 degrees C, 18 degrees C, 21 degrees C, 24 degrees C and 27 degrees C, respectively. The developmental zero and total effective temperature for one generation were estimated to be 9.1 degrees C and 137.2 day-degrees, respectively. Oviposition was observed at all tested temperature, and the number of eggs per female increased with increasing temperature. Adult longevity and pre-ovipositional period were shortened with increasing temperature. The fecundity zero, which was estimated by regression analysis on the average number of eggs per oviposited female per day at five different temperature was 8.7 degrees C. The intrinsic rate of natural increase was higher at higher temperatures, and the values were 0.037 and 0.181 at 15 degrees C and 27 degrees C, respectively.

TI  - Physiological basis of starvation resistance in Drosophila leontia: analysis of sexual dimorphism
VL  - 217
IS  - 11
SP  - 1849-1859
AB  - Geographically varying starvation stress has often been considered as a natural selector that constrains between-population differences for starvation resistance (SR) in Drosophila species. On the Indian subcontinent, a dozen Drosophila species have shown clinal variations in SR across latitude, but the evolved physiological basis of such contrasting adaptations is largely unknown. In the present study, I untangled the physiological basis of sex-specific as well as between-population divergence for SR in D. leontia, collected across a latitudinal transect of the Indian subcontinent (11 degrees 45'- 31 degrees 19'N). Secondly, I tested the assumptions that hardening to starvation stress facilitates an increased survival under subsequent lethal levels of starvation, and such plastic effects differ between the sexes. I observed several interesting results. In contrast to a steeper cline of starvation-related traits with latitude in females, a shallower gradient was observed for males. Females stored higher (similar to 1.3-fold) dry-mass-specific levels of body lipids and glycogen contents, and utilized these both of these energy resources under starvation stress, whereas the starved males metabolized only body lipids as a source of energy. Conversely, the rate of body lipid utilization and threshold need were considerably higher in females as compared with males. Between-population differences were significant for storage levels of energy reserves only, but not for other avenues (rate of metabolite utilization and threshold need) of SR for both sexes. These findings indicate that multiple pathways shape the physiological basis of sexual dimorphism for SR in D. leontia. Further, single or multiple bouts of starvation hardening conferred an increased longevity (similar to 4-9 h; P<0.001) under subsequent lethal levels of starvation stress for females only, and such plastic responses were consistent with a decrease in rate of metabolite utilization. Nevertheless, between-population effects were non-significant for absolute hardening capacity (AHC=K-SR-C). Altogether, these findings suggest that similar evolutionary constraints have resulted in divergent genetic as well as plastic responses to evolve adaptations under starvation stress, and account for the observed sexual dimorphism for basal SR in D. leontia.

TI  - Expression and Simple Purification Strategy for the Generation of Antimicrobial Active Enterocin P from Enterococcus faecium Expressed in Escherichia coli ER2566
VL  - 12
IS  - 4
SP  - 17-25
AB  - Background: Enterocin-P of Enterococcus faecium P13 (EntP) is of great interest as a food preservative and medicine due to its non-toxicity and broad antimicrobial spectrum at various pH, as well as its excellent thermal stability. However, recombinant production of EntP is still in laboratory because of low productivity and complex purification process. Objectives: In this study, we aimed to develop efficient methods for high-level expression and convenient purification of the recombinant EntP. Materials and Methods: An artificially synthesized gene (entP) of 132 bp encoding mature enterocin P of E. faecium P13 was cloned in plasmid pTWIN1 under the control of an inducible T7lac promoter for expression of fusion protein EntP-Mxe GyrA mini-intein-chitin binding domain (CBD) (abbreviated by EntP-Int-CBD) in E. coli. Recombinant EntP was released from the fusion protein by DTT digestion and cleaned by distilled water and checked for anti-bacterial activity. Results: The fusion protein was highly expressed in insoluble form in E. coli at 37 degrees C with 0.05 mM IPTG induction. The insoluble fusion protein EntP-Int-CBD was easily prepared by cell sonication and centrifugation to remove soluble contaminants. The repeat washing steps with Triton X-100 were applied to reduce contaminants. After DTT-induced self-digestion in urea 4 M, the EntP released from the fusion protein was insoluble in water and easier to be separated from soluble Int-CBD by centrifugation. The recombinant peptide was soluble in 20% 2-propanol in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and exhibited strong anti-Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus activities. Conclusions: This study is the first report providing a simple, quick and straight forward procedure for heterologous production of functional and pure Enterocin P without using any chromatography columns in the purification process.

TI  - Air Humidification-Dehumidification Process for Desalination: A review
VL  - 80
AB  - The humidification-dehumidification desalination system is known as an appealing process for small and medium scales, and high-salinity water desalination. These systems consist of humidifier and dehumidifier as the main components, energy sources for heating and electrical energy generation, accessories used for the fluid transfer or efficiency improvement, and measurement/control devices. Different system designs are reported and categorized based on enhancement in productivity, energy consumption and effective parameters such as gained output ratio, specific electrical energy consumption and production cost. According to input energy types and used components, these systems react differently, and the performance parameters change. This literature reviews past/current status and future ideas about humidification-dehumidification systems to pave the way for the researchers to improve this technology. All technologies that improve the humidification-dehumidification system performance via using efficient constitutes, renewable energy, heat recovery via multi-effect and multi-stage processes, accelerating the humidification and dehumidification processes by pressure variation or using heat pump as well as exergy and cost analyses are clarified. It is concluded that despite improving humidification-dehumidification system as a promising process for decentralized small-scale freshwater production applications, it requires further development to improve the system performance based on gained output ratio and economy.

TI  - Continuous Flow Synthesis of a Blocked Polyisocyanate: Process Intensification, Reaction Monitoring Via In-Line FTIR Analysis, and Comparative Life Cycle Assessment
VL  - 25
IS  - 10
SP  - 2367-2379
AB  - The traditional batch production of blocked polyisocyanates, key components in the preparation of self-cross-linking resins, has significant drawbacks associated with the exothermic character of the reaction and the high viscosity of some of the materials involved. We have developed a continuous flow strategy for the generation of a methyl ethyl ketoxime-blocked polyisocyanate. The neat oxime and the viscous polyisocyanate were pumped and mixed in continuous flow using a Kenics static mixer. The homogeneous mixture obtained was fully converted to the target blocked polyisocyanate in a residence time unit downstream of the mixer. Real-time reaction monitoring, via in-line Fourier-transform infrared analysis at the reactor outlet, has been implemented, enabling fast optimization of the reaction conditions and providing a sensitive and reliable method to control product quality. The process has been intensified in flow by stepwise increase of the temperature of the residence time unit. Full conversion after only 15 s of overall residence time has been achieved at 155 degrees C, providing a productivity of ca. 1 kg per hour for a reactor of only 4.5 mL volume. The ecological impacts of a conceptualized upscaled flow process compared to the industrial batch procedure have been evaluated by a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) according to the ISO 14040/44 LCA framework. The LCA results illustrate the capabilities of continuous processing to enable more sustainable production of blocked polyisocyanates.

SP  - 1059-1067
AB  - The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, is an invasive pest species, first detected in Italy in 2012. Only 2 years after this first detection, increasing damage was reported in fruit orchards in the Emilia Romagna region, the first invaded area, which is one of the most important regions for the Italian and European fruit production. In the present study, life table parameters of H. halys populations were investigated in Italy under typical temperate/Mediterranean climate conditions representative of southern Europe. Our findings indicate that in Italy H. halys has two generations/year and very high reproductive rates for both generations (R-0 = 24.04 and 5.44 for the overwintering and summer generation, respectively). The huge growth rates explain why in 2015 a massive outbreak of H. halys was observed in Italy, and these rates confirm that the pest is a threat for agricultural production in southern Europe. The parameters obtained in this study are essential for the development and optimization of sustainable management strategies.

TI  - Solution processed high performance piezoelectric eggshell membrane - PVDF layer composite nanogenerator via tuning the interfacial polarization
VL  - 863
AB  - Bio-compatible and eco-friendly flexible piezoelectric nanogenerators with transparency are emerging energy devices for next-generation energy application. A novel high performance natural, biodegradable and flexible eggshell membrane - polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) based piezoelectric nanogenerator has been developed using a low-temperature solution and spin coating route. X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman patterns exhibited all characteristic signature peaks of the eggshell membrane and PVDF film. Piezoelectric pristine PVDF, eggshell membrane and eggshell membrane-PVDF layered structure based nanogenerators are fabricated using the flexible ITO coated PET substrate and spin coating technique. The fabricated device of eggshell membrane-PVDF layer exhibited better performance with very high output voltage and current of 15 V and 150 nA as compared to 2 V and 20 nA electric output generation from pristine PVDF film based device under same compressive strain, without electric poling. Dielectric properties of piezoelectric PVDF film and eggshell membrane-PVDF were also measured to analyze the working mechanism of the nanogenerator. Hybrid eggshell membrane-PVDF structure shows very high dielectric constant (260) as compared to pristine PVDF (22). A very high output voltage with an average value of 65 V was also obtained from electrical poled hybrid nanogenerator under force of about 10 kgf. Such high piezoelectric output voltage and current from biodegradable eggshell membrane-PVDF based flexible piezoelectric nanogenerator was attributed to dramatic increase in interfacial polarization, capacitance and improved piezoelectric properties of PVDF and triple helical structure created polarization induced electrical dipole moment in the eggshell membrane lattice. The results not only provide a new way to utilize the solid waste for generating green energy from mechanical vibration but also an agent to increase the performance of the PVDF based nanogenerator for powering next generation self-powered implantable medical devices with reduced e-waste elements.

AB  - The elm leaf beetle (ELB) causes severe damage to California's elms. The goal was to develop a management system based on long-term population monitoring for decision making, and environmentally sound control methods. English and Siberian elms with ELB populations in 25 locations from the northeast to the central coast of California were sampled from 1985 to 1990. Population monitoring has indicated that each ELB generation (two to three per season) varies unpredictably in its potential for causing foliage damage. Each generation needs to be sampled and decisions made for control measures most suitable for that generation. From the data base, we have developed a sampling system in which heat accumulation above 11-degrees-C at ELB sites, measured in degree-days, indicates when to sample and, if necessary, when to treat. Sampling elm branch terminals for the presence of ELB eggs during the limited time when egg laying is near its peak provides a cost-effective means of predicting foliage damage, and thus of deciding whether control actions are necessary. Two control options compatible with ELB natural enemies have been tested: trunk banding with Carbaryl and Bacillus thuringiensis foliar sprays. A number of strains of the egg parasitoid Tetrastichus gallerucae have been released and at least one strain has survived over winter. When the number of these parasitoids has increased sufficiently, either through same season releases or from overwintering survival, they have exerted substantial control.

TI  - A facility for long-term Mars simulation experiments: The Mars Environmental Simulation Chamber (MESCH)
VL  - 8
IS  - 3
SP  - 537-548
AB  - We describe the design, construction, and pilot operation of a Mars simulation facility comprised of a cryogenic environmental chamber, an atmospheric gas analyzer, and a xenon/mercury discharge source for UV generation. The Mars Environmental Simulation Chamber (MESCH) consists of a double-walled cylindrical chamber. The double wall provides a cooling mantle through which liquid N-2 can be circulated. A load-lock system that consists of a small pressure-exchange chamber, which can be evacuated, allows for the exchange of samples without changing the chamber environment. Fitted within the MESCH is a carousel, which holds up to 10 steel sample tubes. Rotation of the carousel is controlled by an external motor. Each sample in the carousel can be placed at any desired position. Environmental data, such as temperature, pressure, and UV exposure time, are computer logged and used in automated feedback mechanisms, enabling a wide variety of experiments that include time series. Tests of the simulation facility have successfully demonstrated its ability to produce temperature cycles and maintain low temperature ( down to -140 degrees C), low atmospheric pressure (5-10 mbar), and a gas composition like that of Mars during long-term experiments.

TI  - Can sea urchins beat the heat? Sea urchins, thermal tolerance and climate change
VL  - 3
AB  - The massive die-off of the long-spined sea urchin, Diadema antillarum, a significant reef grazer, in the mid 1980s was followed by phase shifts from coral dominated to macroalgae dominated reefs in the Caribbean. While Diadema populations have recovered in some reefs with concomitant increases in coral cover, the additional threat of increasing temperatures due to global climate change has not been investigated in adult sea urchins. In this study, I measured acute thermal tolerance of Diadema antillarum and that of a sympatric sea urchin not associated with coral cover, Echinometra lucunter, over winter, spring, and summer, thus exposing them to substantial natural thermal variation. Animals were taken from the wild and placed in laboratory tanks in room temperature water (similar to 22 degrees C) that was then heated at 0.16-0.3 degrees C min(-1) and the righting behavior of individual sea urchins was recorded. I measured both the temperature at which the animal could no longer right itself (T-LoR) and the righting time at temperatures below the T-LoR. In all seasons, Diadema antillarum exhibited a higher mean T-LoR than Echinometra lucunter. The mean T-LoR of each species increased with increasing environmental temperature revealing that both species acclimatize to seasonal changes in temperatures. The righting times of Diadema antillarum were much shorter than those of Echinometra lucunter. The longer relative spine length of Diadema compared to that of Echinometra may contribute to their shorter righting times, but does not explain their higher T-LoR. The thermal safety margin (the difference between the mean collection temperature and the mean TLoR) was between 3.07-3.66 degrees C for Echinometra and 3.79-5.67 degrees C for Diadema. While these thermal safety margins exceed present day temperatures, they are modest compared to those of temperate marine invertebrates. If sea temperatures increase more rapidly than can be accommodated by the sea urchins (either by genetic adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, or both), this will have important consequences for the structure of coral reefs.

VL  - 125
IS  - 7
SP  - 361-364
AB  - Effects of temperature on egg, larval and pupal developmental times of the leek moth were examined at five constant temperatures ranging from 12 to 20 degreesC. Using this data, a linear degree-day model for the leek moth was developed. The model gave the threshold temperature of T-h = 6 degreesC, and 630 degree-days were required above the threshold temperature, to complete the development of the leek moth. To validate the model in the field, flight activity during the summers of 1998 and 1999 was studied using pheromone traps. If the summer is warm the leek moth can have two generations per year in Sweden, but the probability of completing two generations within leek plantations is very limited. The likelihood of the leek moth becoming a pest is highly dependent on access to alternative host plants for the first generation of leek moths.

TI  - Flexible use of a dynamic energy landscape buffers a marine predator against extreme climate variability
VL  - 288
IS  - 1956
AB  - Animal migrations track predictable seasonal patterns of resource availability and suitable thermal habitat. As climate change alters this 'energy landscape', some migratory species may struggle to adapt. We examined how climate variability influences movements, thermal habitat selection and energy intake by juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) during seasonal foraging migrations in the California Current. We tracked 242 tuna across 15 years (2002-2016) with high-resolution archival tags, estimating their daily energy intake via abdominal warming associated with digestion (the 'heat increment of feeding'). The poleward extent of foraging migrations was flexible in response to climate variability, allowing tuna to track poleward displacements of thermal habitat where their standard metabolic rates were minimized. During a marine heatwave that saw temperature anomalies of up to +2.5 degrees C in the California Current, spatially explicit energy intake by tuna was approximately 15% lower than average. However, by shifting their mean seasonal migration approximately 900 km poleward, tuna remained in waters within their optimal temperature range and increased their energy intake. Our findings illustrate how tradeoffs between physiology and prey availability structure migration in a highly mobile vertebrate, and suggest that flexible migration strategies can buffer animals against energetic costs associated with climate variability and change.

TI  - PEDOT:PSS interfaces stabilised using a PEGylated crosslinker yield improved conductivity and biocompatibility
VL  - 7
IS  - 31
SP  - 4811-4820
AB  - The rapidly expanding fields of bioelectronics, and biological interfaces with electronic sensors and stimulators, are placing an increasing demand on candidate materials to serve as robust surfaces that are both biocompatible, stable and electroconductive. Amongst conductive polymers, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a promising material in biomedical research due to its appropriate stability and high conductivity, however its intrinsic solubility requires a crosslinking process that can limit its conductivity and biocompatibility. Poly(ethylene glycol) is known to be a suitably anti-immunogenic moiety and its derivatives have been widely used for biomedical applications. In this study we investigate the application of poly(ethylene glycol)diglycidyl ether (PEGDE) as an effective crosslinker and conductive filler for PEDOT:PSS. From our interpretation of XPS analysis we hypothesise that the crosslinking reaction is occurring via the epoxy ring of PEGDE interacting with the sulfonic groups of excel PSS chains, which reaches a saturation at 3 w/v% PEGDE concentration. PEGDE crosslinked films did not disperse in aqueous environments, had enhanced electrical conductivity and imparted a significant degree of hydrophilicity to PEDOT:PSS films. This hydrophilicity and the presence of biocompatible PEGDE led to good cell viability and a significantly increased degree of cell spreading on PEDOT:PSS films. In comparison to widely reported chemical crosslinking via glycidoxy propyltrimethoxysilane (GOPS), this original crosslinking yields a highly hydrophilic 2D film substrate with increased electroconductive and biocompatibility properties, resulting in a next-generation formulation for bioengineering applications.

TI  - First-year selective withdrawal performance of the Shasta Dam temperature control device
SP  - 944-949
AB  - Dramatic declines in winter-run chinook salmon populations has resulted in their listing as a protected species, in 1989, under the Federal and California State Endangered Species Acts. One of several factors limiting salmon populations is egg and fry mortality associated with elevated water temperatures in the upper Sacramento River. Since 1987, water temperatures in the upper Sacramento River have been managed to protect endangered salmon species by releasing deeper, colder water from Shasta Lake using the low-level outlet works. However, these releases bypassed the power plant so hydroelectric generation was greatly reduced. For example, bypass releases from 1987 through 1996 have an estimated combined cost of $63 million in replacement power costs. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA), passed in 1992, elevated fish and wildlife protection and restoration to equal importance with the original project objectives of flood control, irrigation, navigation, and power production. As part of the CVPIA, Reclamation was ordered to construct and operate a temperature control device (TCD) at Shasta Dam which would control release water temperatures in the upper Sacramento River to minimize Salmon mortality. The TCD was designed to selectively withdraw water from Shasta Lake over a wide range of levels to meet water temperature targets in the upper Sacramento River. Shasta TCD operations will improve the control of river temperature, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen which will significantly improve the spawning and rearing success of the winter, fall, and spring chinook salmon runs. During the first summer of operation, the Shasta TCD allowed project operators to meet water quality standards while continuing to fulfill contractual obligations for water delivery and power generation. This paper will summarize the TCD's selective withdrawal performance during its first year of operation.

TI  - Characteristics and Evaluation of the High-Quality Source Rocks of Cretaceous Continental Shale Oil in Tonghua Basin, China
VL  - 93
IS  - 1
SP  - 146-154
AB  - The presence of shale oil in the Cretaceous Hengtongshan Formation in the Tonghua Basin, drilled by the well TD-01, has been discussed in this geological investigation for the first time. To evaluate the high-quality source rocks of Cretaceous continental shale oil, the distribution characteristics and the evolution of the ancient environment, samples of shale were systematically analyzed in terms of sedimentary facies, organic geochemistry, and organic carbon isotopic composition. The results demonstrate that a TOC value of 1.5% represents the lower-limit TOC value of the high-quality source rocks. Source rocks have an aggregate thickness of 211 m and contain abundant organic matter, with TOC values of 2.69% on average and a maximum value over 5.44%. The original hydrocarbon-generative potential value (S-1+S-2) is between 0.18 mg/g and 6.13 mg/g, and the R-o is between 0.97% and 1.40%. The thermal maturation of the source rocks is relatively mature to highly mature. The C-13 value range is between -34.75 parts per thousand and -26.53 parts per thousand. The ratio of saturated hydrocarbons to aromatic hydrocarbons is 1.55 to 5.24, with an average of 2.85, which is greater than 1.6. The organic types are mainly type II1, followed by type I. The organic carbon source was C-3 plants and hydrophytes. The paleoclimate of the Hengtongshan Formation can be characterized as hot and dry to humid, and these conditions were conducive to the development of high-quality source rocks. A favorable paleoenvironment and abundant organic carbon sources provide a solid hydrocarbon generation base for the formation and accumulation of oil and gas in the shale of the Tonghua Basin.

TI  - EFFECTS OF PRIOR STRESS RELAXATION ON THE PREDICTION OF CREEP LIFE USING TIME AND STRAIN BASED METHODS
VL  - 135
IS  - 4
SP  - 365-376
AB  - A critical requirement for both next generation conventional and nuclear plants is the development of simplified inelastic design and fitness for purposes procedures that give a reasonably accurate prediction of the complex multiaxial time dependent stress strain behavior. The accumulation of this inelastic strain in the form of coupled creep-fatigue damage over time is one of the principal damage mechanisms which will eventually lead to crack initiation in critical, high temperature equipment. Two main procedures that address creep-fatigue loading are generally used, either a time fraction or a ductility exhaustion approach. It is generally accepted that these methods enable conservative predictions within a factor of 2 to 3 and hence are reliable methods for code based design and fitness for purpose type assessments. However, for complex cycles, this may not be the case; for example, prior relaxation cycles are found to accelerate the creep rupture of the material with the result that a significant reduction in creep life can be observed. An investigation was undertaken into the influence of prior relaxation on resultant failure using a typical low alloy ferritic power station steel. Both time-based and strain based methods were used to predict the damage caused by the stress relaxation cycles followed by operation at steady state. The predictions found that while ductility exhaustion methodologies based on mean properties were adequate in predicting the failure life, time fraction methods were found to be extremely nonconservative for mean properties and only lower bound solutions provided an estimate of remaining creep life. The ASME time fraction approach, using isochronous curves was found to be extremely conservative for K = 0.67, but was able to predict similar damages to ductility exhaustion when K = 1 was used. The Monkman-Grant approach resulted in predictions that erred on the conservative side. The results have implications for both current and future conventional and nuclear power stations as it may be difficult for time based approaches to account accurately for complex cycling, shakedown conditions or stress relaxation at welds.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA differentiation between populations of black sea bass (Centropristis striata) across Cape Hatteras, North Carolina (USA)
VL  - 40
IS  - 7
SP  - 1386-1398
AB  - Aim Phylogeographical breaks' often occur at biogeographical province boundaries, suggesting common causative factors. Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, on the US Atlantic coast, separates water masses of sharply differing temperature and divides the Virginian and Carolinian provinces, but has not often been detected as a phylogeographical break. We studied the black sea bass, Centropristis striata (Linnaeus, 1758), a species with philopatric adults but long-lived planktonic larvae. An earlier study of only two Atlantic populations, and lower-resolution mitochondrial RFLP markers, showed strong separation between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, but not across Cape Hatteras. Location Over 300 adults were collected from populations from the Gulf of Mexico, the US south Atlantic (North Carolina south of Cape Hatteras, the east coast of Florida, and South Carolina), and the US mid-Atlantic (North Carolina north of Cape Hatteras, Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey and Massachusetts). Methods We sequenced the mitochondrial control region, analysed DNA sequence and haplotype frequency differentiation and haplotype networks, and performed coalescent analyses of population sizes and migration rates. Results Sequences formed three clusters - Gulf of Mexico, south Atlantic and mid-Atlantic - the Atlantic clusters being divided at Cape Hatteras. Analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that 31% of sequence variation was between populations on opposite sides of Cape Hatteras, while only 5% was between populations on the same side, yet migrate analysis detected asymmetric migration across the Cape, greater from north to south than in the opposite direction. A transitional population with roughly equal frequencies of south and mid-Atlantic haplotypes occupied a narrow stretch between Cape Hatteras and the Virginia border. Main conclusions Strong barriers to gene flow exist between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic, and across Cape Hatteras. Adult migratory and spawning behaviours that separate mid-Atlantic and south Atlantic populations, limited larval exchange, and selection imposed by thermal gradients are each potentially responsible. In addition, these data indicate that fishery stocks of black sea bass north and south of Cape Hatteras are genetically distinct, supporting their separate management.

TI  - Empirical evidence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation influence on land surface phenology and productivity in the western United States
VL  - 159
SP  - 167-180
AB  - Timing of plant life cycle events (phenology) and annual plant productivity represent key interactions between the climate system and the biosphere, with implications and feedbacks for climate and ecosystem functions. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system is a dominant source of interannual climate variability in the western United States, with important effects on temperature, precipitation, and drought. In this study, we examine the connection between ENSO and terrestrial vegetation dynamics using MOD17 annual net primary productivity (NPP) and land surface phenology derived from MODIS and AVHRR vegetation indices. Three phenology metrics-start of growing season (SOS), end of growing season (EOS), and length of growing season (LOS)-were estimated separately for El Nino and La Nina years by fitting difference logistic functions to split-sample time series of the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (for the period 2000-2011) and AVHRR-derived 3rd generation GIMMS NDVI (NDVI3g) for two temporal periods (2000-2011 and 1982-2011). El Nino events were associated with a significantly earlier SOS than La Nina events in most regions of the western U.S. ENSO-related differences in timing of the end of growing season were generally smaller and more heterogeneous. ENSO impacts on total length of the growing season tended to be spatially heterogeneous but mostly positive in El Nino years. Relative to La Nina events, El Nino events were generally associated with significantly higher NPP in each ecoregion (with mean differences ranging from 2 to 45 gC m(-2) year(-1)). The correlation between total annual production and the Southern Oscillation Index was highest in mid- to late-winter prior to the growing season, suggesting some predictive power in advance of the growing season. These results suggest that future intensification of the ENSO system could have serious consequences for terrestrial ecosystems in the western U.S., especially in regions where ENSO already has a strong impact on interannual climate variability and vegetation dynamics.

TI  - Predicting Maize Phenology: Intercomparison of Functions for Developmental Response to Temperature
VL  - 106
IS  - 6
SP  - 2087-2097
AB  - Accurate prediction of phenological development in maize (Zea mays L.) is fundamental to determining crop adaptation and yield potential. A number of thermal functions are used in crop models, but their relative precision in predicting maize development has not been quantified. The objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the precision of eight thermal functions, (ii) to assess the effects of source data on the ability to differentiate among thermal functions, and (iii) to attribute the precision of thermal functions to their response across various temperature ranges. Data sets used in this study represent >1000 distinct maize hybrids, >50 geographic locations, and multiple planting dates and years. Thermal functions and calendar days were evaluated and grouped based on their temperature response and derivation as empirical linear, empirical nonlinear, and process-based functions. Precision in predicting phase durations from planting to anthesis or silking and from silking to physiological maturity was evaluated. Large data sets enabled increased differentiation of thermal functions, even when smaller data sets contained orthogonal, multi-location and -year data. At the highest level of differentiation, precision of thermal functions was in the order calendar days < empirical linear < process based < empirical nonlinear. Precision was associated with relatively low temperature sensitivity across the 10 to 26 degrees C range. In contrast to other thermal functions, process-based functions were derived using supra-optimal temperatures, and consequently, they may better represent the developmental response of maize to supra-optimal temperatures. Supra-optimal temperatures could be more prevalent under future climate-change scenarios, but data sets in this study contained few data in that range.

TI  - Proteobacteria become predominant during regrowth after water disinfection
VL  - 573
SP  - 313-323
AB  - Disinfection processes aim at reducing the number of viable cells through the generation of damages in different cellular structures and molecules. Since disinfection involves unspecific mechanisms, some microbial populations may be selected due to resilience to treatment and/or to high post-treatment fitness. In this study, the bacterial community composition of secondarily treated urban wastewater and of surface water collected in the intake area of a drinking water treatment plant was compared before and 3-days after disinfection with ultraviolet radiation, ozonation or photocatalytic ozonation. The aim was to assess the dynamics of the bacterial communities during regrowth after disinfection. In all the freshly collected samples, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the predominant phyla (40-50% and 20-30% of the reads, respectively). Surface water differed from wastewater mainly in the relative abundance of Actinobacteria (17% and <5% of the reads, respectively). After 3-days storage at light and room temperature, disinfected samples presented a shift of Gammaproteobacteria (from 8 to 10% to 33-65% of the reads) and Betaproteobacteria (from 14 to 20% to 31-37% of the reads), irrespective of the type of water and disinfection process used. Genera such as Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter or Rheinheimera presented a selective advantage after water disinfection. These variations were not observed in the non-disinfected controls. Given the ubiquity and genome plasticity of these bacteria, the results obtained suggest that disinfection processes may have implications on the microbiological quality of the disinfected water.

TI  - Analysis of the Potential for Gas Micro-Cogeneration Development in Poland Using the Monte Carlo Method
VL  - 13
IS  - 12
AB  - Micro-cogeneration (mCHP) is a promising solution for the generation of heat and electricity in households, it contributes to reducing carbon dioxide emissions in countries where the production of electricity is mainly based on fossil fuels. Its dissemination in Poland faces barriers in the form of high purchase prices in relation to electricity productivity. In this work 1% of the household population in Poland was analyzed using the Monte Carlo method. It was found that for mCHP to become economically profitable for a group of at least 10,000 households, its price should fall from around 18,000 euros (711.5 euros/kW(th)and 18,000 euros/kW(e)) to 4800 euros (189.7 euros/kW(th)and 4800 euros/kW(e)) and for 100,000 households to 4100 euros (162.1 euros/kW(th)and 4100 euros/kW(e)). These calculations were made for fixed gas and electricity prices. The analysis also included cases of various changes in gas and energy prices. Faster growth of electricity prices than gas prices reduce the profitability barrier. In addition, a building located in Lesser Poland region was analyzed, with an above average demand for electricity and heat. Gas micro-cogeneration becomes profitable for this household at a price of 3700 euros (146.2 euros/kW(th)and 3700 euros/kW(e)) at fixed gas and electricity prices.

TI  - Parallel evolution and adaptation to environmental factors in a marine flatfish: Implications for fisheries and aquaculture management of the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus)
VL  - 11

SP  - 1322-1341
AB  - Unraveling adaptive genetic variation represents, in addition to the estimate of population demographic parameters, a cornerstone for the management of aquatic natural living resources, which, in turn, represent the raw material for breeding programs. The turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) is a marine flatfish of high commercial value living on the European continental shelf. While wild populations are declining, aquaculture is flourishing in southern Europe. We evaluated the genetic structure of turbot throughout its natural distribution range (672 individuals; 20 populations) by analyzing allele frequency data from 755 single nucleotide polymorphism discovered and genotyped by double-digest RAD sequencing. The species was structured into four main regions: Baltic Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Adriatic Sea, and Black Sea, with subtle differentiation apparent at the distribution margins of the Atlantic region. Genetic diversity and effective population size estimates were highest in the Atlantic populations, the area of greatest occurrence, while turbot from other regions showed lower levels, reflecting geographical isolation and reduced abundance. Divergent selection was detected within and between the Atlantic Ocean and Baltic Sea regions, and also when comparing these two regions with the Black Sea. Evidence of parallel evolution was detected between the two low salinity regions, the Baltic and Black seas. Correlation between genetic and environmental variation indicated that temperature and salinity were probably the main environmental drivers of selection. Mining around the four genomic regions consistently inferred to be under selection identified candidate genes related to osmoregulation, growth, and resistance to diseases. The new insights are useful for the management of turbot fisheries and aquaculture by providing the baseline for evaluating the consequences of turbot releases from restocking and farming.

TI  - Direct coupling of a high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell with hydrogen produced by catalytic partial dehydrogenation of a gasoline-ethanol blend (E10)
VL  - 498
AB  - The on-board partial dehydrogenation of gasoline to generate hydrogen of sufficient purity to feed a fuel cell directly requires catalysts producing high purity hydrogen at high rate, while also preserving the defining density and boiling point properties of gasoline to allow its recycle to the fuel tank. Here, hydrogen of purity >98% is produced by the catalytic partial dehydrogenation of gasoline SP95E10 (containing 10% ethanol) with a productivity of 2300 NL.h(-1).kgcat(-1) using a Pt-Sn-In/alumina catalyst prepared by templating and incipient wetness impregnation. The hydrogen is used to feed a high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell. The difference in performance between the fuel cell fed with pure hydrogen and with hydrogen generated from gasoline reaches only 13 mV at 200 mA cm(-2) at 160 degrees C, and the loss is completely recovered when the anode gas stream is reverted to pure hydrogen. Such reversible performance loss is attributable to the presence of carbon monoxide that is formed from oxygenated hydrocarbons during the partial dehydrogenation reaction. The depleted gasoline retains its physical properties and presents significantly lower sulfur content, opening prospects for power generation on-board a vehicle with a fuel cell using hydrogen produced on demand from its primary fuel.

TI  - The Covariance between Genetic and Environmental Influences across Ecological Gradients Reassessing the Evolutionary Significance of Countergradient and Cogradient Variation
VL  - 1168
SP  - 100-+
AB  - Patterns of phenotypic change across environmental gradients (e.g., latitude, altitude) have long captivated the interest of evolutionary ecologists. The pattern and magnitude of phenotypic change is determined by the covariance between genetic and environmental influences across a gradient. Cogradient variation (CoGV) occurs when covariance is positive: that is, genetic and environmental influences on phenotypic expression are aligned and their joint influence accentuates the change in mean trait value across the gradient. Conversely, countergradient variation (CnGV) occurs when covariance is negative: that is genetic and environmental influences on phenotypes oppose one another, thereby diminishing the change in mean trait expression across the gradient. CnGV has so far been found in at least 60 species, with most examples coming from fishes, amphibians, and insects across latitudinal or altitudinal gradients. Traits that display CnGV most often involve metabolic compensation, that is, the elevation of various physiological rates processes (development, growth, feeding, metabolism, activity) to counteract the dampening effect of reduced temperature, growing season length, or food supply. Far fewer examples of CoGV have been identified (11 species), and these most often involve morphological characters. Increased knowledge of spatial covariance patterns has furthered our understanding of Bergmann size clines, phenotypic plasticity, species range limits, tradeoffs; in juvenile growth rate, and the design of conservation strategies for wild species. Moreover, temporal CnGV explains some cases of an apparent lack of phenotypic response to directional selection and provides a framework for predicting evolutionary responses to climate change.

VL  - 11
IS  - 9
SP  - 1732-1747
AB  - Rapid environmental change is altering the selective pressures experienced by marine species. While adaptation to local environmental conditions depends on a balance between dispersal and natural selection across the seascape, the spatial scale of adaptation and the relative importance of mechanisms maintaining adaptation in the ocean are not well understood. Here, using population assignment tests, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), and genome scans with double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing data, we evaluated population structure and locus-environment associations in a commercially important species, summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus), along the U.S. east coast. Based on 1,137 single nucleotide polymorphisms across 232 individuals spanning nearly 1,900 km, we found no indication of population structure across Cape Hatteras, North Carolina (F-ST=0.0014) or of isolation by distance along the coast using individual relatedness. ABC estimated the probability of dispersal across the biogeographic break at Cape Hatteras to be high (95% credible interval: 7%-50% migration). However, we found 15 loci whose allele frequencies were associated with at least one of four environmental variables. Of those, 11 were correlated with bottom temperature. For summer flounder, our results suggest continued fisheries management as a single population and identify likely response mechanisms to climate change. Broadly speaking, our findings suggest that spatial balancing selection can manifest in adaptive divergence on regional scales in marine fish despite high dispersal, and that these conditions likely result in the widespread distribution of adaptive alleles and a high potential for future genetic adaptation in response to changing environmental conditions. In the context of a rapidly changing world, a landscape genomics perspective offers a useful approach for understanding the causes and consequences of genetic differentiation.

TI  - Variation in viability selection among cohorts of juvenile red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus)
VL  - 57
IS  - 7
SP  - 1689-1697
AB  - Selection will result in observable changes in traits only if it acts consistently in space and time, but few estimates of selection in natural populations have been temporally replicated. Here we estimate viability selection on nestling growth rates for 13 cohorts ( 1989-2001) of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) from a natural population located in southwestern Yukon, Canada. Directional selection on nestling growth rates varied in magnitude and direction from one cohort to the next. The magnitude of directional selection was relatively weak in most years (median beta' = 0.24). but there were episodes of very strong viability selection (beta' > 0.5) in some cohorts. We found no evidence of significant stabilizing or disruptive selection on this trait. Examination of viability selection episodes over shorter time periods suggested that the strength of selection on juveniles in this population was positively related to the time scale over which selection was measured. Viability selection from birth to emergence from the natal nest (50 days of age) and from emergence to successful recruitment (100 days of age) were positively correlated, but were both independent of selection on nestling growth rates from recruitment to potential breeding age (one year). The strength of directional selection on growth rates prior to recruitment was negatively correlated with spring temperature whereas selection from recruitment to breeding was positively correlated with the abundance of spruce cones produced in the previous fall. Episodes of strong directional selection from birth to breeding age appear to be due to potentially rare combinations of environmental conditions. As a result, predicting the occurrence of very strong episodes of selection will be extremely difficult, but predicting the microevolutionary responses to observed selection on individual cohorts remains feasible.

TI  - Techno-economic analysis of wood biomass boilers for the greenhouse industry
VL  - 86
IS  - 3
SP  - 364-371
AB  - The objective of this study is to perform a techno-economic analysis on a typical wood pellet and wood residue boiler for generation of heat to an average-sized greenhouse in British Columbia. The variables analyzed included greenhouse size and structure, boiler efficiency, fuel types, and source of carbon dioxide (CO2) for crop fertilization. The net present value (NPV) show that installing a wood pellet or a wood residue boiler to provide 40% of the annual heat demand is more economical than using a natural gas boiler to provide all the heat at a discount rate of 10%. For an assumed lifespan of 25 years, a wood pellet boiler system could generate NPV of C$259,311 without electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and C$74,695 with ESP, respectively. While, installing a wood residue boiler with or without an ESP could provide NPV of C$919,922 or C$1,104,538, respectively. Using a wood biomass boiler could also eliminate over 3000 tonne CO2 equivalents of greenhouse gases annually. Wood biomass combustion generates more particulate matters than natural gas combustion. However, an advanced emission control system could significantly reduce particulate matters emission from wood biomass combustion which would bring the particulate emission to a relatively similar level as for natural gas.

TI  - Regulating Ultrasound Cavitation in order to Induce Reproducible Sonoporation
VL  - 1215
SP  - 311-+
AB  - Sonoporation would be linked to cavitation, which generally appears to be a non reproducible and unstationary phenomenon. In order to obtain an acceptable trade-off between cell mortality and transfection, a regulated cavitation generator based on an acoustical cavitation measurement was developed and tested. The medium to be sonicated is placed in a sample tray. This tray is immersed in in degassed water and positioned above the face of a flat ultrasonic transducer (frequency: 445 kHz; intensity range: 0.08-1.09 W/cm(2)). This technical configuration was admitted to be conducive to standing-wave generation through reflection at the air/medium interface in the well thus enhancing the cavitation phenomenon. Laterally to the transducer, a homemade hydrophone was oriented to receive the acoustical signal from the bubbles. From this spectral signal recorded at intervals of 5 ms, a cavitation index was calculated as the mean of the cavitation spectrum integration in a logarithmic scale, and the excitation power is automatically corrected. The device generates stable and reproducible cavitation level for a wide range of cavitation setpoint from stable cavitation condition up to full-developed inertial cavitation. For the ultrasound intensity range used, the time delay of the response is lower than 200 ms. The cavitation regulation device was evaluated in terms of chemical bubble collapse effect. Hydroxyl radical production was measured on terephthalic acid solutions. In open loop, the results present a great variability whatever the excitation power. On the contrary the closed loop allows a great reproducibility. This device was implemented for study of sonodynamic effect. The regulation provides more reproducible results independent of cell medium and experimental conditions (temperature, pressure). Other applications of this regulated cavitation device concern internalization of different particles (Quantum Dot) molecules (SiRNA) or plastnids (GFP, DsRed) into different types of cells (AT2, RL, LLC...). Preliminary results are presented.

TI  - Contribution of individual random mutations to genotype-by-environment interactions in Escherichia coli
VL  - 98
IS  - 20
SP  - 11388-11393
AB  - Numerous studies have shown genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions for traits related to organismal fitness. However, the genetic architecture of the interaction is usually unknown because these studies used genotypes that differ from one another by many unknown mutations. These mutations were also present as standing variation in populations and hence had been subject to prior selection. Based on such studies, it is therefore impossible to say what fraction of new, random mutations contributes to GxE interactions. In this study, we measured the fitness in four environments of 26 genotypes of Escherichia coli, each containing a single random insertion mutation. Fitness was measured relative to their common progenitor, which had evolved on glucose at 37 degreesC for the preceding 10,000 generations. The four assay environments differed in limiting resource and temperature (glucose, 28 degreesC; maltose, 28 degreesC; glucose, 37 degreesC; and maltose, 37 degreesC). A highly significant interaction between mutation and resource was found. In contrast, there was no interaction involving temperature. The resource interaction reflected much higher among mutation variation for fitness in maltose than in glucose. At least 11 mutations (42%) contributed to this GxE interaction through their differential fitness effects across resources. Beneficial mutations are generally thought to be rare but, surprisingly, at least three mutations (12%) significantly improved fitness in maltose, a resource novel to the progenitor. More generally, our findings demonstrate that GxE interactions can be quite common, even for genotypes that differ by only one mutation and in environments differing by only a single factor.

TI  - Comparison of upper thermal tolerances of native and nonnative fish species in Arizona
VL  - 135
IS  - 6
SP  - 1433-1440
AB  - We used a lethal thermal method to estimate the upper thermal tolerances of 11 native and 7 normative fish species found throughout southern Arizona. Fish were acclimated to 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C. For all species tested, an increase in acclimation temperature resulted in a higher thermal tolerance value. Among the species acclimated to 25 degrees C, desert pupfish Cyprinodon macularius, western mosquitofish Gambusia affinis, and Gila topminnow Poeciflopsis occidentalis were most tolerant to high temperature. Speckled dace Rhinichthys osculus, spikedace Meda fulgida, and loach minnow R. cobitis were least tolerant. Many native species demonstrated a limited ability to extend their upper temperature tolerances via acclimation. Our data suggest that several native species may be sensitive to increasing annual and large daily temperature fluctuations in Arizona's streams and rivers, Although southwestern native fishes were previously believed to be tolerant to high temperature due to their evolution in desert environments, this study suggests that many of these fishes are less tolerant than previously thought. In addition, many fishes introduced from the eastern United States had higher temperature tolerances than some of the native desert species tested. Increases in stream temperatures in Arizona could reduce the habitat available for native fishes and therefore may favor those normative species with higher thermal tolerances.

TI  - The Metamatrix of Thermal Comfort: A compendious graphical methodology for appropriate selection of outdoor thermal comfort indices and thermo-physiological models for human-biometeorology research and urban planning
VL  - 81
AB  - Ongoing climate crisis increase people's outdoor thermal stress, discouraging outside activities and intensifying indoor consumptions. Amelioration of urban microclimates is necessary to safeguard citizens from thermal strokes without energy-intensive strategies, ensuring future cities' sustainable development. More than 200 calculation methods can be adopted with the purpose to design thermally comfortable public spaces, but existing literature lacks selection criteria to justifiably choose the appropriate ones. As resolution, the Metamatrix of Thermal Comfort has been developed. It's a graphical methodology, addressed to academicians and practitioners, that allows to rapidly comprehend and compare the specificities of 65 renowned thermal comfort indices and thermo-physiological models, explaining their mutual interactions. To promote practicality in thermal comfort studies, relying on calculation tools, an Operational version, including only 22 indices and models integrated in computer programs, is presented. A qualitative evaluation by approximately 30 criteria, such as climatic and physical factors, meteorological conditions, solar exposure and type of environment, allows to select thermal comfort calculation methods compatible to specific needs. To find appropriate computational tools, the Metamatrix of Software can be consulted. An application example is provided, proving the suitability of this graphical methodology as a powerful asset to apply outdoor thermal comfort-driven design to urban planning.

TI  - Trans-generational responses to low pH depend on parental gender in a calcifying tubeworm
VL  - 5
AB  - The uptake of anthropogenic CO2 emissions by oceans has started decreasing pH and carbonate ion concentrations of seawater, a process called ocean acidification (OA). Occurring over centuries and many generations, evolutionary adaptation and epigenetic transfer will change species responses to OA over time. Trans-generational responses, via genetic selection or trans-generational phenotypic plasticity, differ depending on species and exposure time as well as differences between individuals such as gender. Males and females differ in reproductive investment and egg producing females may have less energy available for OA stress responses. By crossing eggs and sperm from the calcareous tubeworm Hydroides elegans (Haswell, 1883) raised in ambient (8.1) and low (7.8) pH environments, we observed that paternal and maternal low pH experience had opposite and additive effects on offspring. For example, when compared to offspring with both parents from ambient pH, growth rates of offspring of fathers or mothers raised in low pH were higher or lower respectively, but there was no difference when both parents were from low pH. Gender differences may result in different selection pressures for each gender. This may result in overestimates of species tolerance and missed opportunities of potentially insightful comparisons between individuals of the same species.

TI  - ENERGETIC BEHAVIOUR OF A SOLAR THERMAL SYSTEM PRODUCING DOMESTIC HOT WATER AND PREHEATING THE VENTILATION AIR
SP  - 310-321
AB  - As a result of the evolution of the thermal regulation in Europe, buildings are better isolated and more airtight, thereby reducing their heating needs. Efficient systems from the energetic point of view, using preferably renewable sources, must cover the new distribution of needs. Indeed, domestic hot water (DHW) becomes a more important load than space heating in residential buildings. In this context, solar thermal systems are appropriate for supplying a significant part of the heat demand in energy efficient housing. Thus, this paper focuses on an innovative solar thermal system producing DHW and preheating the ventilation air. A co-simulation between Dymola (Modelica language) and EnergyPlus forecasts the energy performance of the system in a low-energy individual house for different French cities. The results show an improved collector efficiency as well as a higher solar productivity in comparison to a classical solar domestic hot water system. Although energy savings are achieved for the majority of the studied climates with the studied system, a different control strategy may be interesting in order to improve the distribution of the collected solar energy. To this end, a parametric analysis provides some clues for increasing the energy performance of the innovative system when modifying the design and control parameters.

TI  - Life cycle assessment of a novel bipolar electrodialysis-based flow battery concept and its potential use to mitigate the intermittency of renewable energy generation
VL  - 35
AB  - The novel bipolar electrodialysis flow battery (BEDFB) concept is an acid-base type of energy storage solution that uses safe and abundant electrolytes and that has the potential of providing long-duration storage at low cost. To date, the potential environmental impacts of the BEDFB have not been investigated. Here, we report the results of a life cycle assessment (LCA) and an integrated sustainability analysis for a 1 MW/ 6 MWh BEDFB system having a 20-year lifetime. The manufacturing phase (cradle-to-gate) and the full life cycle (cradle-to grave) were analyzed per 1 MWh (functional unit) of installed storage capacity using five LCA categories. For the use phase part of the LCA, the BEDFB was assumed to provide energy storage to support wind and PV generation within the national Mexican electricity grid. In addition, the cumulative energy demand (CED), the energy returned on investment (EROI) and three sustainability dimensions (feasibility, viability, desirability) were evaluated. Finally, we calculated the losses posed by the renewables that are currently (2019) deployed in the Mexican grid to assess the potential of energy storage deployment within the Mexican context. For the manufacturing phase, the BEDFB technology exhibited a terrestrial ecotoxicity value of 16.3 kg1.4DCB/MWh and a global warming impact of 9.1 kgCO(2)e/MWh, which are significantly lower values than reported for the state-of-the-art all-vanadium flow battery technology. PV generation in combination with the BEDFB demonstrated the best environmental profile, followed by generation through wind and the average Mexican grid conditions. We found that 304 BEDFB?s would suffice to mitigate the energy losses represented by renewable deployments in Mexico today. The main result from the sustainability analysis is that, on the supply side, the BEDFB technology requires minimal fossil energy and chemicals during the upstream processes of the manufacturing phase.

VL  - 46

SP  - 4072-4086
AB  - There are a number of shortcomings for currently-available technologies for ammonia production, such as carbon dioxide emissions and water consumption. We simulate a novel model for ammonia production from hydrogen sulfide through membrane technologies. The proposed production process decreases the need for external water and reduces the physical footprint of the plant. The required hydrogen comes from the separation of hydrogen sulfide by electrochemical membrane separation, while the required nitrogen is obtained from separating oxygen from air through an ion transport membrane. 10% of the hydrogen from the electrochemical membrane separation along with the separated oxygen from the ion transport membrane is sent to the solid oxide fuel cell for heat and power generation. This production process operates with a minimal number of processing units and in physical, kinetic, and thermal conditions in which a separation factor of similar to 99.99% can be attained.

VL  - 141

AB  - The temperature-dependent development of the European larch bark beetle, Ips cembrae, was studied under long-day conditions L:D 16:8 at three temperature regimes, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C, using the sandwich plate method. By observing the individual developmental progress, we calculated the developmental times and lower developmental thresholds of one entire generation and various ontogenetic stages. The mean developmental time of one generation was about 120, 64 and 37days at 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 25 degrees C, respectively. The egg stage comprised about 9% of the total development or about 16% of the pre-imaginal development. The larval stages took about 39% of the entire and about 66% of the pre-imaginal development. The pupal stage needed about 11% of the total or about 18% of the pre-imaginal development. The lower developmental threshold for one generation was 11.2 degrees C. The egg stage had the highest lower developmental threshold of 12.0 degrees C, the pupa the lowest of 9.8 degrees C and the total larval stages showed a value of 11.2 degrees C. The thermal requirements for I.cembrae have never been studied in detail before. The results will be a valuable contribution for monitoring and risk assessment models to estimate the beetle's phenology and its potential impacts on forest ecosystems under changing climate conditions.

TI  - Selection of technological regime and cryoprotector for lyophilization of lactobacteria (Lactobacillus spp.)
VL  - 10
IS  - 4
SP  - 184-190
AB  - Despite the success achieved in the comprehensive study of probiotic cultures, today there are a number of problems associated with the low viability of lactic acid bacteria during their processing and long-term storage in probiotics. Our work aimed to select the optimal technological regime and cryoprotectant to preserve the viability of lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus spp. during their lyophilization. According to the results of the conducted researches, it is established that for freeze-drying of probiotic cultures Lactobacillus spp. in the facility LZ-45.27 (Frigera, Czech Republic) the most optimal is the mode which provides a rise of temperature within 45 hours from minus 70.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C to plus 26.0 +/- 1.0 degrees C with a speed of 2.2 +/- 0.1 degrees C/hour. It is effective to use protective media for lactobacilli, which consist of: skim milk (90%) and sucrose (10%); skim milk (90%) and lactose (10%); skim milk (90%), glucose (2.5%), sucrose (2.5%), lactose (5.0%) (P <= 0.05). Freeze-drying of lactic acid bacteria under optimal conditions and the addition of cryoprotectants will avoid the problems associated with a significant reduction in the number of microbial cells. The results of research can be used for long-term storage of cultures of lactobacilli by their lyophilization.

TI  - Response mechanisms of leaf nutrients of endangered plant (Acer catalpifolium) to environmental factors varied at different growth stages
VL  - 17
AB  - The response patterns of N and P in plant leaves are one of the tools for investigating the ability of plants to cope with current environmental conditions and predicting their future viability. Endangered species are more sensitive to environmental changes, lack of nutrients such as NP will adversely affect the survival of species. 119 Acer catalpifolium are the only ones left in the world were studied and were divided into different growth stages (small, adult and old trees) to study the environmental response of leaves to NP. Results showed that: the NP stoichiometric characteristics of Acer catalpifolium leaves were lower in small stage, with the growth of plants, the NP content increased. There was a significant correlation between the soil nutrient and leaf NP stoichiometry in all growth stages, and with the increase of soil N: P, the leaf N: P changed from N limitation to N and P limitation, showing a poor adaptability to soil environmental changes. Under the influence of environmental conditions, the adaptation strategy of leaf NP at different growth stages were different. With the return of nutrients, the leaf N: P at adult and old stages increased with litter thickness. Small and old stages showed poor adaptation with environmental changes. These results indicate that leaf NP differed significantly among different life stages and that these differences can accounted for part of the causes of endangerment of Acer catalpifolium.

TI  - Substantial heritable variation for susceptibility to Dothistroma septosporum within populations of native British Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris)
VL  - 65
IS  - 6
SP  - 987-996
AB  - The threat from pests and pathogens to native and commercially planted forest trees is unprecedented and expected to increase under climate change. The degree to which forests respond to threats from pathogens depends on their adaptive capacity, which is determined largely by genetically controlled variation in susceptibility of the individual trees within them and the heritability and evolvability of this trait. The most significant current threat to the economically and ecologically important species Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) is dothistroma needle blight (DNB), caused by the foliar pathogen Dothistroma septosporum. A progeny-population trial of 4-year-old Scots pine trees, comprising six populations from native Caledonian pinewoods each with three to five families in seven blocks, was artificially inoculated using a single isolate of D. septosporum. Susceptibility to D. septosporum, assessed as the percentage of non-green needles, was measured regularly over a period of 61 days following inoculation, during which plants were maintained in conditions ideal for DNB development (warm; high humidity; high leaf wetness). There were significant differences in susceptibility to D. septosporum among families indicating that variation in this trait is heritable, with high estimates of narrow-sense heritability (0.38-0.75) and evolvability (genetic coefficient of variation, 23.47). It is concluded that native Scots pine populations contain sufficient genetic diversity to evolve lower susceptibility to D. septosporum through natural selection in response to increased prevalence of this pathogen.

SP  - 151-160
AB  - Knowledge of the larval-age distribution in the field is important for prediction purpose and timing of insecticide applications for insect pest management. This studies acts by calculating the average of thermal units in degree-days (dd's). The average of thermal units required for completion of generation is 544.98, 640.63 and 599.66 degrees-days (degrees C) as calculated from air temperatures derived from thermograph and satellite images, and soil temperatures from satellite images, respectively, considering 9.89 degrees C as a developmental threshold. These were higher than the estimated value of dd's based on laboratory data (524.27 degrees-days (degrees C)). There was a difference between degree days obtained from air temperatures derived from satellite images and thermograph by 59.2 dd's, this value represented only about 2.85 days. In order to improve the predictability, a factor was estimated between them which is 0.81, 0.96 and 0.87 in case of thermograph, soil and air temperature that derived from satellite images so the predicted stages was highly improved. Egg hatching was estimated to be 80% complete by approximate to 80.45 dd's. At 174.85 DD, mostly all larvae in the field experiment were from the first to third instars. The presence of more mature larvae (fourth to sixth instars) was not noticed until 197.59 dd's. These data indicate that, the best timing for control application against Spodoptera littoralis would be at 174.85-197.59 dd's. The results are important for quick prediction purposes, control timing and also as valuable tools used in an integrated control program for managing S. littoralis in Egypt.

TI  - Response of African humid tropical forests to recent rainfall anomalies
VL  - 368
IS  - 1625
AB  - During the last decade, strong negative rainfall anomalies resulting from increased sea surface temperature in the tropical Atlantic have caused extensive droughts in rainforests of western Amazonia, exerting persistent effects on the forest canopy. In contrast, there have been no significant impacts on rainforests of West and Central Africa during the same period, despite large-scale droughts and rainfall anomalies during the same period. Using a combination of rainfall observations from meteorological stations from the Climate Research Unit (CRU; 1950-2009) and satellite observations of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM; 1998-2010), we show that West and Central Africa experienced strong negative water deficit (WD) anomalies over the last decade, particularly in 2005, 2006 and 2007. These anomalies were a continuation of an increasing drying trend in the region that started in the 1970s. We monitored the response of forests to extreme rainfall anomalies of the past decade by analysing the microwave scatterometer data from QuickSCAT (1999-2009) sensitive to variations in canopy water content and structure. Unlike in Amazonia, we found no significant impacts of extreme WD events on forests of Central Africa, suggesting potential adaptability of these forests to short-term severe droughts. Only forests near the savanna boundary in West Africa and in fragmented landscapes of the northern Congo Basin responded to extreme droughts with widespread canopy disturbance that lasted only during the period of WD. Time-series analyses of CRU and TRMM data show most regions in Central and West Africa experience seasonal or decadal extreme WDs (less than 2600 mm). We hypothesize that the long-term historical extreme WDs with gradual drying trends in the 1970s have increased the adaptability of humid tropical forests in Africa to droughts.

TI  - Smart Indian Railways: An Environment Friendly Model
VL  - 326
SP  - 193-200
AB  - In recent years development of Indian railways took place rapidly, but still there are many issues related in the way of growth. The biggest issue is the creation of world's biggest open toilet. In every coach there is an open toilet system through which feces and urine of human is discharged directly on the tracks, which results corrosion of track components. Another issue of food waste on platforms and through the train canteens, which is another big headache for Indian railways. Several models of green toilets have been proposed for the purpose of improvement in the environment and hygiene like development of Controlled discharge toilet system (CDTS) built by DRDO based on train speed, development of Zero discharge toilets (ZDTS) by Research Designs and standards organization Lucknow and IIT Kanpur. These systems are tried by railway but rejected. These systems are not suitable for trains because of its infrastructure complexity, expensiveness and large number of people will use them. Therefore there is a requirement of proper sanitation in the Indian railways. In this paper a model is proposed which produces energy and fertilizers from toilet waste and food waste which can be used for thermal generation, electric generation, cooking, agriculture and some other purposes.

SP  - 43-47
AB  - Prevailing modes of the manufacture of modern energy-harvesting systems and other electronics based on silicon fail to meet the requirements of the steps involved in low-cost fabrication. Rapid and low-cost roll-to-roll manufacture - the future of commercialization for flexible and printed electronics - requires flexible and lowcost substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate and, more recently, green materials such as nano-paper. The temperature at every single fabrication stage is crucial with such materials and cannot exceed a certain threshold, generally 150 degrees C or less. Low-temperature plasma, therefore can provide an excellent way forward for future manufacturing methods. This contribution presents a proprietary, large-area plasma of extremely high-volume power density, up to 100 W/cm(3), capable of generating diffuse, homogeneous and cold plasma (<70 degrees C) in the open air, as well as in technical-grade gases including nitrogen, argon, methane, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and pure water vapour. Although the temperature of the plasma is very low, the population of energetic states is sufficient to induce physical/chemical changes on the surfaces of a range of nanostructured materials and semiconductors, such as graphene oxide, titanium dioxide, perovskites, and others, resulting in various changes to crystallinity, optoelectronic, and wettability properties depending on the gas employed for plasma generation. The low temperature of the plasma and rapid treatment times, in the order of 1-10s, enables the integration of plasma processing into roll-to-roll manufacture, a significant step forward in commercial viability within the emerging field of flexible and printed electronics. This study provides an example of rapid (<1 min) low-temperature plasma processing of indium-tin-oxide electrodes as a replacement for time-consuming chemical treatment before deposition of PEDOT:PSS in a p-i-n perovskite solar cell.

AB  - This paper focuses on the potential use of ammonia as a carbon-free fuel, and covers recent advances in the development of ammonia combustion technology and its underlying chemistry. Fulfilling the COP21 Paris Agreement requires the de-carbonization of energy generation, through utilization of carbon-neutral and overall carbon-free fuels produced from renewable sources. Hydrogen is one of such fuels, which is a potential energy carrier for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. However, its shipment for long distances and storage for long times present challenges. Ammonia on the other hand, comprises 17.8% of hydrogen by mass and can be produced from renewable hydrogen and nitrogen separated from air. Further more, thermal properties of ammonia are similar to those of propane in terms of boiling temperature and condensation pressure, making it attractive as a hydrogen and energy carrier. Ammonia has been produced and utilized for the past 100 years as a fertilizer, chemical raw material, and refrigerant. Ammonia can be used as a fuel but there are several challenges in ammonia combustion, such as low flammability, high NOx emission, and low radiation intensity. Overcoming these challenges requires further research into ammonia flame dynamics and chemistry. This paper discusses recent successful applications of ammonia fuel, in gas turbines, co-fired with pulverize coal, and in industrial furnaces. These applications have been implemented under the Japanese 'Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP): Energy Carriers'. In addition, fundamental aspects of ammonia combustion are discussed including characteristics of laminar premixed flames, counterflow twin-flames, and turbulent premixed flames stabilized by a nozzle burner at high pressure. Furthermore, this paper discusses details of the chemistry of ammonia combustion related to NOx production, processes for reducing NOx, and validation of several ammonia oxidation kinetics models. Finally, LES results for a gas-turbine-like swirl-burner are presented, for the purpose of developing low-NOx single-fuelled ammonia gas turbine combustors. (C) 2019 The Authors.

TI  - Is ocean energy an alternative in developing regions? A case study in Michoacan, Mexico
VL  - 266
AB  - In many parts of the world, renewable energy is being considered as an alternative to supply electricity to communities in developing regions. However, even though various technologies are becoming available, there are several socio-environmental constraints that impinge on the viability of ocean energy conversion projects in isolated communities. By assessing environmental restrictions and socioeconomic attributes where electric power may be produced from the ocean can be useful in prioritizing the locations (especially those isolated) where this alternative is more viable. This paper examines socio-economic and environmental factors that may affect the introduction of ocean energy harvesting in areas currently without electricity. Our findings reveal that: a) in the coastal area of the state of Michoacan, southwest Mexico (at < 20 km from the coast and <100 m.a.s.l.), 153 human settlements with over 4,000 inhabitants lack electric power; 16 of these settlements are indigenous; b) economic activities are mostly fisheries and ecotourism; yet, marginalizaion is very high in the area; c) there are four protected areas with nesting sites for several marine turtle species (greater black, hawksbill, leatherback, and green); the "Deep Pacific Sea" natural protected area harbors great biodiversity; and d) electric power may be produced from ocean energy, especially waves, currents and thermal gradients. The infrastructure for grid connection and technical and logistical support is limited, and the topography near the coast is complex. However, our results indicate that the coastal region of Michoacan, has promising sources of ocean energy, especially for isolated settlements with limited, or no, electricity supply. The results show that waves and thermal gradients are viable options for energy generation in the area studied. Considering socioeconomic conditions and environmental restrictions, our observations suggest that, in particular, ocean energy projects might be successfully implemented in two locations on the coast of Michoacan, Future on-site studies into the environmental impact, the percepction and acceptance of society towards the new technologies and economic costs are necessary before implementing these new technologies.

VL  - 22

SP  - 4876-4889
AB  - Anthropogenic CO(2)emissions are projected to lower the pH of the ocean 0.3 units by 2100. Previous studies suggested thatProchlorococcusandSynechococcus, the numerically dominant phytoplankton in the oceans, have different responses to elevated CO(2)that may result in a dramatic shift in their relative abundances in future oceans. Here we showed that the exponential growth rates of these two genera respond to future CO(2)conditions in a manner similar to other cyanobacteria, butProchlorococcusstrains had significantly lower realized growth rates under elevated CO(2)regimes due to poor survival after exposure to fresh culture media. Despite this, aSynechococcusstrain was unable to outcompete aProchlorococcusstrain in co-culture at elevated CO2. Under these conditions,Prochlorococcus' poor response to elevated CO(2)disappeared, andProchlorococcus'relative fitness showed negative frequency dependence, with both competitors having significant fitness advantages when initially rare. These experiments suggested that the two strains should be able to coexist indefinitely in co-culture despite sharing nearly identical nutritional requirements. We speculate that negative frequency dependence exists due to reductive Black Queen evolution that has resulted in a passively mutualistic relationship analogous to that connectingProchlorococcuswith the 'helper' heterotrophic microbes in its environment.

AB  - Ranges of preferred and avoidance temperatures in Cyclops strenuus Fischer, 1851 were determined based on the results of its experimental testing in the thermal gradient device. It is established that the process of temperature selection occurs with an overshoot. It is noted that copepods started to select the final preferred temperatures on the 8th day (temperatures above 26 degrees C were avoided; the avoidance of low temperatures was not recorded). The average value of the critical thermal maximum for the season was determined. It is found that optimal, pessimal, and tolerant temperatures can be calculated on the scale of the species tolerance according to values of preferred and avoidance temperatures as well as according to values of the temperature range of regulation of the critical thermal maximum.

TI  - Experimental simulation of a martensitic stainless steel coating subjected to thermal fatigue
VL  - 95
IS  - 5
SP  - 679-690
AB  - Studies of thermal fatigue damage have been an area of ever-growing interest in the industries such as aerospace, nuclear, metallurgy and other industries where metallic structures have been subjected to thermomechanical loadings. Thermal fatigue effects will only be evident, if the thermal cycled structure size is big enough. In this work, we have studied continuous cast cylinders which are components submitted to thermal cycles. The repetition of temperature cycles induces many fractures on material surfaces and could induce cylinder failure. In order to attempt to solve this important technological problem by protecting the surface, a coating was deposited on the cylinder by a semi-transferred plasma are technique; this method provides a coating which is not too diluted into the support. In the present work, a martensitic stainless steel was deposited on a cylindrical low alloyed steel substrate, simulating a true cylinder; the specimen used in this study has dimensions of a 1/5 of those of a real cylinder. It was high frequency heated with a pancake type inductor and cooled with a compressed air system on its outer surface and an axial flow cooling water inside; the specimen was rotated at a speed of 1.1 R.P.M. An experimental temperature map was established using two infrared pyrometers for temperature surface measurements and Thermocouples for infernal temperature measurements; these were inserted into the cylinder. The objective of this tridimensional simulation is to obtain the best reproduction of thermal loading of the casting cylinder, When the thermal stabilized cycle is reached (after 15 cycles), twenty temperature measurements were carried out in order to construct the experimental thermal map of the stabilized cycle, Furthermore, different experimental maps were constructed from the initial state to the stabilized cycle. The temperature range was established to correspond to typical industrial values, and moreover, the experimental thermal maps will be used to a future numerical simulation of the thermomechanical behaviour of the cylinder. The highest measured temperature was 500 degrees C close to the inductor; the lowest temperatures were measured near the axis at 40 degrees C and also at the end of a generating line at 180 degrees C. Furthermore, residual stresses and deformations were measured in the coating depth before the thermal fatigue experiment and at different periods of the test. These measurements were performed using X Ray and neutron diffraction, before and after thermal fatigue cycles. Experiments performed on cylindrical specimens are difficult and expensive; thermal fatigue tests serve only for the verification of the coating toughness and for the construction of thermal maps. The study of the microstructural evolution of the coating was conducted with the help of other smaller specimens, which were submitted to thermal shocks;some microhardness measurements were carried out to estimate hardness variations of the coating. These specimens are small coated cylinders; their thermal cycles were identical with thermal fatigue cycles. Moreover, the temperature evolution of the specimens was adjusted in order to correspond to the thermal evolution of the thermal fatigue coating cylinder. However, only a numerical simulation of these thermal shock experiments will allow to evidence the balance between this simplify test and the thermal fatigue test. After 150 fatigue thermal cycles, no cracks were observed on the surface of the cylinder. After 100 additional cycles, with a new higher temperature of 700 degrees C, no damage was evident on the surface. Residual stresses decrease quickly with thermal cycles; decreases in hardness were also correlated with lower yield points. Several isothermal mechanical tests were performed on the coating material (low cycle fatigue and relaxation) and on the support to determine their thermomechanical behaviour in the temperature range 20-700 degrees C. The parameters were identified by means of a systematic numerical procedure (a computer program of simulation and identification). The microstructural evolution, during mechanical tests, was examined and related to the evolution of internal variables of the viscoplastic model. It was found that, at every temperature, the material showed cyclic softening behaviour. Moreover at 450 degrees C, a high stress level was correlated with the evolution of the material microstructure and the increase of the kinematic variables of the model. The viscoplastic model chosen in this study permits a good description of, not only the macroscopic mechanical results, but also of the microstructural evolutions of the material, An anisothermal constitutive model could be introduced into a numerical procedure; the latter, with the aid of a finite element method, should permit the calculation of the thermomechanical effects of thermal fatigue on structures such as cylinders. It should also permit a comparison between the two tests of thermal fatigue and thermal shocks.

TI  - PARASITISM AND GENERATION CYCLES IN A SALT-MARSH PLANTHOPPER
VL  - 63
IS  - 4
SP  - 912-920
AB  - 1. In warm climates many insects exhibit discrete generations, in the absence of obvious factors that could synchronize their age structure. It has been hypothesized that parasitoid wasps might be responsible for these oscillations in the host age structure, known as generation cycles. 2. We examine the role of the parasitoid Anagrus delicatus in the dynamics of the salt-marsh planthopper Prokelisia marginata. In particular, we evaluate the hypothesis that Anagrus contributes to the formation of generation cycles in the hopper, in the subtropical climate of Florida. 3. Two kinds of evidence are presented. First, we construct continuous-time models of the system that incorporate what is known about Anagrus foraging behaviour, the life cycles of host and parasitoid, and their movements. We then examine the behaviour of these models to determine if Anagrus has the potential to induce generation cycles. We also show how spatial variation in the risk of parasitism can generate 'pseudo-interference' in our continuous-time framework. Secondly, we examine the temporal pattern of host and parasitoid abundance, and parasitism rates in the field. If Anagrus were contributing to the formation of generation cycles, we would expect to see a characteristic pattern of abundance and mortality from parasitism. 4. Both our modelling and empirical results suggest that Anagrus contributes to generation cycles in Prokelisia. Anagrus has the theoretical prerequisites for generation cycles to occur and in the field generates a cyclic pattern of parasitism that would help induce generation cycles in the planthopper. 5. The existence of an adult host stage that is invulnerable to parasitism strongly influences the stability of our models. Without this stage Anagrus cannot fully stabilize the system, even if the risk of parasitism varies greatly from patch to patch.

TI  - A second generation genetic map for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)
VL  - 9
AB  - Background: Genetic maps characterizing the inheritance patterns of traits and markers have been developed for a wide range of species and used to study questions in biomedicine, agriculture, ecology and evolutionary biology. The status of rainbow trout genetic maps has progressed significantly over the last decade due to interest in this species in aquaculture and sport fisheries, and as a model research organism for studies related to carcinogenesis, toxicology, comparative immunology, disease ecology, physiology and nutrition. We constructed a second generation genetic map for rainbow trout using microsatellite markers to facilitate the identification of quantitative trait loci for traits affecting aquaculture production efficiency and the extraction of comparative information from the genome sequences of model fish species. Results: A genetic map ordering 1124 microsatellite loci spanning a sex-averaged distance of 2927.10 cM (Kosambi) and having 2.6 cM resolution was constructed by genotyping 10 parents and 150 offspring from the National Center for Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture ( NCCCWA) reference family mapping panel. Microsatellite markers, representing pairs of loci resulting from an evolutionarily recent whole genome duplication event, identified 180 duplicated regions within the rainbow trout genome. Microsatellites associated with genes through expressed sequence tags or bacterial artificial chromosomes produced comparative assignments with tetraodon, zebrafish, fugu, and medaka resulting in assignments of homology for 199 loci. Conclusion: The second generation NCCCWA genetic map provides an increased microsatellite marker density and quantifies differences in recombination rate between the sexes in outbred populations. It has the potential to integrate with cytogenetic and other physical maps, identifying paralogous regions of the rainbow trout genome arising from the evolutionarily recent genome duplication event, and anchoring a comparative map with the zebrafish, medaka, tetraodon, and fugu genomes. This resource will facilitate the identification of genes affecting traits of interest through fine mapping and positional cloning of candidate genes.

TI  - Genetic stability of genome-scale deoptimized RNA virus vaccine candidates under selective pressure
VL  - 114
IS  - 3
SP  - E386-E395
AB  - Recoding viral genomes by numerous synonymous but suboptimal substitutions provides live attenuated vaccine candidates. These vaccine candidates should have a low risk of deattenuation because of the many changes involved. However, their genetic stability under selective pressure is largely unknown. We evaluated phenotypic reversion of deoptimized human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidates in the context of strong selective pressure. Codon pair deoptimized (CPD) versions of RSV were attenuated and temperature-sensitive. During serial passage at progressively increasing temperature, a CPD RSV containing 2,692 synonymous mutations in 9 of 11 ORFs did not lose temperature sensitivity, remained genetically stable, and was restricted at temperatures of 34 degrees C/35 degrees C and above. However, a CPD RSV containing 1,378 synonymous mutations solely in the polymerase L ORF quickly lost substantial attenuation. Comprehensive sequence analysis of virus populations identified many different potentially deattenuating mutations in the L ORF as well as, surprisingly, many appearing in other ORFs. Phenotypic analysis revealed that either of two competing mutations in the virus transcription antitermination factor M2-1, outside of the CPD area, substantially reversed defective transcription of the CPD L gene and substantially restored virus fitness in vitro and in case of one of these twomutations, also in vivo. Paradoxically, the introduction into Min L of one mutation each in the M2-1, N, P, and L proteins resulted in a virus with increased attenuation in vivo but increased immunogenicity. Thus, in addition to providing insights on the adaptability of genome-scale deoptimized RNA viruses, stability studies can yield improved synthetic RNA virus vaccine candidates.

TI  - Quantitative trait loci for thermotolerance phenotypes in Drosophila melanogaster
VL  - 96
IS  - 3
SP  - 232-242
AB  - For insects, temperature is a major environmental variable that can influence an individual's behavioral activities and fitness. Drosophila melanogaster is a cosmopolitan species that has had great success in adapting to and colonizing diverse thermal niches. This adaptation and colonization has resulted in complex patterns of genetic variation in thermotolerance phenotypes in nature. Although extensive work has been conducted documenting patterns of genetic variation, substantially less is known about the genomic regions or genes that underlie this ecologically and evolutionarily important genetic variation. To begin to understand and identify the genes controlling thermotolerance phenotypes, we have used a mapping population of recombinant inbred (RI) lines to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect variation in both heat- and cold-stress resistance. The mapping population was derived from a cross between two lines of D. melanogaster (Oregon-R and 2b) that were not selected for thermotolerance phenotypes, but exhibit significant genetic divergence for both phenotypes. Using a design in which each RI line was backcrossed to both parental lines, we mapped seven QTL affecting thermotolerance on the second and third chromosomes. Three of the QTL influence cold-stress resistance and four affect heat- stress resistance. Most of the QTL were trait or sex specific, suggesting that overlapping but generally unique genetic architectures underlie resistance to low- and high-temperature extremes. Each QTL explained between 5 and 14% of the genetic variance among lines, and degrees of dominance ranged from completely additive to partial dominance. Potential thermotolerance candidate loci contained within our QTL regions are identified and discussed.

VL  - 1

SP  - 36-39
AB  - We maintained adult many-lined sun skinks (Mabuya multifasciata; 12 females and 12 males) collected from Hainan (southern China) in September 2006 in two outdoor enclosures to examine the effect of feeding condition on selected body temperature (T-sel). Skinks shifted their thermal preferences when fasted. Temporal variation in T-sel was not found within each sex x feeding condition combination, and neither in fed nor in fasted skinks did the mean values for T-sel differ between sexes. Body temperatures selected by fed skinks fell within the range from 30.2 to 33.9 degrees C, and those selected by fasted skinks within the range from 25.1 to 31.8 degrees C. Body temperatures (31.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C) selected by fed skinks were on average 4.0 degrees C higher than those (27.8 +/- 0.4 degrees C) selected by fasted skinks. Fasted skinks had no difficulty in attaining higher body temperatures, but they voluntarily shift their thermal preferences downwards to save energy. This finding suggests an adaptive mechanism adopted by many-lined sun skinks to enhance their fitness during the periods when food availability is low.

TI  - Multi-objective optimization of a solar-driven polygeneration system based on CO2 working fluid
VL  - 252
AB  - The object of this study is the investigation of polygeneration plants utilizing solar energy in order to produce power products on the scale of a few MW. Parabolic trough collectors are used in order to exploit solar irradiation and to provide the generated heat to the polygeneration/trigeneration cycle in a high-temperature range (500-570 degrees C). The plants under consideration additionally consist of a storage tank, a Brayton cycle with s-CO2, a LiBr-H2O absorption chiller and also the installation of a suitable thermodynamic organic Rankine cycle (ORC) cycle is examined in order to utilize waste heat for further power generation. The systems are first investigated for operation under steady-state conditions and then for dynamic conditions on an annual basis. Based on the final annual results of the plants, the plant in which ORC was not used shows annual electrical, exergy and energy efficiencies equal to 18.33%, 23.37% and 54.91% respectively, while the plant in which ORC was used similarly shows 19.05%, 23.63% and 49.00%. According to economic analysis, the payback period was found at 6.37 years without ORC and 6.51 years with ORC. Taking into account the operational and techno-economic results of the plants it can be concluded that the plants produce satisfactory energy products ensuring also the economic viability of the investment.

TI  - Optimal energy scheduling strategy for multi-energy generation grid using multi-agent systems
VL  - 124
AB  - Due to high environmental concerns and ever-increasing fossil fuel costs, generation of clean energy and its optimal management considering the demand side responses are very essential to upsurge the productivity and reliability of the distribution grids. Hence, a kind of distributed microgrid identified as multi-energy generation grid (MEGG) has been proposed in this paper. The anticipated MEGG integrated with renewable energy resources, fuel cells (FCs), an alternative grid-supporting generator (AGSG) connected with boiler, micro-turbine (MT), and thermal system, wastes burning power plant (WBPP), and energy storage system (ESS) that investigate the optimal resource management in a grid under various operational conditions to minimize the emissions and operational costs. The problem is supervised by agents-based technique considering the generation capabilities and demand side responses. The three-layered technique is presented for the distributed optimal resource management based on multi-agent systems (MAS) framework, where different agents operate and perform tasks autonomously. An optimal energy management scheduling strategy is accomplished considering actions that guarantee the maximum use of generated renewable energy, eradicate the excess use of WBPP and FC, minimize AGSG operational time, and full-load demands satisfaction during the entire day. Similarly, coordination between the MEGG and central power grid has also been accomplished for the purpose to exchange power. For validation, three scenarios have been presented which shows that the combined utilization of distributed energy resources can profusely generate electricity having less emissions, recover the generation costs in peak hours, and enhance the reliability of the entire grid.

TI  - Optimization of combustion characteristics of palm kernel-based biofuel for grate furnace
VL  - 9
IS  - 4
SP  - 457-472
AB  - Grate firing is one of the main competing technologies in biomass combustion for steam and electricity generation. Ash generated in the furnace during combustion process would greatly reduce the boiler thermal performance and may lead to unscheduled shutdown. The focus of this study is to optimize the combustion characteristics of the mixture of palm kernel shell (PKS) and selected additives (Al2O3, MgO and CaO) to develop a fuel mixture of low ash yield and higher heating value (HHV). D-Optimal Design under Cross Methodology of Design Expert (6.08) was employed to mix the components alongside various particle sizes. The mixed samples were ashed in a muffle furnace (848K) to a constant weight and their HHV were determined using Ballistic Bomb Calorimeter. Combustion test based on optimized PKS additive mixture was conducted with a 5kW grate furnace from which the effects of varying the ratio of primary to secondary air flow rate on temperatures and flue gas compositions from the furnace were measured. The ash obtained after combustion process was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) for the purpose of identifying the mineral phase compounds that are present in PKS and PKS-additive ash. The optimum composition obtained for the process was 2.5, 0.0, 5.0, 92.5% and 5.50mm for additives (Al2O3, MgO, CaO), PKS and particle size, respectively. The composition resulted in lowest ash yield (0.56%) and HHV (20.64kJ/g). The coefficient of determination (R-2) (0.7951 and 0.7344) and least-square errors (0.19 and 0.024) of the prediction model indicated a close fitness to the experiment results obtained for ash yield and HHV. Primary to secondary air ratio of (40:60) recorded maximum temperature (1058K), minimum level of CO (285ppm) and 6% oxygen. XRD results showed excellent interaction between PKS and additives. The appearance of potassium-alumino silicate (KAlSiO4) in the PKS-additive ash prevented the release of potassium chloride which has the ability to increase ash deposition and corrosion.

VL  - 23

AB  - Physiological trait variation underlies health, responses to global climate change, and ecological performance. Yet, most physiological traits are complex, and we have little understanding of the genes and genomic architectures that define their variation. To provide insight into the genetic architecture of physiological processes, we related physiological traits to heart and brain mRNA expression using a weighted gene co-expression network analysis. mRNA expression was used to explain variation in six physiological traits (whole animal metabolism (WAM), critical thermal maximum (CTmax), and four substrate specific cardiac metabolic rates (CaM)) under 12 degrees C and 28 degrees C acclimation conditions. Notably, the physiological trait variations among the three geographically close (within 15 km) and genetically similar F. heteroclitus populations are similar to those found among 77 aquatic species spanning 15-20 degrees of latitude (similar to 2,000 km). These large physiological trait variations among genetically similar individuals provide a powerful approach to determine the relationship between mRNA expression and heritable fitness related traits unconfounded by interspecific differences. Expression patterns explained up to 82% of metabolic trait variation and were enriched for multiple signaling pathways known to impact metabolic and thermal tolerance (e.g., AMPK, PPAR, mTOR, FoxO, and MAPK) but also contained several unexpected pathways (e.g., apoptosis, cellular senescence), suggesting that physiological trait variation is affected by many diverse genes.

TI  - Thermal Inactivation Kinetics and Radio Frequency Control of Aspergillus in Almond Kernels
VL  - 11
IS  - 11
AB  - Mold infections in almonds are a safety issue during post-harvest, storage and consumption, leading to health problems for consumers and causing economic losses. The aim of this study was to isolate mold from infected almond kernels and identify it by whole genome sequence (WGS). Then, the more heat resistant mold was selected and the thermal inactivation kinetics of this mold influenced by temperature and water activity (a(w)) was developed. Hot air-assisted radio frequency (RF) heating was used to validate pasteurization efficacy based on the thermal inactivation kinetics of this target mold. The results showed that the two types of molds were Penicillium and Aspergillus identified by WGS. The selected Aspergillus had higher heat resistance than the Penicillium in the almond kernels. Inactivation data for the target Aspergillus fitted the Weibull model better than the first-order kinetic model. The population changes of the target Aspergillus under the given conditions could be predicted from Mafart's modified Bigelow model. The RF treatment was effectively used for inactivating Aspergillus in almond kernels based on Mafart's modified Bigelow model and the cumulative lethal time model.

TI  - Syngas production for gas-to-liquids applications: technologies, issues and outlook
VL  - 71
IS  - 1
SP  - 139-148
AB  - The main gas-to-liquids (GTL) interest now is in Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis of hydrocarbons. While synthesis gas (syngas) for GTL can be produced from any carbon-based feedstock (hydrocarbons, coal, petroleum coke, biomass), the lowest cost routes to syngas so far are based on natural gas. Thus, the focus for GTL has been largely on associated gas, so-called stranded or remotely located gas reserves, and larger gas reserves that are not currently being economically exploited. The principal technologies for producing syngas from natural gas are: catalytic steam methane reforming (SMR), two-step reforming, autothermal reforming (ATR), partial oxidation (POX), and heat exchange reforming. The distinguishing characteristics of these technologies and their commercial uses are discussed in this paper. Ongoing R&D efforts to develop lower-cost syngas generation technologies are also briefly discussed. Relevant commercial experience with large-scale syngas generation for GTL is also discussed. As a frame of reference, in terms of syngas flow rates, a 20,000 b/day F-T plant would be comparable to three 2500 mt/day methanol plants. Single-train methanol plants are now producing more than 2500 t/day-and plants approaching 3000 mt/day have been announced. The projected relative economies of scale of the various syngas production technologies indicate that two-step reforming and ultimately, ATR, should be the technologies of choice for large-scale GTL plants. Nevertheless, for a 20,000 b/day F-T liquids plant, capital charges still dominate the manufacturing costs. Syngas production (oxygen plant and reforming) comprises half of the total capital cost of this size GTL plant. While air-blown reforming eliminates the expensive oxygen plant, air-blown reforming is unlikely to be competitive with, or offer the flexibility of, oxygen-blown reforming. The reasons for this conclusion are discussed. The proposed and future GTL facilities should be substantially less costly than their very expensive predecessors-as the result of improvements in FT catalyst and reactor design, the most significant of which have been pioneered by Sasol. In the absence of a breakthrough technology, economy of scale will be the only significant mechanism by which GTL can achieve greater economic viability. However, even with such further cost reductions, the economic viability of GTL plants will remain confined to special situations until crude price levels rise substantially. In the long term, if a ceramic membrane reactor (combining air separation and partial oxidation) can be developed that enables the 20% reduction in GTL investment costs that the R&D effort is targeting, GTL could become economically viable at crude prices below US$20/b.

SP  - 996-1002
AB  - In this study, airborne MS2 bacteriophages were exposed for subsecond time intervals to atmospheric-pressure cold plasma (APCP) produced using different power levels (20, 24, and 28 W) and gas carriers (ambient air, Ar-O-2 [ 2%, vol/ vol], and He-O-2 [ 2%, vol/ vol]). In addition, waterborne MS2 viruses were directly subjected to the APCP treatment for up to 3 min. MS2 viruses with and without the APCP exposure were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), reverse transcription-PCR (RTPCR), and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Viral inactivation was shown to exhibit linear relationships with the APCP generation power and exposure time (R-2 > 0.95 for all energy levels tested) up to 95% inactivation (1.3-log reduction) after a subsecond airborne exposure at 28 W; about the same inactivation level was achieved for waterborne viruses with an exposure time of less than 1 min. A larger amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as atomic oxygen, in APCP was detected for a higher generation power with Ar-O-2 and He-O-2 gas carriers. SEM images, SDS-PAGE, and agarose gel analysis of exposed waterborne viruses showed various levels of damage to both surface proteins and their related RNA genes after the APCP exposure, thus leading to the loss of their viability and infectivity.

TI  - Epoxy nanocomposite capacitors for application as MCM-L compatible integral passives
VL  - 124
IS  - 1
SP  - 1-6
AB  - Polymer/ceramic composite emerges as a novel material system for application as integral capacitors for the next generation of microelectronic industry where the discrete passive components such as capacitors, resistors, and inductors are likely to be replaced by the embedded components. In this study, epoxy based nanocomposites are selected due to their low-cost and low temperature processing advantages in comparison to the traditional polymers used in the microelectronic industry today. Other potential advantages of epoxy materials could be their aqueous based fabrication process and availability in the form of dry films for direct lamination onto substrates. This paper reports dielectric properties of epoxy nanocomposites made from three commercially available resin composites (i) a solvent based photodefinable epoxy, (ii) an aqueous based photodefinable epoxy, and (iii) a non-photodefinable epoxy. Possible avenues for achieving higher capacitance density in polymer/ceramic composites for future needs have been discussed. Deposition of polymer/ceramic thin films on a 300 mm x 300 mm PWB and glass substrates has been demonstrated using a state-of-the-art meniscus coater. The end goal of this study is to develop a defect-free manufacturable process for depositing and patterning particulate epoxy composite capacitors on large area PWB substrates. It is believed that the large area process will reduce the overall manufacturing costs and increase process yield, thus facilitate the economic viability of the integral passive technology.

TI  - Evaluation of mixtures performances in Organic Rankine Cycle when utilizing the geothermal water with and without cogeneration
VL  - 154
SP  - 567-576
AB  - In this paper, performances of some zeotropic mixtures in Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) have been assessed and evaluated for potential of utilizing the low-temperature and -caloric geothermal water. The options of single power generation and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) production through the common series and parallel configurations have been considered. The possible optimization of these applications when using the mixtures opposite pure fluids is the main objective and has been largely discussed. To reach this, the maximal power output level has been mainly focused as evaluation factor for variety of the heat source temperatures (up to 120) and heat consumer parameters. The results showed that in case of stand-alone ORC the mixtures: R438A, R422A and R22M are more efficient than the pure fluids advised and can enhance the power productivity and geothermal water utilization at the sources' temperatures 80, 100 and 120 degrees C, respectively. R407A and R22D also offer attractive outputs at source temperatures of 80 degrees C and 100 degrees C, respectively. Furthermore, compared to R601a in the series CHP option using R22M in the parallel CHP circuit at heat source temperature 120 degrees C is more feasible and enables considerable promotions for a wide field of conditions. Similarly, R422A at source temperature 100 degrees C is also energetically favorable, but only at conditions matching the low till moderate heat loads or high supply temperatures. Finally, R22M and R422A are always much better than the pure R227ea in the parallel ORC-CHP system within this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Progress in in-situ CO2-sorption for enhanced hydrogen production
VL  - 91
AB  - Deployment of fossil fuels to quench the energy demand of the world's rising population results in elevated levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially CO2, which in turn is responsible for undesirable climate change. This necessitates a shift toward cleaner energy resources such as hydrogen. Enhanced hydrogen production via steam reforming of diverse fuels (methane, biomass, organic wastes, etc.) with in-situ CO2-sorption seems to be a promising alternative. Leading-edge, innovative and eco-friendly pathways coupled with high process efficiencies are needed for the development and growth of this technology. This review article evaluates the fundamental concepts such as criteria for CO2 uptake, mechanisms, thermodynamics and kinetics of the water gas shift reaction along with different modeling methods for sorption enhanced processes. Moreover, research works carried out worldwide at lab-scale coupled with process development and demonstration units are discussed as a means to encourage this pathway for H-2 generation. Furthermore, light is shed on techno-economics as an approach to improve the viability and sustainability of the proposed technology. This paper analyzes different dimensions of the CO2-sorption enhanced process to promote it as a potentially carbon-neutral and ecofriendly pathway for hydrogen production.

TI  - The biodrying concept: An innovative technology creating energy from sewage sludge
VL  - 147
SP  - 124-129
AB  - A full-scale biodrying installation was treating 150 kton (wet weight) of dewatered waste activated sludge per year. The waste was treated at thermophilic conditions (65-75 degrees C) in a 2-step forced aeration process reducing the total wet sludge weight by 73%. The final product had a high caloric value (7700-10,400 (kJ/kg)), allowing a combustion for energy generation in external facilities. The resulting product met the European microbial and heavy metal quality standards needed for an application as organic fertilizer. The facility used <0.5 MW of electricity and recovered 9.3 MW from biologically produced heat, which was internally used for the heating of office buildings. Produced ammonia, originating from the microbial conversion of organic matter, was recovered from the ventilated air in an acid gas scrubber as an ammonium sulphate solution 40% (w/w) (7.3 kton/year) and was sold as substitute for artificial fertilizers. The sustainability of this process is discussed relative to other sludge handling processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 44

SP  - 53-57
AB  - The genetic mechanism of cool temperature resistance at the booting stage of rice, is largely unknown in spite of the significance in rice cultivation. We have screened 317 M2 lines derived from chemically mutagenized cv. Taichung 65 which is highly resistant to cool temperature. Repeated screening from M3 through M6 generation recovered seven cool temperature sensitive mutants. They showed significantly lower seed fertility than Taichung 65 when treated with cool water (19-degrees-C). Although the seed fertility fluctuated to some extent with years, four of the seven mutants showed very low seed fertility and one relatively high but significantly lower seed fertility than Taichung 65. The remaining two showed intermediate values. Segregation of seed fertility in F2 plants between Taichung 65 and the mutants suggested that many of the mutants were due to single-gene recessive mutations. In four mutants, pollen development was severely damaged by cool water treatment. Also female organ (embryosac) was malformed in some mutants. These seven mutants are potential materials for the investigation of cool resistance in rice.

TI  - Results of Reservoir Modeling of the Operation and Production of a Recompleted Gas Well in a Geopressured/Geothermal Reservoir in the Wilcox Formation, Texas, for Electricity Generation
VL  - 19
IS  - 6
SP  - 1151-1161
AB  - Reservoir modeling of production of hot geothermal fluid and natural gas from a geopressured reservoir in the Wilcox formation, Texas, for geothermal-electricity generation is carried out primarily on the basis of well-log data. The reservoir modeling takes into account operational considerations such as a constant target flow rate, a 30-year reservoir lifetime, and minimum wellhead pressure as well as uncertainty in reservoir parameters such as gas saturation and reservoir volume. The results of the reservoir modeling are presented and their relevance to other similar geopressured/geothermal wells with the potential for natural-gas production is discussed. Geopressured/geothermal reservoirs are found throughout the Texas and Louisiana Gulf coast region, generally starting at depths below 8,000 ft, and are characterized by high-temperature/high-pressure, brine-saturated layers of interbedded shales and sandstones with correspondingly large quantities of dissolved natural gas. The temperature of the brine from these formations is high enough that it could be used to run organic Rankine cycle or binary power plants to generate electricity, whereas the dissolved natural gas in the brine could be simultaneously collected and used to generate additional electricity or be sold as a byproduct. However, there is uncertainty about whether these reservoirs can maintain adequate production over the 30-plus-year lifetime of the power plant, and about what the natural-gas-production profiles would look like over this lifetime to supplement revenue from the geothermal-electricity production. This paper uses reservoir modeling to simulate the operation and production of a recompleted gas well in a geopressured/geothermal reservoir in the Wilcox formation, Texas, to assess the feasibility of the use of such reservoirs to produce a constant flow rate of high-temperature brine over a 30-year production lifetime for electricity generation. Reservoir modeling is a tool that can help predict fluid-flow rate and natural-gas production from complex reservoirs over a long-term time frame. Multiphase-flow reservoir modeling is used in this study to provide insight on the viability of recovering hot geothermal brine for electricity production over a time frame of 30 years by use of an existing natural-gas well. For this study, data from an abandoned gas well in the Wilcox formation in Texas, including a well log and fluid-chemistry data, are used to create a reservoir model with multiple layers of sandstone and shale with properties inferred from the well log and flow tests. The modeling also considers the impact of the well-operation limitations for the abandoned well after it is recompleted, such as a maximum frictional pressure drop in the well, on the geothermal-brine- and methane-production profiles. To assess the impact of key reservoir characteristics such as reservoir volume and gas saturation on the flow rate of geothermal brine and natural gas over the long term, a parametric-sensitivity analysis is completed by use of a range of reasonable values for these key reservoir parameters. For all the reservoir volumes considered (1.42 x 10(7) to 5.90 x 10(7) acre-ft), the flow rate of both geothermal brine and natural gas is sustained over the 30-year production period and it is determined that reservoir longevity is not an issue for electricity production. The free-phase-gas saturation has an observable impact on flow, with a higher free-gas saturation leading to lower geothermal-brine-and methane-flow rates caused by gas choking the flow in the near-well region. Overall, the multiphase reservoir modeling results indicate that for the reservoir considered, the well can be operated so that production of hot geothermal brine can be maintained over the lifetime of a binary power plant close to the target flow rates and that the quantities of natural gas produced would be significant for the overall power-plant-project economics.

TI  - Temperature-driven differences in phenology and habitat suitability for brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys, in two ecoregions of North Carolina
AB  - Brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal), is an invasive pest of Asian origin first detected in North Carolina in 2009. By 2015, it became an important pest in the mountain and Piedmont regions, but its population densities have remained low in the eastern plains regions. Starting with a cohort of diapausing adults in January of 2018 and 2019, semi-field cage studies were used to document the phenology and reproductive capacity of H. halys through October of each year at Mills River (mountains) and Goldsboro (Southeastern Plains) sites, which have the same photoperiod, but different temperature profiles. Halyomorpha halys was univoltine in the cooler mountain site, but bivoltine in the warmer plains site, leading to earlier emergence from overwintering diapause, greater heat unit accumulations, and a F1 adult generation that emerged before on-set of diapause-inducing conditions, which allowed for an F2 generation. However, only 17.2% of ovipositing F1 females laid egg masses that hatched, compared to > 90% of overwintered females. Poor establishment of H. halys in the plains versus mountains was attributed to heat stress that contributed to a higher percentage of overwintered adults that emerged early and did not oviposit, a truncated oviposition pattern by overwintered adults, and poor F2 egg hatch. Quadratic equations fit relationships between cumulative degree-days from biofix and proportional oviposition and adult eclosion of respective generations. Utility of the phenology model on a wider scale will depend on how well H. halys populations in other areas conform to North Carolina population's response to photoperiod and temperature.

AB  - Rivers are critical to agriculture, industry, and the needs of humans and wildlife. This study evaluates the water quality of the Beheshtabad River in Iran's Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province, using water quality index and multivariate statistical methods. Nitrate, temperature, phosphate, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, electrical conductivity, total solids, and pH were measured at five selected stations along the river over 6months using standard methods. Water quality index results demonstrated that water quality varied in the selected stations between average and good and that pollution in this section of the Beheshtabad River increases from upstream to downstream. Clustering and principal component analysis were also utilized. Multivariate statistical methods were used to analyze water conditions for efficient management of surface water quality. Agricultural fertilizers, upstream wastewater discharge, and fish farms constitute the main elements that decrease the water quality of the Beheshtabad River. To preserve this water resource against pollution, the implementation of stringent rules and guidelines are needed to enhance health and preserve water resources for future generations.

AB  - Significance: The increased activities of free radicals or reactive oxygen species in tissues of exercising humans and animals were first reported similar to 30 years ago. A great deal has been learned about the processes that can generate these molecules, but there is little agreement on which are important, how they are controlled, and there are virtually no quantitative data. Superoxide and nitric oxide are generated by skeletal muscle and their reactions lead to formation of secondary species. A considerable amount is known about control of superoxide generation by xanthine oxidase activity, but similar information for other generation systems is lacking. Recent Advances: Re-evaluation of published data indicates potential approaches to quantification of the hydrogen peroxide concentration in resting and contracting muscle cells. Such calculations reveal that, during contractions, intracellular hydrogen peroxide concentrations in skeletal muscle may only increase by similar to 100 nM. The primary effects of this modest increase appear to be in "redox'' signaling processes that mediate some of the responses and adaptations of muscle to exercise. These act, in part, to increase the expression of cytoprotective proteins (e.g., heat shock proteins and antioxidant enzymes) that help maintain cell viability. During aging, these redox-mediated adaptations fail and this contributes to age-related loss of skeletal muscle. Critical Issues and Future Directions: Understanding the control of ROS generation in muscle and the effect of aging and some disease states will aid design of interventions to maintain muscle mass and function, but is dependent upon development of new analytical approaches. The final part of this review indicates areas where such developments are occurring. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 15, 2477-2486.

TI  - An artificial metal-alloy interphase for high-rate and long-life sodium-sulfur batteries
VL  - 29
SP  - 1-8
AB  - Room-temperature sodium-sulfur battery is considered to be a promising candidate for next-generation batteries due to its high theoretical energy density (similar to 1274 Wh kg(-1)) and natural abundance of elements. There are however, a number of concomitant challenges, including large volume change, low ionic conductivity, rapid dendrite growth, and high chemical reactivity, which limit the viability of sodium anodes. Solid electrolyte interphases that address all 4 challenges simultaneously to enable high-rate cycling of sodium anodes remain scarce in the literature. Here we report an artificial metal-alloy interphase (MAI) comprising sodium-tin alloy, which was synthesized using a facile solid-vapor reaction of metallic sodium with tin tetrachloride vapors, instead of using typical liquid electrolytes with tin-based additives (solid-liquid reaction). The MAI was found to facilitate reversible deposition of sodium at relatively high current densities (2-7 mA cm(-2)), and allows sodium electrodes to cycle stably for over 650 cycles at 2 mA cm(-2) in sodium symmetric cells. Owing to the unique properties of MAI, such as strong electrode adhesion (to accommodate volume change), high ionic conductivity (to minimize overpotential), high Young's modulus (to suppress dendrite growth), and low electrolyte permeability (to minimize electrolyte reduction), the sodium anode with MAI can endure extended cycling test in sodium-sulfur batteries for over 500 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%. This solid-vapor chemistry concept to synthesize MAIs can also be generalized to other material systems such as sodium-silicon and sodium-titanium alloys.

TI  - Climate adaptation is not enough: warming does not facilitate success of southern tundra plant populations in the high Arctic
VL  - 23
IS  - 4
SP  - 1540-1551
AB  - Rapidly rising temperatures are expected to cause latitudinal and elevational range shifts as species track their optimal climate north and upward. However, a lack of adaptation to environmental conditions other than climate - for example photoperiod, biotic interactions, or edaphic conditions - might limit the success of immigrants in a new location despite hospitable climatic conditions. Here, we present one of the first direct experimental tests of the hypothesis that warmer temperatures at northern latitudes will confer a fitness advantage to southern immigrants relative to native populations. As rates of warming in the Arctic are more than double the global average, understanding the impacts of warming in Arctic ecosystems is especially urgent. We established experimentally warmed and non-warmed common garden plots at Alexandra Fiord, Ellesmere Island in the Canadian High Arctic with seeds of two forb species (Oxyria digyna and Papaver radicatum) originating from three to five populations at different latitudes across the Arctic. We found that plants from the local populations generally had higher survival and obtained a greater maximum size than foreign individuals, regardless of warming treatment. Phenological traits varied with latitude of the source population, such that southern populations demonstrated substantially delayed leaf-out and senescence relative to northern populations. Our results suggest that environmental conditions other than temperature may influence the ability of foreign populations and species to establish at more northerly latitudes as the climate warms, potentially leading to lags in northward range shifts for some species.

SP  - 486-494
AB  - The city of Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan, which has a population of 804,474, and has been experiencing rapid growth over the last 15 years, generates approximately 1.39 kg capita(-1) day(-1) of municipal solid waste (MSW). Nearly 700 tonnes of MSW are collected daily, of which 97% is disposed of at landfills. The newest landfill was built using modern technologies, including a landfill gas (LFG) collection system. The rapid growth of Astana demands more energy on its path to development, and the viability analysis of MSW to generate electricity is imperative. This paper presents a technical-economic pre-feasibility study comparing landfill including LFG utilization and waste incineration (WI) to produce electricity. The performance of LFG with a reciprocating engine and WI with steam turbine power technologies were compared through corresponding greenhouse gases (GHG) reduction, cost of energy production (CEP), benefit-cost ratio (BCR), net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) from the analyses. Results demonstrate that in the city of Astana, WI has the potential to reduce more than 200,000 tonnes of GHG per year, while LFG could reduce slightly less than 40,000 tonnes. LFG offers a CEP 5.7% larger than WI, while the latter presents a BCR two times higher than LFG. WI technology analysis depicts a NPV exceeding 280% of the equity, while for LFG, the NPV is less than the equity, which indicates an expected remarkable financial return for the WI technology and a marginal and risky scenario for the LFG technology. Only existing landfill facilities with a LFG collection system in place may turn LFG into a viable project.

TI  - Artificial nighttime light changes aphid-parasitoid population dynamics
VL  - 5
AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) is recognized as a widespread and increasingly important anthropogenic environmental pressure on wild species and their interactions. Understanding of how these impacts translate into changes in population dynamics of communities with multiple trophic levels is, however, severely lacking. In an outdoor mesocosm experiment we tested the effect of ALAN on the population dynamics of a plant-aphid-parasitoid community with one plant species, three aphid species and their specialist parasitoids. The light treatment reduced the abundance of two aphid species by 20% over five generations, most likely as a consequence of bottom-up effects, with reductions in bean plant biomass being observed. For the aphid Megoura viciae this effect was reversed under autumn conditions with the light treatment promoting continuous reproduction through asexuals. All three parasitoid species were negatively affected by the light treatment, through reduced host numbers and we discuss induced possible behavioural changes. These results suggest that, in addition to direct impacts on species behaviour, the impacts of ALAN can cascade through food webs with potentially far reaching effects on the wider ecosystem.

TI  - Mitochondrial Genome Contributes to the Thermal Adaptation of the Oomycete Phytophthora infestans
VL  - 13
AB  - As a vital element of climate change, elevated temperatures resulting from global warming present new challenges to natural and agricultural sustainability, such as ecological disease management. Mitochondria regulate the energy production of cells in responding to environmental fluctuation, but studying their contribution to the thermal adaptation of species is limited. This knowledge is needed to predict future disease epidemiology for ecology conservation and food security. Spatial distributions of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) in 405 Phytophthora infestans isolates originating from 15 locations were characterized. The contribution of MtDNA to thermal adaptation was evaluated by comparative analysis of mtDNA frequency and intrinsic growth rate, relative population differentiation in nuclear and mtDNA, and associations of mtDNA distribution with local geography climate conditions. Significant variation in frequency, intrinsic growth rate, and spatial distribution was detected in mtDNA. Population differentiation in mtDNA was significantly higher than that in the nuclear genome, and spatial distribution of mtDNA was strongly associated with local climatic conditions and geographic parameters, particularly air temperature, suggesting natural selection caused by a local temperature is the main driver of the adaptation. Dominant mtDNA grew faster than the less frequent mtDNA. Our results provide useful insights into the evolution of pathogens under global warming. Given its important role in biological functions and adaptation to local air temperature, mtDNA intervention has become an increasing necessity for future disease management. To secure ecological integrity and food production under global warming, a synergistic study on the interactive effect of changing temperature on various components of biological and ecological functions of mitochondria in an evolutionary frame is urgently needed.

VL  - 23
IS  - 7
SP  - 3665-3681
AB  - Low temperatures constrain cellular life due to reductions in nutrient uptake, enzyme kinetics, membrane permeability, and function of other biomacromolecules. This has implications for the biophysical limits of life on Earth, and the plausibility of life in extraterrestrial locations. Although most pseudomonads are mesophilic in nature, isolates such as the Antarctic Pseudomonas syringae Lz4W exhibit considerable psychrotolerance, with an ability to grow even between 4 and 0 degrees C. In this review, we explore the molecular traits and characteristic phenotypes of P. syringae Lz4W that enable life at low temperatures. We describe adaptations that enhance membrane fluidity; examine genes involved in cellular function and survival in the cold; assess capability for energy generation at low temperature; and detail the mechanics of DNA repair and RNA processing at low temperature, and speculate that P. syringae Lz4W can also synthesize glycerol to maintain flexibility of macromolecular systems. In the range 4 to 0oC, there are considerable changes in the properties and behaviour of water. Specifically, density can have adverse impacts on plasma-membrane functions, cytoplasmic viscosity, protein behaviour, and other essential properties of cellular system. We identified a combination of adaptations that may be peculiar to cold-tolerant P. syringae, including increase of unsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane; a RNA polymerase able to function at 0 degrees C; RecBCD- and RuvAB-dependent reestablishment of replication fork; and efficiencies of degradosome machinery and RNA processing by RNaseR at low temperature. Several unresolved questions are discussed in the context of astrobiology, and further work needed on the psychrotolerance of P. syringae.

AB  - The influence of the environment on selected elements of Southern Africa's marine biota is reviewed in order to provide a basis for examining possible impacts of anticipated climate change on the biota. Some fish species with pelagic larvae tend to spawn in regions of reduced off-shore transport and turbulence, but sufficient upwelling for the generation of adequate food supplies is also of importance. Benthic animals may be specially susceptible to factors influencing population densities, and many organisms respond to temperature changes. There is regional coherence in some biotic and oceangraphic indices, suggestive that environmental perturbations may affect large areas. The northern Benguela region is influenced by 'Benguela Ninos', which occur infrequently but result in southward displacements of both local populations and more tropical species. The Benguela Ninos seemingly benefit survival of the early stages of some organisms, but may decrease the production of others by up to 50%. In the southern Benguela region, a major shift in species dominance occured in the early 1960s. It is likely that the environment exerted an influence, but the mechanism is not known and the ability to predict both the timing and nature of ecosystem change remains poor. In the same region, large changes in the strengths of year-classes of important fish populations during a period of high oceanographic variability in the 1980s confirmed previous empirical observations that epipelagic species are favoured by warm conditions and groundfish by a cool environment. Species of recreational interest migrate to the southeast coast of Africa from both the northeast and the southwest. The strengths of the migrations may be influenced by environmental conditions in the areas of their origin.

TI  - Carbon balance implications of coconut biodiesel utilization in the Philippine automotive transport sector
VL  - 26

SP  - 579-585
AB  - Carbon dioxide inventory implications of a biodiesel program in the Philippines are assessed. Biodiesel is assumed to be the methyl ester of coconut oil. Different scenarios for the use of agricultural residues as fuel for heat or power generation are analyzed. Reduction in net CO2 emissions are estimated at 77-104 g/MJ of diesel displaced by biodiesel. These benefits are found to be particularly sensitive to the extent to which residues are utilized. The predicted reductions in CO2 emissions are much greater than values reported in recent studies on biodiesel derived from other vegetable oils, due both to the large amount of potential fuel in the residual biomass and to the low-energy inputs in traditional coconut fanning techniques. However, agricultural productivity constraints suggest that by 2010, the maximum level of biodiesel substitution for the entire country is only 8%. At this level of utilization reductions of 2.85-3.85% in the Philippines' projected 130 x 10(6) tons of carbon dioxide emissions per annum can be realized. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 5

SP  - 90202-90208
AB  - Flexible devices have attracted much attention due to their great potential as next-generation electronics and for their applications in healthcare, fitness and AI robots. In these devices, the circuits composed of printed metal pastes are regarded as the key components on various flexible substrates. Although low temperature silver (Ag) paste has been applied in these devices, a high price and electromigration seriously limit their wide application. Copper (Cu), which has almost the same conductivity but is low cost and electromigration-resistant has been expected to be a substitute for the Ag-based paste. Herein, sub-micro copper particles with a suitable diameter were synthesized by a simple large-scale polyol method. A Cu paste was further formed from the Cu particles and printed onto a flexible substrate to form a Cu-based pattern. A reactive plasma process was used to sinter the copper pattern at low temperature. A high conductivity Cu pattern with a resistivity of 15.9 mu Omega cm has been successfully fabricated with only 10 minutes sintering at 200 W due to an enhanced plasma effect. The temperature was below 75 degrees C during the plasma process. A V-shape Cu antenna pattern has also been arranged on PET to fabricate a flexible antenna device, and the results show that the pattern has the same sensitivity for high-frequency signals when compared to bulk commercial copper foil.

VL  - 79
SP  - 385-390
AB  - Nowadays fossil fuel plays a significant role in the global energy supply and demand. Many non-oil producers and agricultural countries have set the target of biomass utilization as alternative energy in their energy policy plan. Gasification is one of the promising technologies in terms of the conversion of biomass to heat and power. However, this technology has faced many challenges, e.g. high capital cost, low energy conversion efficiency, etc. As the Thai government has promoted the use of biomass as alternative energy and has financially supported the use of agricultural residue for heat and power production in 12 pilot projects, this study will review the current status of the gasification technology used in the projects and discuss the results of a performance test conducted in terms of feedstock consumption rate, producer gas yield, heating value of producer gas, and thermal efficiency. The feedstock used consisted of residue from wood, corncob, palm, etc. Four projects used producer gas for electrical power generation with the capacity ranged from 250 to 300 kWe and 8 projects to produce heat for use in the ceramics industry, for fertilizer drying, hotels, etc. According to the study, it was seen that downdraft air gasification technology is suitable for small-scale heat and power production. The heating value of the producer gas ranged from 1.89 to 5.89 MJ/Nm(3) and the maximum cold gas efficiency of 76.96% was able to be reached. (C) 2015 the Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Optimization of Production Parameters for Probiotic Lactobacillus Strains as Feed Additive
VL  - 24
IS  - 18
AB  - In animal nutrition, probiotics are considered as desirable alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters. The beneficial effects of probiotics primarily depend on their viability in feed, which demands technical optimization of biomass production, since processing and storage capacities are often strain-specific. In this study, we optimized the production parameters for two broiler-derived probiotic lactobacilli (L. salivarius and L. agilis). Carbohydrate utilization of both strains was determined and preferred substrates that boosted biomass production in lab-scale fermentations were selected. The strains showed good aerobic tolerance, which resulted in easier scale-up production. For the freeze-drying process, the response surface methodology was applied to optimize the composition of cryoprotective media. A quadratic polynomial model was built to study three protective factors (skim milk, sucrose, and trehalose) and to predict the optimal working conditions for maximum viability. The optimal combination of protectants was 0.14g/mL skim milk/ 0.08 g/mL sucrose/ 0.09 g/mL trehalose (L. salivarius) and 0.15g/mL skim milk/ 0.08 g/mL sucrose/ 0.07 g/mL (L. agilis), respectively. Furthermore, the in-feed stabilities of the probiotic strains were evaluated under different conditions. Our results indicate that the chosen protectants exerted an extensive protection on strains during the storage. Although only storage of the strains at 4 degrees C retained the maximum stability of both Lactobacillus strains, the employed protectant matrix showed promising results at room temperature.

TI  - Water masses constrain the distribution of deep-sea sponges in the North Atlantic Ocean and Nordic Seas
VL  - 659
SP  - 75-96
AB  - Water masses are bodies of water with distinctive physical and biogeochemical properties. They impart vertical structure to the deep ocean, participate in circulation, and can be traced over great distances, potentially influencing the distributions of deep-sea fauna. The classic potential temperature-salinity (theta-s) diagram was used to investigate deep-sea sponge (demosponge genus Geodia) association with water masses over the North Atlantic Ocean and Nordic Seas. A novel analysis was conducted, based on sampling the curvature of climatological mean theta-s curves at sponge locations. Sponges were particularly associated with turning points in the theta-s curves, indicative of intermediate and deep water masses. Arctic geodiid species (G. hentscheli and G. parva) were associated with Arctic intermediate and deep waters in the Nordic Seas, and with dense overflows into the northern North Atlantic. Boreal species (G. atlantica, G. barretti, G. macandrewii, and G. phlegraei) were associated with upper and intermediate water masses in the Northeast Atlantic and with upper, Atlantic-derived waters in the Nordic Seas. Taken together with distributional patterns, a link with thermohaline currents was also inferred. We conclude that water masses and major current pathways structure the distribution of a key deep-sea benthic faunal group on an ocean basin scale. This is most likely because of a combination of the physical constraints they place on the dispersal of early life-history stages, ecophysiological adaptation (evolved tolerances) to specific water masses, and the benefits to filter-feeders of certain phenomena linked to water column structure (e.g. nepheloid layers, internal waves/ tides, density-driven currents).

TI  - Development of a PF Fired High Efficiency Power Plant (AD700) an important issue for future power generation
SP  - 3-17
AB  - European efforts to start substantial improvements of the performance of well established supercritical coal-fired power technology named the AD700 project began in 1998. Major targets were development of austenitic materials and nickel-based super alloys for the hottest sections of boilers, steam lines and turbines. Other targets were development of boiler and turbine designs for the more advanced conditions, and finally economic viability of the AD700 technology has been investigated. The project has been very successful and 40 partners from the European power industry have worked together in several projects co-funded by the European Commission for 10 years. Procurement of a mature and commercially optimised AD700 plant could take place around 2015. The investigated nickel-based materials have shown very high creep strengths but they are hard to manufacture. Ongoing tests indicate that the developed austenitic material will fulfil its creep strength target and is now ready for commercialisation. Improved materials allow higher steam temperatures and pressures. Improved thermodynamic design optimises plant efficiencies for the given steam parameters. The present paper presents a proposal for an improved steam cycle named the Master Cycle (MC) based on a revision of the double reheat steam cycle where the bleeds of the IP turbines have been moved to a feed pump turbine bleeding on the first cold reheat line. The MC offers solid heat rate improvements of similar to 3.5% compared with single reheat cycles. These improvements maintain a flexible operation mode of the plant in relation to renewable energy production plants and facilitate efficient energy supply for a post combustion carbon capture installation. Further thermodynamic improvements enable an efficiency for a seawater-cooled 800MW AD700 power plant around 55% based on the MC. This is the perfect match to the future demand for zero emission power plants.

VL  - 44

AB  - Probiotics, in particular, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used as starter cultures in food and pharmaceutical industries. Presence of LAB supports the production and preservation of a diverse range of food products, provides a positive effect on the human gastrointestinal tract, and prevents the progression of many diseases. However, the main limiting factor in the application of LAB is that they hardly survive in acidic conditions, including the human digestive system. This factor inhibits LAB to maintain their functionality and deliver their health benefits to the host. For this purpose, magnetic immobilisation of LAB with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) was conducted to evaluate the effect of IONs on bacterial growth and their viability at low pH. Gram-positiveLactobacillus acidophilus,a well-known species of LAB, was selected for this study. The IONs were successfully synthesised with the average size of 7 nm and used for decoration ofL. acidophiluscells at low pH. Based on the results, a 1.8-fold increase in bacterial viability was observed by decorating cells with 360 mu g/mL IONs.

TI  - Outlier SNP markers reveal fine-scale genetic structuring across European hake populations (Merluccius merluccius)
VL  - 23
IS  - 1
SP  - 118-135
AB  - Shallow population structure is generally reported for most marine fish and explained as a consequence of high dispersal, connectivity and large population size. Targeted gene analyses and more recently genome-wide studies have challenged such view, suggesting that adaptive divergence might occur even when neutral markers provide genetic homogeneity across populations. Here, 381 SNPs located in transcribed regions were used to assess large- and fine-scale population structure in the European hake (Merluccius merluccius), a widely distributed demersal species of high priority for the European fishery. Analysis of 850 individuals from 19 locations across the entire distribution range showed evidence for several outlier loci, with significantly higher resolving power. While 299 putatively neutral SNPs confirmed the genetic break between basins (F-CT = 0.016) and weak differentiation within basins, outlier loci revealed a dramatic divergence between Atlantic and Mediterranean populations (F-CT range 0.275-0.705) and fine-scale significant population structure. Outlier loci separated North Sea and Northern Portugal populations from all other Atlantic samples and revealed a strong differentiation among Western, Central and Eastern Mediterranean geographical samples. Significant correlation of allele frequencies at outlier loci with sea-water surface temperature and salinity supported the hypothesis that populations might be adapted to local conditions. Such evidence highlights the importance of integrating information from neutral and adaptive evolutionary patterns towards a better assessment of genetic diversity. Accordingly, the generated outlier SNP data could be used for tackling illegal practices in hake fishing and commercialization as well as to develop explicit spatial models for defining management units and stock boundaries.

TI  - Selection and foraging response of harbour seals in an area of changing prey resources
VL  - 581
SP  - 199-214
AB  - Resource selection is a hierarchical and dynamic process. Selection can occur at different spatial and temporal scales, and can change over time with shifts in resource availability. The temporal dynamic of selection was investigated for a harbour seal Phoca vitulina population in Porsangerfjord, Norway, a subarctic fjord with large seasonal fluctuations in resource distribution. The availability of potential harbour seal prey was assumed to be dependent on the prey's biomass densities, distance from the seals' haulout sites and accessibility of the areas where prey was located, restricted by the presence of sea ice during winter and spring. The foraging behaviour of seals was investigated by assessing their preference and foraging response to the seasonal dynamics of prey distribution. The movement and dive patterns of individual seals (n = 10) were tracked with GPS devices. Foraging locations were compared to the availability of potential prey species in the fjord. Results suggested that harbour seals in Porsangerfjord had a preference for small-sized fish (<25 cm). Small codfish were preferred during autumn, but a response to the presence of pelagic fish was seen when the latter aggregated to overwinter in cold deep waters in the inner parts of the fjord. The formation of ice during late winter, however, provoked a shift in preference for small codfish, due to the sudden inaccessibility of pelagic fish. A strong reversed trend was observed in spring when the ice melted. The results indicate preference for small aggregated fish and the presence of a foraging response to changes in resource distribution.

TI  - A review of historical and contemporary processes affecting population genetic structure of Southern Ocean seabirds
VL  - 117
IS  - 1
SP  - 4-18
AB  - Genetic signatures of historical, behavioural and environmental processes are evident in contemporary seabird populations. Molecular markers have allowed us to determine historical patterns of gene flow, relationships among taxa, and contemporary dispersal barriers. The Southern Ocean contains a number of small, isolated islands that are home to four families of seabirds: albatrosses, petrels, penguins and skuas, which have been the focus of a number of population genetic studies. While capable of travelling large distances, many seabirds have restricted dispersal and exhibit high levels of population structure; typically in northern areas and areas with high endemism (e.g. New Zealand). We reviewed 29 studies of 25 Southern Ocean seabird species comparing biogeographic patterns, glacial history and barriers to gene flow, especially at-sea distribution and ocean currents. Despite diversity in behaviour and life history, our review demonstrates that population genetic structure of the seabirds corresponds to the same barriers. For penguins, currents are the major impediment to dispersal whereas at-sea distribution and island location influence population structure for many seabirds with genetically distinct populations on islands at the periphery of their range. As environmental conditions change, it will become more important to assess how seabirds respond and how these changes influence both dispersal and population structure. It is particularly important as a disproportionately high number of Southern Ocean seabirds are threatened or near threatened. Future studies need to focus on adaptive genetic markers, range-wide comprehensive sampling, influence of behaviour on genetic structure and lesser studied seabirds such as terns and cormorants.

TI  - Temporal variation in temperature determines disease spread and maintenance in Paramecium microcosm populations
VL  - 278
IS  - 1723
SP  - 3412-3420
AB  - The environment is rarely constant and organisms are exposed to temporal and spatial variations that impact their life histories and inter-species interactions. It is important to understand how such variations affect epidemiological dynamics in host-parasite systems. We explored effects of temporal variation in temperature on experimental microcosm populations of the ciliate Paramecium caudatum and its bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. Infected and uninfected populations of two P. caudatum genotypes were created and four constant temperature treatments (26 degrees C, 28 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 32 degrees C) compared with four variable treatments with the same mean temperatures. Variable temperature treatments were achieved by alternating populations between permissive (23 degrees C) and restrictive (35 degrees C) conditions daily over 30 days. Variable conditions and high temperatures caused greater declines in Paramecium populations, greater fluctuations in population size and higher incidence of extinction. The additional effect of parasite infection was additive and enhanced the negative effects of the variable environment and higher temperatures by up to 50 per cent. The variable environment and high temperatures also caused a decrease in parasite prevalence (up to 40%) and an increase in extinction (absence of detection) (up to 30%). The host genotypes responded similarly to the different environmental stresses and their effect on parasite traits were generally in the same direction. This work provides, to our knowledge, the first experimental demonstration that epidemiological dynamics are influenced by environmental variation. We also emphasize the need to consider environmental variance, as well as means, when trying to understand, or predict population dynamics or range.

VL  - 41
IS  - 4
SP  - 1085-1096
AB  - Risk assessment of metal-contaminated habitats based on responses in the field is complicated by the evolution of local, metal-resistant ecotypes. The unpredictability of occurrence of genetically determined adaptive traits, in terms of site-specific geochemistry, a population's inferred exposure history, and in the physiology of resistance, exacerbates the problem. Micro-evolutionary events warrant the attention of ecotoxicologists because they undermine the application of the bedrock of toxicology, the dose-response curve, to in situ field assessments. Here we survey the evidence for the existence of genetically differentiated, metal-resistant, invertebrate populations; we also describe some of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the adaptations. Quantitative changes in tissue-metal partitioning, and in the molecular and cellular responses (biomarkers) to alterations in internal bioreactive metal pools, are widely accepted as indicators of toxicity and/or exposure in free-living organisms. Both can be modulated by resistance. The understanding that all genomes are intrinsically flexible, with subtle sequence changes in promoter regions or epigenetic adjustments conferring significant phenotypic consequences, is deemed highly relevant. Equally relevant is the systems biology insight that genes and proteins are woven into networks. We advocate that biomarker studies should work toward assimilating and exploiting these biological realities through monitoring the activities of suites of genes (transcriptomics) and their expressed products (proteomics), as well as profiling the metabolite signatures of individuals (metabolomics) and by using neutral genetic markers to genotype populations. Ecotoxicology requires robust tools that recognize the imprint of evolution on the constitution of field populations, as well as sufficient mechanistic understanding of the molecular-genetic observations to interpret them in meaningful environmental diagnostic ways.

VL  - 23

SP  - 830-845
AB  - Solid oxide fuel cell - internal combustion engine (SOFC-ICE) hybrid systems are an attractive solution for electricity generation. The system can achieve up to 70% theoretical electric power conversion efficiency through energy cascading enabled by utilizing the anode off-gas from the SOFC as the fuel source for the ICE. Experimental investigations were conducted with a single cylinder Cooperative Fuel Research (CFR) engine by altering fuel-air equivalence ratio (phi), and compression ratio (CR) to study the engine load, combustion characteristics, and emissions levels of dry SOFC anode off-gas consisting of 33.9% H-2, 15.6% CO, and 50.5% CO2. The combustion efficiency of the anode off-gas was directly evaluated by measuring the engine-out CO emissions. The highest net-indicated fuel conversion efficiency of 31.3% occurred at phi = 0.90 and CR = 13:1. These results demonstrate that the anode off-gas can be successfully oxidized using a spark ignition combustion mode. The fuel conversion efficiency of the anode tail gas is expected to further increase in a more modern engine architecture that can achieve increased burn rates in comparison to the CFR engine. NOx emissions from the combustion of anode off-gas were minimal as the cylinder peak temperatures never exceeded 1800 K. This experimental study ultimately demonstrates the viability of an ICE to operate using an anode off-gas, thus creating a complementary role for an ICE to be paired with a SOFC in a hybrid power generation plant.

TI  - Multi-objective optimization of a 1G-2G biorefinery: A tool towards economic and environmental viability
VL  - 284
AB  - First-generation sugarcane ethanol production is a well-established technology. However, second-generation ethanol is not yet consolidated in industries. Under these circumstances, this work presents a multi-objective optimization of this process focusing on economic and environmental objectives. The impact of the Brazilian decarbonization program on an integrated biorefinery is analyzed, considering a first-generation ethanol conventional autonomous distillery and a second-generation process with hydrothermal pre-treatment, enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation of the xylose liquor. The economic metric was the Net Present Value and the environmental assessment was based on the plant inventory considering Global Warming Potential. A multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm was used, considering the ratio of bagasse diverted to the second-generation process, enzyme loading and solid fraction in the hydrolysis reactor as optimization variables. The carbon credit price was estimated for each point in the Pareto set in order to make the process economically feasible. As the main conclusions, there is a trade-off between economic and environmental targets, indicating that carbon credits may be essential for second-generation ethanol economic feasibility. The optimized integrated biorefinery is able to increase ethanol production by approximately 24% compared to first-generation biorefineries, but an increase in ethanol production higher than 13% would make the process economically unfeasible, while the decarbonization credits are not being commercialized. A price of $ 15.77 for decarbonization credits would make it possible to produce 20% more ethanol, keeping the integrated biorefinery economically feasible. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Experimental evolution in fluctuating environments: tolerance measurements at constant temperatures incorrectly predict the ability to tolerate fluctuating temperatures
VL  - 28
IS  - 4
SP  - 800-806
AB  - The ability to predict the consequences of fluctuating environments on species distribution and extinction often relies on determining the tolerances of species or genotypes in different constant environments (i.e. determining tolerance curves). However, very little is known about the suitability of measurements made in constant environments to predict the level of adaptation to rapidly fluctuating environments. To explore this question, we used bacterial clones adapted to constant or fluctuating temperatures and found that measurements across a range of constant temperatures did not indicate any adaptation to fluctuating temperatures. However, adaptation to fluctuating temperatures was only apparent if growth was measured during thermal fluctuation. Thus, tolerance curves based on measurements in constant environments can be misleading in predicting the ability to tolerate fast environmental fluctuations. Such complications could lead to false estimates of the genetic merits of genotypes and extinction risks of species due to climate change-induced thermal fluctuations.

TI  - CENTRALIZED BIOGAS PLANTS COMBINE AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS WITH ENERGY-PRODUCTION
VL  - 30
IS  - 12
SP  - 133-141
AB  - The concept of centralized biogas plants has been developed in Denmark. At present, 10 plants are in operation with capacities ranging from 50 to 500 tonnes of biomass per day. The biomass consists of approximately 80% manure co-digested with 20% organic waste from abattoirs and various food industries. The effluent is returned as nutritionally defined fertilizer, partly to the farms that supply fresh manure, and partly to other crop farmers. The plants are sited to ensure that the energy can be utilized, mainly for CHP generation. The heat is used for district heating of urban communities. Operational experience shows considerable increases in gas production primarily due to co-digestion of the manure with organic wastes. Possibilities of process regulation have been revealed, and stable thermophilic digestion has been achieved. A two-step process has turned out to be advantageous, the second step being lower temperature post digestion. Environmental and agricultural benefits include savings for farmers, improved fertilization efficiency, less greenhouse gas emission, and cheap, environmentally sound waste recycling. The working economy of the centralized biogas plants has improved, but there is still a need for further reductions in running costs if financially competitive plants are to be created without public investment grants.

TI  - A Protocooperation-based Sleep-Wake Architecture for Next Generation Green Cellular Access Networks
AB  - The rapidly increasing contribution towards global warming from the information communication technology (ICT) sector is a clear indication of the need for energy efficient green communication networks. For instance, in the case of cellular networks, over 80% of the total energy is consumed at the access network. On the other hand, incorporating self-sustainability and autonomy in its operation, control, and maintenance is significantly vital due to relatively larger sizes, higher complexities, and dynamic behaviors of future networks than those of current networks. In this paper, with the inspiration from the ecological principle of protocooperation, a novel energy efficient cellular access network architecture is proposed. With the adoption of the wake-up technology, base transceiver stations (BTSs) are made to protocooperate with each other to achieve higher energy efficiency within a cellular access network. Protocooperation is one of the ecological interactions by which two interacting species gain benefit through cooperation. However, this type of cooperation is not compulsory for the survival of any of these two species. To accomplish less energy consumption and higher self-sustainability at the access network, BTSs cooperatively and dynamically switch between active and sleep modes depending on the current traffic situation. The extent of self-sustainability incorporated in the proposed architecture is studied and analyzed. As per the result, our proposed architecture and algorithm are capable of achieving a significant amount of energy saving, which is an important step towards a self-sustainable green communication system.

TI  - A case study of tornado-producing storm south of Rhodopes mountain in the Eastern Mediterranean
VL  - 57

SP  - 187-199
AB  - A brief overview of tornadic events (wind spouts) over Bulgaria in the period 1904-1989 that have been recorded in the meteorological archive and described in scientific papers is presented. The local tornado (spout) on 15 May 1999 in Zhaltusha village (south of Rhodopes mountain in the most southern part of Bulgaria, close to the Mediterranean coast) is studied in detail. The case is associated with hail ('egg-shaped' stones about 5 cm in diameter) and caused damages of property valued above US$250 000. The high-wind-speed vortex blew off house roofs, rooted out trees, and turned over trucks. Using numerical model analysis fields and satellite imagery, evidence is presented, which illustrates the role of synoptic scale mechanisms for the generation of the severe storm. On the large scale, the circulation pattern is associated with a trough disruption process over the area of Western Europe, North Atlantic and Mediterranean. Under the influence of southwestern flow in the lower troposphere, warm and moist Mediterranean air is advected in the region of strong westerlies in the higher levels. Together with the role of low-level warm/moist advection and westerly transport of cold air at the mid-upper levels. diurnal heating, terrain-induced lifting, etc., are also critical for the initiation of deep convection over the region of tornadic event. As a result of these factors, a typical cloud pattern developed that indicates the existence of a local area of negative vertical gradient of the thermal advection in the troposphere, associated with the dramatic destabilisation. Other synoptic- and mesoscale elements may also be revealed or confirmed by satellite and radiosonde data. The nearest Rhodopes radiosounding (at Thessaloniki airport) and surface meteorological data from Kurdjaly station are used for air mass analysis in the vicinity of the storm. The obtained result shows very high values of atmospheric instability indices (the energy E-i = 3327 J/kg K, TT1 = 45.6 degreesC, K-1 = 16.5 degreesC). The updraft was up to 20 m/s and the difference of wind velocity at 300- and 700-hPa levels was up to 10 m/s. Cloud water content reached up to 12 g/kg. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

TI  - What makes the difference? - Sea sturgeon on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean
VL  - 56
SP  - 285-+
AB  - Sea Sturgeons are closely related anadromous fishes inhabiting both shores of the North Atlantic Ocean. They are classified in two species: the European sturgeon Acipenser sturio in Europe and the Atlantic sturgeon A. oxyrinchus in North America. The Atlantic sturgeon is further separated into two subspecies: Atlantic sturgeon (North American East Coast populations) A. o. oxyrinchus and Gulf sturgeon A. o. desotoi. Most recent studies of morphology and genetics support these classifications. Furthermore, they produced evidence for a trans-Atlantic colonization event during the early Middle Ages. Atlantic sturgeon colonized Baltic waters, founding a self-reproducing population before they became extinct due to anthropogenic reasons. Today, populations of Atlantic sturgeon are found along the Atlantic Coast from the St. Johns River, Florida to the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, whereas only one relict spawning population of European sturgeon still exists in the Gironde River, France. The evidence of a population of Atlantic sturgeon in Baltic waters requires a detailed comparison of both sea sturgeon species, describing differences and similarities, which may influence the ongoing restoration projects in Europe as well as concerning conservation efforts in North America. This article reviews similarities and differences in the fields of genetics, morphology, and ecological adaptation of European sturgeon and Atlantic sturgeon, concluding that, besides morphological and genetic differences, a wider range of spawning temperatures in Atlantic sturgeon is evident. This wider temperature adaptation may be a selective advantage under fast-changing climatic conditions, possibly the mechanism that enabled the species shift in the Baltic Sea during the Middle Ages.

TI  - Novel Hydrogen Bioreactor and Detection Apparatus
VL  - 152
SP  - 35-51
AB  - In vitro hydrogen generation represents a clear opportunity for novel bioreactor and system design. Hydrogen, already a globally important commodity chemical, has the potential to become the dominant transportation fuel of the future. Technologies such as in vitro synthetic pathway biotransformation (SyPaB)-the use of more than 10 purified enzymes to catalyze unnatural catabolic pathways-enable the storage of hydrogen in the form of carbohydrates. Biohydrogen production from local carbohydrate resources offers a solution to the most pressing challenges to vehicular and bioenergy uses: small-size distributed production, minimization of CO2 emissions, and potential low cost, driven by high yield and volumetric productivity. In this study, we introduce a novel bioreactor that provides the oxygen-free gas phase necessary for enzymatic hydrogen generation while regulating temperature and reactor volume. A variety of techniques are currently used for laboratory detection of biohydrogen, but the most information is provided by a continuous low-cost hydrogen sensor. Most such systems currently use electrolysis for calibration; here an alternative method, flow calibration, is introduced. This system is further demonstrated here with the conversion of glucose to hydrogen at a high rate, and the production of hydrogen from glucose 6-phosphate at a greatly increased reaction rate, 157 mmol/L/h at 60 degrees C.

TI  - Impacts of flow diversion for small hydroelectric power plants on sediment transport, northwest Washington
VL  - 16
IS  - 5
SP  - 432-443
AB  - Hydroelectric power is a major source of electric energy in northwestern Washington, and an important part of the region's economy. In ''run-of-the-river'' hydroelectric projects, water is diverted from a river when the discharge exceeds a specified flow and is conveyed downhill to a powerhouse. Creeks used for hydropower generation also constitute the natural spawning habitat for anadromous cold-water fish. Because fish embryo survival rates decrease with an increase in the percentage of fine sediments in spawning gravels, studies of the potential effects of flow diversion on sediment transport are typically required when applying for a permit to build a run-of-the-river project. To provide insight into the actual impacts of flow diversion on sediment conditions, and thus fish habitat, we reproduced channel-morphology measurements and sediment texture sampling originally made for the pre-construction study of Koma Kulshan, a small run-of-the-river hydroelectric power plant in northwestern Washington that has been in operation since 1990. Potential non-project changes were controlled by additional sampling upstream of the project. Flow diversion appears to have had an impact on fine-sediment transport, but has not significantly affected coarse-sediment transport in the gravel-bed streams studied. This is because flow diversion represents a small portion of the peak flows likely to move coarse sediment, but can be a significant portion of the low flows during which only fine sediment is transported.

TI  - Stress response and ischemic tolerance in the brain
SP  - 69-75
AB  - In order to elucidate the cellular stress responses of the brain induced by ischemia-reperfusion, we investigated the induction of stress proteins in the cultured astrocytes exposed to hypoxia-reoxygenation (H-R). In a separate in vivo study, we examined the inducibility of ischemic tolerance and heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) in moderately symptomatic gerbils by unilateral preconditioning ischemia. In the former studies, we first attempted to clarify the role of the most abundant stress protein, glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 78, in H-R. Introduction of antisense oligonucleotide to GRP78 into astrocytes suppressed H-R-induced astrocyte release of interleukin 6 (IL-6), and cell lysates from H-R astrocytes displayed induction of IL-6, which was present in the samples immunoprecipitated with anti-GRP78, suggesting the role of GRP78 as a molecular chaperone for sustaining generation of IL-6 under the stress of H-R. Another unique stress protein, oxygen-regulated protein 150 (ORP150), was purified and through several experimental steps we cloned the ORP150 gene successfully. These stress proteins may contribute to the adaptive response of astrocytes to ischemic stress, thereby ultimately contributing to the enhanced survival of neurons. In the latter studies, ischemic tolerance could be induced in the ipsilateral caudate-putamen of gerbils with moderate neurological signs secondary to preconditioning unilateral ischemia which was reversible but strong enough to induce HSP72. The present investigation strongly suggested an important role of stress proteins in the cellular stress responses of the brain subjected to ischemia-reperfusion.

TI  - In-Situ Characterization of Moisture Absorption and Hygroscopic Swelling of Silicone/Phosphor Composite Film and Epoxy Mold Compound in LED Packaging
AB  - Epoxy mold compound (EMC) and optical grade silicone based materials have been widely used in manufacturing Light Emitting Diode (LED). Silicones are being used as encapsulant and lenses for next-generation LED packaging designs, such as chip on board (COB) LEDs. Silicones serve several roles including protective lenses, stress relieving encapsulant, mechanical protection and light path materials. Even though silicone-based materials are typically hydrophobic, they are not resistant to moisture absorption, which may greatly affect the key attributes of silicones such as high transparency, high refractive index, stable thermo-mechanical properties, and tunable hardness. On the other hand, EMCs are used in LEDs as packaging material because of their low cost and high productivity, whereas their moisture absorption is long known. In this study, a new generation of silicone/phosphor composite films and a commonly-used EMC material for COB LEDs are studied regarding their moisture absorption and hygroscopic swelling behaviors by in-situ measurements. Moisture sorption tests were performed using TGA Q5000SA at different humidity and temperature conditions, such as 30 degrees C & 30% RH, 30 degrees C & 60% RH, 30 degrees C & 80% RH, 60 degrees C & 30% RH, 60 degrees C & 60% RH, 60 degrees C & 80% RH, 80 degrees C & 30% RH, 80 degrees C & 60% RH and 80 degrees C & 80% RH. Hygroscopic swelling was detennined using DMA-RH Q800 at 60 degrees C. Material properties including diffusivity, activation energy, saturated moisture concentration and the coefficient of hygroscopic swelling are extracted from the experimental data. Based on the results, comprehensive discussions are made on the characteristics of moisture absorption and hygroscopic swelling for the two different materials.

TI  - Carbonized rice husk coated solar absorber for clean water generation from seawater with a solar still
AB  - This study demonstrated the generation of clean water from seawater collected at the beach coast in Universiti Malaysia Sabah, Malaysia, with carbonized rice husk coated melamine sponge as solar absorber by a solar still. Melamine sponge was utilized as a seawater transportation medium since its porous structure is excellent in channelling the seawater. Whereas carbonized rice husk was used as the photothermal conversion material for its efficient heat absorption due to its black colour and porous structure. Implementing air gap between the seawater body and solar absorber, and restricted water pathway assisted in localizing heat on the top surface of the solar absorber. Clean water was generated under direct solar radiation during the day at an open space with average solar intensity around 1.1 similar to 1.2 kW/m(2) (slightly higher than 1 sun) for about 4 h. Efficiency of the solar absorber was calculated, while the quality of the generated clean water was observed in terms of salinity and pH value. Insulated solar still with carbon-coated sponge showed the highest efficiency at about 54.74%. Salinity of the collected clean water significantly reduced to consumable level which was approximately 55 ppm, and the pH value at about 6.73 where it was within the safe limit of the drinkable water pH.

VL  - 56
AB  - Crassostrea nippona is a commercially important oyster species in East Asia for it is edible during the summer when the other oyster species are unavailable. Salinity is one of the important limiting factors to the survival and distribution of this stenohaline species. In this study, 535 million reads (74G data) from C. nippona were produced and assembled into 66,742 transcripts. The number of 19,253 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under salinity stress were identified as salinity stress-response genes. Through comparative evolutionary analysis in five Crassostrea species from East Asia, salinity stress-response genes were noticed to have higher adaptive evolution rates than other genes. This study presents the first de novo transcriptome of C. nippona. Furthermore, comparative evolutionary analysis implies that salinity plays an important role in speciation of Crassostrea species.

TI  - Low Temperature Plasma Reforming of Hydrocarbon Fuels Into Hydrogen and Carbon Suboxide for Energy Generation Without CO2 Emission
VL  - 40

SP  - 1362-1370
AB  - An alternative process of extracting energy from fossil fuels (coal, biomass, hydrocarbons, etc.) without the emission of CO2 is possible with nonequilibrium plasma. Apart from CO and CO2, there exists carbon suboxide (C3O2)-a solid carbon oxide, which can be polymerized to form chemically and thermodynamically stable substances. This article describes a novel process of extracting the energy from fossil fuels without the emission of CO2 while producing hydrogen and carbon suboxide (a reddish, brown polymer), an important constituent of organic fertilizers. This approach has the capability of avoiding drawbacks associated with combustion of fossil fuels, such as CO2 emission. The conversion processes of a hydrocarbon feedstock (n-butane) and characterization of the byproduct of the conversion process with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy are discussed. Thermodynamic calculation of energy efficiencies of conversion of readily available hydrocarbon feedstocks such as biomass, natural gas, and low quality coal (lignite and peat) into hydrogen and carbon suboxide is also discussed. Thermodynamic results calculated show energy efficiency of up to 78% for producing carbon suboxide from various hydrocarbon feedstocks when compared to energy efficiency of producing syngas (100%).

AB  - The recent series of global catastrophic events (e.g., heatwaves, flooding) have again raised the concerns over the greater impact of climate change. The focus has been concentrated towards reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel based energy systems. It is necessary to build a commercially viable CO2 sensor with high reliability. The gas-sensing field has shifted from using a cumbersome gas-reference electrode to solid-state electrochemical devices because they can be employed to detect CO2 in real-time overcoming the limits of widely used IR-based CO2 sensors. Here, solid electrolytes and mixed conducting semiconductor-based gas sensors for various gaseous species including CO2 are reviewed. The study on semiconducting metal oxides (SMOs) has been pushed forward as a most viable option for commercializing monolithic all-solid-state electrochemical gas sensors. Among SMOs, the perovskite-type metal oxides are considered as one of the promising structures for next-generation greenhouse gas sensors due to their remarkable thermal and chemical stability. This article also includes the fundamental understanding of essential factors that govern the electrical signals in all-solid-state electrochemical gas sensors. (c) 2020 The Author(s).

The photocatalytic activity of [OMIM]Br/FeCl3 ILs as homogenous photocatalysts were investigated towards hydrogen generation from methanol/water mixtures under visible light irradiation. The FeCl3-based IL with [OMIM]Br/FeCl3 molar ratio of 1 : 1 exhibited the highest visible light photocatalytic activity with a hydrogen productivity of 243.2 mmol h(-1) g(-1) and a hydrogen purity of 95.5 %; such a high hydrogen yield and purity was reported for the first time. It was proposed that [OMIM] Br acted as an electron acceptor, which delayed the electron-hole pair recombination of FeCl3. Also, [OMIM] Br could capture the produced carbon dioxide that is released with hydrogen gas. Additionally, [OMIM] Br/FeCl3 could be reused six times with nearly the same photocatalytic activity. These outstanding credits in terms of hydrogen generation rate and purity plus the economic feasibility, through several cycles of reuse, could certify such an IL as a promising photocatalyst for employment in water splitting. This paper suggests ways forward for research to develop the use of ILs as efficient and effective photocatalysts for hydrogen generation via water splitting.

TI  - New advances in hydrogen production via the catalytic decomposition of wax by-products using nanoparticles of SBA frame-worked MoO3
VL  - 106
SP  - 615-624
AB  - The alternative energy sources in general and hydrogen based energy in particular have been currently grabbing great attention. Hydrogen is an efficient green source for power generation owing to its huge energy content. The operational costs and the hydrogen output are the key factors in the selection of a certain technique for the hydrogen production industrially. This study summarizes a new route for hydrogen production starting from a bit complicated hydrogen-containing molecules. Particular attention is given during this work towards a direct pyrrolysis catalytic conversion of long chains n-paraffin into hydrogen with in-situ production of nano-structured carbon particles. The simultaneous isomerization of the n-paraffin contented in the feedstock is also discussed during this process. This research study had provided new advances in the hydrogen production based on carrying out the production process at non-severe conditions namely; low operational temperatures and no pressure was applied. The introduction of a meso-porous molybdenum oxide catalyst for the catalytic hydrogen production is also a point of novelty for the presented work. Promising results have been disclosed at the end of this investigation; approximately 60 wt.% of the feedstock was converted to fuel gases while nearly 30 wt.% of the feed had turned as nano-carbon species. The hydrogen productivity had been detected as high as 42 wt.% of the original feedstock. This in fact might provide a new platform of the hydrogen production throughout the conversion of wax by-products. In comparison to two commercial catalysts, the hydrogen yield obtained by the prepared catalyst in this work had heavily scored. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 38

SP  - 205-213
AB  - Body temperature has a major influence on the physiological processes, growth, reproductive output, and overall survival of ectotherms. When a habitat is altered as a result of natural or anthropogenic influences, the available temperatures in the habitat can change, thus affecting an animal's ability to thermoregulate. We studied thermoregulation in response to habitat change in a population of spotted turtles (Clemmys guttata) in Southern Ontario, Canada. Historically, the study site was ditched to draw down water levels to facilitate peat mining, and the resulting drainage ditches were the only habitat containing surface water and turtles were restricted to these drains. Recent colonization of the site by beaver (Castor canadensis) caused increases in water level and water surface area. We followed spotted turtles (N=16) outfitted with radio transmitters and iButtons to estimate body temperatures (T-b) continuously throughout the active season post-flooding. Turtle models outfitted with iButtons (N=50) were deployed in the nine available habitat types to record environmental temperatures (T-e). Turtles (N=13) were tested in a thermal gradient under laboratory conditions to determine preferred body temperature range (T-set). The T-set for the population ranged from 20 degrees C to 26 degrees C. In the field, T-b was within the T-set range 28% of the time from March to October, and 67% of the time from July to August. Efficiency of thermoregulation was calculated to be highest in July and August. The habitat type with the highest thermal quality was the shallow flooded zone created by beaver damming, and the habitat with the lowest thermal quality was the drain bottom, the drains being the only aquatic habitat available prior to flooding. This study confirms that beaver flooding provided a wide variety of preferable thermal opportunities for spotted turtles. Further investigation is needed to determine the effects of flooding on spotted turtle thermoregulation during nesting and hibernation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 147
IS  - 2
SP  - 344-348
AB  - Prior exposure to extreme temperatures can induce thermoprotection in migratory locusts, which is important for survival in their natural environment. An important motor activity that needs to be protected is ventilation. The mechanism underlying heat shock is not ftilly understood, and our goal was to test the idea that cytoskeletal stability is critical for such thermoprotection. Cytoskeletal stabilizers (concanavalin A) and destabilizers (colchicine) were bath-applied in semi-intact locust preparations in both control (C) and pre-treated heat-shocked (3 It, 45 degrees C) animals. We measured parameters of the ventilatory motor pattern during maintained high temperature (43 degrees C) and recorded the times taken for motor pattern generation to fail and then recover on returning to room temperature. We found that concanavalin A mimicked the effects of a prior heat stress in control animals by increasing time to failure and decreasing time to recovery of motor pattern generation. However, colchicine destroyed protection in heat-shocked animals by decreasing time to failure and increasing time to recovery. Our findings confirm that the cytoskeleton has a mechanistic role in preserving neural function at high temperatures, possibly through stabilizing ion channels and other integral membrane proteins (e.g. Na+/K+ ATPase) and their interactions with heat shock proteins.

VL  - 25

SP  - 22-31
AB  - In the present work the aerodynamic performances of an innovative rotor blade row have been experimentally investigated. Measurements have been carried out in a large scale low speed single stage cold flow facility at a Reynolds number typical of aeroengine cruise, under nominal and off-design conditions. The time-mean blade aerodynamic loadings have been measured at three radial positions along the blade height through a pressure transducer installed inside the hollow shaft, by delivering the signal to the stationary frame with a slip ring. The time mean aerodynamic flow fields upstream and downstream of the rotor have been measured by means of a five-hole probe to investigate the losses associated with the rotor. The investigations in the single stage research turbine allow the reproduction of both wake-boundary layer interaction as well as vortex-vortex interaction. The detail of the present results clearly highlights the strong dissipative effects induced by the blade tip vortex and by the momentum defect as well as the turbulence production, which is generated during the migration of the stator wake in the rotor passage. Phase-locked hot-wire investigations have been also performed to analyze the time-varying flow during the wake passing period. In particular the interaction between stator and rotor structures has been investigated also under off-design conditions to further explain the mechanisms contributing to the loss generation for the different conditions.

TI  - Brassica carinata as an alternative oil crop for the production of biodiesel in Italy: Engine performance and regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions
VL  - 36
IS  - 21
SP  - 4656-4662
AB  - A comparison of the performance of Brassica carinata oil-derived biodiesel with a commercial rapeseed oil-derived biodiesel and petroleum diesel fuel is discussed as regards engine performance and regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions. B. carinata is an oil crop that can be cultivated in coastal areas of central-southern Italy, where it is more difficult to achieve the productivity potentials of Brassica napus (by far the most common rapeseed cultivated in continental Europe). Experimental tests were carried out on a turbocharged direct injection passenger car diesel engine fueled with 100% biodiesel. The unregulated exhaust emissions were characterized by determining the SOOT and soluble organic fraction content in the particulate matter, together with analysis of the content and speciation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, some of which are potentially carcinogenic, and of carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones)that act as ozone precursors. B. carinata and commercial biodiesel behaved similarly as far as engine performance and regulated and unregulated emissions were concerned. When compared with petroleum diesel fuel, the engine test bench analysis did not show any appreciable variation of output engine torque values, while there was a significant difference in specific fuel consumption data at the lowest loads for the biofuels and petroleum diesel fuel. The biofuels were observed to produce higher levels of NOx concentrations and lower levels of PM with respect to the diesel fuel. The engine heat release analysis conducted shows that there is a potential for increased thermal NOx generation when firing biodiesel with no prior modification to the injection timing. It seems that, for both the biofuels, this behavior is caused by an advanced combustion evolution, which is particularly apparent at the higher loads. When compared with petroleum diesel fuel, biodiesel emissions contain less SOOT, and a greater fraction of the particulate was soluble. The analysis and speciation of the soluble organic fraction of biodiesel particulate suggest that the carcinogenic potential of the biodiesel emissions is probably lower than that of petroleum diesel. Its better adaptivity and productivity in clay and sandy-type soils and in semiarid temperate climate and the fact that the performance of its derived biodiesel is quite similar to commercial biodiesel make B. carinata a promising oil crop that could offer the possibility of exploiting the Mediterranean marginal areas for energetic purposes.

TI  - Growth and salinity tolerance of juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from two introduced New Zealand populations
VL  - 76
IS  - 12
SP  - 2219-2226
AB  - Self-sustaining populations of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were established in New Zealand, from a common introduction group, near the turn of the 20th century. To investigate possible population divergence over this relatively short time scale we compared size, growth, and hypersalinity tolerance of families from two populations over their first year of rearing under shared conditions. Differences in initial fry mass were consistent with egg-size differences, but there was also evidence of genetic differences in early growth rates. Size differences between the populations decreased over time and rank correlations of mean family mass with initial egg and fry masses degraded over increasing intervals to nearly zero by the end of the year. Population effects on hypersalinity tolerance were not apparent after 4, 6, or 10 months of rearing (from yolk absorption), but family effects were suggested by ANOVAs and by the existence of groups of families with seemingly different relative seasonal optima for tolerance. Thus far, investigation of juvenile traits under common environmental conditions has shown less genetic divergence between the two New Zealand populations than is suggested by the range of differences found for phenotypic traits measured on wild adults in previous investigations.

TI  - Atomic layer deposition assisted pattern transfer technology for ultra-thin block copolymer films
VL  - 613
SP  - 32-37
AB  - As an emerging developing technique for next-generation lithography, directed self-assembly (DSA) of block copolymer (BCP) has attracted numerous attention and has been a potential alternative to supplement the intrinsic limitations of conventional photolithography. In this work, the self-assembling properties of a lamellar diblock copolymer poly(styrene-b-methylmethacrylate) (PS-b-PMMA, 22k-b-22k, L-0 = 25 nm) on Si substrate and an atomic layer deposition (ALD)-assisted pattern transfer technology for the application of DSA beyond 16/14 nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology nodes, were investigated. Firstly, two key processing parameters of DSA, i.e. annealing temperatures and durations of BCP films, were optimized to achieve low defect density and high productivity. After phase separation of BCP films, self-assembling patterns of low defect density should be transferred to the substrate. However, due to the nano-scale thickness and the weak resistance of BCP films to dry etching, it is nearly impossible to transfer the BCP patterns directly to the substrate. Therefore, an ALD-based technology was explored in this work, in which deposited Al2O3 selectively reacts with PMMA blocks thus hardening the PMMA patterns. After removing PS blocks by plasma etching, hardened PMMA patterns were left and transferred to underneath SiO2 hard mask layer. Using this patterned hard mask, nanowire array of 25 nm pitch were realized on Si substrate. From this work, a high-throughput DSA baseline flow and related ALD-assisted pattern transfer technique were developed and proved to have good capability with the mainstream CMOS technology.

TI  - The reproductive potential of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita is affected by selection for virulence against major resistance genes from tomato and pepper
VL  - 131
IS  - 3
SP  - 431-440
AB  - The emergence of virulent root-knot nematode populations, able to overcome the resistance conferred by some of the resistance genes (R-genes) in Solanaceous crops, i.e., Mi(s) in tomato, Me(s) in pepper, may constitute a severe limitation to their use in the field. Research has been conducted to evaluate the durability of these R-genes, by comparing the reproduction of several laboratory-selected and wild virulent Meloidogyne incognita isolates, on both susceptible and resistant tomatoes and peppers. We first show that the Me1 R-gene in pepper behaves as a robust R-gene controlling avirulent and virulent Me3, Me7 or Mi-1 isolates. Although the reproductive potential of the virulent isolates was highly variable on susceptible and resistant plants, we also confirm that virulence is highly specific to a determined R-gene on which selection has occurred. Another significant experimental result is the observation that a reproductive fitness cost is associated with nematode virulence against Mi-1 in tomato and Me3 and Me7 in pepper. The adaptative significance of trade-offs between selected characters and fitness-related traits, suggests that, although the resistance can be broken, it may be preserved in some conditions if the virulent nematodes are counter-selected in susceptible plants. All these results have important consequences for the management of plant resistance in the field.

AB  - Recently Bekker et al. [Bekker G-J et al. Protein Sci. 2019;28:429-438.] described a computational strategy of applying molecular-dynamics simulations to estimate the relative stabilities of single-domain antibodies, and utilized their method to design changes with the aim of increasing the stability of a single-domain antibody with a known crystal structure. The structure from which they generated potentially stabilizing mutations is an anti-cholera toxin single domain antibody selected from a naive library which has relatively low thermal stability, reflected by a melting point of 48 degrees C. Their work was purely theoretical, so to examine their predictions, we prepared the parental and predicted stabilizing mutant single domain antibodies and examined their thermal stability, ability to refold and affinity. We found that the mutation that improved stability the most (7 degrees C) was one which changed an amino acid in CDR1 from an asparagine to an aspartic acid. This change unfortunately was also accompanied by a reduction in affinity. Thus, while their modeling did appear to successfully predict stabilizing mutations, introducing mutations in the binding regions is problematic. Of further interest, the mutations selected via their high temperature simulations, did improve refolding, suggesting that they were successful in stabilizing the structure at high temperatures and thereby decrease aggregation. Our result should permit them to reassess and refine their model and may one day lead to a usefulin silico approach to protein stabilization.

TI  - Forecasting Life Cycle CO2 Emissions of Electrified Vehicles by 2030 Considering Japan's Energy Mix
VL  - 12

SP  - 806-813
AB  - This paper presents a comprehensive life-cycle analysis of CO2 (LCCO2) emissions from automobiles using a hybrid life-cycle inventory approach to predict the growth of electrified vehicles in Japan. Herein, the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), plug-in HEV (PHEV), and battery electric vehicle (BEV) versions of the mass-produced Toyota Prius hatchback are analyzed, considering the automobile-usage environment in Japan. In particular, a breakeven analysis of HEV vs. PHEV vs. BEV is conducted in terms of LCCO2 emissions that are affected by (i) outside air temperature and (ii) CO2 emissions during power generation from the present day up to 2030. Our results show that HEV has the lowest LCCO2 emissions when the current thermal-power-dependent electricity generation mix (average for 2012-2014) is considered, followed in order by PHEV and BEV. However, it is predicted that in 2030, PHEV will have the lowest LCCO2 emissions, followed in order by HEV and BEV, as it is anticipated that nuclear and renewable energy sources will be widely available by 2030. PHEV is expected to gain popularity by 2030. Regarding BEV, large quantities of CO2 emissions are emitted during battery production. Furthermore, due to the domestic electricity generation mix from the present day up to 2030, the LCCO2 emissions of BEV will exceed those of HEV and PHEV.

AB  - The top management or the owners of a company are mainly interested in the overall economics and productivity of their industrial plants, and are always on the lookout for analyses which should be able to guide them in their decision and policy making processes. They usually like the overall outputs to be compared to total inputs in terms of quantities and costs, are generally not bothered about the intricacies of individual plant/unit efficiencies and the technicalities, and therefore they are always looking towards simple and easier ways to assess their operations, plant effectiveness and economics. For the owners of a cogeneration power plant producing power and water, it is just another industrial plant which should produce two saleable products, from burning the fuel and processing the sea water. Cost-wise this should be economical and balanced. The Water and Electricity Department (WED), Abu Dhabi, has been using various types of hydrocarbon fuels as the main source of energy inputs for its power and desalination plants. The experience in fuel control has resulted in development of a proposed novel methodology for the analysis of combined power and desalination plants as a single unit, as far as fuel efficiency, the allocation of fuels to power and desalination and the relevant specific fuel costs for power generation and water production are concerned. The paper presents the idea of using a heat value for potable water produced from desalination of sea water. It discusses the use of overall fuel efficiency of the system for fuel allocation to power and desalination, and balancing the energy input against the output of power and desalination plants in the WED network, based on its own data.

VL  - 61

SP  - 254-263
AB  - Bacteria of the genus Spiroplasma are widely found in plants and arthropods. Some of the maternally transmitted Spiroplasma endosymbionts in arthropods are known to kill young male hosts (male killing). Here, we describe a new case of Spiroplasma-induced male killing in a moth, Ostrinia zaguliaevi. The all-female trait caused by Spiroplasma was maternally inherited for more than 11 generations but was spontaneously lost in several lineages. Antibiotic treatment eliminated the Spiroplasma infection and restored the 1:1 sex ratio. The survival rates and presence/absence of the W chromosome in the embryonic and larval stages of O. zaguliaevi showed that males were selectively killed, exclusively during late embryogenesis in all-female broods. Based on phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA, dnaA and rpoB gene sequences, the causative bacteria were identified as Spiroplasma belonging to the tick symbiont Spiroplasma ixodetis clade. Electron microscopy confirmed bacterial structures in the follicle cells and follicular sheath of adult females. Although many congeneric Ostrinia moths harbor another sex ratio-distorting bacterium (Wolbachia), only O. zaguliaevi harbors Spiroplasma.

TI  - Crystallinity and lattice vacancies of different mesoporous g-C3N4 for photodegradation of tetracycline and its cytotoxic implication
VL  - 308
AB  - Tetracycline (TC) antibiotic removal from water bodies is important to provide clean water and sanitation. Mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) photocatalyst derived from three different types of precursors manages to remove TC effectively under visible light irradiation. Among urea, thiourea, and melamine precursors, melamine-prepared GCN (MGCN) via thermal polymerization has the highest efficiency to photodegrade tetracycline (TC) antibiotics up to 99.5% (0.0122 min(-1)) within 240 min. The COD for TC removal by using MGCN was up to 77.5% after 240 min of degradation. This is due to the slow charge recombination and rapid charge carrier migration. The MGCN encounters different properties such as high crystallinity, dense structure allowing fast charges migration, and nitrogen vacancies that create a defect state that suppresses charge recombination. It was found that the conduction band (CB) of MGCN was located at a more negative position (E-CB = -0.33 V) than (O-2/O-2(center dot-)) and the valence band (VB) was placed at a more positive position (E-VB = 2.30 V) than (H2O/OH center dot), which allows generation of both radicals for photodegradation. Based on the cell viability test, the photodegraded TC in the water how non-toxicity toward Balb/c 3T3 cells after being irradiated (lambda > 420 nm) for 240 min under visible light. The MGCN prepared in this study demonstrated the highest effectiveness and recyclable photocatalyst for the removal of TC among all GCNs.

TI  - Implementation of integrated membrane processes for pilot scale development of fractionated milk components
VL  - 80
IS  - 1
SP  - 139-153
AB  - Numerous opportunities For the separation and Fractionation of milk and whey components are presented as a result of continuing developments in filtration membranes modules and processes. The preparation of sufficient quantities of selected protein groups for functionality studies and food application tests requires considerable amounts of starting material, particularly in the case of whey-based constituents. Adequate amounts of membrane filtration surface area are, therefore, needed in order to expedite processing time, limit conditions for microbial growth and increase productivity from a product development point of view. With this objective in mind, a series of large pilot plant membrane separation systems based on microfiltration, ultrafiltration and electrodialysis were recently installed and commissioned. Rapid ultrafiltration of whey for the generation of high protein concentrates under a wide variety of conditions, including 'cold' filtration, is facilitated by a Memtech(TM) spiral wound membrane plant with a maximum surface area of 144 m(2) that is accommodated within 3 modules mounted in parallel. Designed to operate on a continuous feed-and-bleed principle, product is heated while pumping via a plate-heater to the plant's balance tank in order to raise temperature to the desired operating condition. Magnetic now meters mounted on the feed, permeate and diafiltration water lines enable the volume concentration ratio to be controlled throughout a run. Defatting of rennet whey by microfiltration using a Tetra Pak Alcross(TM) M, Type 2 x 19 Special, crossflow microfiltration (MF) plant fitted with a 0.1 mu m pore size ceramic membrane with a filtration area of 13.3 m(2) trebled flux rate during ultrafiltration at 12 degrees C under steady state conditions. High protein whey protein concentrates (ca. 80% total protein) were processed in the defatted and nondefatted state at either 50 degrees C or 12 degrees C for functional characterisation, Preliminary analyses indicate that all 4 WPC's produced weak gels. Native phosphocasein was prepared from skim milk using the above MF plant. Partial demineralisation of skim milk prior to MF was facilitated using an Ionics (Ionics Inc.) Electromat(TM) ED, featuring a 100-cell pair Mark III electrodialysis membrane stack. Electrodialysis resulted in improvements in the heat stability profile of phosphocasein, at the expense of rennet coagulation properties which were totally eliminated even in the presence of added calcium.

TI  - The impact of environmental and human factors on urban heat and microclimate variability
VL  - 95
SP  - 199-208
AB  - Urbanization is known to cause noticeable changes in the properties of local climate. Studies have shown that urban areas, compared to rural areas with less artificial surfaces, register higher local temperatures as a result of Urban Heat Islands (UHIs). Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities in the world and a high proportion of its population residing in densely built high-rise buildings are experiencing some degrees of thermal discomfort. This study selected Mong Kok and Causeway Bay, two typical urban communities in Hong Kong, to gather evidence of microclimate variation and sources of thermal discomfort. UHIs were estimated from 58 logging sensors placed at strategic locations to take temperature and humidity measurements over 17 consecutive days each in the summer/hot and winter/cool periods. By employing geographic information and global positioning systems, these measurements were geocoded and plotted over the built landscape to convey microclimate variation. The empirical data were further aligned with distinct environmental settings to associate possible factors contributing to UHIs. This study established the existence and extent of microclimate variation of UHI within urban communities of different environmental configuration and functional uses. The findings provided essential groundwork for further studies of UHI effects to inform sources of local thermal discomfort and better planning design to safeguard environmental health in public areas.

TI  - Hydrogen peroxide: A central player in physical plasma-induced oxidative stress in human blood cells
VL  - 48
IS  - 5
SP  - 542-549
AB  - Plasma medicine is an interdisciplinary field and recent clinical studies showed benefits of topical plasma application to chronic wounds. Whereas most investigations have focused on plasma-skin cell interaction, immune cells are omnipresent in most tissues as well. They not only elicit specific immune responses but also regulate inflammation, which is central in healing and regeneration. Plasma generates short-lived radicals and species in the gas phase. Mechanisms of plasma-cell interactions are not fully understood but it is hypothesized that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) mediate effects of plasma on cells. In this study human blood cells were investigated after cold atmospheric plasma treatment with regard to oxidation and viability. Plasma generates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the responses were similar in cells treated with concentration-matched H2O2. Both treatments gave an equivalent reduction in viability and this was completely abrogated if catalase was added prior to plasma exposure. Further, five oxidation probes were utilized and fluorescence increase was observed in plasma-treated cells. Dye-dependent addition of catalase diminished most but not all of the probe fluorescence, assigning H2O2 a dominant but not exclusive role in cellular oxidation by plasma. Investigations for other species revealed generation of nitrite and formation of 3-nitrotyrosine but not 3-chlorotyrosine after plasma treatment indicating presence of RNS which may contribute to cellular redox changes observed. Together, these results will help to clarify how oxidative stress associates with physical plasma treatment in wound relevant cells.

TI  - A simple approach for stochastic generation of spatial rainfall patterns
VL  - 472
SP  - 63-76
AB  - Rainfall scenarios are of considerable interest for design flood and flood risk analysis. To this end, the stochastic generation of continuous rainfall sequences is often coupled with the continuous hydrological modelling. In this context, the spatial and the temporal rainfall variability represents a significant issue, especially for basins in which the rainfall field cannot be approximated through the use of a single station. Therefore, methodologies for the spatially and temporally correlated rainfall generation are welcome. An example of such a methodology is the well-established Spatial-Temporal Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulse (STNSRP), a modification of the single-site Neyman-Scott Rectangular Pulse (NSRP) approach, designed to incorporate specific features to reproduce the rainfall spatial cross-correlation. In order to provide a simple alternative to the STNSRP, a new method of generating synthetic rainfall time series with pre-set spatial temporal correlation is proposed herein. This approach relies on the single-site NSRP model, which is used to generate synthetic hourly independent rainfall time series at each rain gauge station with the required temporal autocorrelation (and several other appropriately selected statistics). The rank correlation method of Iman and Conover (IC) is then applied to these synthetic rainfall time series in order to introduce the same spatial cross-correlation that exists between the observed time series. This combination of the NSRP model with the IC method consents the reproduction of the observed spatial-temporal variability of a rainfall field. In order to verify the proposed procedure, four sub-basins of the Upper Tiber River basin are investigated whose basin areas range from 165 km(2) to 2040 km(2). Results show that the procedure is able to preserve both the rainfall temporal autocorrelation at single site and the rainfall spatial cross-correlation at basin scale, and its performance is comparable with that of the STNSRP model for rainfall field generation. Given its simple formal structure (based on well established methods: i.e. NSRP and IC), we believe that the proposed approach can be conveniently utilized to generate spatially and temporally correlated rainfall scenarios.

TI  - Brazilian silverside, Atherinella brasiliensis (Quoy & Gaimard,1825) embryos as a test-species for marine fish ecotoxicological tests
VL  - 9
AB  - The fish embryo test (FET) is an alternative to the classic freshwater toxicity test used to assess environmental hazards and risks to fish. This test has been standardized and adopted by the Organization for Economic and Cooperation and Development (OECD). As salinity may affect the substances' toxicity, we describe the development of an alternative euryhaline test species for embryonic ecotoxicological tests: the Brazilian silverside Atherinella brasiliensis (Quoy & Gaimard, 1825). This species is broadly distributed along the coast of South America and is able to inhabit a broad range of environmental and saline conditions. Ours is the first study on the maintenance of a native South American species for natural reproduction and the generation of embryos for tests. The embryos used are transparent and possess fluorescent cells which have only been seen in a few species and which may be used as markers, making it an alternative assessment tool for the lethal and sublethal substances in marine and estuarine environments. We provide a detailed description and analysis of embryonic development under different salinities and temperatures. The embryos and larvae developed in similar ways at different salinities, however as temperatures increased, mortality also increased. We considered the effects of the reference toxicants Zn2+ and SDS using a protocol similar to the FET that was standardized for zebrafish. Brazilian silverside embryos are as sensitive as freshwater, or euryhaline fish, to the surfactant but are more resistant to metals prior to hatching. We were able to show the advantages of the Brazilian silverside as a model for a marine fish embryo test (FETm) with high levels of reproducibility and little contaminated waste.

TI  - Self-Powered Smart Beehive Monitoring and Control System (SBMaCS)
VL  - 21
IS  - 10
AB  - Beekeeping in Africa has been practiced for many years through successive generations and along inherited patterns. Beekeepers continue to face challenges in accessing consistent and business-driven markets for their bee products. In addition, the honeybee populations are decreasing due to colony collapse disorder (CCD), fire, loss of bees in swarming, honey buggers and other animals, moths, starvation, cold weather, and Varoa mites. The main issues are related to un-controlled temperature, humidity, and traditional management of beekeeping. These challenges result in low production of honey and colony losses. The control of the environmental conditions within and surrounding the beehives are not available to beekeepers due to the lack of monitoring systems. A Smart Beehive System using Internet of Things (IoT) technology would allow beekeepers to keep track of the amount of honey created in their hives and bee colonies even when they are far from their hives, through mobile phones, which would curtail the challenges currently faced by the beekeepers. However, there are challenges in the design of energy-efficient embedded electronic devices for IoT. A promising solution is to provide energy autonomy to the IoT nodes that will harvest residual energy from ambient sources, such as motion, vibrations, light, or heat. This paper proposes a Self-Powered Smart Beehive Monitoring and Control System (SBMaCS) using IoT to support remote follow-up and control, enhancing bee colonies' security and thus increasing the honey productivity. First, we develop the SBMaCS hardware prototype interconnecting various sensors, such as temperature sensor, humidity sensor, piezoelectric transducer-which will work as a weight sensor-motion sensor, and flame sensor. Second, we introduce energy harvesting models to self-power the SBMaCS by analyzing the (i) energy harvested from adult bees' vibrations, (ii) energy harvesting through the piezoelectric transducer, and (iii) radio frequency energy harvesting. Third, we develop a mobile phone application that interacts with the SBMaCS hardware to monitor and control the various parameters related to the beehives. Finally, the SBMaCS PCB layout is also designed. SBMaCS will help beekeepers to successfully monitor and control some important smart beekeeping activities wherever they are using their mobile phone application.

TI  - Sustainable NOx production from air in pulsed plasma: elucidating the chemistry behind the low energy consumption
VL  - 24
IS  - 2
SP  - 916-929
AB  - N-Based fertilisers are paramount to support our still-growing world population. Current industrial N-2 fixation is heavily fossil fuel-dependent, therefore, a lot of work is put into the development of fossil-free pathways. Plasma technology offers a fossil-free and flexible method for N-2 fixation that is compatible with renewable energy sources. We present here a pulsed plasma jet for direct NOx production from air. The pulsed power allows for a record-low energy consumption (EC) of 0.42 MJ (mol N)(-1). This is the lowest reported EC in plasma-based N-2 fixation at atmospheric pressure thus far. We compare our experimental data with plasma chemistry modelling, and obtain very good agreement. Hence, we can use our model to explain the underlying mechanisms responsible for this low EC. The pulsed power and the corresponding pulsed gas temperature are the reason for the very low EC: they provide a strong vibrational-translational non-equilibrium and promote the non-thermal Zeldovich mechanism. This insight is important for the development of the next generation of plasma sources for energy-efficient NOx production.

TI  - Household income inequality aggravates high-temperature exposure inequality in urban China
VL  - 275
AB  - The exposure to extremely high temperatures varies across population groups. Those with better adaptation strategies (such as air conditioning) suffer less. This paper combines China's daily mean temperature data with comprehensive national survey data at the household level and estimates the relationship between high-temperature exposure and adaptation behavior of urban dwellers. We find that the usage of air conditioning and electric fans by urban households in China increases with their summer high-temperature exposures. The rise in the number of days with extreme heat (mean temperature exceeding 80 degrees F) induces the purchase and use of air conditioning. High-temperature adaptability varied across households-the rich are more likely to increase air conditioning usage to cope with the high-temperature discomfort; while the poor are less likely to afford such a market product for adaptation, they suffer more from high-temperature exposure. Such a variation in the affordability and usage of market products to adapt to climate risks will exacerbate the climate-induced inequality.

TI  - Conversion of Solid Waste into Functional Carbon Materials: A Review
VL  - 6
IS  - 1
SP  - 52-68
AB  - Population explosion and increasing living standard of people resulted in generation of more than a Giga ton of waste per annum worldwide. Hence waste is one of the global problems in 21st century and expected that waste generation continues in future also. Every human activity is left with some waste. There are some major sectors for waste generation, such as manufacturing sector, agricultural sector (in the form of biomass) and municipality waste etc. These wastes are having minimal value or even negative values and creating problem or burden to the environment, human health etc. Therefore, it is utmost important to process and manage those wastes properly. The existing waste management processes involves: recycling, dumping and landfilling, incineration/combustion etc., which are neither sufficient to nullify the adverse effect of the waste nor economic process. These management processes involve human intervention and thereby resulting huge expenses. Nowadays, there is a paradigm shift from management of waste into conversion of waste producing fertilizer, fuel, energy as well as carbon materials etc. In this review, effort is given exclusively to summarize the different processes of waste conversion into functional carbon material such as activated carbon, porous carbon, carbon nanotube, graphene, carbon dot, carbon fibre etc. It has been discussed with the help of illustrative examples from the literatures.

TI  - Interactive Effects of Temperature and Plant Host on the Development Parameters of Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)
VL  - 13
IS  - 8
AB  - Simple Summary The beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is an economic pest that causes significant damage to various vegetables and field crops in Korea. Timely forecasting of pest emergence and occurrence plays a vital role in pest management. To predict the spring emergence and population dynamics of S. exigua, constant temperature-mediated developmental parameters of S. exigua were studied with linear and nonlinear models on different plant hosts. The temperature and plant host significantly influenced the development of S. exigua. The total developmental time decreased with the increase in temperature, although there was no development at extreme temperatures. We developed a forecasting model, and our findings predicted the spring emergence of S. exigua in June. Thus, continuous monitoring of S. exigua in crop fields is needed to be ready to take advanced management measures against S. exigua. This study investigated the effects of different temperatures (15, 20, 25, 27, 30, 35, and 40 degrees C) on the development rate of Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) eggs, larvae, pupae, and total immatures on plant hosts (soybean, maize, potato, and green pea). The eggs of S. exigua developed successfully at all the tested temperatures, except at 40 degrees C. The total developmental time (egg-adult) decreased with an increasing temperature from 15 to 35 degrees C on plant hosts. Stage-specific parameters such as the lower threshold temperature (TH) were determined using linear and nonlinear models (Sharpe-Schoolfield-Ikemoto [SSI]). The lower developmental threshold (LDT) and thermal constant (K) were determined using a linear model. The LDT and K for the total immature stage had respective values of 11.9 degrees C and 397.27 degrees -day (DD) on soybean, 11.6 degrees C and 458.34 degrees -day (DD) on maize, 11.2 degrees C and 446.23 degrees -day (DD) on potato, 10.7 degrees C and 439.75 degrees -day (DD) on green pea, and 12.2 degrees C and 355.82 degrees -day (DD) on the artificial diet. The emergence frequency of adult S. exigua over the full range of constant temperatures was simulated using nonlinear developmental rate functions and the Weibull function. This study predicted the spring emergence date in the first to second weeks of June, with approximately five generations for plant hosts. The interaction of temperature and plant host also influenced the development and longevity of the adults. Overall, the findings of this study may be useful for predicting the number of generations, occurrence, population dynamics in crop fields, and management of S. exigua.

TI  - Assessment of the total lightning flash rate density (FRD) in northeast Brazil (NEB) based on TRMM orbital data from 1998 to 2013
VL  - 93
AB  - The Northeast region of Brazil (NEB) concentrates on average 18 % of the total deaths associated with lightning strikes in Brazil. When considering population, the state of Piaui had the highest mortality rate in the region (1.8 deaths million(-1)), much higher than the national rate (0.8) and the NEB rate (0.5). This work aimed to evaluate the space-time distribution of total lightning (intracloud, cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground) in NEB, covering the period from 1998 to 2013. For this purpose, we used data from the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) aboard the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, which provided information on the occurrence of total lightning, and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor aboard on TERRA satellite, which provided the terrain elevation data to verify the influence of topography on the flash rate density (FRD). The full distribution was used to identify the hotspots (cities with the highest FRD), while the monthly distribution helped in the cluster analysis. NEB has great spatial and temporal variability of the recorded lightning rates, with average of 0-44.5 flash km(-2) year(-1). The regions with high total lightning rates are located in the states of Piaui, MaranhAo and west of Bahia. The topography of the region seems to act as a facilitator of the convective process, leading to the formation of intense upward currents, essential for the generation of electric charges inside thunderstorms. CAPE values showed good relationship with lightning occurrence in the region. The cluster with the highest occurrence of lightning and hotspots is in the region of influence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and Mesoscale Convective Systems, suggesting an important relationship with large organized cloud systems.

TI  - Geology, fluid inclusion and isotope constraints on ore genesis of the post-collisional Dabu porphyry Cu-Mo deposit, southern Tibet
VL  - 89
SP  - 421-440
AB  - The Dabu Cu-Mo porphyry deposit is situated in the southern part of the Lhasa terrane within the post-collisional Gangdese porphyry copper belt (GPCB). It is one of several deposits that include the Qulong and Zhunuo porphyry deposits. The processes responsible for ore formation in the Dabu deposit can be divided into three stages of veining: stage I, quartz-K-feldspar (biotite) chalcopyrite pyrite, stage II, quartz-molybdenite +/- pyrite +/- chalcopyrite, and stage III, quartz-pyrite +/- molybdenite. Three types of fluid inclusions (FIs) are present: liquid-rich two-phase (L-type), vapor-rich two-phase (V-type), and solid bearing, multi-phase (S-type) inclusions. The homogenization temperatures for the FIs from stages I to III are in the ranges of 272-475 degrees C, 244-486 degrees C, and 299-399 degrees C, and their salinities vary from 2.1 to 49.1, 1.1 to 55.8, and 2.9 to 18.0 wt% NaCl equiv., respectively. The coexistence of S-type, V-type and L-type FIs in quartz of stage I and II with similar homogenization temperatures but contrasting salinities, indicate that fluid boiling is the major factor controlling metal precipitation in the Dabu deposit. The ore forming fluids of this deposit are characterized by high temperature and high salinity, and they belong to a H2O-NaCl magmatic-hydrothermal system. The H-O-S-Pb isotopic compositions indicate that the ore metals and fluids came primarily from a magmatic source linked to Miocene intrusions characterized by high Sr/Y ratios, similar to other porphyry deposits in the GPCB. The fluids forming the Dabu deposit were rich in Na and Cl, derived from metamorphic dehydration of subducted oceanic slab through which NaCl-brine or seawater had percolated. The inheritance of ancient subduction-associated arc chemistry, without shallow level crustal assimilation and/or input of the meteoric water, was responsible for the generation of fertile magma, as well as CO2-poor and halite-bearing FIs associated with post-collisional porphyry deposits. The estimated mineralization depths of Qulong, Dabu and Zhunuo deposits are 1.6-43 km, 0.5-3.4 km and 0.2-3.0 km, respectively, displaying a gradual decrease from eastern to western Gangdese. Deep ore-forming processes accounted for the generation of giant-sized Qulong deposit, because the exsolution of aqueous fluids with large fraction of water and chlorine in deep or high pressure systems can extract more copper from melts than those formed in shallow systems. However, the formation of small-sized Dabu deposit can be explained by a single magmatic event without additional replenishment of S, metal, or thermal energy. In addition, the ore-forming conditions of porphyry Cu-Mo deposits in GPCB are comparable to those of porphyry Cu +/- Au +/- Mo deposits formed in oceanic subduction-related continental or island arcs, but differ from those of porphyry Mo deposit formed in the Dabie-Qinling collisional orogens. The depth of formation of the mineralization and features of primary magma source are two major controls on the metal types and ore-fluid compositions of these porphyry deposits.

TI  - Enhancing the Adaptability of the Deep-Sea Bacterium Shewanella piezotolerans WP3 to High Pressure and Low Temperature by Experimental Evolution under H2O2 Stress
VL  - 84
IS  - 5
AB  - Oxidative stresses commonly exist in natural environments, and microbes have developed a variety of defensive systems to counteract such events. Although increasing evidence has shown that high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and low temperature (LT) induce antioxidant defense responses in cells, there is no direct evidence to prove the connection between antioxidant defense mechanisms and the adaptation of bacteria to HHP and LT. In this study, using the wild-type (WT) strain of a deep-sea bacterium, Shewanella piezotolerans WP3, as an ancestor, we obtained a mutant, OE100, with an enhanced antioxidant defense capacity by experimental evolution under H2O2 stress. Notably, OE100 exhibited better tolerance not only to H2O2 stress but also to HHP and LT (20 MPa and 4 degrees C, respectively). Whole-genome sequencing identified a deletion mutation in the oxyR gene, which encodes the transcription factor that controls the oxidative stress response. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that the genes associated with oxidative stress defense, anaerobic respiration, DNA repair, and the synthesis of flagella and bacteriophage were differentially expressed in OE100 compared with the WT at 20 MPa and 4 degrees C. Genetic analysis of oxyR and ccpA2 indicated that the OxyR-regulated cytochrome c peroxidase CcpA2 significantly contributed to the adaptation of WP3 to HHP and LT. Taken together, these results confirmed the inherent relationship between antioxidant defense mechanisms and the adaptation of a benthic microorganism to HHP and LT.

VL  - 66

SP  - 268-280
AB  - Number of mares mated per stallion, foaling rate, reproductive life and generation interval of a Warmblood population were analysed exemplary as a basis for future breeding strategy. Records were obtained, for the period 1978 to 1991, from Hanoverian herd registration book. Out of the 189.006 registered matings 109.005 foalings were observed within the span of 14 breeding years. During the period between 1978 to 1991,45.4% stallions were mated with less than 10 mares. On an average, the stallions were kept for 4.0 years for breeding and mated with 29.S mares (s = 34.6) per season. The mean value of stallions mated with less than 10 mares per year, was 41.9%. The average foaling rate was 57.7% per year. The foaling rate increased with increase in the artificial insemination practise. In 1990 more than 61 % foalings were observed. The reproductive life of the mares born in 1977 was analysed. The average reproductive life of such mares were 4.6 years with 2.7 foals born within the span of 14 years. The generation intervals for dam-daughter, dam-son, sire-daughter and sire-son were L(dd) = 9.1, L(ds) = 9.2, L(sd) = 10.7 and L(ss) = 10.7 years for each respective path (s = 4.2-4.8). The integration of performance tests on mares in a breeding programme were discussed. Therefore, simulation studies were conducted. The application of test results for estimating more accurate breeding values of sires results distinctly higher selection response (about 25%) per generation.

VL  - 55
IS  - 9
SP  - 818-824
AB  - Female adults of the rice leaf bug Trigonotylus caelestialium (Kirkaldy) (Heteroptera: Miridae) produce non-diapause eggs under long-day conditions, whereas they produce diapause eggs under short-day conditions. These egg-production modes change following a photoperiodic change from long-day to short-day conditions or vice versa, with individual variations in responsiveness shown in the time from the photoperiodic change to the mode change. Strains of this insect with higher or lower responsiveness to photoperiodic change were established after several generations of selection, indicating that the individual variation has a genetic basis. The selected strains that were more responsive and less responsive to one photoperiodic change were found to be less responsive and more responsive to the opposite photoperiodic change, respectively, indicating a significant negative correlation between responsiveness to reciprocal photoperiodic changes. The selected strains also had a significantly different incidence of diapause-egg producers in stationary photoperiods compared to a non-selected strain, showing that selections for responsiveness to photoperiodic change were essentially the same as selections for a higher or lower incidence of diapause-egg producers. These results indicate that responsiveness to photoperiodic change is one aspect of the tendency to produce diapause or non-diapause eggs. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Protocols for more effective induction of tetraploid rainbow trout
VL  - 69
IS  - 4
SP  - 367-372
AB  - Practical use of tetraploids in culture of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss to make triploid production fish depends on (1) the effectiveness of the induction process and (2) the ability of tetraploids to reproduce and yield viable offspring. Investigations were undertaken to develop a protocol for the induction of tetraploidy to compensate for differences in time to first cleavage (i.e., first cleavage interval [FCI]). Small aliquots of eggs (similar to 500) from individual females were immediately fertilized and evaluated for FCI. The remaining eggs were stored at 4 degrees C for less than 24 h and were subjected to varying hydrostatic pressures at different initiation times and durations of treatment based on FCI. Tne most successful protocol involved treatment at 9,000 lb/ in(2)(633 kg/cm(2)) for 8 min starting at 62-65% of the FCI for two strains, while the results for the third strain were less clear and need further investigation. Observed population-level changes FCI over one generation of culture in our facilities reinforced the desirability of using protocols that varied with FCI. With the variation noted in FCI and the lack of information on its control, we recommend that treatment initiation be based on FCI analysis of a sample of eggs from each female used for tetraploidy induction. Although more research is needed to optimize the yield from this approach to triploid production, there is the potential for the selection of the best tetraploid lines to predictably generate genetically improved triploid rainbow trout for aquaculture.

VL  - 121

SP  - 431-448
AB  - The harpacticoid copepod Tisbe holothuriae HUMES was collected from Saronicos Gulf (Greece) and cultured under laboratory conditions, through several generations. Experiments of a factorial design were used to estimate the combined effects of temperature (14, 19, 24-degrees-C) and salinity (26, 32, 38, 44 parts per thousand) on the various parameters (development time, maturation time of egg sacs, interval time between egg sacs, longevity, number of offspring per egg sac, number of egg sacs per female and total offspring per female) and the demographic variables (T:Mean generation time, Ro:Net productive rate, r(m):Intrinsic rate of natural increase) of population dynamics of T. holothuriae. Response-surfaces curves were used to discern the interaction between the factors and to predict the optimum conditions for mass culture. Increase of temperature caused a decrease of Mean generation time and Net reproductive rate. The Intrinsic rate of natural increase decreased at temperatures lower or higher than 19-degrees-C. Salinities lower or higher than 38 parts per thousand led to an increase of the values of T and a decrease of the values of Ro and r(m). The linear and quadratic effects of temperature were proved to be important factors affecting most of the parameters of the population dynamics of T. holothuriae. The temperature-salinity interaction was found to be not statistically significant in all the studied parameters. At the optimum conditions (T:19-degrees-C, S:38 parts per thousand) the demographic variables were estimated as T = 11.107 days, Ro = 29.25 and r(m) = 0.304.

TI  - Consequences of mutation accumulation for growth performance are more likely to be resource-dependent at higher temperatures
VL  - 21
IS  - 1
AB  - Background Mutation accumulation (MA) has profound ecological and evolutionary consequences. One example is that accumulation of conditionally neutral mutations leads to fitness trade-offs among heterogenous habitats which cause population divergence. Here we suggest that temperature, which controls the rates of all biochemical and biophysical processes, should play a crucial role for determining mutational effects. Particularly, warmer temperatures may mitigate the effects of some, not all, deleterious mutations and cause stronger environmental dependence in MA effects. Results We experimentally tested the above hypothesis by measuring the growth performance of ten Escherichia coli genotypes on six carbon resources across ten temperatures, where the ten genotypes were derived from a single ancestral strain and accumulated spontaneous mutations. We analyzed resource dependence of MA consequences for growth yields. The MA genotypes typically showed reduced growth yields relative to the ancestral type; and the magnitude of reduction was smaller at intermediate temperatures. Stronger resource dependence in MA consequences for growth performance was observed at higher temperatures. Specifically, the MA genotypes were more likely to show impaired growth performance on all the six carbon resources when grown at lower temperatures; but suffered growth performance loss only on some, not all the six, carbon substrates at higher temperatures. Conclusions Higher temperatures increase the chance that MA causes conditionally neutral fitness effects while MA is more likely to cause fitness loss regardless of available resources at lower temperatures. This finding has implications for understanding how geographic patterns in population divergence may emerge, and how conservation practices, particularly protection of diverse microhabitats, may mitigate the impacts of global warming.

TI  - Optimization of Steam and Solvent Injection as an Improved Oil Recovery Method for Heavy Oil Reservoirs
VL  - 27
SP  - 1863-1868
AB  - Currently a resource more and more used by the petroleum industry to increase the efficiency of steam flood mechanism is the addition of solvents. The process can be understood as a combination of a thermal method (steam injection) with a miscible method (solvent injection), promoting, thus, reduction of oil viscosity and interfacial tensions between injected fluid and oil. Solvents are hydrocarbons well known for reducing these tensions and facilitating the production of heavy oil. The use of solvent alone tends to be limited because of its high cost. When co-injected with steam, the vaporized solvent condenses in the cooler regions of the reservoir and mixes with the oil, creating a zone of low viscosity between steam and heavy oil. Mobility of the displaced fluid is then improved, resulting in an increase of oil recovery. To better understand this improved oil recovery method, a numerical study of the process was done contemplating the effects of some operational parameters (distance between wells, steam injection rate, solvent type and injected solvent volume) on cumulative oil production and oil rates. A semi synthetic model was used. Some reservoir data were obtained similar to those found in Brazilian Potiguar Basin and others ones were obtained from literature. Simulations were performed in STARS (CMG, 2007.11). It was found that injected solvent volumes increased oil recovery and oil rates. Further, the majority of the injected solvent was produced and can be recycled. High initial productions achieved by models that use solvent have normally a significant impact on the operation economics, because earlier productions suggest that fluids injection (steam and solvent) can be interrupted earlier. On environmental point of view, it would have a reduction of energy and water consumptions for steam generation, having diminished Green House Gases (GHG) emissions. Also it is important to emphasize that the high oil rates presented by these models can generate an earlier financial return, and this would be decisive for the economic viability of the project.

SP  - 976-983
AB  - Temperature, precipitation, and climatic productivity expressed by Thornthwaite Memorial model in the major corn production regions in Inner Mongolia in the last 60 years were analyzed to assess the potential impacts of climate change on corn production. Temperature in Inner Mongolia from 1951 to 2010 has been increasing and abrupt changes occurred at all the six stations. Precipitation did not show significant trend, but with dramatic fluctuations. Changes in climatic productivity manifested that precipitation was the main constraint in Inner Mongolia, especially in warm and hot temperate corn production zones. In response to climate change, cool temperate zone in Inner Mongolia has the potential to serve as the stable corn production region in the future. Comparison and correlation analysis between climatic productivity and unit yield revealed that the standstill stage in maize production in Inner Mongolia may be constrained by meteorological factors, as should be a new concern about local food security in the future.

SP  - 885-897
AB  - We evaluated and compared the thermal quality for a lizard community (9 species) in Sierra del Ajusco and Pedregal de San Angel (central Mexico) along an altitudinal gradient (2 320-3 530 m) to determine whether different thermal environments may be influencing species distribution and thermoregulatory behavior. Six areas that differ in elevation and vegetation type are chosen to survey environmental operative temperatures. Habitat thermal quality is estimated from the mean deviation of operative temperatures from lizards' selected thermal range. Results indicate 3 key findings: 1) operative temperature and thermal quality are higher at lower elevations (2 320 and 2 540 m), where xeric scrub vegetation was abundant; 2) thermal quality is lowest in closed-canopy pine forest (2 870 and 3 220 m); and 3) intermediate values of operative temperature and thermal quality are observed in open grassland habitat (3 000 and 3 530 m). These results support our hypothesis that elevation and vegetation type affect thermal quality and we conclude that thermal ecology studies should be conducted at multiple spatial scales to gain a better understanding of factors influencing the thermal niche and thermoregulatory profiles.

VL  - 88
IS  - 7
AB  - Neutrophils kill invading microbes and therefore represent the first line of defense of the innate immune response. Activated neutrophils assemble NADPH oxidase to convert substantial amounts of molecular oxygen into superoxide, which, after dismutation into peroxide, serves as the substrate for the generation of the potent antimicrobial hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in the phagosomal space. In this minireview, we explore the most recent insights into physiological consequences of HOCl stress. Not surprisingly, Gram-negative bacteria have evolved diverse posttranslational defense mechanisms to protect their proteins, the main targets of HOCl, from HOCl-mediated damage. We discuss the idea that oxidation of conserved cysteine residues and partial unfolding of its structure convert the heat shock protein Hsp33 into a highly active chaperone holdase that binds unfolded proteins and prevents their aggregation. We examine two novel members of the Escherkhia coil chaperone holdase family, RidA and CnoX, whose thiol-independent activation mechanism differs from that of Hsp33 and requires N-chlorination of positively charged amino acids during HOCl exposure. Furthermore, we summarize the latest findings with respect to another bacterial defense strategy employed in response to HOCl stress, which involves the accumulation of the universally conserved biopolymer inorganic polyphosphate. We then discuss sophisticated adaptive strategies that bacteria have developed to enhance their survival during HOCl stress. Understanding bacterial defense and survival strategies against one of the most powerful neutrophilic oxidants may provide novel insights into treatment options that potentially compromise the ability of pathogens to resist HOCl stress and therefore may increase the efficacy of the innate immune response.

VL  - 84

SP  - 1357-1365
AB  - Intervention technologies for inactivating Salmonella on whole chia seeds are currently limited. Determination of the thermal inactivation kinetics of Salmonella on chia seeds and selection of an appropriate nonpathogenic surrogate will provide a foundation for selecting and optimizing thermal pasteurization processes for chia seeds. In this study, chia seed samples from three separate production lots were inoculated with a five-strain Salmonella cocktail or Enterococcus faecium NRRL-B2354 and equilibrated to a water activity of 0.53 at room temperature (25 degrees C). After equilibration for at least 3 days, the inoculated seeds were subjected to isothermal treatments at 80, 85, or 90 degrees C. Samples were removed at six time points, and surviving bacteria were enumerated. Whole chia seeds were diluted in a filter bag at 1:30 because bacterial recovery with this method was similar to that obtained from ground seeds. Survivor data were fitted to consolidated models: one primary model (log linear or Weibull) and one secondary model (Bigelow). E. faecium had higher thermal resistance than did Salmonella, suggesting that E. faecium may be a suitable conservative nonpathogenic surrogate for Salmonella. The Weibull model was a better fit for the survivor data than was the log-linear model for both bacteria based on the lower root mean square error and corrected Akaike's information criterion values. Lipid oxidation measurements and fatty acid concentrations were significantly different from those of the control samples, but the overall magnitude of the differences was relatively small. The thermal inactivation kinetics of Salmonella and E. faecium on chia seeds may be used as a basis for developing thermal pasteurization processes for chia seeds.

VL  - 83
SP  - 135-143
AB  - Nuclear fuel cycles based on thorium are gaining close attention due to its higher availability and more homogenous geographical distribution. Thorium cycles, likely to be less problematic with regard to waste generation and weapons proliferation, will extend the availability of nuclear fuel by hundreds/thousands of years. The principal Th cycle involves the transmutation of the fertile Th-232 isotope into the fissile isotope U-233 by means of neutron capture. In the present study, the coupled operation of a hybrid fission/fusion system and a standard thermal reactor is analyzed. Using the MCNP neutronic transport code, the behavior for U-233 consumption/generation in both systems as a function of Th/U feed ratio to each reactor is analyzed. The useful composition range for the feed to the thermal reactor was found to be between 1.7% and 2.25%; within these range, breeder input enrichment can be found which causes the rate of consumption and generation of U-233 to be identical. Under this condition, from the point of view of the fissile isotope, the cycle is closed, with no net generation or consumption. The cycle requires a Th-232 input to compensate the amount spent on breeding the fissile material; for the range of interest, this varies between 0 and 35% of the total mass flow in the breeder leg of the cycle.

AB  - The compelling biologic basis for combining hyperthermia with modern cancer therapies including radiation and chemotherapy was first appreciated nearly half a century ago. Hyperthermia complements radiation as conditions contributing to radio-resistance generally enhance sensitivity to heat and sensitizing effects occur through increased perfusion/tumor oxygenation and alteration of cellular death pathways. Chemosensitization with hyperthermia is dependent on the particular mechanism of effect for each agent with synergistic effects noted for several commonly used agents. Clinically, randomized trials have demonstrated benefit including survival with. the addition of hyperthermia to radiation or chemotherapy in treatment of a wide range of malignancies. Improvements in treatment delivery techniques, streamlined logistics, and greater understanding of the relationship of thermal dosimetry to treatment outcomes continue to facilitate wider clinical implementation. Evolving applications include thermal enhancement of immunotherapy, targeted drug delivery and application of principals of thermal biology towards integration of thermal ablation into multimodality oncologic care.

AB  - Climate change-induced extreme heat events are becoming a major issue in different parts of the world, especially in developing countries. The assessment of regional and temporal past and future change in heat waves is a crucial task for public health strategies and managements. The historical and future heat index (HI) time series are investigated for temporal change across Iran to study the impact of global warming on public health. The heat index is calculated, and the nonparametric trend assessment is carried out for historical time series (1981-2010). The future change in heat index is also projected for 2020-2049 and 2070-2099 periods. A rise in the historical heat index and extreme caution conditions for summer and spring seasons for major parts of Iran are notable for historical (1981-2010) series in this study. Using different climate change scenarios shows that heat index will exceed the critical threshold for human adaptability in the future in the country. The impact of climate change on heat index risk in Iran is significant in the future. To cope with this crucial situation, developing early warning systems and health care strategies to deal with population growth and remarkable socio-economic features in future is essential.

TI  - Ecological strategies and fitness tradeoffs in Escherichia coli mutants adapted to prolonged starvation
VL  - 78
IS  - 1
SP  - 43-49
AB  - Many bacteria in nature are nutritionally deprived, and there has been heightened interest during the past decade in the properties of these bacteria. We subjected five populations of Escherichia coli to prolonged starvation in a minimal salts medium, during which time the density of viable cells declined by several orders of magnitude. From each one, we isolated a surviving clone that showed some heritable difference in colony morphology. We then characterized these mutants in two ecologically relevant respects. First, we determined the nature of their selective advantage, if any, during prolonged starvation. (i) Three of the five mutants had significantly lower net death rate when progenitor and mutant clones were starved separately. (ii) Three mutants showed a significant reduction in death rate in mixed culture that was frequency dependent and manifest when the mutant clone was initially rare. This pattern suggests that these mutants fed on some byproduct of progenitor cells (living or dead). (iii) Two mutants caused the death rate of their progenitors to increase significantly relative to the rate measured in the absence of the mutant. This pattern suggests that these mutants had become allelopathic to their progenitors. Thus, three distinct ecological adaptations to prolonged starvation are evident. No advantage was detected for one mutant, whereas two mutants exhibited multiple advantages. Second, we asked whether the starvation-selected mutants were as fit in growth-supporting conditions as their progenitors. All five mutants were inferior to their progenitor during competition in fresh medium. Evidently, there is an evolutionary tradeoff between performance under growth and starvation conditions.

TI  - Increased production of hydrogen with in situ CO(2)capture through the process of water splitting using magnetic core/shell structures as novel photocatalysts
VL  - 28
IS  - 3
SP  - 3566-3578
AB  - One of the chief challenges in hydrogen production through the photocatalytic splitting of water is to employ an efficient photocatalyst that has an absorption edge at the range of long wavelengths. In this study, composite structures made of different Ag-based shells over the core of Fe(2)O(3)nanoparticles were utilized as novel magnetic photocatalysts for hydrogen generation from water. Specifically, Ag nanoparticles, Ag/(3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTS), and Ag/polyethyleneimine (PEI) were capped on the surface of the hematite core to produce three visible light-effective photocatalysts. Structural and textural properties of the synthesized photocatalysts were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Additionally, their thermal stability and optical properties were respectively studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and UV reflectance. Photocatalytic activities of the presented core/shells were planned either as a function of the magnetic force or composition of the shell layer. It could be noted that the incorporation of organic or polymer layer could significantly increase the electronic density at the metal centers. Thus, the ability of iron oxide to catalyze the water-splitting process could be enhanced. Hence, the variation of shell structure could show a key-role in the photocatalytic potential of the presented structures in terms of manipulating the composition of produced gases. On the other hand, the magnetic nature of hematite could also positively affect the photocatalytic activity of these structures by minimizing the scattering of light irradiation during the splitting process. Particularly, shifting the way of photocatalysts dispersion from magnetic to mechanical (during water splitting) had in turn reduced hydrogen productivity from 540 to 485 mmol h(-1) g(-1). This obviously confirms the relationship between the level of hydrogen production by the presented photocatalysts and their magnetic nature which results in quenching of irradiation scattering.

TI  - EFFECTS OF HEAT SHOCK ON OVARY DEVELOPMENT AND HSP83 EXPRESSION IN Tribolium castaneum (COLEOPTERA: TENEBRIONIDAE)
VL  - 70

SP  - 204-216
AB  - Heat. shock affects reproductive performance in insects including Tribolium. castaneum. In. this study, the effects of heat shock on ovary development and hsp83 expression in T castaneum. Were investigated. Two lines of T castaneum, H line and C line, from, the same base population were established and maintained for five successive generations. In each generation, the newly hatched beetles (within 3 h after eclosion) in the H line were treated with a heat shock at 40 degrees C for I h, and those in the C line Were raised at normal temperature (30 degrees C) as control treatment. Four trails related to ovary development. were measured for the beetles of the fifth generation: days from eclosion to laying the first eggs (T-o), days from, eclosion to laying, the first hatchable eggs (T-h), ovariole size on the third day after eclosion, and pupal mass of their offspring. The results showed that the beetles of the H line had a significantly longer pre-oviposition period (0.6 more days) and smaller ovariole size than those of the C line. No significant difference in pupal mass was observed. Applying heal shock to the offspring of the fifth generation of both lines led to significantly higher hsp83 expression in offspring of the C line than in offspring of the H line. Within each line, the hsp83 expression. level in offspring with heat shock was significantly higher than that of offspring without heat shock, but, the difference in the C line was much larger than that in the H line. We infer from these results that a tradeoff between heat resistance, registered as hsp83 expression, and ovarian development operates under heal, stress in T. castaneum.

TI  - Techno-Economic Assessment of a Grid-Independent Hybrid Power Plant for Co-Supplying a Remote Micro-Community with Electricity and Hydrogen
VL  - 9
IS  - 8
AB  - This study investigates the techno-economic feasibility of an off-grid integrated solar/wind/hydrokinetic plant to co-generate electricity and hydrogen for a remote micro-community. In addition to the techno-economic viability assessment of the proposed system via HOMER (hybrid optimization of multiple energy resources), a sensitivity analysis is conducted to ascertain the impact of +/- 10% fluctuations in wind speed, solar radiation, temperature, and water velocity on annual electric production, unmet electricity load, LCOE (levelized cost of electricity), and NPC (net present cost). For this, a far-off village with 15 households is selected as the case study. The results reveal that the NPC, LCOE, and LCOH (levelized cost of hydrogen) of the system are equal to $333,074, 0.1155 $/kWh, and 4.59 $/kg, respectively. Technical analysis indicates that the PV system with the rated capacity of 40 kW accounts for 43.7% of total electricity generation. This portion for the wind turbine and the hydrokinetic turbine with nominal capacities of 10 kW and 20 kW equates to 23.6% and 32.6%, respectively. Finally, the results of sensitivity assessment show that among the four variables only a +10% fluctuation in water velocity causes a 20% decline in NPC and LCOE.

VL  - 117
IS  - 48
SP  - 25778-25785
AB  - Multifunctional nanodevices integrated with excellent optoelectric and thermoelectric properties are highly demanded for developing next generation self-powered optoelectronics. In the work, we demonstrate the viability of a coupled structure of homologous In2O3(ZnO)(m) with In-doped ZnO into heterojunction belts synthesized by alloy-evaporation deposition, offering multiple functions with strong confined optical emissions and high power factors. Energy-filter secondary electron images reveal a five-layer contrast in the width direction of the belts due to different ionization energies corresponding to In2O3(ZnO)(m)/In:ZnO/ZnO/In:ZnO/In2O3(ZnO)(m) as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy analysis. The indium-doped ZnO channels confined in two sides behave like quantum wells through band alignment, and become predominant in the main UV emission at 385 nm, as revealed by cathodoluminescence spectroscopic imaging. More intriguingly, this novel heterostructure provides an ideal pathway to enhance electron conduction through the indium doped ZnO layer, and the homologous In2O3(ZnO)(m) layer contains numerous interfaces to impede phonon transportation. In this way, the power factor of the heterostructure is greatly enhanced to be 2.07 x 10(-4) W m(-1) K-2 at room temperature, as compared to about 1.03 x 10(-5) W m(-1) K-2 for the undoped ZnO nanowires. This unique heterostructure achieved by a facile one-step growth process offers a new concept for designing devices by manipulating photons via coupling with electrons and phonons.

TI  - PERFORMANCE MONITORING OF GAS TURBINE COMPONENTS: A REAL CASE STUDY USING A MICRO GAS TURBINE TEST RIG
SP  - 11-20
AB  - Estimating the performance of all the components of a recuperated micro gas turbine cycle plays a determinant role in improving their reliability for distributed power generation and cogeneration. The monitoring and diagnostic activity consists in continuously evaluating the productivity capacity and the efficiency of the plant, using the stream of data coming from the plant's instrumentation. In this framework a diagnostic tool for the micro gas turbine installed at the TPG test rig (located in Savona, Italy) was developed, with the objective of monitoring the operating parameters of the turbomachine, the performance of the heat exchanger and, in general, the good operation of the plant. Even though the commercial machine is equipped with the essential probes for control (rotational speed, TOT, intake temperature and eating water temperature meters) and diagnostic purposes (vibration sensor, filter differential pressure and other thermocouples), further instruments were introduced in the test rig to measure a larger number of properties and points. As result of this, a wide number of measurements is available and can be effectively used for the development of a diagnostic model. The diagnostic model presented in this paper is written in Matlab-Simulink (R) environment and, in its first version, provides information about compressor and turbine efficiency and heat exchanger effectiveness. The model was developed starting from the turbomachinery maps and the heat exchanger design performance. A validation of the code was performed using the measurements coming directly from the data acquisition system. Preliminary results coming from the model are presented, showing the different performance of each component of the plant in the various operating conditions.

VL  - 76

SP  - 511-520
AB  - The sex-determining mechanism has important demographic and genetic consequences by virtue of its effect on the population sex ratio. Here we investigate the effect of temperature dependent sex determination (TSD) on the primary sex ratio of the harpacticoid copepod, Tigriopus californicus. At the two experimental temperatures (15degrees and 22degreesC) used in this study, the primary sex ratio is almost always biased in favour of males. Higher temperatures induce masculinization and the change in sex ratio is not caused by differential mortality of the sexes. The mean level of TSD in the population is small (proportion of males increases by similar to5% between 15degrees and 22degreesC) because only one-third of the families actually exhibit a significant sex-ratio response while the rest of the population is insensitive to temperature. A comparison of the primary sex ratio and the level of TSD between two locations reveals few differences among populations. Finally, individuals still exhibited TSD after having been maintained under constant temperature conditions in the lab for several generations. In addition the proportion of temperature-sensitive individuals remained unchanged. This suggests that the observed level of TSD is not an artefact of testing field-captured individuals in a novel laboratory environment. At this point the adaptive significance of temperature-dependent sex determination in T californicus remains unknown.

TI  - Zero peak housing: Exploring the possibility of eliminating electrical draws from houses during periods of high demand on the electrical grid
VL  - 58
SP  - 103-113
AB  - Residential buildings constitute one of the largest demands for electricity. Although the contribution of air-conditioning to total energy use is quite small in many climates, this end-use can place a disproportionate demand upon the central electrical generation, transmission, and distribution system, particularly in the late afternoon of hot summer days. Even in some heating dominated climates, these can be the times of system-wide peak demand, and it is common for electrical systems (such as in Ontario. Canada) to meet marginal demands during these peak periods using generators fired by GHG-intensive fuels (coal and natural gas). The viability of achieving a zero peak house (ZPH)-a house that draws no electricity from the grid during system-wide peak periods-has been assessed via detailed building performance simulations using a case study house based upon a tract-built design in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was found that 41%-51% of the goal of eliminating electricity consumption during the summer Ontario on-peak period (11h00 to 17h00 during weekdays from May 1 through October 31) could be achieved through a combination of architectural, control, efficiency, and occupant behaviour measures. It was also found that the remaining demand for electricity could be completely eliminated using realistically sized photovoltaic and battery systems for on-site generation and storage of electricity.

TI  - Deep Water Cycling and the Multi-Stage Cooling of the Earth
VL  - 21
IS  - 10
AB  - Paleo-temperature data indicates that the Earth's mantle has not cooled at a constant rate. The data show slow cooling from 3.8 to 2.5 Ga followed by more rapid cooling until the present. This has been argued to indicate a transition from a single plate mode to a plate tectonics. However, a tectonic change may not be necessary. Multistage cooling can result from deep water cycling coupled to mantle convection. Melting and volcanism removes water from the mantle (degassing). Dehydration tends to stiffen the mantle, which slows convective vigor and plate velocities causing mantle heating. Higher mantle temperature tends to lower mantle viscosity and increase plate velocities. If these two tendencies are in balance, then mantle cooling can be weak. Breaking this balance, via a switch to net mantle rehydration, can cool the mantle more rapidly. We use coupled water cycling and mantle convection models to test the viability of this hypothesis. Within model and data uncertainty, the hypothesis that deep water cycling can lead to a multi-stage Earth cooling is consistent with data constraints. Probability distributions, for successful models, indicate that plate and plate margin strength play a minor role for resisting plate motions relative to the resistance from interior mantle viscosity.

TI  - Correlated synthetic time series generation for energy system simulations using Fourier and ARMA signal processing
VL  - 44
IS  - 10
SP  - 8144-8155
AB  - As the contribution of renewable energy grows in electricity markets, the complexity of the energy mix required to meet demand grows, likewise the need for robust simulation techniques. While decades of wind, solar, and demand profiles can sometimes be obtained, this is too few samples to provide a statistically meaningful analysis of a system with baseload, peaker, and renewable generation. To demonstrate the viability of an energy mix, many thousands of samples are needed. Synthetic time series generation presents itself as a suitable methodology to meet this need. For a synthetic time series to be statistically viable, several conditions must be met. The series generator must produce independent, identically distributed samples, each having the same fundamental properties as the original signal without duplicating it exactly. One approach for such a generator is training a surrogate model using Fourier series decomposition for seasonal patterns and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models to describe time-correlated statistical noise about the seasonal patterns. When combined, the Fourier plus ARMA (FARMA) model has been shown to provide an infinite set of independent, identically distributed sample time series with the same statistical properties as the original data [1]. When considering an energy mix with renewable electricity production, several time series of energy, grid, and weather measurements are needed for each synthetic year modeled to statistically comprehend the efficiency of any given energy mix. This includes measurements of solar exposure, air temperature, wind velocity, and electricity demand. These cannot be considered independent series in a given synthetic year; for example, in summer months demand may be higher when solar exposure and air temperature are high and wind velocity is low. To capture and reproduce the correlations that might exist in the measured histories, the ARMA can further be extended as a Vector ARMA (VARMA). In the VARMA algorithm, covariance in statistical noise is captured both within a history as part of the autoregressive moving average and with respect to the other variables in the time series. In this work, the implementation of the Fourier VARMA in the RAVEN uncertainty quantification and risk analysis software framework [2] is presented, along with examples of correlated synthetic history generation. Finally, methods to extend synthetic signals to multiyear samples are presented and discussed.

TI  - End-of-life treatment of crystalline silicon photovoltaic panels. An emergy-based case study
VL  - 161
SP  - 1129-1142
AB  - Although photovoltaic (PV) technology has been projected as one of the most promising candidates to replace conventional fossil based power generation, claims about the potential disadvantages of the PV panels end-of-life (EoL) deserve careful attention in order to fully establish a feasibility and viability baseline and support technological and implementation policies. The current challenge concerning PV technology resides in making them efficient and competitive in comparison with traditional power generation systems, without disregarding the appraisal of EoL impacts. The emergy analysis method proved to be a reliable approach for the evaluation of the efficiency, effectiveness and environmental friendliness of technological processes under a global scale perspective and may likely be applied to the EoL PV investigation as a complement of conventional energy and economic assessments. Therefore, this method was used in this study to evaluate the sustainability of a PV panel recycling process. In addition, this paper aims to explore the implications of methodological assumptions when Emergy Accounting (EMA) tackles waste management systems, in order to address the shortcomings in this field. Results show that the PV panel treatment can generate large environmental benefits not only at the local scale of the process, but also at the larger scale of the industrial manufacture and material recovery, as well as at the even larger scale of the biosphere where resources come from and pollution is released. The comparison between the emergy invested for electricity production via PV and fossil energy sources also including EoL resource and environmental costs, highlights that PV technology is competitive under both energy and environmental points of view. This comparison reveals that the solar technologies imply remarkable emergy savings (1.45E+12 sej/kWh for fossil sources versus 3.57E+11 sej/kWh for crystalline silicon photovoltaic down to 2.31E+11 sej/kWh for cadmium telluride photovoltaic). Results clearly show that PV solar power can be considered a mature technology and can favorably compete with other renewable and non-renewable options for electricity generation. However, efficiency improvements of PV panels thermal recovery are still possible and may lead to further decrease of still too large emergy costs of the treatment process, not to talk of potential recovery alternatives such as chemical treatment for silicon cells and better upstream industrial design.

SP  - 292-305
AB  - Extreme cold marine and freshwater temperatures (below 4 degrees C) induce massive deterioration to the cell membranes of organisms resulting in the formation of ice crystals, consequently causing organelle damage or cell death. One of the adaptive mechanisms organisms have evolved to thrive in cold environments is the production of antifreeze proteins with the functional capabilities to withstand frigid temperatures. Antifreeze proteins are extensively identified in different cold-tolerant species and they facilitate the persistence of cold-adapted organisms by decreasing the freezing point of their body fluids. Various structurally diverse types of antifreeze proteins detected possess the ability to modify ice crystal growth by thermal hysteresis and ice recrystallization inhibition. The unique properties of antifreeze proteins have made them a promising resource in industry, biomedicine, food storage and cryobiology. This review collates the findings of the various studies carried out in the past and the recent developments observed in the properties, functional mechanisms, classification, distinct sources and the ever-increasing applications of antifreeze proteins. This review also summarizes the possibilities of the way forward to identify new avenues of research on anti-freeze proteins.

TI  - Optimal artificial neural networks and tabulation methods for chemistry representation in LES of a bluff-body swirl-stabilized flame
VL  - 32
SP  - 1527-1535
AB  - Large-eddy simulations (LES) of the Sydney bluff-body swirl-stabilized methane-hydrogen flame are performed, employing two chemistry representation methods, namely a conventional structured tabulation technique and artificial neural networks (ANNs). A generalized method for the generation of optimal artificial networks (OANNs) has been proposed by Ihme et al. [M. Ihme, A.L. Marsden, H. Pitsch, Neural Comput. 20 (2) (2008) 573-601]. This method is, for the first time, applied in LES of turbulent reactive flows, guaranteeing an optimal chemistry representation with error control, which was previously not possible. The network performance with respect to accuracy, data retrieval time, and storage requirements is compared with the structured tabulation of increasing resolution, and effects or long-time error accumulation on the statistical results during a numerical simulation are discussed. Using the optimization algorithm, it is demonstrated that ANN accuracies can be achieved which are comparable with structured tables of moderate to fine resolution. Furthermore, it is shown that for a comparable number of synaptic weights, the network fitness increases with increasing number of hidden layers. Compared to the tabulation technique, data retrieval from the network is computationally more expensive; however, the additional overhead associated with the ANN evaluation remains acceptable in LES applications. Results for flow field statistics and scalar quantities which are obtained from LES are in good agreement with experimental data, and possible reasons for the differences between computed and measured temperature profiles near the bluff-body are discussed. The difference in the velocity statistics between simulations employing structured table and network representation are small, and deviations in the CO, profiles on the fuel-rich side of the flame are mainly attributed to the sensitivity of CO2 with respect to changes in progress variable.

TI  - The Impact of Tobacco Cigarettes, Vaping Products and Tobacco Heating Products on Oxidative Stress
VL  - 11
IS  - 9
AB  - Cells constantly produce oxidizing species because of their metabolic activity, which is counteracted by the continuous production of antioxidant species to maintain the homeostasis of the redox balance. A deviation from the metabolic steady state leads to a condition of oxidative stress. The source of oxidative species can be endogenous or exogenous. A major exogenous source of these species is tobacco smoking. Oxidative damage can be induced in cells by chemical species contained in smoke through the generation of pro-inflammatory compounds and the modulation of intracellular pro-inflammatory pathways, resulting in a pathological condition. Cessation of smoking reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with cigarette use. Next-generation products (NGPs), as alternatives to combustible cigarettes, such as electronic cigarettes (e-cig) and tobacco heating products (THPs), have been proposed as a harm reduction strategy to reduce the deleterious impacts of cigarette smoking. In this review, we examine the impact of tobacco smoke and MRPs on oxidative stress in different pathologies, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and tumors. The impact of tobacco cigarette smoke on oxidative stress signaling in human health is well established, whereas the safety profile of MRPs seems to be higher than tobacco cigarettes, but further, well-conceived, studies are needed to better understand the oxidative effects of these products with long-term exposure.

TI  - The delivery of injury prevention exercise programmes in professional youth soccer: Comparison to the FIFA 11+
VL  - 20
IS  - 1
SP  - 26-31
AB  - Objectives: Injury prevention exercise programmes for amateur soccer have gained considerable attention, but little is known about their relevance and adaptability to professional soccer settings. The first aim of this study was to evaluate the delivery and content of injury prevention exercise programmes used by professional youth soccer teams, compared to the industry standard injury prevention exercise programme for soccer, the Federation Internationale de Football Association's FIFA 11+. The second aim was to document specific challenges to implementing injury prevention exercise programmes in this context. Design: Prospective observational study. Methods: The participants were soccer coaches, fitness coaches and physiotherapists (n=18) from four teams in a professional youth soccer academy. Each team's chosen injury prevention exercise programmes were observed weekly across an entire soccer season (160 sessions). The delivery and content of the programmes were documented on a standardised worksheet and compared to the FIFA 11+. Specific implementation challenges were recorded. Results: Fitness coaches were the primary deliverers of injury prevention exercise programmes, with support from physiotherapists. Multiple delivery formats and locations were employed, along with the extensive use of equipment. Across all injury prevention exercise programme sessions, a median of one FIFA 11+ exercise was performed in its original form and a further four in a modified form. Implementation challenges included poor staff communication, competing training priorities and heavy game schedules. Conclusions: Although the basic components of the FIFA 11+ hold relevance for professional youth male teams, the delivery and content of injury prevention exercise programmes require considerable tailoring for this context. Recognising this will inform the development of improved, context-specific injury prevention exercise programmes, along with corresponding strategies to enhance their implementation.

TI  - TECHNO-ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY STUDY OF INSTALLING SOLAR PV SYSTEMS ON GAS STATIONS' ROOFTOPS IN KUWAIT
AB  - Considering the fact that Kuwait receives annual global irradiation of about 2088 kWh/m(2), the potential for utilizing solar energy for electric power generation cannot be overlooked. Micro-grid connected PV plants are one important option for the energy mix that can be pursued to meet part of the future demand for energy. To assess the viability of such option, we investigated the technical and the economic feasibility of installing PV solar panels on local gas stations' rooftops. Gas stations were targeted because of their unobstructed flat rooftops and being mostly far away from high-rise buildings and other shade-causing objects. The daily and monthly energy consumption data of one typical gas station were used in this study. PVsyst software was used to determine the optimal technical parameters of the system. The available rooftop area of the gas station, fitted with the selected PV models and the inverters resulted in an installed capacity of 77.3 kWp. The system was able to generate 121.3 MWh/year which covers about 72 % of the annual energy consumption of the gas station. Factors affecting the system output such as near shading, soiling, and temperature effects were considered. The economic analysis of the system estimated the cost of kWh to be around $0.088. The overall cost of the system incurred during its lifetime (25 years), including inverters replacement cost, maintenance cost, and financial cost, was about $269,200.

TI  - Spodoptera spp. monitoring in sugarcane: use of sex pheromone traps
VL  - 31
IS  - 2
SP  - 445-459
AB  - Introduction. The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda, is one of the world's most devastating pests. Although originally from the Americas, this insect has become a global food security threat. The reason is that its polyphagia and adaptability combine with the effects of climate change. In Costa Rica, the species of the Spodoptera order, are considered minor pests in sugarcane production. Nevertheless, there is a knowledge gap in population dynamics of the moths of this genus. Objective. Monitor the populations of S. frugiperda, S. sunia, and S. exigua species in a sugarcane field. Materials and methods. The study was conducted in a sugarcane plantation of the variety CC 01-1940, located in Guanacaste, Costa Rica between February 2018 and May 2019. Sexual pheromone-baited traps formulated for S. frugiperda, S. sunia, and S. exigua were used, each pheromone corresponded to a treatment and ten replicates of each one were established. The abundance of each species was compared and correlated with several climatological variables. Results. The highest percentage of catches corresponded to S. frugiperda, followed by S. sunia, while the captures of S. exigua were marginal. For both S. frugiperda and S. sunia, the dry season months favored larger populations, so factors such as higher average temperature, thermal amplitude, and lower relative humidity were associated with higher captures in the traps. Conclusions. Increases in the average temperature and decrease in rainfall periods could increase the incidence of Spodoptera genus as pests in sugarcane production.

VL  - 31
IS  - 4
SP  - 850-856
AB  - We investigated the effects of family selection on the growth rates of four genetic lines of Litopenaeus vannamei, the Pacific white shrimp, from Venezuela. The mean family weight at selection was 16.79 g and the mean growth rate was 0.169 g d(-1) at a mean age of 138 days. The mean growth rates per generation were 0.141 g d(-1) for the parental generation (P-0), 0.173 g d-1 for the F-1 and 0.191 g d(-1) for the F-2. Survival varied from 83.3% to 94.4%. There were statistically significant differences between lines, with lines B and C, growing at higher temperatures and lower salinities, showing the fastest growth. Regression analysis between growth rate and age for each genetic line showed high r(2) values, but smaller than those shown between growth rate and generation. The mean heritability (h(2)) estimated for growth rate was 0.25 +/- 0.04, with line per generation values ranging from 0.18 to 0.38. The mean heritability for growth rate per line showed some variation but there was no correlation between heritability and growth rate. Females showed a greater gain in growth rate per generation than males due to their faster growth when they were older. This study shows the high potential of these L. vannamei populations for the future of shrimp culture in the Americas.

VL  - 49
IS  - 1
SP  - 70-77
AB  - The cryopreservation of noctuid eggs in liquid nitrogen has proved be a promising tool in the mass production of Trichogramma, however studies into this technique have only just begun. This study evaluated the response of different densities of the female of Trichogramma pretiosum Riley to the parasitism of Mythimna sequax eggs stored and not stored in liquid nitrogen, and the performance of females reared only in cryopreserved eggs. The study evaluated the influence of the number of T. pretiosum females (4, 8 and 12) released to parasitise 40 M. sequax eggs, stored and not stored for 15 days in liquid nitrogen, as well as the performance of T. pretiosum females reared in eggs stored for three generations and females reared in non-stored eggs. Parasitism by T. pretiosum in stored eggs was 84%, twice the value obtained in previous studies. The emergence of parasitoids was greater than 95% in both experiments. The performance of females raised in stored eggs did not differ from that of females raised in non-stored eggs. The data show that the technique of cryopreservation of M. sequax eggs may be a viable alternative in the mass production of T. pretiosum.

VL  - 97

SP  - 1353-1364
AB  - The phenology of oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busek), on apple (Malus spp.) in North Carolina was studied using pheromone traps and egg sampling in abandoned and commercial orchards in 2000 and 2001, with subsequent development of an oviposition degree-day model and management studies in relation to codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), phenology. Oriental fruit moth eggs were found in greater numbers on leaves early and on fruit later in the growing season, on the top versus the bottom of the leaf surface, and on the calyx area versus the side or stem end of the fruit. A degree-day (DD) model to predict oriental fruit moth oviposition was developed based on temperature accumulations from peak moth trap capture of the first (overwintering) generation, by using 7.2 and 32.2degreesC as the temperature limits. The model predicted four ovipositing generations 4 oriental fruit moth with the second beginning 507 DD after peak moth catch. Using predictions of the oriental fruit moth and codling moth degree-day oviposition models, an experiment was conducted to determine the level of second generation oriental fruit moth control with methoxyfenozide applied under different scenarios for first generation codling moth. Methoxyfenozide was equally effective in managing codling moth and oriental fruit moth for all treatment timings.

TI  - Alteration of DNA supercoiling serves as a trigger of short-term cold shock repressed genes of E. coli
VL  - 50
IS  - 15
SP  - 8512-8528
AB  - Cold shock adaptability is a key survival skill of gut bacteria of warm-blooded animals. Escherichia coli cold shock responses are controlled by a complex multi-gene, timely-ordered transcriptional program. We investigated its underlying mechanisms. Having identified short-term, cold shock repressed genes, we show that their responsiveness is unrelated to their transcription factors or global regulators, while their single-cell protein numbers' variability increases after cold shock. We hypothesized that some cold shock repressed genes could be triggered by high propensity for transcription locking due to changes in DNA supercoiling (likely due to DNA relaxation caused by an overall reduction in negative supercoiling). Concomitantly, we found that nearly half of cold shock repressed genes are also highly responsive to gyrase inhibition (albeit most genes responsive to gyrase inhibition are not cold shock responsive). Further, their response strengths to cold shock and gyrase inhibition correlate. Meanwhile, under cold shock, nucleoid density increases, and gyrases and nucleoid become more colocalized. Moreover, the cellular energy decreases, which may hinder positive supercoils resolution. Overall, we conclude that sensitivity to diminished negative supercoiling is a core feature of E. coli's short-term, cold shock transcriptional program, and could be used to regulate the temperature sensitivity of synthetic circuits.

TI  - Preliminary core characterization of a Generation IV lead fast reactor DEMO: Goals, design rationales and options
VL  - 51
IS  - 9
SP  - 1806-1812
AB  - An Italian effort has been initiated under a cooperation between ENEA and CIRTEN for the investigation of a concept for a small size Generation IV Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) demonstration project (DEMO) which could provide significant support to the European Lead-cooled System (ELSY), by validating lead technology and the overall system behaviour. A demonstration reactor is expected to prove the viability of technology for use in a future commercial power plant, construction and operation, with the purpose of assessing the general strategy to use, to the largest extent. Thus, the first step towards the DEMO conceptual design has been the specification of the issues of ELSY - assumed as reference LFR - to investigate/validate, the objectives to reach, tools and methodology. As a result, a set of general requirements that must be met have been first identified and further scope analyses have been carried out in order to determine suitable core configurations. Finally, static neutronics analyses have been performed using the ERANOS2.1 deterministic code in conjunction with the JEFF3.1 nuclear data library to accomplish a preliminary core characterization; the mutual compatibility of both objectives and technological constraints has been confirmed a posteriori by thermal-hydraulic estimations. Results have shown that a 250 MWth lead-cooled MOX-fueled DEMO may be a viable concept: in the case of 480 degrees C reference coolant outlet temperature, 2 m s(-1) average coolant velocity and 42 cm active core extension, high neutron flux values (around 2.5 times the ELSY ones) have been obtained (peak flux: 6.3 x 10(15) cm(-2) s(-1) with corresponding fast fraction of approximately 15.8%, i.e., some 1 x 10(15) cm(-2) s(-1)) thanks to the significant power densities reached.

TI  - Next generation HOM-damping
VL  - 30
IS  - 6
AB  - Research and development for superconducting radio-frequency cavities has made enormous progress over the last decades from the understanding of theoretical limitations to the industrial mass fabrication of cavities for large-scale particle accelerators. Key technologies remain hot topics due to continuously growing demands on cavity performance, particularly when in pursuit of high quality beams at higher beam currents or higher luminosities than currently achievable. This relates to higher order mode (HOM) damping requirements. Meeting the desired beam properties implies avoiding coupled multi-bunch or beam break-up instabilities depending on the machine and beam parameters that will set the acceptable cavity impedance thresholds. The use of cavity HOM-dampers is crucial to absorb the wakefields, comprised by all beam-induced cavity Eigenmodes, to beam-dynamically safe levels and to reduce the heat load at cryogenic temperature. Cavity damping concepts may vary, but are principally based on coaxial and waveguide couplers as well as beam line absorbers or any combination. Next generation energy recovery linacs and circular colliders call for cavities with strong HOM-damping that can exceed the state-of-the-art, while the operating mode efficiency shall not be significantly compromised concurrently. This imposes major challenges given the rather limited damping concepts. A detailed survey of established cavities is provided scrutinizing the achieved damping performance, shortcomings, and potential improvements. The scaling of the highest passband mode impedances is numerically evaluated in dependence on the number of cells for a single-cell up to a nine-cell cavity, which reveals the increased probability of trapped modes. This is followed by simulations for single-cell and five-cell cavities, which incorporate multiple damping schemes to assess the most efficient concepts. The usage and viability of on-cell dampers is elucidated for the single-cell cavity since it can push the envelope towards quasi HOM-free operation suited for next generation storage and collider rings. Geometrical end-cell shape alterations for the five-cell cavity with already efficient mode damping are discussed as a possibility to further lower specific high impedance modes. The findings are eventually put into relation with demanding impedance instability thresholds in future collider rings.

TI  - Assessment of biogas production in Argentina from co-digestion of sludge and municipal solid waste
VL  - 61
SP  - 195-205
AB  - In Argentina, there is an important potential to utilize organic waste to generate bioenergy. This work analyzes the environmental impacts and the energetic and economic requirements of the biogas produced by digesting the sewage sludge (SS) produced in a wastewater treatment plant in a medium city in Argentina. The SS is co-digested with the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), and the basis of this study is the life cycle assessment (LCA). The LCA is performed according to ISO 14040-44 using the SimaPro simulator. First, the transport of the raw materials to the biogas plant was defined. Then, the co-digestion and the biogas treatment for final use were evaluated. The co-digestion was improved with glycerol, and the generation of biogas was estimated using the GPS-X software. Two alternatives for the end use of biogas were considered: combined heat and power (CHP) and biomethane generation. For the first, H2S and water vapor were removed from the raw biogas stream, and for the second, also CO2 was removed. The H2S removal process was simulated in the SuperPro software by anaerobic biofiltration. The same software was used to simulate the removal of CO2 absorption-desorption with water as solvent. Finally, the environmental impacts related to the end use of biogas (CHP and biomethane) were evaluated. The environmental, energetic and economic analyses showed that the co-digestion of SS and OFMSW has great potential for reducing the environmental impacts and increasing the economic and energetic value of the substances via the production of biomethane, electricity and, potentially, fertilizer.

TI  - Practical Performance and Enabling Technologies in Immersion Scanners for the Double Patterning Generation
VL  - 7973
AB  - At SPIE2010, excellent performance of the cutting edge immersion lithography scanner, the NSR-S620D, which is based on the new "Streamlign" platform was demonstrated. Last year's work focused mainly on machine evaluation data([1]). Now, many S620Ds are employed at customers' sites and being used in device manufacturing. In this paper, the authors will introduce the latest factory data, as well as various techniques that enable superior yield and enhance productivity in IC manufacturing. It is well understood, that in order to achieve further device shrinks without using traditional techniques such as NA expansion or wavelength reduction, several practical issues must be overcome. Extremely tight overlay performance will be required for pitch splitting double patterning, for example. In addition, it is also necessary to control the image plane and the aberration of the optics much more carefully. Of course these improvements must also be achieved with sufficient productivity (throughput). In order to satisfy all of the requirements for mass production at customer factories, many variable factors must be dealt with. One of these variable factors is the characteristics of the processed wafers that include on-flatness, grid distortion, steep topology around the edge, or topography of the previous layers' patterns. These factors typically impact overlay and/or auto focus accuracy. Another variable is the difference in exposure conditions between layers, which include illumination conditions, dose, reticle transmittance, and the alignment marks. Exposure induced heating in particular is the key issue for today's enhanced throughput capabilities, with regards to achieving both optimal accuracy and productivity. In some IC production facilities, and often foundries, many different kinds of products are manufactured in parallel. However, in order to enhance performance and accuracy, it is sometimes necessary to optimize machine parameters for each product. Cleary this requires quick tuning capabilities to minimize overhead affects for each product. As discussed earlier, various techniques must be utilized to minimize the gap between machine inspection data and manufacturing performance at customer sites. This paper discusses such technologies and provides the supporting data.

AB  - The main objective of the present work was to establish and maintain a colony of Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus, Riohacha strain, under laboratory conditions and to study its life cycle. The colony's insectary was established from adult male and female mosquitoes collected from peripheral neighborhoods of Riohacha, Colombia. Environmental conditions established in the insectary were 26.5 degrees C average temperature, 80% average relative humidity, and 12 h photoperiodicity. Eight continuous generations were taken into account for maintaining the mosquitoes and analyzing their life cycle. The male mosquito's average life cycle was 26.8 days. The female's cycle was 30.8 days. Analysis of each of the biological stages of development (mean days) produced the following results: egg incubation 4.55 +/- 0.291, larvae 8.28 +/- 0.499, pupae 1.32 +/- 0.215, adult male 12.65 +/- 5.920, and adult female 16.73 +/- 6.034. The Riohacha colony has been maintained for 32 generations in 31 months. Comparison of the Riohacha colony with the previously established Cartagena and Barranquilla colonies showed few differences in the duration of stages of the life cycle between strains.

VL  - 65
IS  - 21
SP  - 4359-4365
AB  - Escherichia coli 0151:H7 is a foodborne pathogen. This bacterial strain can generate Shiga-like toxins (SLTs), which can cause serious sickness and even death. Thus, it is important to develop effective and sensitive methods that can be used to rapidly identify the presence of SLTs from complex samples. Pigeon egg white (PEW) contains abundant glycoproteins, including pigeon ovalbumin (POA) (similar to 60%). POA possesses Gal-alpha(1 -> 4)-Gal-beta(1 -> 4)-GlcNAc termini,. which can recognize the B subunits in SLT type 1 (SLT-1B). Thus, POA is a suitable probe for trapping SLT-1B. In this work, we used PEW proteins as starting materials to react with aqueous tetrachloroauric acid for generation of PEW-protein-immobilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs@PEW) via one-pot reactions. We demonstrated that the generated AuNPs@PEW were mainly dominated by POA-immobilized Au NPs. The as-prepared AuNPs@PEW were used as affinity probes to selectively probe SLT-1B from complex cell lysates derived from E. coli 0157:H7. The selective trapping step can be completed within similar to 90 s under microwave heating (power = 450 W) to enrich sufficient SLT-1B for Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometric analysis. Furthermore; this approach:can be used to detect SLT-1B at a concentration as low as similar to 40 pM.

VL  - 23

AB  - Any modification of the environment that leads to a physiological, genetic, or epigenetic adaptive response in microorganisms may be considered as a stress. Historically, forms of stresses affecting biological structures were classified either as non-thermal, such as osmotic, oxidative, or acid stress or as thermal stress, hot or cold. Currently, the classification in biology is as abiotic, including physical and chemical stress, or biotic. The aim of this mini-review is to show, through the example of microorganisms, that the response to stress can be considered, in biology, as a global phenomenon, which can be extended to anthropogenic pressure.

TI  - Quantitative assessment and driving force analysis of vegetation drought risk to climate change:Methodology and application in Northeast China
VL  - 282
AB  - Given the significant increasing trend of droughts in Northeast China (NEC) under climate change, it is of particularly urgency to quantify the drought risk to vegetation in different ecosystems. Based on the theory of risk formation, we developed a quantitative framework for the assessment of ecosystem drought risk that integrates both drought hazard and vulnerability (sensitivity and adaptability). To quantitatively assess the drought risk to different vegetation types in NEC, we used long-term (1982-2015) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) data. The effects of climate change and non-climatic factors (mainly human activities) on the NDVI dynamics and drought risk were analyzed using the partial least squares regression method to explore key drivers of risk formation. Our findings indicate that almost 45.4% of ecosystem vegetation in NEC is at a moderate or high risk of drought. Our findings indicate that vulnerability is key to NEC drought risk assessment, and adaptability plays an important role in regulating sensitivity. Land cover is the main driving factor for the spatial pattern of drought vulnerability in NEC, and forests have the lowest vulnerability. The impact of climate change on vegetation dynamics in dry years (R-dry(2) = 0.35) is significantly higher than over the entire study period (R-all(2) = 0.20). Cropland drought risk is dominated by human activities, whilst woodland and grassland drought risk is controlled by temperature and precipitation variability, respectively. The driving force analysis of vegetation dynamics and drought risk improves our understanding of the mechanisms behind the formation of risk patterns in NEC. Our study provides a basis for land use management and the formulation of drought adaptation options for vegetation types at different growth stages.

TI  - An Alert System for Informing Environmental Risk of Dengue Infections
SP  - 171-183
AB  - Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection the incidence of which varies with the environment and climate. Knowingly, the reported incidence of dengue is an insensitive indicator of infection risk in a locality. The Ovitrap Index has been in use in many countries. This index is a measurement of mosquito eggs in specified geographic locations which, in turn, reflects the distribution of Aedine mosquitoes, the vector for dengue. An alert system, founded on the Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, was created from a synthesis of geospatial data on ovitrap indices in Hong Kong. The inter-relationship between ovitrap indices and temperature was studied. This inference forms the rationale for the generation of weighted overlays to define risk levels. The weighting can be adjusted to set the sensitivity of the alert system. The system is operational at two levels: (1) for the general public to assist in the evaluation of dengue risk in the community, and (2) for professionals and academia in undertaking technical analysis. The alert system offers one objective means to defining the risk of dengue in a society, which would not be affected by the incidence of the infection itself.

VL  - 25

SP  - 445-458
AB  - Changes in legislation have opened the Mexican geothermal resources for exploitation to private companies; therefore the evaluation of the known geothermal areas has a high priority to plan further exploitation and possibly the expansion of the well fields. The calculation of the remaining productivity of geothermal fields currently in exploitation can be achieved with less uncertainty using the parameters obtained from production and injection wells, as well as the production efficiency of the installed plants. No information about previous volumetric evaluation is available for the fields presently being exploited, and there is the possibility that they may support an increase in their energy output or extend further their production life. The most widely used calculation technique is the USGS volumetric method that requires the knowledge of parameters that can be measured only after exploitation started. Heat in place-volumetric evaluation was undertaken for two fields in Mexico: Cerro Prieto and the Las Tres Virgenes geothermal fields, using all information obtained by exploration surveys and exploitation drilling. The obtained values allow planning a possible expansion of the fields based on their estimated mean potential output that is 1397 MWe for Cerro Prieto and 48 MWe for Las Tres Virgenes compared to the presently installed capacity of 580 MWe.

TI  - Understanding the dominant controls on litter decomposition
VL  - 104
IS  - 1
SP  - 229-238
AB  - 1. Litter decomposition is a biogeochemical process fundamental to element cycling within ecosystems, influencing plant productivity, species composition and carbon storage. 2. Climate has long been considered the primary broad-scale control on litter decomposition rates, yet recent work suggests that plant litter traits may predominate. Both decomposition paradigms, however, rely on inferences from cross-biome litter decomposition studies that analyse site-level means. 3. We re-analyse data from a classical cross-biome study to demonstrate that previous research may falsely inflate the regulatory role of climate on decomposition and mask the influence of unmeasured local-scale factors. 4. Using the re-analysis as a platform, we advocate experimental designs of litter decomposition studies that involve high within-site replication, measurements of regulatory factors and processes at the same local spatial grain, analysis of individual observations and biome-scale gradients. 5. Synthesis. We question the assumption that climate is the predominant regulator of decomposition rates at broad spatial scales. We propose a framework for a new generation of studies focused on factoring local-scale variation into the measurement and analysis of soil processes across broad scales. Such efforts may suggest a revised decomposition paradigm and ultimately improve confidence in the structure, parameter estimates and hence projections of biogeochemical models.

TI  - Experimental and theoretical evaluation of thermophysical properties for moist air within solar still by using different algorithms of artificial neural network
VL  - 30
AB  - In this research article, an attempt has been made to predict the thermophysical properties of moist air in a solar still cavity with the help of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modelling. Six training algorithms have been used to train, test, and validate the ANN model (viz. OSS, CGP, CGF, RP, SCG, and LM). Water and inner glass cover temperatures were selected as the input parameters whereas, the model output are: thermal conductivity, partial vapour pressure at water & glass surface, thermal conductivity, volumetric expansivity, specific heat, latent heat of vaporization, and dynamic viscosity. The findings have revealed that the proposed ANN model can be used to predict the thermophysical properties of moist air with excellent accuracy. The results of ANN model were tested against the well-established relations of Tsilingiris. Out of all the training algorithms used LM was found to be the best in all the stages of ANN modelling, as the results are well within an accuracy level of more than 95%. Hence, the developed LM algorithm-based ANN model is one of the most suitable algorithm for the prediction of the thermophysical properties of moist air.

TI  - Decadal trends in Red Sea maximum surface temperature
VL  - 7
AB  - Ocean warming is a major consequence of climate change, with the surface of the ocean having warmed by 0.11 degrees C decade(-1) over the last 50 years and is estimated to continue to warm by an additional 0.6 - 2.0 degrees C before the end of the century(1). However, there is considerable variability in the rates experienced by different ocean regions, so understanding regional trends is important to inform on possible stresses for marine organisms, particularly in warm seas where organisms may be already operating in the high end of their thermal tolerance. Although the Red Sea is one of the warmest ecosystems on earth, its historical warming trends and thermal evolution remain largely understudied. We characterized the Red Sea's thermal regimes at the basin scale, with a focus on the spatial distribution and changes over time of sea surface temperature maxima, using remotely sensed sea surface temperature data from 1982 - 2015. The overall rate of warming for the Red Sea is 0.17 +/- 0.07 degrees C decade(-1), while the northern Red Sea is warming between 0.40 and 0.45 degrees C decade(-1), all exceeding the global rate. Our findings show that the Red Sea is fast warming, which may in the future challenge its organisms and communities.

TI  - Electrodeposition of Si from Silicate Ions at Graphite and Liquid Zn Electrodes in Molten CaCl2
VL  - 169
IS  - 5
AB  - To establish a next-generation production process for SOG-Si, we proposed the electrochemical reduction process of SiO2 using a liquid Zn cathode in molten CaCl2. In this study, we focused on the dissolved SiO2 to improve the productivity of the process. The ionic species and electrochemical reduction of silicate ions at solid graphite and liquid Zn electrodes in molten CaCl2 with various O2-/SiO2 ratios (r(O2-)/SiO2 ) at 1123 K were investigated. Ionic species of silicates in the melts were determined by Raman spectroscopy. The dominant species were SiO32- (r(O2-)/SiO2 = 1.0) and SiO44- (r(O2-)/SiO2 = 1.5 and 2.0). Cyclic voltammetry, XRD, and SEM revealed that the electrochemical reduction of SiO3 (2-), Si2O7 (6-), and SiO4 (4-) occurs at the graphite electrode from 1.35 V, 1.12 V, and 0.75 V vs Ca2+/Ca, respectively. The electrochemical reduction potentials of silicate ions at the liquid Zn electrode shifted to more negative values in the order SiO32- > Si2O76- > SiO44-. The reaction observed at 0.60 V was attributed to the simultaneous electrochemical reduction of silicate ions and formation of Ca-Zn alloy. The indirect reduction of silicate ions by Ca-Zn alloy was also confirmed. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published on behalf of The Electrochemical Society by IOP Publishing Limited.

TI  - FABRICATION ROADMAP AS AN EXAMPLE FOR SMALL MODULAR REACTORS
SP  - 419-426
AB  - Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are being designed to achieve many of the same goals as Generation IV reactors in much smaller individual package sizes. The experience with developing a fabrication roadmap to Generation IV reactors can be transferred as guidance for fabrication design of SMRs. Some areas where fabrication process development needs to come early in the sequence are materials for fast neutron areas, connections of thick to thin for combinations of pressure containment and fluid flow, fabrication with planned coating of internal surfaces, and materials that push beyond existing upper temperature limits. For instance, the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) shifted to lower peak temperatures as the enormity of the materials qualification task for the originally planned peak temperatures became apparent. Materials replacements for long lifetime were needed in NGNP even when the peak temperature was lowered, with some like silicon carbide composite fuel rods not expected to be available for initial production. Several new welding techniques such as short-circuit transfer, narrow groove, tandem gas metal arc, hybrid laser-gas metal arc, and friction stir are also available. These techniques offer improved weld quality and higher productivity in assembly operations. Other fabrication considerations, such as qualification of joining methods, long life mechanical components, and dissimilar material joints will be discussed.

TI  - Canopy status modulates formation of wood rays in scots pine under hemiboreal conditions
VL  - 67
AB  - Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) reserves are crucial for trees to cope with weather extremes, thus to ensure their survival and ecological plasticity. The NSC reserves can depend on social status, suggesting uneven plasticity of trees at the stand level. In stemwood of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), which is a widespread and important species, NSC reserves are stored in parenchyma in wood rays (WR). The quantity of WRs is adjusted intra-annually, allowing retrospective analysis of factors affecting their formation. Accordingly, the differences in WR quantity in stemwood of dominant and intermediate (canopy trees with reduced and narrow crowns) maturing Scots pine were assessed by quantitative wood anatomy. Tangential cuts from the outermost 30 treerings were analysed. The relative ray area was intermediate, i.e. covering about 5% of the tangential cut, yet expressed high individuality among the trees. The size and amount of WR mainly differed between the earlywood and latewood; WRs in latewood were higher although narrower in comparison to earlywood, yet their total amount was higher in earlywood. Canopy status had only a slight effect, as quantity and height of WR tended to be higher for the intermediate trees, particularly in earlywood. The size and quantity of WR expressed interannual variation, which was mainly related to the meteorological conditions prior to the formation of the tree-ring (previous summer and autumn) indicating legacy effects of climatic factors on NSC and susceptibility of trees to cumulative effects of weather extremes. However, the climatic signals in the inter-annual variation of WR were weaker than observed before, likely due to location of the studied stand in the mid-part of the species range. Nevertheless, the observed differences in mean values and inter-annual variation of WR suggested a withinspecies diversity of carbon allocation patterns, supporting adaptability of the species.

TI  - MODELING OF CONCRETE THERMAL TREATMENT IN CAST-IN-SITU STRUCTURES
IS  - 6
SP  - 37-43
AB  - Nowadays main qualitative indices depend on concrete structure formation and curing while constructing cast-in-situ concrete and reinforced concrete structures and especially it concerns winter conditions. Therefore the regime of thermal treatment influences on concrete properties characterizing its strength, porosity, durability, frost resistance etc. In this connection selection of regimes and their corrections are reasonable to be tested while using models. Convenience in mathematical modeling is in reproduction of the operational process in time. However explicit mathematics is obtained only for relatively simple systems or at the cost of specific assumptions and suppositions. In this connection it is expedient to use physical simulation along with mathematical one. The physical simulation presupposes manufacturing, thermal treatment and testing of prototype models. Development of efficient, scientifically-substantiated technology for thermal treatment of cast-in-situ concrete is impossible without information support and working environment. The proposed mathematical model of thermal treatment for castin-situ structures determines sequence of the operations to be executed. Shapes, geometric dimensions, surface area have been determined in the paper. The required thermotechnical characteristics of formwork systems for structures under concreting have been used for making calculations of thermal treatment regimes. The model has taken into account three main stages of thermal treatment: temperature rising, isothermal warming and cooling. The paper provides formulae for their determination including total heat expenditure: for temperature rising of the concrete mix, for thermal treatment of 1 M-3 concrete mix, for cement exothermic reaction per 1 M-3, for reinforcement heating per 1 M-3, for moisture evaporation, for heating of formwork system. The following heat losses have been determined: in the environment, in the process of passing through the exterior surface of the formwork, in case of temperature rising in one of the constructive element and per 1 M-3 of its concrete mix. The paper reveals determination of hourly heat consumption for a concrete structure as a whole. The proposed methodology makes it possible to determine the required characteristics of heat treatment process for concrete mixes, to optimize regimes of heat treatment, promptly to make corrections in the created situation, to automatize the process and when it is necessary to make comparison of some solutions in the form of graphics and diagrams.

AB  - The urban heat island effect is linked to the built environment and threatens human health during extreme heat events. In this study, we analyzed whether characteristic land uses within an urban area are associated with higher or lower surface temperatures, and whether concentrations of. hot. land uses exacerbate this relationship. Zonal statistics on a thermal remote sensing image for the City of Toronto revealed statistically significant differences between high average temperatures for commercial and resource/industrial land use (29.1 degrees C), and low average temperatures for parks and recreational land (25.1 degrees C) and water bodies (23.1 degrees C). Furthermore, higher concentrations of either of these land uses were associated with more extreme surface temperatures. We also present selected neighborhoods to illustrate these results. The paper concludes by recommending that municipal planners and decision-makers formulate policies and regulations that are specific to the problematic land uses, in order to mitigate extreme heat.

TI  - Generation of mid-ocean ridge basalts at pressures from 1 to 7 GPa
VL  - 66
IS  - 12
SP  - 2073-2090
AB  - We propose a model for the generation of average MORBs based on phase relations in the CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-CO2 system at pressures from 3 to 7 GPa and in the CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-Na2O-FeO (CMASNF) system at pressures from similar to0.9 to 1.5 GPa. The MELT seismic tomography (Forsyth et al., 2000) across the East Pacific Rise shows the largest amount of melt centered at similar to30-km depth and lesser amounts at greater depths. An average mantle adiabat with a model-system potential temperature (T-P) of 1310degreesC is used that is consistent with this result. In the mantle, additional minor components would lower solidus temperatures similar to50degreesC, which would lower T-P of the adiabat for average MORBs to similar to1260degreesC. The model involves generation of carbonatitic melts and melts that are transitional between carbonatite and kimberlite at very small melt fractions (<0.2%) in the low-velocity zone at pressures of similar to2.6 to 7 GPa in the CMAS-CO2 system, roughly the pressure range of the PREM low-velocity zone. These small-volume, low-viscosity melts are mixed with much larger volumes of basaltic melt generated at the plagioclase-spinel lherzolite transition in the pressure range of similar to0.9 to 1.5 GPa. In this model, solidus phase relations in the pressure range of the plagioclase-spinel lherzolite transition strongly, but not totally, control the major-element characteristics of MORBs. Although the plagioclase-spinel lherzolite transition suppresses isentropic decompression melting in the CMAS system, this effect does not occur in the topologically different and petrologically more realistic CMASNF system. On the basis of the absence of plagioclase from most abyssal peridotites, which are the presumed residues of MORB generation, we calculate melt productivity during polybaric fractional melting in the plagioclase-spinel lherzolite transition interval at exhaustion of plagioclase in the residue. In the CMASN system, these calculations indicate that the total melt productivity is similar to24%, which is adequate to produce the oceanic crust. The residual mineral proportions from this calculation closely match those of average abyssal peridotites. Melts generated in the plagioclase-spinel lherzolite transition are compositionally distinct from all MORB glasses, but do not have a significant fractional crystallization trend controlled by olivine alone. They reach the composition field of erupted MORBs mainly by crystallization of both plagioclase and olivine, with initial crystallization of either one of these phases rapidly joined by the other, This is consistent with phenocryst assemblages and experimental studies of the most primitive MORBs, which do not show an olivine-controlled fractionation trend. The model is most robust for the eastern Pacific, where an adiabat with a T-P of similar to1260degreesC is supported by the MELT seismic data and where the global inverse correlation of (FeO)(8) with (Na2O)(8) is weak. Average MORBs worldwide also are well modeled. A heterogeneous mantle consisting of peridotite of varying degrees of major-element depletion combined with phase-equilibrium controls in the plagioclase-spinel lberzolite transition interval would produce the form of the global correlations at a constant T-P, which suggests a modest range of TP along ridges. Phase-composition data for the CMASNF system are presently not adequate for quantitative calculation of (FeO)(8)-(Na2O)(8)-(CaO/Al2O3)(8) systematics in terms of this model. The near absence of basalts in the central portion of the Gakkel Ridge suggests a lower bound for T-P along ridges of similar to1240degreesC, a potential temperature just low enough to miss the solidus for basalt production at similar to0.9 GPa. An upper bound for T-P is poorly constrained, but the complete absence of picritic glasses in Iceland and the global ridge system suggests an upper bound of similar to1400degreesC. In contrast to some previous models for MORB Generation that emphasize large potential temperature variations in a relatively homogeneous peridotitic mantle, our model emphasizes modest potential temperature variations in a peridotitic mantle that shows varying degrees of heterogeneity. Calculations indicate that melt productivity changes from 0 to 24% for a change in T-P from 1240 to 1260degreesC, effectively producing a rapid increase to full crustal thickness or decrease to none as ridges appear and disappear.

VL  - 15
AB  - Background: A key question in evolutionary biology is the relationship between species traits and their habitats. Caves offer an ideal model to test the adjustment of species to their surrounding temperature, as they provide homogeneous and simple environments. We compared two species living under different thermal conditions within a lineage of Pyrenean beetles highly modified for the subterranean life since the Miocene. One, Troglocharinus fonti, is found in caves at 4-11 degrees C in the ancestral Pyrenean range. The second, T. ferreri, inhabits the coastal area of Catalonia since the early Pliocene, and lives at 14-16 degrees C. Results: We found no differences in their short term upper thermal limit (ca. 50 degrees C), similar to that of most organisms, or their lower thermal limit (ca. -2.5 degrees C), higher than for most temperate insects and suggesting the absence of cryoprotectants. In longer term tests (7 days) survival between 6-20 degrees C was almost 100% for both species plus two outgroups of the same lineage, but all four died between 23-25 degrees C, without significant differences between them. Conclusions: Our results suggest that species in this lineage have lost some of the thermoregulatory mechanisms common in temperate insects, as their inferred default tolerance range is larger than the thermal variation experienced through their whole evolutionary history.

TI  - Calling Behavior, Copulation Time, and Reproductive Compatibility of Corn-Strain Fall Armyworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) From Populations in Mexico
VL  - 46

SP  - 901-906
AB  - The calling behavior, mating time, and the reproductive compatibility of virgin adults of fall armyworms, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), were studied in this work. Larvae were collected on maize (Zea mays L.) from six states located on the Pacific coast (Chiapas, Michoacan, and Sinaloa), on the Gulf of Mexico (Veracruz and Yucatan), and in central Mexico (Morelos). Before the experiments, insects were reared under laboratory conditions for one generation. We recorded the age at which females called for the first time, the onset time of calling, the duration of calling, the onset time of copulation, and the duration of copulation. The calling rhythms of the six populations were dissimilar. Females from all populations began to call in the second or third scoto-phase. The time for onset of calling and the duration of calling were significantly different among the S. frugiperda populations studied. Spodoptera frugiperda pairs from Sinaloa, Veracruz, Yucatan, and Morelos started to copulate earlier than the pairs from Chiapas and Michoacan. Pairs from Veracruz and Yucatan copulated longer than those from Michoacan, Morelos, Chiapas, and Sinaloa. Our crossing experiment using females and males from the six populations showed that individuals from different populations could copulate and produce fertile offspring. Thus, although the S. frugiperda populations showed variability in the timing of reproduction, the populations were not reproductively incompatible, which indicated that geographic distance has not led to reproductive isolation in corn-strain populations of S. frugiperda in Mexico.

TI  - Friction factors and Nusselt numbers in microchannels with superhydrophobic walls
SP  - 599-609
AB  - The thermal management of electronics is becoming an increasing concern as industry continues to simultaneously push performance while shrinking the size of electronic devices. Microchannel cooling is a promising technology to accommodate the heat dissipation rates and associated fluxes projected for future generations of electronics while also satisfying the need for a reduced footprint to accommodate ever-shrinking device sizes. One shortfall of microchannel cooling, however, is the large pressure drop associated with pumping liquids through microchannels, i.e., channels in which the smallest dimension is between about I micron and I mm. Superhydrophobic surfaces combine roughness features with low surface energy coatings to create materials with substantially decreased wettability and drag resistance in laminar flows and represent a promising technology for reducing the flow resistance of microchannels. The presence of an (insulating) air layer that is trapped within the superhydrophobic surface, and which separates the microchannel wall from the working fluid, gives rise to a low shear-stress region responsible for the observed reduction in flow resistance. There have been a limited number of studies on the fluid mechanics in superhydrophobic microchannels and, to our knowledge, heat transfer has not been examined. Quantifying the trade-off between the enhanced heat transfer due to pressure drop reduction versus the insulating characteristics of the air layer is of paramount importance for determining the viability of superhydrophobic surfaces as a technology for enhancing microchannel heat transfer. In this work we compute friction factors and Nusselt numbers for the fully-developed (with respect to energy and momentum) flow of a fluid in a parallel-plane microchannel with different heat flux and momentum boundary conditions at the upper and lower channel walls. Two approximations are taken for modeling the superhydrophobic microchannel. In the first case we study the single-phase flow of a fluid in a microchannel where one or both microchannel walls is assumed to be superhydrophobic and where the superhydrophobicity is modeled via application of Navier's slip model at the microchannel wall. Solutions for the velocity profiles are then employed to calculate theoretical friction factors and Nusselt numbers for the constant heat flux condition. This analysis is then extended to examine the implications on the thermal resistance of a superhydrophobic surface due to the presence of a purely conductive air layer. In the second case we model the fluid flow in the presence of a recirculating air layer that separates the fluid from the microchannel wall. In this instance the low-viscosity air layer gives rise to apparent fluid slip for the working fluid which is dependant on the thickness of the air layer and the viscosity ratio of the two working fluids. This case represents an upper apparent-slip limit as the characteristic spacing of the surface roughness becomes large relative to the channel height and air-layer thickness.

VL  - 42
IS  - 2
SP  - 354-362
AB  - The life cycle of Lethocerus deyrollei (Vuillefroy) in Sayo-cho, Hyogo, Japan (35 degrees 00' N, 134 degrees 21' E), was studied in terms of flight, reproduction, and energy allocation as well as developmental zero (t(0)) and required heat units (K) for a generation. Counts of bugs attracted to electric lighting showed that L. deyrollei flew most frequently in July, the second half of the mating season. The weight of aight muscle showed no significant yearly change despite a conspicuous difference in the aight activities. Fat content in the abdomen was low during summer, when oviposition activity reached a high level in females. Thereafter, lipid accumulation increased to mid-October when aight to an overwintering site took place. The lipid reservoir in late summer may be critical for surviving winter but no significant decrease was observed during overwintering. The number of eggs in the ovary indicated univoltism because no females had mature eggs late in the year. t(0) and K were calculated based on laboratory rearing at different temperatures. Thus, estimated K(635 degree days) and local heat mass suggest a univoltine life cycle in Sayo-cho. The possible areas for successful inoculation of L. deyrollei were examined on the basis of available heat mass and day length in places where the species is extinct or not observed. Based on the estimated K and critical day length for reproductive maturation, Niigata and Tokyo fulfill suitable conditions of the Sayo population to complete a univoltine life cycle.

TI  - SIMULATION OF THE THERMAL COMFORT CONDITIONS OF URBAN AREAS: A CASE STUDY IN KYIV
IS  - 51
SP  - 186-198
AB  - Formulation of the problem. Studies of bioclimate of a territory are aimed at determining the favorable and adverse impacts of various climatic factors and their combinations on the human body. Complex urban morphology has a significant impact on microclimate and, accordingly, on thermal comfort of a person in such an environment. The height of buildings, street orientation, and distance between buildings alter the solar energy inlet, affect thermal regime, transform the wind speed and direction at the street level. Studies of the bioclimatic conditions of urban areas during the warm season are highly relevant as they provide an opportunity to evaluate human thermal sensations in the city, as well as the potential effectiveness of adaptation measures to heat stress (architectural measures and measures based on the use of green areas and water bodies). The purpose of the article. The aim of this research is to simulate the bioclimate of an urban environment to determine the human thermal load in summer months based on modern bioclimatic indices and software. Methods. For the purpose of this study, a part of the territory of the Osokorky residential area of Kyiv was selected. To get values of the main meteorological parameters of the researched area, a three-dimensional, prognostic, microscale model ENVI-met was used. ENVI-met pertains to the CFD-models (computation fluid dynamics model) and is designed for microscales with a horizontal resolution from 0.5 to 10 m and with a time step of 10 seconds as maximum. The PET calculation was performed using the RayMan model. Results. A clear hot summer day (04 August 2017) was chosen for the simulation. The simulation was performed from 6:00 EEST on 4 August till 6:00 EEST the next day (output interval - 1 hour). The simulation results show that the values of the main meteorological parameters (air temperature and humidity, wind characteristics) and physiologically equivalent temperature differ significantly within urban spaces, even across small areas. The amplitudes of PET value were maximum in the daytime and made 12 degrees-15 degrees C. The decrease in the amplitude of the air temperature within the researched area in the evening and night hours led to a notable decrease in the PET amplitude to 2 degrees-3 degrees C. The analysis of the simulated PET values for the researched area confirmed that the residents of the urban areas experience the most intense heat stress while staying in the open asphalted areas during the daytime. The duration of the period with comfortable conditions during the researched day was very short - from 22:00 EEST through midnight. The range of the daily course of PET values at different points of the researched area varied from 19.4 degrees (at point No. 7) to 37.1 degrees C (at point No. 5 located in the well courtyard). Based on the PET values simulated for the researched area and for CAWS Kyiv was found the significant differences between thermal comfort conditions within the complex urban spaces and at the weather station. Therefore, the values of bioclimatic indices simulated based on the weather station data can not be applied with any approximation to solve scientific and applied tasks that require information on the bioclimate at particular points in the urbanized environment. To solve such tasks, it is recommended to apply modern methods - ENVI-met and RayMan models. Scientific novelty and practical significance. For the first time in Ukraine, microclimate and thermal comfort conditions within the complex urban environment has been simulated using ENVI-met and RayMan models. The results of such simulation can be used to choose heat adaptation measures which would help to increase the comfort of the urban areas. The simulation of microclimate and thermal comfort conditions of some parts of the city territory is important stage of design of the buildings, in order to choose the optimal location for buildings and trees and to create the most comfortable conditions for people.

AB  - The Chinese Government established an industrial environmental management system to execute its pollutants gross control policy in 2006. A key component of this system is the Best Available Techniques (BAT) determination method and pollution control management. This paper augments BAT with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to create a technology selection model for thermal power techniques as case study. Emissions reduction and energy conservation potentials can be weighed against technological feasibility to create best fit assessments for a wide variety of power generation installations. Using this model improves the ability of policymakers and plant owners alike to plan appropriate technology consolidation and upgrade paths. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

VL  - 135
IS  - 4
SP  - 295-309
AB  - Smelting in autumn in age 0 + Salmo salar was improved by 2 months of short photoperiod in an otherwise constant long photoperiod regime. Four groups of fry were reared under either constant-long photoperiod (LD 17:7), or LD17:7 interrupted by LD7:17 for one (Imo-short; July 27-September 1) or 2 months (2mo-short; June 30-September 1), or simulated natural day length (LDN). Bimodality in size-frequency developed in all groups by August. Probability of an individual entering the upper-modal group (UMG) was related positively to fork length in late June. The LDN regime had the highest proportion of both lower-modal group fish (46% vs. 25-27%), and 0 + sexually mature males of the four groups (26% vs. 10-12%). Smelt development in autumn was highest in the 2mo-short group, but was inferior to normal spring smelts, as judged by hypoosmoregulatory ability and gill Na+ K+ ATPase activity. Following transfer of UMG fish to a sea-cage in November, the 2mo-short group exhibited best survival and growth over winter. From spring onwards all groups grew well, reaching harvest size (3-4 kg) in August after 20 months in sea water. Mortality in sea water was 24% and 28% in the 2mo- and 1mo-short groups, and 54% and 67% in the constant-long and LDN groups, The study indicated the feasibility of stabilising the undesirable seasonal fluctuation in commercial salmon production by producing 'off-season' smolts 6 months out-of-phase from regular spring smelts.

TI  - Innovative beneficial reuse of reverse osmosis concentrate using bipolar membrane electrodialysis and electrochlorination processes
VL  - 326
IS  - 2
SP  - 392-399
AB  - Reverse osmosis (110) is a widely used and rapidly growing desalination technology. A major disadvantage of this process is that the concentrate from the RO process, which could be as much as 25% of the feed represents a polluting stream. This waste stream could pose a significant challenge to the implestream, mentation of this process, particularly for inland communities which do not have the option of ocean disposal. An excellent environmentally benign approach to disposal could be beneficial reuse of the waste stream. This study presents two innovative beneficial reuse strategies for RO concentrate produced by an integrated membrane system (IMS) from a wastewater reclamation facility. The technologies evaluated in this study included bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED) for conversion of RO concentrate into mixed acid and mixed base streams, and electrochlorination (EC) for onsite chlorine generation. Bench-scale studies conducted with BMED demonstrated that RO concentrate could be desalted while producing mixed acids and mixed bases with concentrations as high as 0.2N. Similarly, the EC process was capable of producing a 0.6% hypochlorite solution from RO concentrate. The acids and bases as well as the hypochlorite produced could be directly applied to the RO process as well as upstream pre-treatment processes. A preliminary economic evaluation of the viability of these two approaches was conducted by conducting rough order of magnitude cost estimates based on the bench-scale performance of these processes on RO concentrate. A comparison of the overall costs of an Integrated Membrane System utilizing these innovative reuse strategies with conventional disposal options and thermal zero liquid discharge treatment is presented. This comparison indicates that a reuse approach might be economically viable for inland wastewater reuse facilities that utilize RO membranes and have limited options for concentrate disposal.

TI  - Petrological and geochemical investigations of potential source rocks of the central Congo Basin, Democratic Republic of Congo
VL  - 96
IS  - 2
SP  - 245-275
AB  - Paleozoic and Mesozoic outcrop and core samples (REMINA Dekese and REMINA Samba wells) covering various stratigraphic intervals from the central Congo Basin were analyzed for total organic carbon (C-org), total inorganic carbon (C-inorg), and total sulfur content. Rock-Eval analysis and vitrinite reflectance (R-o) measurements were performed on the basis of the C-org content. Fifteen samples were chosen for molecular organic geochemistry. Nonaromatic hydrocarbons (HCs) were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) flame ionization detection and GC-mass spectrometry. Samples of the Alolo shales from the Aruwimi Group (Lindi Supergroup, late Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic) are in general very poor in C-org (most samples <0.5%) and contain a high amount of degraded organic matter (OM). All samples of this group revealed a type III to IV kerogen and cannot be considered as a potential source rock. Permian-Carboniferous sediments from the Lukuga Group (Dekese well and outcrop samples) contain moderate contents of organic carbon (<2%). The T-max values (heating temperature at which the top peak of S-2 occurs) indicate early mature OM, partly also a higher level of maturity because of Ro (0.6-0.7%) and production index values (S-1/S-1 + S-2 < 0.2). All samples contain hydrogen-poor type III to IV kerogen with low HC generation potential, only having a very minor gas generation potential. The kinds of OM, as well as the biological markers, indicate a terrestrial-dominated depositional environment. Organic geochemical investigations on Upper Jurassic (Stanleyville Group) to Lower Cretaceous (Loia Group) samples from the Samba well and outcrops in the northeastern part of the Congo Basin reveal moderate to high contents of organic carbon (as much as 25%). The kerogen has very high hydrogen index (HI) values reflecting type I kerogen of excellent quality in the Stanleyville Group (as much as 900 mg HC/g C-org) and type I to II kerogen in the overlying Loia Group (as much as 900 mg HC/g C-org). Outcrop samples from the Stanleyville Group have variable partly high C-org contents and are also characterized by very high HI values (as much as 900 mg HC/g C-org). The samples studied are too immature for petroleum generation. Based on biomarker analysis, an aquatic anoxic depositional environment can be assumed for the Stanleyville Group, whereas a lacustrine deposition is likely for the samples of the Loia Group. Based on the geologic knowledge of the area, deposition under lacustrine conditions is most likely also for the Stanleyville Group. Both the Stanleyville and Loia groups can be regarded as excellent petroleum source rocks and could be part of a petroleum system if sufficient burial and maturation have occurred. The presence of resedimented vitrinite particles in the Lukuga Group of the Dekese well with a slightly higher maturation rank than the autochthonous vitrinites suggests that 3000-4000 m (9840-13,120 ft) of Carboniferous to Devonian sediment has been eroded from the eastern margin of the Congo Basin. Finally, R-o data were used to create one-dimensional models for the Dekese and Samba wells, giving an overview of the burial, thermal, and maturity histories of the area.

TI  - Gene flow across a major biogeographic barrier is not increasing under climate change for the barnacle Catomerus polymerus
VL  - 669
SP  - 97-106
AB  - On the south-east coast of Australia, the impermeability of the Southeast Australian Biogeographic Barrier (SEABB) limits the dispersal of many intertidal taxa, but current flow across the SEABB is expected to be increasing under climate change. The surf barnacle Catomerus polymerus has extensive populations on either side of the barrier that both mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) sequence data and surveys using 4-6 microsatellite loci imply have been separated for millennia (>167 000 yr). Nevertheless, these data sets (based on collections from 2005-2012) also imply that there has been some recent dispersal across the SEABB. If transbarrier migration is now possible, then in the absence of selection the differentiation of lineages should be eroded. Next-generation sequencing provides the opportunity to both better quantify levels of population differentiation attributable to the SEABB and to determine if there is regional selection. Our data (3801 single nucleotide polymorphisms) for individuals collected in 2019 within 3 eastern and 4 western sites support earlier reports of low population differentiation within eastern and western regions (F-ST < 0.021) and the strong regional separation of eastern and western lineages (F-RT = 0.23). Moreover, in contrast to earlier studies, we did not detect any putative migrants, with all individuals assigning most strongly to their sampling region. Most strikingly, analysis using BAYESCAN implied that 47 loci (1.24 %) of our surveyed loci show evidence of significant regional diversifying selection, which implies that even if C. polymerus larvae are able to cross the barrier, they will be strongly disfavoured by selection.

TI  - Resolving Adaptive and Demographic Divergence among Chinook Salmon Populations in the Columbia River Basin
VL  - 140
IS  - 3
SP  - 783-807
AB  - Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the Columbia River basin (CRB) comprise three lineages-lower Columbia River and sympatric interior ocean and stream types-each with distinct biological attributes. To evaluate the adaptive and neutral genetic variation of this species in the CRB, we genotyped 54 Chinook salmon populations using a panel of 96 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci. All three lineages were represented among the collections and were widely distributed across locations, ranging from the upper Salmon River to near the Columbia River estuary. Our goal was to explore local adaptation as a process shaping the population structure and genetic variation among Chinook salmon beyond the inferences possible with neutral marker data. In our analyses with putatively neutral SNPs, the population structure of Chinook salmon throughout the CRB was generally concordant with that of previous studies using microsatellites. Regression analyses and outlier methods identified 28, 17, and 29 candidate SNP loci for positive selection among stream-type, ocean-type, and lower-river Chinook salmon, respectively. The candidate SNP markers were tested for association with seven environmental variables using multiple methods. We identified unambiguous markers, including nine candidates in the stream-type lineage and seven in the ocean-type lineage that were significantly correlated with elevation and/or temperature. The association of six candidates markers in the lower-river lineage could not be confirmed by population structure analyses and remained ambiguous. We observed a significant association of isolation by distance for the ocean-and stream-type lineages with our SNP panel; however, there was also a significant relationship between pairwise F-ST and several habitat variables. In all cases, the apparent adaptive variation complemented the results of demographic genetic structure but with higher resolution of population differentiation.

TI  - Genetic diversity and genotypic stability in Prunus avium L. at the northern parts of species distribution range
VL  - 75
IS  - 2
AB  - Key message Large genetic variation was found in Prunus avium L. populations from the northern parts of the species distribution range. The ranking of genotypes in terms of growth was stable when tested at three trial sites within the northern parts of the species distribution range. Context Peripheral populations especially those in the leading edge are isolated from rest of the areas in the species distribution range. This can make them less genetically diverse yet genetically distinct from the rest of the populations in the species distribution range. Evaluation of their genetic diversity is thus crucial in understanding the local adaptation potential of a species. Aims We investigated the genetic diversity and genotype by environment interaction at the northern parts of the distribution range of P. avium. Methods Quantitative genetic variation of growth, stem form, and spring phenology were assessed in progenies from 93 plus trees of P. avium selected from 43 locations at the north of the species distribution range in Sweden and tested at two Swedish sites and one Danish site. Results We find large quantitative genetic variation in growth and phenology at the northern part of the distribution range of P. avium. Only a limited genotype by environment interaction was observed with no clear indication of local adaptation at the northern parts of the species distribution. Conclusion We conclude that P. avium harbors a high level of genetic diversity at the north of its distribution range. Present patterns therefore reflect more likely the recent introduction of the species and dispersal dynamics rather than a long-term loss of diversity along South-North ecological clines during the Holocene. With no indications of genetic depletion in growth or phenology, the gene pool in the breeding program is considered suitable for the future propagation of the species in the tested area.

VL  - 117

SP  - 1211-1224
AB  - The anthropozoonotic metastrongyloid nematodes Angiostrongylus cantonensis and Angiostrongylus costaricensis, as well as Angiostrongylus vasorum, Crenosoma vulpis, Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior are currently considered as emerging gastropod-borne parasites and have gained growing scientific attention in the last years. However, the knowledge on invertebrate immune responses and on how metastrongyloid larvae are attacked by gastropod immune cells is still limited. This work aims to describe an in vitro system to investigate haemocyte-derived innate immune responses of terrestrial gastropods induced by vital axenic metastrongyloid larvae. We also provide protocols on slug/snail management and breeding under standardized climate conditions (circadian cycle, temperature and humidity) for the generation of parasite-free F0 stages which are essential for immune-related investigations. Adult slug species (Arion lusitanicus, Limax maximus) and giant snails (Achatina fulica) were maintained in fully automated climate chambers until mating and production of fertilized eggs. Newly hatched F0 juvenile specimens were kept under parasite-free conditions before experimental use. An improved protocol for gastropod haemolymph collection and haemocyte isolation was established. Giemsa-stained haemolymph preparations showed adequate haemocyte isolation in all three gastropod species. Additionally, a protocol for the production of axenic first and third stage larvae (L1, L3) was established. Haemocyte functionality was tested in haemocyte-nematode-co-cultures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy analyses revealed that gastropod-derived haemocytes formed clusters as well as DNA-rich extracellular aggregates catching larvae and decreasing their motility. These data confirm the usefulness of the presented methods to study haemocyte-mediated gastropod immune responses to better understand the complex biology of gastropod-borne diseases.

AB  - Experiments with temperature effect on survival of a terrestrial mollusk, Bradybaena fruticum, revealed differential mortality rate of specimens differing by shell and biochemical phenotypes. Among young specimens, vitality is shown to be higher in stripeless and yellow morphs than in striped and pink ones, while in adults no differences between these morphs are indicated. It is supposed that these experimental data indicate one of the non-specific esterase marking certain shell traits allele has selective advantage under high temperature conditions. These data are in favor of selective value of enzyme polymorphism.

TI  - Reducing the fuel temperature for pressure-tube supercritical-water-cooled reactors and the effect of fuel burnup
VL  - 295
SP  - 524-533
AB  - The Pressure-Tube Supercritical-Water-Cooled Reactor (PT-SCWR) is one of the concepts under investigation by the Generation IV International Forum for its promise to deliver higher thermal efficiency than nuclear reactors currently in operation. The high coolant temperature (>625 K) and high linear power density employed by the PT-SCWR cause the fuel temperature to be fairly high, leading to a reduced margin to fuel melting, thus increasing the risk of actual melting during accident scenarios. It is therefore desirable to come up with a fuel design that lowers the fuel temperature while preserving the high linear power ratio and high coolant temperature. One possible solution is to separate the fertile (ThO2) and fissile (PuO2) fuel materials into different radial regions in each fuel pin. Previously-reported work found that by locating the fertile material at the centre and the fissile material at the periphery of the fuel pin, the fuel centreline temperature can be reduced by 650 K for fresh fuel compared to the case of a homogeneous (Th-Pu)O-2 mixture for the same coolant temperature and linear power density. This work provides a justification for the observed reduction in fuel centreline temperature and suggests a systematic approach to lower the fuel temperature. It also extends the analysis to the dependence of the radial temperature profile on fuel burnup. The radial temperature profile is determined from the analytical solution of the steady-state heat conduction equation in the fuel pin, ignoring azimuthal dependence and axial heat flow. The temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity is accounted for, as is the radial dependence of the volumetric power density, which is determined from detailed lattice-level transport calculations performed using the lattice code DRAGON. The reduction in the centreline fuel temperature is shown to be caused partly by a reduction in the heat flux in the case of the two-region fuel and partly by the higher thermal conductivity of both pure ThO2 and pure PuO2 compared to that of a ThO2-PuO2 mixture. The centreline temperature of the two-region fuel is shown to be higher for irradiated fuel than for fresh fuel, a fact explained by the depletion of the fissile material in the peripheral region and the buildup of fissile material in the central region.

TI  - The evolution of organic solderability preservatives (OSPs) from a temporary protectant to a leadership position in surface finishing chemistry
VL  - 37
IS  - 2
SP  - 12-19
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the evolution of organic solderability preservatives (OSPs) technology from a temporary anti-tarnish to an approved process for the lead-free assembly of high-reliability printed circuit boards (PCBs). Design/methodology/approach - As this is an informational paper, the main approach was to compare and contrast various types of OSP molecules and their fitness for use. Findings - The active ingredient of an OSP is one of the most important ingredients that can help to improve the heat resistance, which becomes much more important in conjunction with lead-free solder. The latest OSP shows excellent stability, even at more than the peak reflow temperatures used with lead-free solders. The success of any OSP process is highly correlated to process control and maintenance and OSP formulations are not created equal. The thickness of the film is only one difference. However, the key differentiators for OSP coatings are the overall ability of the organic film to resist oxygen penetration and humidity; and withstand the higher temperatures of lead-free assembly. The author suggests that original equipment manufacturer (OEMs), contract manufacturers and PCB fabricators perform testing and qualification of OSPs using industry-accepted reliability and solderability testing methods. Research limitations/implications - This work represents the author's extensive experience with OSP technology, as well as the results of a collective collaboration with Shikoku Chemical Corporation. The findings represent reliability and solderability testing carried out in various manufacturing sites including cooperation with certain OEMs that are users of circuits fabricated with OSP technology. Originality/value - This paper details how critical advances in OSP technology have enabled improvements in solderability and reliability over earlier commercial generations and have further enhanced the solderability of lead-free assemblies.

TI  - Reliable and unproductive? Stereotypes of older employees in corporate and news media
VL  - 38
IS  - 1
SP  - 166-191
AB  - Older employees face a severe employability problem, partly because of dominant stereotypes about them. This study investigates stereotypes of older employees in corporate and news media. Drawing on the Stereotype Content Model, we content analysed newspaper coverage and corporate media of 50 large-scale Dutch organisations, published between 2006 and 2013. The data revealed that stereotypical portrayals of older employees are more common in news media than in corporate media and mixed in terms of valence. Specifically, older employees were positively portrayed with regard to warmth stereotypes, such as trustworthiness, but negatively with regard to competence stereotypes, such as technological competence and adaptability. Additionally, stereotypical portrayals that do not clearly belong to warmth or competence dimensions are found, such as the mentoring role stereotype and the costly stereotype. Because competence stereotypes weigh more heavily in employers' productivity perceptions, these media portrayals might contribute to the employability problem of older employees. We suggest that older employees could benefit from a more realistic media debate about their skills and capacities.

VL  - 110
IS  - 5
SP  - 489-500
AB  - Foliage edibility of Scots pine clones of French and Polish origin (woodlands near Haguenau in Alsace and near Taborz in Mazury) is tested on the pine sawfly Diprion pini L. Feeding bioassays were first performed with larvae of the first instar, larval mortality being appreciated after 10 or 12 days of foliage feeding. These tests were realized in standard laboratory conditions (20-degrees-C, 16h30/7h30 photoperiod and 16-degrees-C, 15h/9h photoperiod) with the foliage of 27 clones selected according to morphological characteristics. These experiments enabled us to select 4 clones showing well differentiated capacities of edibility, to feed more aged larvae, from the 4th instar to cocoon spinning. Several biological characteristics as development rate, size, fecundity and diapause rate were then observed in addition to mortality on diprions fed with the foliage of these clones. This later test was carried out in natural conditions of temperature and photoperiod. The whole of these experiments shows that some clones are favourable or unfavourable to the sawfly survival and development. Unfavourable clones are mainly found in clone population of Taborz origin. In addition to high mortality, consumption of the needles of these pines induces decrease in foliage eating and deterioration of the physiological state of the surviving insects: decrease in size and in fecundity, changes in development and diapause rate. These effects are compared, by bioassays on aged larvae, to consumption incidence of the young needles.

TI  - Biofuel production from Jatropha curcas
SP  - 613-615
AB  - Jatropha curcas Linn, a tree bearing non-edible oil seeds, grows well in tropical countries throughout semi arid Asia and Africa. It is very hardy, can tolerate high temperature and can grow in 5% to 75% soil moisture. It is quick growing and non palatable to the browsing animals. The plant has multiple economic value each of its part being commercially viable. The most important is its seed oil which is semidrying and is a diesel substitute having characteristics close to those of diesel. It can also be used as lubricant, illuminant and in several other industires like soap, candle etc. Latex has many pharmaceutical applications. Looking at the importance of the plant, various experimentations have been carried out to optimise its growth, productivity with respect to moisture requirement, planting time, starting material, pretreatment, temperature reactivity, light influence and other growth parameters. Comparison has also been done with different genotypes from different parts of the world. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of oil has been made from the different germ plasm. And the adaptability of different germ plasm from different parts of the world in Indian conditions has also been studied. It was observed that seed soil content qualitatively and quantitatively was variable with respect to different germ plasm.

VL  - 56
IS  - 1
SP  - 51-58
AB  - Plasma ion values and mortality rates were compared for 450 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) of three sizes following direct transfer from fresh water to Black Sea water of about 18 ppt. In fish of 14.29+/-0.30 g, plasma Na+, Cl- and K+ levels significantly (p<0.05) rose above initial values five days after the transfer and peaked at 178.6+/-5.66, 153.9+/-0.14 and 1.14+/-0.04 mM/l, respectively. In 20.45+/-0.48 g fish, these values also rose significantly, reaching 172.4+/-4.24, 151.8+/-6.65 and 0.98+/-0.04 mM/l by day 5. In fish of 29.91+/-0.99 g, however, plasma Na+ and Cl- concentrations peaked 19 days after transfer, reaching only 165.5+/-6.43 and 142.9+/-8.34 mM/l, while plasma K+ reached its highest concentration of 1.02+/-0.06 mM/l on day 12, All three concentrations dropped to near initial values on day 26. In all groups, the plasma Ca2+ level rose significantly (p<0.05) above the initial value five days after transfer and then declined while the plasma P5+ concentration dropped on day 5, reaching a minimum on day 12 and recovering the initial level on day 26. The lowest mortality (8.0+/-1.89%) was recorded in the 30 g group, followed by 19.3+/-0.94% and 24.7+/-0.94% in the 20 g and 14 g groups. The failure of the smallest fish to adapt after direct transfer to sea water was likely due to excessively high plasma Na+ and Cl- concentrations and tissue dehydration, indicating that fish of 30 g best adapt to a seawater environment of 18 ppt.

TI  - Seawater adaptation and growth of post-smolt Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) of wild and farmed strains
VL  - 220
IS  - 1
SP  - 367-384
AB  - Atlantic salmon smolts (Salmo salar L.) of wild (Namsen) and farmed (AquaGen) strains were transferred to fall-strength seawater (33 parts per thousand) for 0 (initial control group), 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 14, 30, 42 and 60 days at three different temperatures (4.3, 9.4 and 14.3 degreesC). Freshwater temperature in each tank was adjusted to test conditions 10 days prior to transfer. Physiological adaptation was monitored as changes in plasma growth hormone levels, gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity, plasma chloride levels and survival in seawater. Overall, smolts from the wild strain were better able to tolerate transfer to seawater than smolts from the hatchery strain. A delay in the osmotic disturbance and a prolonged period of osmotic stress were observed at the low temperature. Circulating GH levels increased transiently in all groups during the first 12-48 h in seawater and long-term GH levels were positively correlated with seawater temperature. Growth rates were influenced by temperature and strain, with the farmed smolts showing a higher growth than the wild smolts. Food Conversion Efficiency (FCE) was higher in smolts from the farmed strain, whereas no differences in daily food consumption were observed. Optimum temperature for FCE was calculated to be 10.5 degreesC, whereas the optimal temperature for growth in seawater was calculated to be 13.0 degreesC. We suggest that the observed differences in seawater tolerance, growth and food conversion probably are genetic and may reflect the fact that the hatchery fish have been bred for rapid growth for several generations.

TI  - Mitigation of Pollution-induced Deterioration of Digital Prints through Low-Temperature Storage
SP  - 44-47
AB  - An IPI survey found that approximately 87% of museums, libraries and archives already have digital prints in their collections and that they are concerned about increasing influxes of these materials. The survey also showed that objectionable deterioration has already occurred to some of their prints including fading, yellowing, color bleed, surface cracking and delamination. In total, 71% of institutions have already experienced deterioration in their digital print collections. Previous experimental research, both by IPI and others, has been able to establish a clear connection between ozone and nitrogen dioxide exposure and each of those forms of decay. Development of effective methods to mitigate such damage will, therefore, be critical to the survival of these objects for future generations. This study was aimed specifically at determining the efficacy of one particular approach, mitigating pollutant damage to digital prints through lowered-temperature storage. Since the deterioration due to pollutants occurs through chemical reactions, it may be possible to slow decay through cool or cold storage. The Arrhenius method was used to predict the times to significant fade or yellowing of prints exposed to 1 ppm ozone or 5 ppm nitrogen dioxide. Test targets were incubated at 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 35 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 45 degrees C at 50% RH for multiple intervals up to 56 days. Cyan, magenta, yellow, and black color patches were monitored using ANSI Status A density for density loss. Unprinted, white areas were monitored using ANSI Status A blue density for paper yellowing. It was found that lower temperature does in fact reduce the rates of decay but not equally for both pollutants. Low temperature was more effective at reducing yellowing caused by nitrogen dioxide than it was at reducing the fade caused by ozone; however, cool or cold storage can clearly mitigate damage and extend the usable life of digital prints in collections.

TI  - Modeling the 2013 Zika Outbreak in French Polynesia: Intervention Strategies
VL  - 1
IS  - 3
AB  - The ongoing Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas has been a serious public health emergency since 2015. Since Zika is a vector-borne disease, the size of the vector population in the affected area plays a key role in controlling the scale of the outbreak. The primary vectors for Zika, the Aedes Agypti and Aedes Albopictus species of mosquitoes, are highly sensitive to climatic conditions for survival and reproduction. Additionally, increased international travel over the years has caused the disease outbreak to turn into a pandemic affecting five continents. The mosquito population and the human travel patterns are the two main driving forces affecting the persistence and resurgence of Zika and other vector-borne diseases. This paper presents an enhanced dynamic model that simulates the 2013-2014 French Polynesia Zika outbreak incorporating the temperature dependent mosquito ecology and the local transit network (flights and ferries). The study highlights the importance of human travel patterns and mosquito population dynamics in a disease outbreak. The results predict that more than 85% of the population was infected by the end of the outbreak and it lasted for more than five months across the islands. The basic reproduction number (R-0) for the outbreak is also calculated using the next-generation-matrix for validation purposes. Additionally, this study is focused on measuring the impact of intervention strategies like reducing the mosquito population, preventing mosquito bites and imposing travel bans. French Polynesia was chosen as the region of interest for the study because of available demographic, climate and transit data. Additionally, results from similar studies for the region are available for validation and comparison. However, the proposed system can be used to study the transmission dynamics of any vector-borne disease in any geographic region by altering the climatic and demographic data, and the transit network.

AB  - Using differential scanning calorimetry, we demonstrated the presence of biological glasses and measured the transition temperatures in dry encysted embryos (cysts) of the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana. Cysts from the following three geographic locations were studied: San Francisco Bay (SFB); the Great Salt Lake, Utah (GSL); and the Mekong Delta, Vietnam (VN; these cysts were produced from previous sequential inoculations of SFB cysts into growth ponds). Values for the glass transition temperature, T g, were highest in VN cysts. This study indicates that the composition and properties of these biological glasses can be altered by natural selection and thermal adaptation. To our knowledge, T g values for all three kinds of cysts were significantly higher than those for any other desiccation-tolerant animal system. To gain insight into the significance of T g, we examined the thermal stability of these dry cysts at 80 degrees C. GSL cysts were the least tolerant, by far, with VN cysts being extremely tolerant and SFB cysts not far behind. Those results correlated with the thermal transition values. Also measured were alcohol-soluble carbohydrates, similar to 90% of which is the disaccharide trehalose, a known component of biological glasses. Amounts in the GSL cysts were significantly less than those in the other two kinds of cysts. Several stress proteins were measured in the three groups of cysts, with all of them being in lesser amounts in GSL cysts compared with the SFB and VN cysts. We interpret the data in terms of mechanisms involved with desiccation tolerance and thermal conditions at the sites of cyst collection.

VL  - 9
IS  - 1
AB  - This study examines the viability analysis of fixed-tilt and two axis tracking stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) power systems for electrical power generation in bioclimatic classification zones of the northeastern (NE) states of India where many remote villages are still un-electrified. Grid extension is not possible in many zones of the NE states of India because of the mountainous terrain. Therefore, as an alternative for un-electrified remote villages, the usage of stand-alone PV power systems may mitigate the power shortage problem. Based on the simulation model, the techno-economic analysis is carried out by using 22 years' of satellite-based monthly average solar radiation and temperature data. The typical load profile is also assumed for the purpose of analysis, which replicates the electrical appliances used by the end-users. The optimal fixed-tilt and optimal tracking PV system configuration along with optimal cost of energy (COE) is also obtained. The COE is found to be 0.383-0.497 $/kWh for the fixed-tilt PV system, and the same for the tracking PV system is obtained in the range of 0.523-0.732 $/kWh. From the fixed-tilt and tracking PV system, the monthly average electrical power, monthly average excess electrical power, monthly average unmet electrical load, monthly average inverter power, battery state of charge, and battery input power over the year are detailed, analyzed, and compared. Moreover, the capacity factor obtained in the case of a fixed-tilt PV system lies within the range of 14.2%-17.7% and the same is 17.6%-22.7% for the tracking PV system. Also, the findings of this study reveal detailed information regarding techno-economic and performance analysis of fixedtilt and tracking PV power systems, which may help policy makers or investors to develop PV technology for the NE states of India.
